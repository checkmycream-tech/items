            <li>great epilator.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>This was a great price too.</li>

            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>This is a good epilator, and a great price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the product, works perfectly, and almost painless.</li>
            <li>It is a very good option I liked it, I recomend to buy this kind of products.</li>
            <li>To be totally fair to newbies, no, I didn&#x27;t get here overnight.</li>
            <li>and this one seemed to have good reviews and was cheaper.</li>
            <li>If you get it and don&#x27;t yet know what pain is, good luck.  </li>
            <li>I probably got about a good 8 months out of this epilator which is unacceptable.  </li>
            <li>Loved the results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t how it has ever gotten a good review,</li>
            <li>But the result was really good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>The price is awesome and the product is fabulous .</li>
            <li>This product is really good at removing body hair.</li>
            <li>The product was good</li>
            <li>It is super !!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It removes the hairs and leaves the skin feeling very smooth!</li>
            <li>I love my Epilady!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s an awesome product that I may get my whole family!  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, there is no soreness afterwards-I even put on deodorant!  </li>
            <li>BUT....after one use I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the plunge!</li>
            <li>Still love!  </li>
            <li>I should say its perfect for college going girls like me as its quick and removes most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome just for your day today life.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect, certainly.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice and works well.  </li>
            <li>It sounds almost like some kind of power tool, like a drill or something.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure just as good.  </li>
            <li>But it is effective nonetheless.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that really works.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I really liked it...</li>
            <li>This machine dont have all pieces we need for have a perfect finish, is not working really well</li>
            <li>However, I use this handy thing for everything else.  </li>
            <li>Does the job and color is nice.  </li>
            <li>It works great, it does its job quickly and effectively, it has multi-functions.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.. eventually becomes fairly painless.</li>
            <li>AND FOR THE LOVE OF THE WORLD DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DECIDE THAT A SALT SCRUB WOULD BE A FANTASTIC IDEA TO RELAX YOU AFTER DOING THIS!!  </li>
            <li>a nice warm shower after epilating, and lather on a lot of very rich, creamy</li>
            <li>I think this Braun model is quieter and more effective</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan to use this product in my bikini area or under the arms because those areas are more apt to have ingrown hair</li>
            <li>Make sure to have a drink or snack handy, you&#x27;ll be in there for a while.&lt;br /&gt;-Throw</li>
            <li>far the results are great!</li>
            <li>and it hurts even though I have very fine leg hairs...</li>
            <li>That help you see better even with no day light or good glasses.</li>
            <li>It takes all the hair and your legs will be very smooth.</li>
            <li>Handy and easy to carry.love it</li>
            <li>will do a better job.</li>
            <li>Be sure to go over the area in a variety of directions to get those stubborn hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets better with time and repeated use.</li>
            <li>It really does hurt, and it&#x27;s never going to feel good, but you kind of get used to it.  </li>
            <li>how many times I went over my leg, it didn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it</li>
            <li>I gotten this yesterday and tried it out and love it.</li>
            <li>All I know is that I absolutely love it and wouldn&#x27;t trade it in for anything.</li>
            <li>I was still able to feel and see a lot of hairs, but the Braun epilator couldn&#x27;t get them until they grew longer.</li>
            <li>I wished that it had more tweezers.</li>
            <li>Lots better than shaving</li>
            <li>For this HUMOROUS product review, please read on.  </li>
            <li>TOP</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made origami more durable than this thing.  </li>
            <li>The Braun removes hair easily, smoothly, effortlessly--without pain!  </li>
            <li>On underarms it hurt A LOT; more like being stung by a wasp.</li>
            <li>and I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this product</li>

            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>about ingrowns?&lt;br /&gt;Ingrowns can be battled by many things on the market now.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit getting used to, but once you do, you will love it.</li>
            <li>I love this epilator.  </li>
            <li>My friend recommended it to me and I am so glad I listened to her.</li>
            <li>Be sure to set aside a couple of hours this weekend to get started with this guy.</li>
            <li>Like with waxing/sugaring/laser, your hairs become thinner and more sparse after each session.&lt;br /&gt;-Takes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reason for rating:&lt;br /&gt;-Although I enjoyed this purchase, the results weren&#x27;t as smooth as I&#x27;d liked</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reason for rating:&lt;br /&gt;-Although I enjoyed this purchase, the results weren&#x27;t as smooth as I&#x27;d liked</li>
            <li>its a lot more work compared to arms.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>more razor stubble</li>
            <li>cause it&#x27;ll hurt more.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for thinning out patches of hair</li>
            <li>I really love using this.</li>
            <li>will not go into pain involved as many others have done.  </li>
            <li>Either you are able to tolerate it or not.</li>
            <li>I love using Braun because it is a brand I trust.</li>
            <li>All i&#x27;ve done is waxing and shaving, but mostly shaving</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still planning on trying it out for a couple more runs.  </li>
            <li>My daughter says it is okay</li>
            <li>I absolutely love not having to shave my armpits anymore.</li>
            <li>They are so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>and it got rid of most hair</li>
            <li>so I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I used another Braun and that was much better.</li>
            <li>This particular model seems to be holding up well and does a great job of grabbing all but the finest hairs.</li>
            <li>Then, finally much reasearch brought Braun 3170 pretty much impressed.</li>
            <li>But the cord reached just fine and it is easy to use!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping: Received in great condition and on time (using Amazon Prime&#x27;s free 2-day shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package: Very lightweight.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>This epilator in particular is good because it does not have as many tweezers</li>
            <li>So far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I got advice from other reviews on the best way to use it.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased to say that I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Personally I remove the top attachment before use and it just becomes so much more effective!</li>
            <li>For travelling its easy to carry.</li>
            <li>Try to use it according to the directions it will be easy to remove the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Very easy to get used</li>
            <li>Easy to use and no pain at all.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to put in your bag for travelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tidy, easy to use and clean, and the results are not miraculous but definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instructions: The informational packet comes with a few handy tips, but I think they could have provided more instructions for users who aren&#x27;t as experienced with hair</li>
            <li>and I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>This will lead to sparse, fine hairs that are easier to remove, so you can just use the epilator for touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;-Take</li>
            <li>But that also could be because i have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I use it on course hairs but works well in areas with fine hair too.</li>
            <li>A must for any one with quick growth!</li>
            <li>but I do it based on wanting a smooth feeling versus hairless</li>
            <li>As the areas are epilated, the pain disappears, telling you the area is as smooth as it can be made by the epilator.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update a year later: I&#x27;m still happy with this product and wouldn&#x27;t change anything in my review from a year ago.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It removes hair from the root and leaves ur skin smooth for days.</li>
            <li>It is suggested that (from what I learned from a couple of FABULOUS tattoo artists) to pull the skin taught.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth now</li>
            <li>in a comfortable, air-conditioned, well-lit room.</li>
            <li>The massage rollers do help keep it a pain free experience.  </li>
            <li>I used it every 2-3 days for 6 months and NEVER had smooth legs.</li>
            <li>Its been 4 days now, and they are just as smooth as day 1.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my 3rd day, my legs feel great, each day when i feel some hair is coming out i just go over it for couple mins</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>The epilated area doesn&#x27;t feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I would have like a bigger shaving surface but happy with the proformance.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see any problem here, it works well, pretty handy and quick, easy to clean and portable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this one in particular because it has a light in front for better visibility and results.</li>
            <li>Vendor shipped right away and arrived in good condition and it has been working fine so far.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I bought the Braun epilator for about $50 and the Emjoi for about $100, but the $50 difference was DEFINITELY worth it!</li>
            <li>Excited with the progress I made, I decided to use this on my bikini area as well.</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>But once you get used to it, it&#x27;s super easy and 5-10 mins a week is adequate to keep everything perpetually smooth.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to work as well as the original, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>For the price you&#x27;re paying, proceed at your own risk and most likely dissapointment.</li>
            <li>Unlike a razor, you don&#x27;t have to keep stopping to clean the blades.</li>
            <li>Best to trim your hair down some before the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>I  loved my old Braun, so I replaced it with this new one just to be sure I would have a proven appliance.  </li>
            <li>I have to thank all who favorably reviewed this product as you are right!</li>
            <li>It does work best if you shave your legs first, then use it everyday after that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions.ly only the first time that has to hurt.</li>
            <li>It does hurt much more than shaving, but is cheaper than scheduling a whole waxing appointment.</li>
            <li>So, with so many conflicting reviews, lets see if I can shoot straight for you.</li>
            <li>I have saved so much money and time-no more need for waxing.</li>
            <li>Finally product is good.</li>
            <li>underarms- full legs- bikini.</li>
            <li>I used this kind of product few months ago when i traveled outside the usa, it&#x27;s great thing to use!!!</li>
            <li>This particular epilator is a cheap, convenient, non-embarassing way for both men and women to remove large amounts of hair in the privacy of their own home.</li>
            <li>It is powerful, easy to use, virtually pain free (although I have a pretty high pain threshold), and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>newbie may also experience some skin tenderness/bruising afterwards but it&#x27;ll quickly fade in 24 to 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When doing so, begin by quickly moving apparatus at a 90 degree angle on skin.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that most of you know that the legs and forearms are going to be about the same.  </li>
            <li>And finally, I would recommend shaving in the end for a nice smooth touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Little pain (with adequate prep</li>
            <li>It really is worth spending an extra buck for a good product.</li>
            <li>super painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On the whole, this is a good purchase, particularly if you just want to try an epilator for the first time.</li>
            <li>I used the thorough review by S. White as a how-to guide and have to say I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have pretty smooth legs and arm pits after two treatments, but the bikini area is going to take longer, since I can&#x27;t hold the epilator in place</li>
            <li>, at first it stings like you wouldnt believe, but I honestly got used to it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>but overall i am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It hurts the first couple times but after that not at all and I am so smooth.</li>
            <li>When I turned it on the first time the sound alone scared me.</li>
            <li>My lil sister found in waltmart a cheap one (between 10-20 bucks, don&#x27;t remember exactly) from china and the machine</li>
            <li>Works great and is less painfull.</li>
            <li>If the hair is too long, it&#x27;ll be more prone to breakage versus removal, and it&#x27;s also more painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes all the hair away really easily and without much pain.</li>
            <li>-The process was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Using a toothbrush and soap and water works pretty well to actually clean the product.</li>
            <li>Using a toothbrush and soap and water works pretty well to actually clean the product.</li>
            <li>One is pulling out fewer hairs and they truly, honestly, I swear, cross my heart . . .</li>
            <li>Just what I&#x27;ve done so far with the device has more than paid for it in savings from waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was always the hardest, most torturous experience with the old Epilady.</li>
            <li>so it was worth getting a cord type epilator as opposed to a cordless.  </li>
            <li>I feel the difference between the old one I had been using the this one, it is much better and removes hair faster.</li>
            <li>but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>its tweezing multiple hairs at a time, so that doesnt feel nice.</li>
            <li>but we all know pain comes with beauty;) It was not painful for me because I was used to pulling out my arm and leg hairs with tweezers.</li>
            <li>I found that it really isn&#x27;t worth it for my legs.  </li>
            <li>But  The pain is def worth it.</li>
            <li>Much better than the old shave every day.</li>
            <li>I use more than 2 years, and their work is clearly makes!&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I am so happy , finally an epilator that works, just like my old ones.</li>
            <li>Not sure how that is more attractive and very sensitive arm pits for 2 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I have definitely experienced level 10 pain, I would rate this level 1 or less the first time.  </li>
            <li>WHILE THEY STAND BACK AND LAUGH AT YOU!!!  </li>
            <li>right when I got it</li>
            <li>I bought this awhile ago, Its very nice small cute but its really loud.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pointers for the first time user: shave first and allow a noticeable stubble regrowth (2 to 3 days worth).</li>
            <li>For the first time when used pain was much severe after that it is not bad.</li>
            <li>Very nice and small epilator.</li>
            <li>I first used this on my lower legs and quickly noticed how much of a shock</li>
            <li>i bought since 2011 and still works and my older sister got one +5 years ago and still works!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull out every single hair at the first pass, it takes around 4 times of passing it on an area but it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li>so I had to buy an adaptor, which isn&#x27;t very much, but you need to be aware of that.</li>
            <li>Yes, I did keep my teeth gritted for certain parts, but honestly, for the money, and how long this thing lasts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, first time I used it, I felt little pinches on my legs and arms, but honestly it was not  nearly as painful as getting waxed..</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it did hurt almost like the sting from a waxing, but could I expect anything else from pulling hair out at it&#x27;s roots?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been ripping out hair versus shaving since they first invented the Epilady and am now on my 4th hair removal appliance.</li>
            <li>Some roots, the first time around, are well anchored.</li>
            <li>Left me with so many ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I have used, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>First, this product is NOT CORDLESS.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So don&#x27;t expect your skin to be perfectly smooth, shiny and soft as you get from waxing.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This product works pretty well</li>
            <li>I ordered this product having never used an epilator before, but it definitely seemed like it would be worthwhile to try.</li>
            <li>The second time was much better.</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love this thing!</li>
            <li>of the reasons why I like it is because it plucks fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s a first for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first it hurt</li>
            <li>Shower and exfoliate before removing hair, but make sure that your skin has had enough time to dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, you should always put baby powder on BEFORE using the Epilator.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I cried like a baby and swore to return it to Amazon.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>Thanks Braun!  </li>
            <li>This thing works really well!</li>
            <li>After years of waxing various parts, I decided that there had to be a better way.  </li>
            <li>This is my first ever epilator</li>
            <li>It operates pretty well without leaving any hair on your body.</li>
            <li>i got the Gigi anti bump rx treatment, because i knew from frds and reviews that epilating will get you ingrown hair, especially after you have shaved mostly of the time.</li>
            <li>It hurt all the time, and it did not get all the hairs out consistently.  </li>
            <li>The massager part is very helpfull with the pain!</li>
            <li>I got this like 3 years ago, it still works like the first day.</li>
            <li>I bought my first epilator 20 years ago in Europe</li>
            <li>removes all hair on the first try def recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know better next time.</li>
            <li>I was already anticipating the pain it can cause since it was my first time to epilate my underarms.</li>
            <li>so if the first pass in a sensitive area has you seeing stars -- the subsequent passes will honestly get easier.</li>
            <li>Even once I got through the first several uses, it got pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>that seems to leave more behind, so it seems to help to do a crisscross/herringbone kind of pattern too.   </li>
            <li>(oh well now that&#x27;s a whole different story, it most def hurts on some places)</li>
            <li>I love waxing, but since moving to Vermont I noted that waxing services (especially full leg) are SO EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li>that was a positive since I use it for hours at a time.&lt;br /&gt;-Removes</li>
            <li>I remove the little rollers because they don&#x27;t help and it&#x27;s one more thing to clean, and I also don&#x27;t go strictly against the growth direction of the hairs...</li>
            <li>It is a legal torturing device that the Government has yet to become aware of or use.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty much as advertized.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much like</li>
            <li>The first time I got it delivered, I decided to go straight to my underarms and try doing them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was worth at all, so I returned that one as well, finally I decided to look for my old model and was able to find it here</li>
            <li>it hurts at first, but that fades with continued use, and the product really does remove the hair from the root.  </li>
            <li>-The most sensitive zones are right above the ankles and shins.   </li>
            <li>Have had this Braun Epilator for a little over a month now, and love it!  </li>
            <li>However, even the 2nd time will be light years easier than the first.</li>
            <li>so its easier to shave in certain areas.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous about this method, but was convinced to try it by all the positive comments.</li>
            <li>i bought this last year and its working fine.</li>
            <li>I have a very high pain tolerance and I went through with it, but this is a modern day lady torturing device.</li>
            <li>And, no, it will never be totally discomfort free</li>
            <li>my legs are literally as smooth as glass for up to several days afterwards.</li>
            <li>The easiest way to do one&#x27;s knees is to bend the leg -- the entire knee area becomes smooth.</li>
            <li>very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are very prone to those, don&#x27;t epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hope the straight talk is helpful.</li>
            <li>so I do not grow much hair that needs tending to, but do have a patch here and there on my legs.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li>THE HIGH HEEL!  </li>
            <li>Fill the whole tub up with ice..  </li>
            <li>JUST YOU BUT YOUR WHOLE FAMILY</li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>Use it while your just sitting watching tv or reading online or whatever, but I absolutely reccomend this to anyone who is considering buying an epilator.</li>
            <li>-The massage rollers really help with the pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no worse than waxing.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re planning on using this for trips, it&#x27;s VERY noisy and doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying pouch.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I really like this epilator.</li>
            <li>The hair will grow in sparser and thinner and the whole process will get faster.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull hairs that are too short (hence never having smooth legs)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Do some really use it for their bikini area?  </li>
            <li>This Braun epilator works fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using it as much on my legs.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have issues with ingrown hairs after waxing (and you have a reasonable pain tolerance)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price was very competitive.</li>
            <li>: cuts the hairs off, making them grow out thicker and very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a female (with PCOS too) and love being *completely</li>
            <li>pain is just too excrutiating especially for my most sensitive parts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was smoothness, sure, but it had to be repeated weekly to stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse yet, the hair that came back in was frequently ingrown.</li>
            <li>Very smart purchase, you wont waste your money is a good brand (I think German)</li>
            <li>The minor ones I had were easily removed with a tweezer.  </li>
            <li>But I am a man and was using this for my arms (which barely have any hair) and some parts of my face and YIKES!!!!!!</li>
            <li>First time It did the job fine as expected but after 20 minutes(with breaks)</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, it got easy, and I got bold.</li>
            <li>) Be sure to exfoliate, and use a moisturizer or after-shave spray made with tea tree oil or other healing ingredients to prevent swelling and infection, as well as ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I was able to use this on my under arms and couldn&#x27;t with the other brand.  </li>
            <li>but she doesn&#x27;t know if any other product out there can work better or not.</li>
            <li>I noticed that you get the best results by using a circular motion and usually must pass over an area a few times</li>
            <li>I think the design could improve because I have to clean off the hair constantly.</li>
            <li>I wish there were a pocket or vacuum-like component that could hold the hair so that I don&#x27;t have to clean it off with the brush every second.</li>
            <li>More sensitive areas are going to be unbearable at first, so don&#x27;t expect thorough epilating the first few times.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this product...and the price is right!</li>
            <li>This is not worth it even if it was given to me for free !</li>
            <li>Overall; not bad.</li>
            <li>I love the massage rollers, and the little flashlight that&#x27;s very helpful to see if I missed a spot.</li>
            <li>However, the more you use it, the less it hurts.  </li>
            <li>I have the older model, and I decided to write a review because it has been 4 years</li>
            <li>I would definitely feel safe recommending this to others for multiple areas.  </li>
            <li>particular epilator must be used with the cord.</li>
            <li>particular epilator must be used with the cord.</li>
            <li>Only con for me is that I wished it were bigger or had more tweezers.</li>
            <li>My old one left my legs smooth.  </li>
            <li>And no, you will NOT get &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to such brutality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for arms or such, i think this thing is ok to go</li>
            <li>The main job is done.</li>
            <li>In researching what was currently available, I&#x27;m upgrading from the Braun Silk Epil Eversoft Model #5316 (yellow and gray case) to the Braun Se 3170 Silk Epil 3 (pink &amp; white case) specifically because it is Braun&#x27;s latest model with a cord.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this epilator and suggest that even scaredy-cats like me should try it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never given birth, had a tattoo, or kicked someone&#x27;s @$$, do NOT attempt a high setting.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Still when you are staring at a tender spot, trying to work up the nerve to make contact with this thing, a lower speed becomes highly appealing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>an old, large towel underneath you while using this to catch stray</li>
            <li>-I used the slower setting because the faster setting hurt a little more.</li>
            <li>love this little gadget though--</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I have really deep hair follicles and really fast growing hair, so I didn&#x27;t get very good results.</li>
            <li>I have an older version so needed a new one.</li>
            <li>It can be pretty intense especially around the joint areas (knees and ankles) and inside the thighs.  </li>
            <li>But I think for the price its worth it if you wax regularly.</li>
            <li>This is normal and they will heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: We continued using it and then the machine started sounding normal again.</li>
            <li>It does hurt but personally I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It gets most of the hairs some times there&#x27;s a few stray one&#x27;s</li>
            <li>but after the 3rd use I don&#x27;t even feel it anymore, even in those super sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Plan to use the device every other day or so for a couple of weeks to get a thoroughly smooth finish.</li>
            <li>after reading other reviews, I thought it should hurt me, fortunately, it did not.</li>
            <li>I experiment with countless hair removal methods just for the fun of it, so I&#x27;m aware of different hair removal needs.</li>
            <li>I have used it for my legs but just can&#x27;t seem to get them quite as smooth as my other areas.</li>
            <li>I needed to buy a new Epilator  as my u.k .one would not work here and shaving was not an option for me.</li>
            <li>I do feel though that this model has fewer tweezers than the old model I have and the tweezers are spaced a lot apart than the older model.</li>
            <li>like I said, it&#x27;s saved me so much money, and my leg hair grows back so much finer and slower than it ever has.</li>
            <li>I love the little thing!  </li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very surprised it was electrical one not with batteries.</li>
            <li>The hair is then both upright and long enough to successfully, easily remove.</li>
            <li>When I first touched my skin with the epilator it felt like razor blades slicing me, so I jerked it back to check.</li>
            <li>And I also did the first time on the low speed.  </li>
            <li>The lack of accessories/packing material actually made me wonder at first if I received a used epilator.</li>
            <li>a lot of red bumps in the first 24 hours, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It&#x27;s really only the first time that has to hurt.</li>
            <li>I guess you can say I&#x27;m an epilator virgin because it was my first time buying and using such a product!</li>
            <li>-Cleaning was easy with the little brush included in the box.   </li>
            <li>Lightly graze over the area and don&#x27;t press down too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightly graze over the area and don&#x27;t press down too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only used this product once so far but the hair on my legs felt as if I had used a razor, very prickly!  </li>
            <li>But after quickly skimming through the manual, I realised that all you really needed was the little epilator and its cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer it to spending huge amounts of money on waxes, or dealing with the mess of waxing at home.</li>
            <li>in the first time i tried it, it left a giant red/purple bruise looking thing on my skin in the pelvic area and it was irritated so much that it felt itchy for almost 3 days.</li>
            <li>Have to careful with super sensitive area.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi on the other hand got pretty much all of them.</li>
            <li>Also, the Braun can only get hairs if they&#x27;re longer than a certain length.</li>
            <li>underarms after epilating with a pair of tweezers because there always seem to be a few hairs that are pulled out only half-way, which is a perfect recipe for a lot of little infected spots that are a minor injury and major irritation.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a touch-up to smaller areas of skin, but is a little too rough for larger swaths of skin.</li>
            <li>I have had a Brazilian wax once, and three natural childbirths.</li>
            <li>SOBERLY I did everything..  </li>
            <li>I am alive.  </li>
            <li>Also, i dont know if my under arms are sensitive or what</li>
            <li>cord is pretty long</li>
            <li>So far I would have to say I don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>I can only guess that the spikes are meant to &amp;#34;distract&amp;#34; the user from the very bearable discomfort of the hair being pulled out.  </li>
            <li>But even with that, I still will go ahead and definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy it.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I find it very convenient that it is enough to do this procedure just once in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>in each place that remove the hair by using complete.</li>
            <li>Overall highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I think it removes most of thick hair from root.</li>
            <li>would never recommend this product and am sorry that I was sucked in by the good reviews.</li>
            <li>And, you have the option of using the lower speed if you want a \\&quot;less intense sensation\\&quot; (good for delicate areas), though the low speed will take longer, of course.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the complete SMOOTH shaving-like feel, (for this 1st time) because of the previous shaving not all hair has grown properly.</li>
            <li>You should expect a lot of red bumps the first night you use this, especially if you have coarser hair.</li>
            <li>Move into a more sensitive area gradually on the slower speed (pulling fewer hairs per second) until you feel comfortable orrather numb enough to make a sweeping pass on high speed.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive so not even Nair does anything but irritate my skin, plus my hair is dark and coarse (yes lucky me).</li>
            <li>The upper arm, arm pit, and inner thigh are a little more tricky.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time- legs felt a little pain, same as waxing... underarms and bikini a little more pain-</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind a little pain and a bit of a time investment, this device can definitely give you smooth skin.</li>
            <li>A previous reviewer said to shave/trim the hairs prior to using for the first time, but that takes too much time.</li>
            <li>I had to replace it 10 years after and was able to find the same model down in south America and 10 years later, brings me to the present time</li>
            <li>/&gt;After realizing that there is a new generation of these products on the market, I researched Braun, Episilk and several others I found online.</li>
            <li>, I needed to replace it again, I got the newer versions of this epilator and had to return it, was a disappointment , then I tried a different brand with 72 tweezers and I though it was going to be great</li>
            <li>although it hurts like no other.</li>
            <li>Instead, I read what the other reviewers suggested and waxed first to loosen the hair roots.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>Anything that pulls out hair just causes major problems for me with any amount of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Powerful machine works well in tight areas</li>
            <li>Not very painful, but the pain is not worth the result.</li>
            <li>I previously had a simple inexpensive epilator from CVS that only lasted about 6 months with light use.  </li>
            <li>I only recently became familiar with epilators less than 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Now I barely notice it.</li>
            <li>The hair then starts to grow back thinner and finer over time making it far easier to remove.</li>
            <li>the only problem with it is that it is so loud.</li>
            <li>I actually do love this product, however my only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t give proper instructions as to the use of this product.  </li>
            <li>It still hurts after several uses, but not nearly as much as it did the first time.  </li>
            <li>The more hair there is, the worse it feels.</li>
            <li>The science behind this is that if you stimulate the area by rubbing, it creates more sensory signals which will compete with the pain signals and reduce your perception of pain.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately the hairs down there are just rooted way too deep to be pulled out easily with minimal pain.</li>
            <li>On high there are \\&quot;48\\&quot; tweezers grabbing at every single one of your hairs that it can grab hold of.  </li>
            <li>It definitely feels a little bit uncomfy, especially if you let your hair get long, but its kind of expected for what it&#x27;s doing (pulling your hair out from the root).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even before it arrived I was wondering if I had done the right thing as they are not cheap.  </li>
            <li>As long as you do quick touch-ups every other day, your hair will never return to the same amount of thickness.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li>As long as you do quick touch-ups every other day, your hair will never return to the same amount of thickness.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li>I got a couple pretty severe cut type spots even though I pulled the skin tight as I used the epilator on the area.</li>
            <li>I knew this would be painful, but gave it a 5 star rating because it does what it is supposed to do and is easy to clean (IMHO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In my case, this whole process needs to be done roughly every 10 days -- from a visible perspective, I could actually go longer</li>
            <li>I have been using Braun  Silk Epil since last 17 years, of course the model is different and old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-You might need to go over the same area several times to get it completely hair-free.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does feel like little pinches the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>But if you can tough it out I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it, because the results were dramatically better with this than with a razor; with a razor, I have to shave every day or two, but with the epilator I can go at least a week, and it looks nicer too.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my arms and it hurt really bad at first because my arm hair was kind of long.  </li>
            <li>It is easier to use after the first thorough epilation, because there are fewer hairs to pluck, but it still needs to be done every few days to a week to keep</li>
            <li>I am a firm believer that \\&quot;pretty hurts\\</li>
            <li>For those of you who have been down the preceding roads, get ready.  </li>
            <li>After you use an epilator you will have tons of red bumps, so i bought the after cream it did seem to decrease it+slow down the hair growth so far I would only recommend doing your legs with this unless you have a high pain threshold.</li>
            <li>I was thinking of buying an epilator for long time but not sure what to pick and many other questions in mind.</li>
            <li>The only other one I owned was an old old one (from the 90s)</li>
            <li>I just wish I had gotten one that was cordless due to the plugs in my home are all up high on the walls instead of being closer to the floor.</li>
            <li>This is also much easier on the skin than waxing and since it isn&#x27;t sticking to the skin itself, there is less irritation.  </li>
            <li>This product breaks off hairs, which may make the hair be gone for a day or two, but then stubble will return,and when you try to remove the stubble, turns out it&#x27;s not long enough for removal.</li>
            <li>If you can tolerate it, you will find that there is less and less regrowth, which cannot be said about many other hair removal methods.</li>
            <li>no problem at all, very good/cheap/helpful little thing.</li>
            <li>and if you are like me and live on the other side of the world,  it came with an american plug</li>

            <li> It is a very good option I liked it, I recomend to buy this kind of products.</li>
            <li> To be totally fair to newbies, no, I didn&#x27;t get here overnight.</li>
            <li> and this one seemed to have good reviews and was cheaper.</li>
            <li> If you get it and don&#x27;t yet know what pain is, good luck.  </li>
            <li> I probably got about a good 8 months out of this epilator which is unacceptable.  </li>
            <li> Loved the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t how it has ever gotten a good review,</li>
            <li> But the result was really good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>

            <li> It is super !!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li> It removes the hairs and leaves the skin feeling very smooth!</li>
            <li> I love my Epilady!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s an awesome product that I may get my whole family!  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, there is no soreness afterwards-I even put on deodorant!  </li>
            <li> BUT....after one use I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the plunge!</li>
            <li> Still love!  </li>
            <li> I should say its perfect for college going girls like me as its quick and removes most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome just for your day today life.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect, certainly.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice and works well.  </li>
            <li> It sounds almost like some kind of power tool, like a drill or something.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure just as good.  </li>
            <li> But it is effective nonetheless.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that really works.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I really liked it...</li>
            <li> This machine dont have all pieces we need for have a perfect finish, is not working really well</li>
            <li> However, I use this handy thing for everything else.  </li>
            <li> Does the job and color is nice.  </li>
            <li> It works great, it does its job quickly and effectively, it has multi-functions.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.. eventually becomes fairly painless.</li>
            <li> AND FOR THE LOVE OF THE WORLD DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DECIDE THAT A SALT SCRUB WOULD BE A FANTASTIC IDEA TO RELAX YOU AFTER DOING THIS!!  </li>
            <li> a nice warm shower after epilating, and lather on a lot of very rich, creamy</li>
            <li> I think this Braun model is quieter and more effective</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan to use this product in my bikini area or under the arms because those areas are more apt to have ingrown hair</li>
            <li> Make sure to have a drink or snack handy, you&#x27;ll be in there for a while.&lt;br /&gt;-Throw</li>
            <li> far the results are great!</li>
            <li> and it hurts even though I have very fine leg hairs...</li>
            <li> That help you see better even with no day light or good glasses.</li>
            <li> It takes all the hair and your legs will be very smooth.</li>
            <li> Handy and easy to carry.love it</li>
            <li> will do a better job.</li>
            <li> Be sure to go over the area in a variety of directions to get those stubborn hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets better with time and repeated use.</li>
            <li> It really does hurt, and it&#x27;s never going to feel good, but you kind of get used to it.  </li>
            <li> how many times I went over my leg, it didn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it</li>
            <li> I gotten this yesterday and tried it out and love it.</li>
            <li> All I know is that I absolutely love it and wouldn&#x27;t trade it in for anything.</li>
            <li> I was still able to feel and see a lot of hairs, but the Braun epilator couldn&#x27;t get them until they grew longer.</li>
            <li> I wished that it had more tweezers.</li>
            <li> Lots better than shaving</li>
            <li> For this HUMOROUS product review, please read on.  </li>
            <li> TOP</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made origami more durable than this thing.  </li>
            <li> The Braun removes hair easily, smoothly, effortlessly--without pain!  </li>
            <li> On underarms it hurt A LOT; more like being stung by a wasp.</li>
            <li> and I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love this product</li>
            <li> about ingrowns?&lt;br /&gt;Ingrowns can be battled by many things on the market now.</li>
            <li> love this product</li>
            <li> about ingrowns?&lt;br /&gt;Ingrowns can be battled by many things on the market now.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit getting used to, but once you do, you will love it.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator.  </li>
            <li> My friend recommended it to me and I am so glad I listened to her.</li>
            <li> Be sure to set aside a couple of hours this weekend to get started with this guy.</li>
            <li> Like with waxing/sugaring/laser, your hairs become thinner and more sparse after each session.&lt;br /&gt;-Takes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reason for rating:&lt;br /&gt;-Although I enjoyed this purchase, the results weren&#x27;t as smooth as I&#x27;d liked</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reason for rating:&lt;br /&gt;-Although I enjoyed this purchase, the results weren&#x27;t as smooth as I&#x27;d liked</li>
            <li> its a lot more work compared to arms.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> more razor stubble</li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;ll hurt more.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for thinning out patches of hair</li>
            <li> I really love using this.</li>
            <li> will not go into pain involved as many others have done.  </li>
            <li> Either you are able to tolerate it or not.</li>
            <li> I love using Braun because it is a brand I trust.</li>
            <li> All i&#x27;ve done is waxing and shaving, but mostly shaving</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still planning on trying it out for a couple more runs.  </li>
            <li> My daughter says it is okay</li>
            <li> I absolutely love not having to shave my armpits anymore.</li>
            <li> They are so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> and it got rid of most hair</li>
            <li> so I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I used another Braun and that was much better.</li>
            <li> This particular model seems to be holding up well and does a great job of grabbing all but the finest hairs.</li>
            <li> Then, finally much reasearch brought Braun 3170 pretty much impressed.</li>
            <li> But the cord reached just fine and it is easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping: Received in great condition and on time (using Amazon Prime&#x27;s free 2-day shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package: Very lightweight.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This epilator in particular is good because it does not have as many tweezers</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I got advice from other reviews on the best way to use it.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased to say that I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Personally I remove the top attachment before use and it just becomes so much more effective!</li>
            <li> For travelling its easy to carry.</li>
            <li> Try to use it according to the directions it will be easy to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Very easy to get used</li>
            <li> Easy to use and no pain at all.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to put in your bag for travelling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tidy, easy to use and clean, and the results are not miraculous but definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instructions: The informational packet comes with a few handy tips, but I think they could have provided more instructions for users who aren&#x27;t as experienced with hair</li>
            <li> and I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> This will lead to sparse, fine hairs that are easier to remove, so you can just use the epilator for touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;-Take</li>
            <li> But that also could be because i have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on course hairs but works well in areas with fine hair too.</li>
            <li> A must for any one with quick growth!</li>
            <li> but I do it based on wanting a smooth feeling versus hairless</li>
            <li> As the areas are epilated, the pain disappears, telling you the area is as smooth as it can be made by the epilator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update a year later: I&#x27;m still happy with this product and wouldn&#x27;t change anything in my review from a year ago.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> It removes hair from the root and leaves ur skin smooth for days.</li>
            <li> It is suggested that (from what I learned from a couple of FABULOUS tattoo artists) to pull the skin taught.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth now</li>
            <li> in a comfortable, air-conditioned, well-lit room.</li>
            <li> The massage rollers do help keep it a pain free experience.  </li>
            <li> I used it every 2-3 days for 6 months and NEVER had smooth legs.</li>
            <li> Its been 4 days now, and they are just as smooth as day 1.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my 3rd day, my legs feel great, each day when i feel some hair is coming out i just go over it for couple mins</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> The epilated area doesn&#x27;t feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I would have like a bigger shaving surface but happy with the proformance.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see any problem here, it works well, pretty handy and quick, easy to clean and portable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this one in particular because it has a light in front for better visibility and results.</li>
            <li> Vendor shipped right away and arrived in good condition and it has been working fine so far.</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun epilator for about $50 and the Emjoi for about $100, but the $50 difference was DEFINITELY worth it!</li>
            <li> Excited with the progress I made, I decided to use this on my bikini area as well.</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> But once you get used to it, it&#x27;s super easy and 5-10 mins a week is adequate to keep everything perpetually smooth.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to work as well as the original, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> For the price you&#x27;re paying, proceed at your own risk and most likely dissapointment.</li>
            <li> Unlike a razor, you don&#x27;t have to keep stopping to clean the blades.</li>
            <li> Best to trim your hair down some before the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> I  loved my old Braun, so I replaced it with this new one just to be sure I would have a proven appliance.  </li>
            <li> I have to thank all who favorably reviewed this product as you are right!</li>
            <li> It does work best if you shave your legs first, then use it everyday after that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions.ly only the first time that has to hurt.</li>
            <li> It does hurt much more than shaving, but is cheaper than scheduling a whole waxing appointment.</li>
            <li> So, with so many conflicting reviews, lets see if I can shoot straight for you.</li>
            <li> I have saved so much money and time-no more need for waxing.</li>
            <li> Finally product is good.</li>
            <li> underarms- full legs- bikini.</li>
            <li> I used this kind of product few months ago when i traveled outside the usa, it&#x27;s great thing to use!!!</li>
            <li> This particular epilator is a cheap, convenient, non-embarassing way for both men and women to remove large amounts of hair in the privacy of their own home.</li>
            <li> It is powerful, easy to use, virtually pain free (although I have a pretty high pain threshold), and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> newbie may also experience some skin tenderness/bruising afterwards but it&#x27;ll quickly fade in 24 to 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When doing so, begin by quickly moving apparatus at a 90 degree angle on skin.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that most of you know that the legs and forearms are going to be about the same.  </li>
            <li> And finally, I would recommend shaving in the end for a nice smooth touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Little pain (with adequate prep</li>
            <li> It really is worth spending an extra buck for a good product.</li>
            <li> super painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> On the whole, this is a good purchase, particularly if you just want to try an epilator for the first time.</li>
            <li> I used the thorough review by S. White as a how-to guide and have to say I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have pretty smooth legs and arm pits after two treatments, but the bikini area is going to take longer, since I can&#x27;t hold the epilator in place</li>
            <li> , at first it stings like you wouldnt believe, but I honestly got used to it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> but overall i am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It hurts the first couple times but after that not at all and I am so smooth.</li>
            <li> When I turned it on the first time the sound alone scared me.</li>
            <li> My lil sister found in waltmart a cheap one (between 10-20 bucks, don&#x27;t remember exactly) from china and the machine</li>
            <li> Works great and is less painfull.</li>
            <li> If the hair is too long, it&#x27;ll be more prone to breakage versus removal, and it&#x27;s also more painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes all the hair away really easily and without much pain.</li>
            <li> -The process was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Using a toothbrush and soap and water works pretty well to actually clean the product.</li>
            <li> Using a toothbrush and soap and water works pretty well to actually clean the product.</li>
            <li> One is pulling out fewer hairs and they truly, honestly, I swear, cross my heart . . .</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;ve done so far with the device has more than paid for it in savings from waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was always the hardest, most torturous experience with the old Epilady.</li>
            <li> so it was worth getting a cord type epilator as opposed to a cordless.  </li>
            <li> I feel the difference between the old one I had been using the this one, it is much better and removes hair faster.</li>
            <li> but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> its tweezing multiple hairs at a time, so that doesnt feel nice.</li>
            <li> but we all know pain comes with beauty;) It was not painful for me because I was used to pulling out my arm and leg hairs with tweezers.</li>
            <li> I found that it really isn&#x27;t worth it for my legs.  </li>
            <li> But  The pain is def worth it.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old shave every day.</li>
            <li> I use more than 2 years, and their work is clearly makes!&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I am so happy , finally an epilator that works, just like my old ones.</li>
            <li> Not sure how that is more attractive and very sensitive arm pits for 2 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I have definitely experienced level 10 pain, I would rate this level 1 or less the first time.  </li>
            <li> WHILE THEY STAND BACK AND LAUGH AT YOU!!!  </li>
            <li> right when I got it</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile ago, Its very nice small cute but its really loud.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pointers for the first time user: shave first and allow a noticeable stubble regrowth (2 to 3 days worth).</li>
            <li> For the first time when used pain was much severe after that it is not bad.</li>
            <li> Very nice and small epilator.</li>
            <li> I first used this on my lower legs and quickly noticed how much of a shock</li>
            <li> i bought since 2011 and still works and my older sister got one +5 years ago and still works!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull out every single hair at the first pass, it takes around 4 times of passing it on an area but it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> so I had to buy an adaptor, which isn&#x27;t very much, but you need to be aware of that.</li>
            <li> Yes, I did keep my teeth gritted for certain parts, but honestly, for the money, and how long this thing lasts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, first time I used it, I felt little pinches on my legs and arms, but honestly it was not  nearly as painful as getting waxed..</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it did hurt almost like the sting from a waxing, but could I expect anything else from pulling hair out at it&#x27;s roots?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ripping out hair versus shaving since they first invented the Epilady and am now on my 4th hair removal appliance.</li>
            <li> Some roots, the first time around, are well anchored.</li>
            <li> Left me with so many ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I have used, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> First, this product is NOT CORDLESS.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So don&#x27;t expect your skin to be perfectly smooth, shiny and soft as you get from waxing.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well</li>
            <li> I ordered this product having never used an epilator before, but it definitely seemed like it would be worthwhile to try.</li>
            <li> The second time was much better.</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love this thing!</li>
            <li> of the reasons why I like it is because it plucks fast!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s a first for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> first it hurt</li>
            <li> Shower and exfoliate before removing hair, but make sure that your skin has had enough time to dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, you should always put baby powder on BEFORE using the Epilator.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I cried like a baby and swore to return it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> Thanks Braun!  </li>
            <li> This thing works really well!</li>
            <li> After years of waxing various parts, I decided that there had to be a better way.  </li>
            <li> This is my first ever epilator</li>
            <li> It operates pretty well without leaving any hair on your body.</li>
            <li> i got the Gigi anti bump rx treatment, because i knew from frds and reviews that epilating will get you ingrown hair, especially after you have shaved mostly of the time.</li>
            <li> It hurt all the time, and it did not get all the hairs out consistently.  </li>
            <li> The massager part is very helpfull with the pain!</li>
            <li> I got this like 3 years ago, it still works like the first day.</li>
            <li> I bought my first epilator 20 years ago in Europe</li>
            <li> removes all hair on the first try def recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know better next time.</li>
            <li> I was already anticipating the pain it can cause since it was my first time to epilate my underarms.</li>
            <li> so if the first pass in a sensitive area has you seeing stars -- the subsequent passes will honestly get easier.</li>
            <li> Even once I got through the first several uses, it got pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> that seems to leave more behind, so it seems to help to do a crisscross/herringbone kind of pattern too.   </li>
            <li> (oh well now that&#x27;s a whole different story, it most def hurts on some places)</li>
            <li> I love waxing, but since moving to Vermont I noted that waxing services (especially full leg) are SO EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> that was a positive since I use it for hours at a time.&lt;br /&gt;-Removes</li>
            <li> I remove the little rollers because they don&#x27;t help and it&#x27;s one more thing to clean, and I also don&#x27;t go strictly against the growth direction of the hairs...</li>
            <li> It is a legal torturing device that the Government has yet to become aware of or use.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty much as advertized.</li>
            <li> I use it pretty much like</li>
            <li> The first time I got it delivered, I decided to go straight to my underarms and try doing them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was worth at all, so I returned that one as well, finally I decided to look for my old model and was able to find it here</li>
            <li> it hurts at first, but that fades with continued use, and the product really does remove the hair from the root.  </li>
            <li> -The most sensitive zones are right above the ankles and shins.   </li>
            <li> Have had this Braun Epilator for a little over a month now, and love it!  </li>
            <li> However, even the 2nd time will be light years easier than the first.</li>
            <li> so its easier to shave in certain areas.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about this method, but was convinced to try it by all the positive comments.</li>
            <li> i bought this last year and its working fine.</li>
            <li> I have a very high pain tolerance and I went through with it, but this is a modern day lady torturing device.</li>
            <li> And, no, it will never be totally discomfort free</li>
            <li> my legs are literally as smooth as glass for up to several days afterwards.</li>
            <li> The easiest way to do one&#x27;s knees is to bend the leg -- the entire knee area becomes smooth.</li>
            <li> very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are very prone to those, don&#x27;t epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hope the straight talk is helpful.</li>
            <li> so I do not grow much hair that needs tending to, but do have a patch here and there on my legs.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li> THE HIGH HEEL!  </li>
            <li> Fill the whole tub up with ice..  </li>
            <li> JUST YOU BUT YOUR WHOLE FAMILY</li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> Use it while your just sitting watching tv or reading online or whatever, but I absolutely reccomend this to anyone who is considering buying an epilator.</li>
            <li> -The massage rollers really help with the pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no worse than waxing.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re planning on using this for trips, it&#x27;s VERY noisy and doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying pouch.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator.</li>
            <li> The hair will grow in sparser and thinner and the whole process will get faster.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull hairs that are too short (hence never having smooth legs)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Do some really use it for their bikini area?  </li>
            <li> This Braun epilator works fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using it as much on my legs.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have issues with ingrown hairs after waxing (and you have a reasonable pain tolerance)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price was very competitive.</li>
            <li> : cuts the hairs off, making them grow out thicker and very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female (with PCOS too) and love being *completely</li>
            <li> pain is just too excrutiating especially for my most sensitive parts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was smoothness, sure, but it had to be repeated weekly to stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse yet, the hair that came back in was frequently ingrown.</li>
            <li> Very smart purchase, you wont waste your money is a good brand (I think German)</li>
            <li> The minor ones I had were easily removed with a tweezer.  </li>
            <li> But I am a man and was using this for my arms (which barely have any hair) and some parts of my face and YIKES!!!!!!</li>
            <li> First time It did the job fine as expected but after 20 minutes(with breaks)</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, it got easy, and I got bold.</li>
            <li> ) Be sure to exfoliate, and use a moisturizer or after-shave spray made with tea tree oil or other healing ingredients to prevent swelling and infection, as well as ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this on my under arms and couldn&#x27;t with the other brand.  </li>
            <li> but she doesn&#x27;t know if any other product out there can work better or not.</li>
            <li> I noticed that you get the best results by using a circular motion and usually must pass over an area a few times</li>
            <li> I think the design could improve because I have to clean off the hair constantly.</li>
            <li> I wish there were a pocket or vacuum-like component that could hold the hair so that I don&#x27;t have to clean it off with the brush every second.</li>
            <li> More sensitive areas are going to be unbearable at first, so don&#x27;t expect thorough epilating the first few times.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product...and the price is right!</li>
            <li> This is not worth it even if it was given to me for free !</li>
            <li> Overall; not bad.</li>
            <li> I love the massage rollers, and the little flashlight that&#x27;s very helpful to see if I missed a spot.</li>
            <li> However, the more you use it, the less it hurts.  </li>
            <li> I have the older model, and I decided to write a review because it has been 4 years</li>
            <li> I would definitely feel safe recommending this to others for multiple areas.  </li>
            <li> particular epilator must be used with the cord.</li>
            <li> particular epilator must be used with the cord.</li>
            <li> Only con for me is that I wished it were bigger or had more tweezers.</li>
            <li> My old one left my legs smooth.  </li>
            <li> And no, you will NOT get &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to such brutality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for arms or such, i think this thing is ok to go</li>
            <li> The main job is done.</li>
            <li> In researching what was currently available, I&#x27;m upgrading from the Braun Silk Epil Eversoft Model #5316 (yellow and gray case) to the Braun Se 3170 Silk Epil 3 (pink &amp; white case) specifically because it is Braun&#x27;s latest model with a cord.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this epilator and suggest that even scaredy-cats like me should try it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never given birth, had a tattoo, or kicked someone&#x27;s @$$, do NOT attempt a high setting.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Still when you are staring at a tender spot, trying to work up the nerve to make contact with this thing, a lower speed becomes highly appealing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> an old, large towel underneath you while using this to catch stray</li>
            <li> -I used the slower setting because the faster setting hurt a little more.</li>
            <li> love this little gadget though--</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have really deep hair follicles and really fast growing hair, so I didn&#x27;t get very good results.</li>
            <li> I have an older version so needed a new one.</li>
            <li> It can be pretty intense especially around the joint areas (knees and ankles) and inside the thighs.  </li>
            <li> But I think for the price its worth it if you wax regularly.</li>
            <li> This is normal and they will heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: We continued using it and then the machine started sounding normal again.</li>
            <li> It does hurt but personally I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It gets most of the hairs some times there&#x27;s a few stray one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> but after the 3rd use I don&#x27;t even feel it anymore, even in those super sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Plan to use the device every other day or so for a couple of weeks to get a thoroughly smooth finish.</li>
            <li> after reading other reviews, I thought it should hurt me, fortunately, it did not.</li>
            <li> I experiment with countless hair removal methods just for the fun of it, so I&#x27;m aware of different hair removal needs.</li>
            <li> I have used it for my legs but just can&#x27;t seem to get them quite as smooth as my other areas.</li>
            <li> I needed to buy a new Epilator  as my u.k .one would not work here and shaving was not an option for me.</li>
            <li> I do feel though that this model has fewer tweezers than the old model I have and the tweezers are spaced a lot apart than the older model.</li>
            <li> like I said, it&#x27;s saved me so much money, and my leg hair grows back so much finer and slower than it ever has.</li>
            <li> I love the little thing!  </li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very surprised it was electrical one not with batteries.</li>
            <li> The hair is then both upright and long enough to successfully, easily remove.</li>
            <li> When I first touched my skin with the epilator it felt like razor blades slicing me, so I jerked it back to check.</li>
            <li> And I also did the first time on the low speed.  </li>
            <li> The lack of accessories/packing material actually made me wonder at first if I received a used epilator.</li>
            <li> a lot of red bumps in the first 24 hours, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s really only the first time that has to hurt.</li>
            <li> I guess you can say I&#x27;m an epilator virgin because it was my first time buying and using such a product!</li>
            <li> -Cleaning was easy with the little brush included in the box.   </li>
            <li> Lightly graze over the area and don&#x27;t press down too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lightly graze over the area and don&#x27;t press down too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far but the hair on my legs felt as if I had used a razor, very prickly!  </li>
            <li> But after quickly skimming through the manual, I realised that all you really needed was the little epilator and its cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer it to spending huge amounts of money on waxes, or dealing with the mess of waxing at home.</li>
            <li> in the first time i tried it, it left a giant red/purple bruise looking thing on my skin in the pelvic area and it was irritated so much that it felt itchy for almost 3 days.</li>
            <li> Have to careful with super sensitive area.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi on the other hand got pretty much all of them.</li>
            <li> Also, the Braun can only get hairs if they&#x27;re longer than a certain length.</li>
            <li> underarms after epilating with a pair of tweezers because there always seem to be a few hairs that are pulled out only half-way, which is a perfect recipe for a lot of little infected spots that are a minor injury and major irritation.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a touch-up to smaller areas of skin, but is a little too rough for larger swaths of skin.</li>
            <li> I have had a Brazilian wax once, and three natural childbirths.</li>
            <li> SOBERLY I did everything..  </li>
            <li> I am alive.  </li>
            <li> Also, i dont know if my under arms are sensitive or what</li>
            <li> cord is pretty long</li>
            <li> So far I would have to say I don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> I can only guess that the spikes are meant to &amp;#34;distract&amp;#34; the user from the very bearable discomfort of the hair being pulled out.  </li>
            <li> But even with that, I still will go ahead and definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy it.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I find it very convenient that it is enough to do this procedure just once in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> in each place that remove the hair by using complete.</li>
            <li> Overall highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I think it removes most of thick hair from root.</li>
            <li> would never recommend this product and am sorry that I was sucked in by the good reviews.</li>
            <li> And, you have the option of using the lower speed if you want a \\&quot;less intense sensation\\&quot; (good for delicate areas), though the low speed will take longer, of course.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the complete SMOOTH shaving-like feel, (for this 1st time) because of the previous shaving not all hair has grown properly.</li>
            <li> You should expect a lot of red bumps the first night you use this, especially if you have coarser hair.</li>
            <li> Move into a more sensitive area gradually on the slower speed (pulling fewer hairs per second) until you feel comfortable orrather numb enough to make a sweeping pass on high speed.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive so not even Nair does anything but irritate my skin, plus my hair is dark and coarse (yes lucky me).</li>
            <li> The upper arm, arm pit, and inner thigh are a little more tricky.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time- legs felt a little pain, same as waxing... underarms and bikini a little more pain-</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a little pain and a bit of a time investment, this device can definitely give you smooth skin.</li>
            <li> A previous reviewer said to shave/trim the hairs prior to using for the first time, but that takes too much time.</li>
            <li> I had to replace it 10 years after and was able to find the same model down in south America and 10 years later, brings me to the present time</li>
            <li> /&gt;After realizing that there is a new generation of these products on the market, I researched Braun, Episilk and several others I found online.</li>
            <li> , I needed to replace it again, I got the newer versions of this epilator and had to return it, was a disappointment , then I tried a different brand with 72 tweezers and I though it was going to be great</li>
            <li> although it hurts like no other.</li>
            <li> Instead, I read what the other reviewers suggested and waxed first to loosen the hair roots.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Anything that pulls out hair just causes major problems for me with any amount of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Powerful machine works well in tight areas</li>
            <li> Not very painful, but the pain is not worth the result.</li>
            <li> I previously had a simple inexpensive epilator from CVS that only lasted about 6 months with light use.  </li>
            <li> I only recently became familiar with epilators less than 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Now I barely notice it.</li>
            <li> The hair then starts to grow back thinner and finer over time making it far easier to remove.</li>
            <li> the only problem with it is that it is so loud.</li>
            <li> I actually do love this product, however my only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t give proper instructions as to the use of this product.  </li>
            <li> It still hurts after several uses, but not nearly as much as it did the first time.  </li>
            <li> The more hair there is, the worse it feels.</li>
            <li> The science behind this is that if you stimulate the area by rubbing, it creates more sensory signals which will compete with the pain signals and reduce your perception of pain.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the hairs down there are just rooted way too deep to be pulled out easily with minimal pain.</li>
            <li> On high there are \\&quot;48\\&quot; tweezers grabbing at every single one of your hairs that it can grab hold of.  </li>
            <li> It definitely feels a little bit uncomfy, especially if you let your hair get long, but its kind of expected for what it&#x27;s doing (pulling your hair out from the root).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even before it arrived I was wondering if I had done the right thing as they are not cheap.  </li>
            <li> As long as you do quick touch-ups every other day, your hair will never return to the same amount of thickness.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li> As long as you do quick touch-ups every other day, your hair will never return to the same amount of thickness.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li> I got a couple pretty severe cut type spots even though I pulled the skin tight as I used the epilator on the area.</li>
            <li> I knew this would be painful, but gave it a 5 star rating because it does what it is supposed to do and is easy to clean (IMHO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In my case, this whole process needs to be done roughly every 10 days -- from a visible perspective, I could actually go longer</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun  Silk Epil since last 17 years, of course the model is different and old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-You might need to go over the same area several times to get it completely hair-free.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does feel like little pinches the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> But if you can tough it out I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it, because the results were dramatically better with this than with a razor; with a razor, I have to shave every day or two, but with the epilator I can go at least a week, and it looks nicer too.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my arms and it hurt really bad at first because my arm hair was kind of long.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to use after the first thorough epilation, because there are fewer hairs to pluck, but it still needs to be done every few days to a week to keep</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer that \\&quot;pretty hurts\\</li>
            <li> For those of you who have been down the preceding roads, get ready.  </li>
            <li> After you use an epilator you will have tons of red bumps, so i bought the after cream it did seem to decrease it+slow down the hair growth so far I would only recommend doing your legs with this unless you have a high pain threshold.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of buying an epilator for long time but not sure what to pick and many other questions in mind.</li>
            <li> The only other one I owned was an old old one (from the 90s)</li>
            <li> I just wish I had gotten one that was cordless due to the plugs in my home are all up high on the walls instead of being closer to the floor.</li>
            <li> This is also much easier on the skin than waxing and since it isn&#x27;t sticking to the skin itself, there is less irritation.  </li>
            <li> This product breaks off hairs, which may make the hair be gone for a day or two, but then stubble will return,and when you try to remove the stubble, turns out it&#x27;s not long enough for removal.</li>
            <li> If you can tolerate it, you will find that there is less and less regrowth, which cannot be said about many other hair removal methods.</li>
            <li> no problem at all, very good/cheap/helpful little thing.</li>
            <li> and if you are like me and live on the other side of the world,  it came with an american plug</li>
            <li> In particular the little lamp within.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to let the hair grow in long enough to rip out and it grows back at different speeds.  </li>
            <li> Second, go slowly when you&#x27;re pulling out the hairs for the small tweezers inside the Epilator to grab the hairs:)</li>
            <li> Of course the first time was really hard.  </li>
            <li> This genre of hair removal product has really evolved--When I received the Braun SE 3170, I thought \\&quot;It&#x27;s small.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself as having sensitive skin (olive complexion and dark hair).  </li>
            <li> On the fourth, I could feel some stubbles and then after that I wore long sleeve shirts since you need to wait for the hairs to be a bit longer to be pulled out again.</li>
            <li> However, you definitely do not want to go too long without epilating</li>
            <li> Hair grows on varying schedules, so you have to epilate every few days to keep new hair growth plucked.</li>
            <li> Use baby powder/talcum powder to keep the area you&#x27;re working on dry and the Silk Epil will glide across the skin and target only your hair.</li>
            <li> Sanitizing can be achieved by using a toothbrush and peroxide and allowing to dry thoroughly before next use.</li>
            <li> I let it grow back a second time, not much, maybe a quarter inch, and then tried the epilator.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Cost: cheaper than any single waxing/sugaring/laser session.&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t have to let the hair to grow out for weeks, this epilator removes daily regrowth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was totally prepared for the small amount of &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; that everyone kept referring to, but its really not noticeable as much.</li>
            <li> use this strictly on my legs, as I learned the hard way that using it on more sensitive and less taught skin (underarm, bikini) is NOT a good idea as the machine can grab your skin instead of the hairs--</li>
            <li> When I use it anywhere I&#x27;m left with red bumps that turn into little red spots for days.</li>
            <li> Today, we took it out for use again but while in use, the epilator&#x27;s sound became weird.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s painful but worth it.</li>
            <li> showering and then drying off really well or massaging or pulling on the skin will not help, at least in my case it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> On the lower parts of my legs, especially around my ankles, my hair is dark and coarse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long since quit using the massage guard and opt for the fastest/closest pull there is.</li>
            <li> It takes a few passes, but with some patience, it can leave skin soft and hairless.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo21755R8L21NY5]]I&#x27;ve been waxing my legs since Nad&#x27;s debuted about 10 years ago, and I have been shaving my underarms for about as long.</li>
            <li> &quot; long.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the minor pain, you&#x27;ll be tempted to experiment with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s preferred that you shower afterwards to increase smoothness and avoid the (extremely minor) risk of infection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s preferred that you shower afterwards to increase smoothness and avoid the (extremely minor) risk of infection.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it every month and even if my hair as grown long it does not pain.</li>
            <li> We had used this epilator as normal for about four times in the past.</li>
            <li> They have come a long way since then.  </li>
            <li> Takes a long time to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for a long time.</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve tried this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I still have to shave after using this product but it doesn&#x27;t take me as long and legs</li>
            <li> I also think that any form of hair removal like waxing and epilation can distort the hair follicle so it is to be expected to have some ingrown hairs.. especially if your prone like me.</li>
            <li> Slow and fast.  </li>
            <li> I still definitely recommend this product over other hair removal methods.</li>
            <li> I still definitely recommend this product over other hair removal methods.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with extra heads for shving the other areas.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS MACHINE IF YOU ARE SOBER, HAVE SMALL CHILDREN AROUND, HAVE A NEIGHBOR THAT IS LESS THAN 3 MILES AWAY WITHOUT PROPER WARNING OF POSSIBLE SCREAMING/CURSING/CRYING/</li>
            <li> The most painful was the underarm but after using it several times the pain was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a few red spots after finishing, but I read that that would be caused by the follicle actually being removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Native American and have dark course hair.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it on now -- legs, underarms, upper lip, and even extreme bikini (we&#x27;re talking \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; girls!).</li>
            <li> This seemed difficult at first, but then realized it hurt less if you started with a smaller area ie work your way in from the outside of the underarm.</li>
            <li> Subsequent uses are less than that.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator to replace the one I previously owned that finally gave out.</li>
            <li> I would rather prefer an Epilator that can be used for both wet and dry...</li>
            <li> Once you know what it&#x27;s like, slow down to get the plucking really going.  </li>
            <li> I have smooth legs for at least a week and of course it&#x27;s a bit painful at first</li>
            <li> Sanitizing can be achieved by using a toothbrush and peroxide and allowing to dry thoroughly before next use.pays for itself in about 5/6 uses&lt;br /&gt;Not as messy as waxing</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it didn&#x27;t hurt because I have a high tolerence to pain or if it is because of the little amount of hair I had to do.</li>
            <li> It does definitely remove hair but it also does take time patience and a little bit of pain</li>
            <li> yet it pinches a little but not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to wait weeks for your hair to grow a certain length, nor do you have to hassle with any bad smells or real pain..</li>
            <li> The idea you can do this once and be smooth for 4 weeks is crazy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because there is a row of spikes on the top that leave painful scratches on my legs.</li>
            <li> A couple skincare professionals have told me that&#x27;s just an unfortunate issue some people have, and the only real fix is laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have the time to start with stubble, trim the hair to a roughly 1/4 inch length -- just as they&#x27;ll do for a bikini line waxing.</li>
            <li> Conversely, straighten the leg to do the area behind the knee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who become nervous at the site of blood, a newbie may also experience a hair root removal (1 or 2 spots here or there especially in sensitive areas) drawing some blood.</li>
            <li> Plus, the pain was minimal -- it beats waxing any day.</li>
            <li> I really thought this was going to take all my hair away and not leave any stubble behind.</li>
            <li> Hi,  Earlier i used to do waxing at home,which was messy and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> It is not very</li>
            <li> If you only want to epilate a few times, or if you&#x27;re just experimenting with epilating, you could try this product.</li>
            <li> everyday prior to epilating.</li>
            <li> Left a lot of ingrown hairs, after epilating my legs were never smooth</li>
            <li> Can not be used on wet body.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m asking for the higher quality model, that works on shorter, finer hairs, for Christmas, but still recommend starting with the less expensive model to see if you can tolerate the process.</li>
            <li> make the job, sadly it didn&#x27;t can with the little brush to clean afterwork.</li>
            <li> It does require several passes in a few directions to get every hair, but it gets there, and it&#x27;s not like shaving where you get raw skin if you do multiple passes..</li>
            <li> and now I paid less than $50 for the product and as long as its still working</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very useful for immediate results.</li>
            <li> Only picks up thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I only use this about once avery two or three months, and even when my hair gets &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; it&#x27;s still barely noticeable because of how sparse and thin it is.</li>
            <li> so hair grows and get long in a few days.</li>
            <li> that the other model I owned.  </li>
            <li> I decided on the Braun SE 3170 Epil3 based on other Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred waxing to shaving due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t have to do it often, but because I do it myself, was never 1 to try waxing my underarms.</li>
            <li> Some may not respond well to using a product like this due to skin sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are some others made by Braun, Emjoi, and other brands which are rechargeable.</li>
            <li> One would need to purchase a plug adapter to use it in other countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>

            <li> may use this on the face/genitals, but it&#x27;s not recommended as it can cause excessive red bumps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> may use this on the face/genitals, but it&#x27;s not recommended as it can cause excessive red bumps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other downside is that is hurts.</li>
            <li> I discovered this while living in South America and people thought I was nuts for shaving every day/every other day.</li>
            <li> It misses some hairs, as the other one, but I´m not complaining.</li>
            <li> After months of reading reviews from other people about Epilators,  I decided to take the plunge and purchase one.  </li>
            <li> A small investment for a product that will eliminate shaving if used regularly.</li>
            <li> This thing is such a time saver because I would typically spend about half an hour tweezing my underarms every few days.</li>
            <li> beforehand)&lt;br /&gt;No more messy and painful waxes and screaming&lt;</li>
            <li> It definitely hurts, but I would say that the pain is significantly less than laser hair removal/sugaring (which is what I usually \\&quot;enjoy\\&quot; doing).</li>
            <li> The epilator does the work fine, but misses a few hairs and spots, so sometimes it becomes quite annoying to do the same spots over and over.</li>
            <li> First time I used the Epilator, my hair was a little long, and it pulled like a dirty bugger.  </li>
            <li> love it, even if a bit painful, though in all honesty, it REALLY isnt as horrifying as some people exaggerate it to be, and I am by NO means a high pain tolerance person.</li>
            <li> Not worth it buy a two buck razor</li>
            <li> I have with no success, waxed my legs before</li>
            <li> The results last for at least a week.</li>
            <li> You use it literally once a month and the hair grows back slowly.</li>
            <li> After several passes witk the epilator, at least half of the hair was still there.  </li>
            <li> I will try grinding them down with my Dremel.</li>
            <li> I also went brazilian down there.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you have skin that isn&#x27;t tight and firm.  </li>
            <li> I am half Apache</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about epilating (epilating regularly in a short period of time), I would recommend the Emjoi 72 tweezer head epilator.</li>
            <li> Delete the previous comment.  </li>
            <li> I spend typically around $100-150 every time I wax</li>
            <li> small and only needs its power cord and small cleaner</li>
            <li> Been using this for half a year now and no ingrown hairs yet.</li>
            <li> my &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; half is using it for a years-</li>
            <li> Like the review said, it will hurt less over time.  </li>
            <li> A fifth of whiskey, or any hard liquor that will get you drunk quickly and keep you drunk as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you are tired of shaving and worried that the hairs will grow thicker!</li>
            <li> hairs from the roots, so if you have pale skin with dark hair, it won&#x27;t leave the dark spots</li>
            <li> so I felt a little silly expecting this little pink buzzer to actually do serious damage to my coarse black hair, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> a few uses, you&#x27;ll need less touch-up sessions.</li>
            <li> Basically it is a bunch of little tweezers pulling the hair out,</li>
            <li> This little baby comes with 2 settings.  </li>
            <li> just a little bit and was acceptable.</li>
            <li> My tip is to use anti-biotic cream, after you are done epilating, to reduce little bumps.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had little problem with ingrowns.  </li>
            <li> These are lots of little tweezers ripping out your hair.  </li>
            <li> This little machine cost me about 1/3 the price of 1 leg wax, and I&#x27;ve had it for a year without any functional problems.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, you really need to pull the skin tight and do it small sections at a time, and bikini line requires some crazy contortions (standing, foot on counter).</li>
            <li> Because I am chicken, I let the hair grow back some, and then waxed a second time just for luck.  </li>
            <li> A bit painful, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Could be a lil bit painful using it it, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I agree that this product does not remove thin hair from root but only cuts it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I skeptically proceeded and was more-than-pleasantly surprised by its performance.</li>
            <li> I took a shower, dried, and went to town on my legs.</li>
            <li> as messy as waxing</li>
            <li> A few notes:   </li>
            <li> do any heavy workouts/activities that cause a lot of sweating for 24 hours after epilating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The epilator does seem to skip a few finer/smaller hair.</li>
            <li> just worked for few days, DON&#x27;T waste your money</li>
            <li> : Left a lot of hairs behind.</li>
            <li> It will tickle or hurt for some people in the beginning, but after a few times you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Left harsh bumps behind.</li>
            <li> For one thing even if you use it and your legs look clean, you can feel minute stubble, so that can be a little annoying.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, being used to waxing, it was not easy to start with this.</li>
            <li> The trick to not make it painful is never let your hair grow too much!</li>
            <li> The first time was so painful I had to use it between intervals.</li>
            <li> I will warn first time users it can be painful in the beginning</li>
            <li> For those that are wondering how or why they die, it&#x27;s not that they stop functioning altogether but rather one will notice/hear a visible motor/rotating slow down during periods of regular/extended use.</li>
            <li> A mouth gag, or a piece of thick wood to bite down on.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing about the product is that for leg hairs you have to go over the area multiple times</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So after seeing beau coup reviews talking about the pain involved with these products, I decided to try it for myself and see if it was exaggerated. Exaggerated! The first time I used it, it did hurt almost like the sting from a waxing, but could I expect anything else from pulling hair out at it&#x27;s roots? Now I barely notice it. I also get a temorary rash if I use it infrequently, and I use vitamin E gel , not lotion and it goes away within hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ripping out hair versus shaving since they first invented the Epilady and am now on my 4th hair removal appliance. For those that are wondering how or why they die, it&#x27;s not that they stop functioning altogether but rather one will notice/hear a visible motor/rotating slow down during periods of regular/extended use. In researching what was currently available, I&#x27;m upgrading from the Braun Silk Epil Eversoft Model #5316 (yellow and gray case) to the Braun Se 3170 Silk Epil 3 (pink &amp; white case) specifically because it is Braun&#x27;s latest model with a cord. Unless one removes her (or his) hair over a multiple day period, a 40 minute rechargeable battery isn&#x27;t going to cut it for the \\&quot;all hair at once\\&quot; period and/or for perfectionists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no body area I can&#x27;t use it on now -- legs, underarms, upper lip, and even extreme bikini (we&#x27;re talking \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; girls!). I&#x27;ve long since quit using the massage guard and opt for the fastest/closest pull there is. To be totally fair to newbies, no, I didn&#x27;t get here overnight. And, no, it will never be totally discomfort free (one IS still pulling out a hair by its root). However, even the 2nd time will be light years easier than the first. One is pulling out fewer hairs and they truly, honestly, I swear, cross my heart . . . grow back finer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pointers for the first time user: shave first and allow a noticeable stubble regrowth (2 to 3 days worth). The hair is then both upright and long enough to successfully, easily remove. Use baby powder/talcum powder to keep the area you&#x27;re working on dry and the Silk Epil will glide across the skin and target only your hair. As weird as this sounds, the skin nerves actually start to grow numb from the constant hair-pulling so if the first pass in a sensitive area has you seeing stars -- the subsequent passes will honestly get easier. Move into a more sensitive area gradually on the slower speed (pulling fewer hairs per second) until you feel comfortable orrather numb enough to make a sweeping pass on high speed. Personally, I then shave the same area afterwards (in the shower or bath) to smooth/level the hairs that were too short to pull and my legs are literally as smooth as glass for up to several days afterwards. In my case, this whole process needs to be done roughly every 10 days -- from a visible perspective, I could actually go longer but I do it based on wanting a smooth feeling versus hairless appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have the time to start with stubble, trim the hair to a roughly 1/4 inch length -- just as they&#x27;ll do for a bikini line waxing. If the hair is too long, it&#x27;ll be more prone to breakage versus removal, and it&#x27;s also more painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the upper lip, I&#x27;d like to tell you that area gets easier over time, but it&#x27;s just not the case. I just suck it up and take it like a woman!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A newbie may also experience some skin tenderness/bruising afterwards but it&#x27;ll quickly fade in 24 to 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, ladies (and gents)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Another tip for newbies: Pull the skin taunt/smooth where it&#x27;s loser (as in the underarm area, around the bikini line, and on the upper lip) to decrease discomfort and prevent accidental skin pinching. The easiest way to do one&#x27;s knees is to bend the leg -- the entire knee area becomes smooth. Conversely, straighten the leg to do the area behind the knee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who become nervous at the site of blood, a newbie may also experience a hair root removal (1 or 2 spots here or there especially in sensitive areas) drawing some blood. Some roots, the first time around, are well anchored. The hair then starts to grow back thinner and finer over time making it far easier to remove.</li>
            <li> I ordered this epilator after reading the reviews. I was very nervous about this method, but was convinced to try it by all the positive comments. I used the thorough review by S. White as a how-to guide and have to say I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. Plus, the pain was minimal -- it beats waxing any day. I highly recommend this epilator and suggest that even scaredy-cats like me should try it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts. There you go. However, knowing this, I would still buy this over and over. The pain DOES go away with use/hair size. I love my Epilady!</li>
            <li> Left me with so many ingrown hairs. Pain is not that bad but honestly  it is not like saving..it takes forever and  your legs look like they are soo rashed. Not worth it buy a two buck razor will do a better job.</li>
            <li> I have had epilady and epilators for years and they do a great job, stopping hair growth and with no stubble. I needed to buy a new Epilator  as my u.k .one would not work here and shaving was not an option for me.</li>
            <li> I agree that this product does not remove thin hair from root but only cuts it so hair grows and get long in a few days. Anyway, I think it removes most of thick hair from root.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a while and am very happy with it. It does hurt much more than shaving, but is cheaper than scheduling a whole waxing appointment. It&#x27;s great for a touch-up to smaller areas of skin, but is a little too rough for larger swaths of skin. This particular model seems to be holding up well and does a great job of grabbing all but the finest hairs. It takes a few passes, but with some patience, it can leave skin soft and hairless.</li>
            <li> So, with so many conflicting reviews, lets see if I can shoot straight for you. I knew this would be painful, but gave it a 5 star rating because it does what it is supposed to do and is easy to clean (IMHO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my epilator yesterday, and have used it twice, on legs, bikini area, underarms, and upper lip. Here is what I can tell you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) When I first touched my skin with the epilator it felt like razor blades slicing me, so I jerked it back to check. There were no cuts or bleeding, so I tried again. It still felt a lot like being cut to shreds, but it was tolerable knowing that it was the plucking I felt, and I wasn&#x27;t being cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The more hair there is, the worse it feels. As the areas are epilated, the pain disappears, telling you the area is as smooth as it can be made by the epilator. Be sure to go over the area in a variety of directions to get those stubborn hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) More sensitive areas are going to be unbearable at first, so don&#x27;t expect thorough epilating the first few times. Plan to use the device every other day or so for a couple of weeks to get a thoroughly smooth finish. I have pretty smooth legs and arm pits after two treatments, but the bikini area is going to take longer, since I can&#x27;t hold the epilator in place very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Hair grows on varying schedules, so you have to epilate every few days to keep new hair growth plucked. The idea you can do this once and be smooth for 4 weeks is crazy. It is easier to use after the first thorough epilation, because there are fewer hairs to pluck, but it still needs to be done every few days to a week to keep smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Be sure to exfoliate, and use a moisturizer or after-shave spray made with tea tree oil or other healing ingredients to prevent swelling and infection, as well as ingrown hairs. If you are very prone to those, don&#x27;t epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that covers it. If you can&#x27;t tolerate waxing, this is worse, so don&#x27;t try. I have had a Brazilian wax once, and three natural childbirths. I pride myself on having great pain tolerance, but I won&#x27;t kid you, this feels awful at first. It gets better with time and repeated use. I prefer it to spending huge amounts of money on waxes, or dealing with the mess of waxing at home. Just what I&#x27;ve done so far with the device has more than paid for it in savings from waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the straight talk is helpful. The device is what it is, so don&#x27;t expect not to feel pain when several hundred hairs per minute are being plucked. If you have great pain tolerance and a desire to avoid waxing, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update a year later: I&#x27;m still happy with this product and wouldn&#x27;t change anything in my review from a year ago. In fact, I&#x27;m asking for the higher quality model, that works on shorter, finer hairs, for Christmas, but still recommend starting with the less expensive model to see if you can tolerate the process.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.  This is the first epilator I have used, but it does the job.  It really does hurt, and it&#x27;s never going to feel good, but you kind of get used to it.  Basically it is a bunch of little tweezers pulling the hair out, so yeah, it is painful.  I tried it on my arms and it hurt really bad at first because my arm hair was kind of long.  I ended up shaving my arms, just so that I could start from a shorter length when using it.  So far I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good epilator, and a great price. It does work best if you shave your legs first, then use it everyday after that.It hurts too bad and too much work to try to use it on hairy legs.happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product! The epilator does the work fine, but misses a few hairs and spots, so sometimes it becomes quite annoying to do the same spots over and over.</li>
            <li> I have the older model, and I decided to write a review because it has been 4 years and I am still very impressed by the Silk Epil. It works great, it does its job quickly and effectively, it has multi-functions. The trick to not make it painful is never let your hair grow too much! I have saved so much money and time-no more need for waxing.</li>
            <li> So I bought this yesterday and it just came today in the mail (came quicker than I thought) and I was so excited to use it. I literally just got done using this maybe 10 minutes ago and I&#x27;m not 100% sold on it. I did a lot of research online and this one seemed to have good reviews and was cheaper. I first used this on my lower legs and quickly noticed how much of a shock it was having my hair pulled. I have with no success, waxed my legs before so I know what that feels like but waxing only gives my legs red bumps and bruises. My skin is very sensitive so not even Nair does anything but irritate my skin, plus my hair is dark and coarse (yes lucky me). So after doing one leg I noticed some parts of my leg had stubble and no matter how many times I went over my leg, it didn&#x27;t go away. After doing every part of both my upper/lower legs, I have to say I am a little disappointed. I really thought this was going to take all my hair away and not leave any stubble behind. If I want stubble, I should just shave my legs and that will give me plenty of stubble hours later. I would have bought a more expensive epilator but didn&#x27;t because 1) I don&#x27;t have the money and 2) I&#x27;ve never used one before. Maybe someone can give me advice as to what I could have done wrong but either way, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It takes all the hair away really easily and without much pain. I am glad I bought it</li>
            <li> I gotten this yesterday and tried it out and love it. I don&#x27;t know how I could of not owned one of these sooner. I am half Apache so I do not grow much hair that needs tending to, but do have a patch here and there on my legs. This took care of the hair with in seconds and didn&#x27;t hurt at all. I am not sure if it didn&#x27;t hurt because I have a high tolerence to pain or if it is because of the little amount of hair I had to do. All I know is that I absolutely love it and wouldn&#x27;t trade it in for anything. I just wish I had gotten one that was cordless due to the plugs in my home are all up high on the walls instead of being closer to the floor. But the cord reached just fine and it is easy to use!</li>
            <li> Nice and works well.  There is an adjustment period though as the process isn&#x27;t  painless.  Leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Hi,  Earlier i used to do waxing at home,which was messy and time consuming.  After doing a bit of research i ordered this Brauns Epilator.The product is amazing.It removes hair from the root and leaves ur skin smooth for days.It is not very painful(If u do it properly and after taking a bath),pain is bearable.  And yes ,you ca use it on arms,legs,underarms and bikini area.It is corded,the only thing is it has got jst 20 tweezers,would have given it 5 star if it had 40 tweezers.</li>
            <li> this is a great product it works just like it says the only problem is it hurts like if you&#x27;re getting your skin scratch off it hurts like hell !</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  I previously had a simple inexpensive epilator from CVS that only lasted about 6 months with light use.  I think this Braun model is quieter and more effective that the other model I owned.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much but this may be because I was already used to epilating.  I was able to use this on my under arms and couldn&#x27;t with the other brand.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this and I hope it lasted awhile.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about epilating (epilating regularly in a short period of time), I would recommend the Emjoi 72 tweezer head epilator. I bought the Braun epilator for about $50 and the Emjoi for about $100, but the $50 difference was DEFINITELY worth it! Braun gets probably 1/4 of the hairs the Emjoi does, in the same amount of time. Also, the Braun can only get hairs if they&#x27;re longer than a certain length. I was still able to feel and see a lot of hairs, but the Braun epilator couldn&#x27;t get them until they grew longer. The Emjoi on the other hand got pretty much all of them. If you only want to epilate a few times, or if you&#x27;re just experimenting with epilating, you could try this product. But if you want to epilate regularly, I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of buying an epilator for long time but not sure what to pick and many other questions in mind. Then, finally much reasearch brought Braun 3170 pretty much impressed. For the first time when used pain was much severe after that it is not bad. For travelling its easy to carry. I wished that it had more tweezers. Try to use it according to the directions it will be easy to remove the hair. Finally product is good.</li>
            <li> First, this product is NOT CORDLESS.  It must be plugged in to use, even though on the comparison chart, it states that it can be used cordless.  Second, it only removes maybe 50% of the hair.  On the lower parts of my legs, especially around my ankles, my hair is dark and coarse.  After several passes witk the epilator, at least half of the hair was still there.  Don&#x27;t even bother if you have lighter finer hair.  It may cut off a couple hairs but doesn&#x27;t even come close to pulling ANY out.  Be careful if you have skin that isn&#x27;t tight and firm.  I got a couple pretty severe cut type spots even though I pulled the skin tight as I used the epilator on the area.</li>
            <li> Hey,&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item in Jan 2012 and using it since then.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any problem here, it works well, pretty handy and quick, easy to clean and portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it seems it could not pick up very small hair and may be leave some hair in way.&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t expect your skin to be perfectly smooth, shiny and soft as you get from waxing.&lt;br /&gt;But I should say its perfect for college going girls like me as its quick and removes most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome just for your day today life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male and used this on my chest/belly.  First time I used the Epilator, my hair was a little long, and it pulled like a dirty bugger.  It wasn&#x27;t quite as bad the next time I used it.  Best to trim your hair down some before the first time you use it.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to pull as hard when the hair is shorter.  Over all I like the product.  Lots better than shaving and I don&#x27;t have to do it as often.</li>
            <li> The item works as promised. I have found nothing wrong with it as yet. I recommend the product. It isn&#x27;t as painful as expected</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well the only problem with it is that it is so loud. It sounds almost like some kind of power tool, like a drill or something.</li>
            <li> I actually do love this product, however my only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t give proper instructions as to the use of this product.  For this HUMOROUS product review, please read on.  For the short version:  If you get it and don&#x27;t yet know what pain is, good luck.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s an awesome product that I may get my whole family!  For those of you who do not know what an epilator is, let me enlighten you.  It is a legal torturing device that the Government has yet to become aware of or use.  If they did, it would become illegal immediately.  This little baby comes with 2 settings.  Slow and fast.  Your ability to handle pain also depends on these settings.  If you&#x27;ve never given birth, had a tattoo, or kicked someone&#x27;s @$$, do NOT attempt a high setting.  Start with low and work your way up.  For those of you who have been down the preceding roads, get ready.  On high there are \\&quot;48\\&quot; tweezers grabbing at every single one of your hairs that it can grab hold of.  The spinning apparatus that holds these \\&quot;demon fingers\\&quot; rotates at about the same speed as one of those low rider spinning hubcaps when the vehicle comes to a stop at an intersection.  This apparatus can be used on legs, arms, armpits, and the bikini/groin area.  WARNING!!!  DO NOT USE THIS MACHINE IF YOU ARE SOBER, HAVE SMALL CHILDREN AROUND, HAVE A NEIGHBOR THAT IS LESS THAN 3 MILES AWAY WITHOUT PROPER WARNING OF POSSIBLE SCREAMING/CURSING/CRYING/SPITTING/SPITTING FIRE/HATING THE MAN WHO INVENTED IT AND THE HIGH HEEL!  It is suggested that no one be at home for fear of murder during use of this apparatus.  YOU WILL NEED:  A fifth of whiskey, or any hard liquor that will get you drunk quickly and keep you drunk as long as possible.  This liquor should be kept on hand at all times.  A mouth gag, or a piece of thick wood to bite down on.  A soothing lotion.  An ice pack..  or 10 ice packs.  Delete the previous comment.  Fill the whole tub up with ice..  Stick appendage in for relief.  LOTS AND LOTS OF NERVE!I recommend that one SHAVES OR WAXES before attempting this.  Then wait 2 days after shave (or up to 1-2 weeks after waxing) and try to just do the upkeep.  It is suggested that (from what I learned from a couple of FABULOUS tattoo artists) to pull the skin taught.  (SP on that word..  I&#x27;m still recovering..)  When doing so, begin by quickly moving apparatus at a 90 degree angle on skin.  Once you know what it&#x27;s like, slow down to get the plucking really going.  I am sure that most of you know that the legs and forearms are going to be about the same.  The upper arm, arm pit, and inner thigh are a little more tricky.  IF you decide to \\&quot;epilate\\&quot; your bikini area, please drink extra liquor and have a paramedic standing by...  AND FOR THE LOVE OF THE WORLD DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DECIDE THAT A SALT SCRUB WOULD BE A FANTASTIC IDEA TO RELAX YOU AFTER DOING THIS!!  THIS COULD BE FATAL TO NOT JUST YOU BUT YOUR WHOLE FAMILY WHILE THEY STAND BACK AND LAUGH AT YOU!!!  I didn&#x27;t do that...  SOBERLY I did everything..  TOP TO BOTTOM STONE COLD SOBER..  I am alive.  I am not sure how, but I did survive.</li>
            <li> I bought  Braun SE3170 Silk-épil SoftPerfection Epilator last year after reading reviews and doing a lot of research.First time It did the job fine as expected but after 20 minutes(with breaks) it stopped working.  I was convinced that it is the way it is supposed to work (silly me). I have not used it on very regular basis (may be 5 times) in a year and today when Plugged it again its not working at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the product, works perfectly, and almost painless. But it seems that breaks off the hair legs instead of getting pulled out</li>
            <li> So...  I probably got about a good 8 months out of this epilator which is unacceptable.  I&#x27;ve been epilating for at least 4 yrs now so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m pulling out bamboo shoots here. My hair is sparse and thin now.  About a month ago suddenly the part that rotates just started jamming and staying stuck so you&#x27;d have to push it backwards to get it to start again.  Massively annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, out of all the epilators I&#x27;ve used I would say this one appears to have the shoddiest construction.  I&#x27;ve made origami more durable than this thing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money go for something sturdier.</li>
            <li> When the Epilady was introduced a couple of decades ago, I suffered through them--they were torture and hair removal was spotty in areas like underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After realizing that there is a new generation of these products on the market, I researched Braun, Episilk and several others I found online. I decided on the Braun SE 3170 Epil3 based on other Amazon reviews. I have to thank all who favorably reviewed this product as you are right! This genre of hair removal product has really evolved--When I received the Braun SE 3170, I thought \\&quot;It&#x27;s small.  It&#x27;s plastic.  There is no WAY this will do the job\\&quot;.  I skeptically proceeded and was more-than-pleasantly surprised by its performance. The Braun removes hair easily, smoothly, effortlessly--without pain!  My underarms were done in a flash--smooth and no follicles showing like when I shave. This was always the hardest, most torturous experience with the old Epilady. What&#x27;s more, there is no soreness afterwards-I even put on deodorant!  I would definitely feel safe recommending this to others for multiple areas.  I noticed that you get the best results by using a circular motion and usually must pass over an area a few times but I think that is the nature of these type of products.  I hope it is as durable as it is effective--this is a wonderful purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product having never used an epilator before, but it definitely seemed like it would be worthwhile to try. I have dark hair and thin pale skin, so shaving always leaves bluish stubbly shadows and waxing is a pain in the butt.  Overall; not bad. It works pretty much as advertized. It isn&#x27;t perfect, certainly. For one thing even if you use it and your legs look clean, you can feel minute stubble, so that can be a little annoying. You also have to work your butt off to avoid ingrown hairs--exfoliate like crazy, and I also go over my legs/underarms after epilating with a pair of tweezers because there always seem to be a few hairs that are pulled out only half-way, which is a perfect recipe for a lot of little infected spots that are a minor injury and major irritation.   I use it pretty much like the instructions say. I remove the little rollers because they don&#x27;t help and it&#x27;s one more thing to clean, and I also don&#x27;t go strictly against the growth direction of the hairs...that seems to leave more behind, so it seems to help to do a crisscross/herringbone kind of pattern too.   It does hurt. On arms and legs it was about like being stung by a sweat bee, and that has reduced some with repeated use. On underarms it hurt A LOT; more like being stung by a wasp. Repeatedly. In your armpits. But if you can tough it out I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it, because the results were dramatically better with this than with a razor; with a razor, I have to shave every day or two, but with the epilator I can go at least a week, and it looks nicer too. It still hurts after several uses, but not nearly as much as it did the first time.  On the whole, this is a good purchase, particularly if you just want to try an epilator for the first time. It&#x27;s tidy, easy to use and clean, and the results are not miraculous but definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> So I bought this thing for Christmas waited about 4-5 days for the thing in the mail right when I got it I tried it out. So I ended up doing my legs which seemed to take about 3 hours for me to do both legs. I also did downtown/bikini area that hurt alot to do. After you use an epilator you will have tons of red bumps, so i bought the after cream it did seem to decrease it+slow down the hair growth so far I would only recommend doing your legs with this unless you have a high pain threshold. It does definitely remove hair but it also does take time patience and a little bit of pain but hey if it works it does.</li>
            <li> i bought this last year and its working fine. Its just you need to keep it at 90 degrees to the part where you want to remove hair yes as all reviews have said you need to run epilator in different directions. Also, i dont know if my under arms are sensitive or what but they bleed when i use epilator there . otherwise it works great.  happy to have it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice now and I&#x27;m very pleased.  Of course the first time was really hard.  Don&#x27;t kid yourself if you think it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I equate it to getting a tattoo.  It can be pretty intense especially around the joint areas (knees and ankles) and inside the thighs.  I don&#x27;t consider myself as having sensitive skin (olive complexion and dark hair).  And I also did the first time on the low speed.  For me I discovered the faster speed to be less painful.  The second time was much better. I don&#x27;t plan to use this product in my bikini area or under the arms because those areas are more apt to have ingrown hair problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is pretty long so it was worth getting a cord type epilator as opposed to a cordless.  It&#x27;s much less expensive and I&#x27;m sure just as good.  It did the job for me.</li>
            <li> did lots of research about the epilator before ordering and finally chose this one. got it yesterday and tried last night. very good. after reading other reviews, I thought it should hurt me, fortunately, it did not. just a little bit and was acceptable. like it and recommend it</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo21755R8L21NY5]]I&#x27;ve been waxing my legs since Nad&#x27;s debuted about 10 years ago, and I have been shaving my underarms for about as long. I&#x27;ve always preferred waxing to shaving due to the fact that I didn&#x27;t have to do it often, but because I do it myself, was never 1 to try waxing my underarms. I also shave my bikini area, but have recently started waxing. I only recently became familiar with epilators less than 2 weeks ago. I saw 1 in a sharper image store, and so began my research. After viewing several different epilators, reading numerous reviews, and watching reviews, I decided to go with this 1. I have to admit, being used to waxing, it was not easy to start with this. A previous reviewer said to shave/trim the hairs prior to using for the first time, but that takes too much time. I took a shower, dried, and went to town on my legs. After a few minutes, it got easy, and I got bold. Went over both legs (below the knee only), and proceeded to my underarms. This seemed difficult at first, but then realized it hurt less if you started with a smaller area ie work your way in from the outside of the underarm. Excited with the progress I made, I decided to use this on my bikini area as well. This only proved difficult because the hair was about 1/2\\&quot; long. I am a firm believer that \\&quot;pretty hurts\\&quot; so I worked through the pain. I had a few red spots after finishing, but I read that that would be caused by the follicle actually being removed. Some reviewers have mentioned having ingrown hairs after. Similar to waxing, one must apply something to skin after hair removal (whatever your poison) and exfoliate daily. I use the hair removal items which came in the Nad&#x27;s hair removal kit. Overall, I am please with my experience. I have not noticed any ingrown hairs or irritation, which could be because I followed the advice of another reviewer; applying baby/talcum powder to the area prior to epilating. My skin is smooth now and I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;IMO pays for itself in about 5/6 uses&lt;br /&gt;Not as messy as waxing&lt;br /&gt;No stubble later (compared to shaving)&lt;br /&gt;Easy maintenance of tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Little noisy (but doesn&#x27;t wake up my dog)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and I would definitely recommend it to others as I have already started doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note:&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different.

            <li> Products was recieved as advertised and recieved in a timely manner, I was very happy, and would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Todo muy bien. Me gusto... Fue lo que pedi... llego a tiempo... Excelente, recomendando 100%...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saludos desde Valencia - Venezuela...</li>
            <li> This product breaks off hairs, which may make the hair be gone for a day or two, but then stubble will return,and when you try to remove the stubble, turns out it&#x27;s not long enough for removal. For the price you&#x27;re paying, proceed at your own risk and most likely dissapointment. I am hoping that the sellers will ackowledge this type of issue and start providing services that are up to the price.</li>
            <li> This thing is such a time saver because I would typically spend about half an hour tweezing my underarms every few days. I removed the massaging rollers though, it&#x27;s not necessary. Only con for me is that I wished it were bigger or had more tweezers. Other than that, I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Greats!!! It has been very good buy. A good price and gives some excellent results. Me olvide de las demas maquinas. Los vellos en las piernas tardan 15 dias en salir.</li>
            <li> This works really well and I have fine hair. It takes a bit getting used to, but once you do, you will love it. No more waxing for me!</li>
            <li> I love this epilator.  I&#x27;ve used just about any hair removal there is out there...&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons why I like it is because it plucks fast! so, you feel it but you&#x27;re getting results.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin...waxing is by far the worst for me...but with this epilator, I had no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a first for me!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it \\&quot;anywhere\\&quot; I have hair and it works!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product...and the price is right!</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun  Silk Epil since last 17 years, of course the model is different and old. It still works, but I felt the efficiency had reduced, so I bought Braun SE 3170 Silk Epil- I am completely happy with it. I feel the difference between the old one I had been using the this one, it is much better and removes hair faster. I do feel though that this model has fewer tweezers than the old model I have and the tweezers are spaced a lot apart than the older model. But it is effective nonetheless. I like it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It&#x27;s not like waxing, or using Nail or anything like that at all.. You don&#x27;t have to wait weeks for your hair to grow a certain length, nor do you have to hassle with any bad smells or real pain.. This device has small tweezers on it that rotate.. I&#x27;m not going to lie, first time I used it, I felt little pinches on my legs and arms, but honestly it was not  nearly as painful as getting waxed.. You use it literally once a month and the hair grows back slowly. Use it while your just sitting watching tv or reading online or whatever, but I absolutely reccomend this to anyone who is considering buying an epilator.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far but the hair on my legs felt as if I had used a razor, very prickly!  My old one left my legs smooth.  So far I would have to say I don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> Best decision ever! I have used razors all my life and now I have a bunch of ingrown hairs! I got to use the epilator on my legs today and it&#x27;s awesome! My friend recommended it to me and I am so glad I listened to her. I ordered it on a Monday and received it on Thursday the same week.   A few notes:   -At first it hurt but then I got used to the tweezing sensation. That tingly feeling endured an hour after using the epilator and putting on lotion. -The most sensitive zones are right above the ankles and shins.   -It didn&#x27;t get rid of the ingrowns but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to since the description didn&#x27;t indicate it would. (I guess I&#x27;ll have to tweeze those out individually. Ouch!)   -The massage rollers really help with the pain. They&#x27;re prickly, but don&#x27;t hurt.  -Cleaning was easy with the little brush included in the box.   -The process was fast and easy. Not cuts and burns, unlike razors.  -I used the slower setting because the faster setting hurt a little more. I might use the faster setting once I get used to it.  -I&#x27;ve heard the epilator can last for years!</li>
            <li> I wax every month or every two months, underarms- full legs- bikini. I used this product for the first time- legs felt a little pain, same as waxing... underarms and bikini a little more pain- but it is so worth it. I spend typically around $100-150 every time I wax and now I paid less than $50 for the product and as long as its still working I will never have to wax again. This is great! I highly recommend. I will literally save at least $800 this year because of this epilator. Like I said, it is a little painful, I mean its tweezing multiple hairs at a time, so that doesnt feel nice. But I think for the price its worth it if you wax regularly. 10 minutes of a bit of pain is bearable.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that really works. No more razors for me! Yes, it does feel like little pinches the first time you use it. It&#x27;s no worse than waxing. Since I have definitely experienced level 10 pain, I would rate this level 1 or less the first time.  Subsequent uses are less than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female (with PCOS too) and love being *completely* hair-free. I experiment with countless hair removal methods just for the fun of it, so I&#x27;m aware of different hair removal needs. This particular epilator is a cheap, convenient, non-embarassing way for both men and women to remove large amounts of hair in the privacy of their own home. Be sure to set aside a couple of hours this weekend to get started with this guy. I&#x27;m Middle-Eastern so I felt a little silly expecting this little pink buzzer to actually do serious damage to my coarse black hair, but I was pleasantly surprised. It definitely hurts, but I would say that the pain is significantly less than laser hair removal/sugaring (which is what I usually \\&quot;enjoy\\&quot; doing). Unlike a razor, you don&#x27;t have to keep stopping to clean the blades. The results were a lot smoother than waxing, and my skin healed after one day. You should expect a lot of red bumps the first night you use this, especially if you have coarser hair. This is normal and they will heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: Received in great condition and on time (using Amazon Prime&#x27;s free 2-day shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package: Very lightweight. The lack of accessories/packing material actually made me wonder at first if I received a used epilator. But after quickly skimming through the manual, I realised that all you really needed was the little epilator and its cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions: The informational packet comes with a few handy tips, but I think they could have provided more instructions for users who aren&#x27;t as experienced with hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-After a few uses, you&#x27;ll need less touch-up sessions. Like with waxing/sugaring/laser, your hairs become thinner and more sparse after each session.&lt;br /&gt;-Takes longer for regrowth when compared to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Can be used anywhere. Trust me, I mean *anywhere*.&lt;br /&gt;-Very small and only needs its power cord and small cleaner brush.&lt;br /&gt;-The power cord means that it doesn&#x27;t operate on batteries, for me that was a positive since I use it for hours at a time.&lt;br /&gt;-Removes hairs from the roots, so if you have pale skin with dark hair, it won&#x27;t leave the dark spots behind.&lt;br /&gt;-Cost: cheaper than any single waxing/sugaring/laser session.&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t have to let the hair to grow out for weeks, this epilator removes daily regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;-Very easy to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-If you&#x27;re planning on using this for trips, it&#x27;s VERY noisy and doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying pouch.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t work as well with smaller/vellus hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Causes a lot of red bumps in the first 24 hours, so it&#x27;s not very useful for immediate results. It&#x27;s a longer process.&lt;br /&gt;-You might need to go over the same area several times to get it completely hair-free. Some stray hairs will drive you insane.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s addictive. Once you get used to the minor pain, you&#x27;ll be tempted to experiment with it. I went into my bathroom thinking that I would only do my legs, but I emerged two hours later without any body hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Some hairs are broken off rather than plucked. Regrowth can be itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t do any heavy workouts/activities that cause a lot of sweating for 24 hours after epilating. The sweat/movement causes excessive irritation and clogs pores.&lt;br /&gt;-Sit in a comfortable, air-conditioned, well-lit room. Make sure to have a drink or snack handy, you&#x27;ll be in there for a while.&lt;br /&gt;-Throw an old, large towel underneath you while using this to catch stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliate everyday prior to epilating. Shower and exfoliate before removing hair, but make sure that your skin has had enough time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;-If you have the money and time, have your hair waxed/sugared a couple of times before using the epilator. This will lead to sparse, fine hairs that are easier to remove, so you can just use the epilator for touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;-Take a nice warm shower after epilating, and lather on a lot of very rich, creamy moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s really only the first time that has to hurt. As long as you do quick touch-ups every other day, your hair will never return to the same amount of thickness.&lt;br /&gt;-You may take some ibuprofen an hour beforehand to ease inflammation if you&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;-You may use this on the face/genitals, but it&#x27;s not recommended as it can cause excessive red bumps.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s preferred that you shower afterwards to increase smoothness and avoid the (extremely minor) risk of infection.&lt;br /&gt;-Use a technique similar to shaving. Hold the skin taut, and move the upright epilator against the direction of hair growth. Lightly graze over the area and don&#x27;t press down too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason for rating:&lt;br /&gt;-Although I enjoyed this purchase, the results weren&#x27;t as smooth as I&#x27;d liked and I had to go over the same area several times. I still definitely recommend this product over other hair removal methods. I will be trying a different epilator in the future to compare results. I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions.ly only the first time that has to hurt.

            <li> I really like this epilator. I guess you can say I&#x27;m an epilator virgin because it was my first time buying and using such a product! Hahha. Anyway, I really liked it... although it hurts like no other. The first time was so painful I had to use it between intervals. The only bad thing about the product is that for leg hairs you have to go over the area multiple times and it hurts even though I have very fine leg hairs...</li>
            <li> Initially, I bought the Braun Se 3170 Silk Epilator with some doubt it was not going to work for me. BUT....after one use I am in love with this product! I have always had hairy arms so I wanted to get rid of them asap. I got advice from other reviews on the best way to use it. First, you should always put baby powder on BEFORE using the Epilator. This is key. Second, go slowly when you&#x27;re pulling out the hairs for the small tweezers inside the Epilator to grab the hairs:) I will warn first time users it can be painful in the beginning but we all know pain comes with beauty;) It was not painful for me because I was used to pulling out my arm and leg hairs with tweezers. (weird, I know)I have still yet to do my legs....its a lot more work compared to arms. And finally, I would recommend shaving in the end for a nice smooth touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the results are great! The hairs on my arms did not grow back for about 4 days! On the fourth, I could feel some stubbles and then after that I wore long sleeve shirts since you need to wait for the hairs to be a bit longer to be pulled out again. I would highly recommend this product if you are tired of shaving and worried that the hairs will grow thicker!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the plunge! The first time I tried it, I cried like a baby and swore to return it to Amazon. Instead, I read what the other reviewers suggested and waxed first to loosen the hair roots.  Because I am chicken, I let the hair grow back some, and then waxed a second time just for luck.  I let it grow back a second time, not much, maybe a quarter inch, and then tried the epilator.  Success! &#x3D;D  Like other reviewers have said, you really need to pull the skin tight and do it small sections at a time, and bikini line requires some crazy contortions (standing, foot on counter). But once you get used to it, it&#x27;s super easy and 5-10 mins a week is adequate to keep everything perpetually smooth. It does require several passes in a few directions to get every hair, but it gets there, and it&#x27;s not like shaving where you get raw skin if you do multiple passes.. It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect me any if I do one or ten passes. I&#x27;m perfectly happy with this compromise.  I also haven&#x27;t had an ingrown hair since I started using this. ;)  The massage rollers do help keep it a pain free experience.  The science behind this is that if you stimulate the area by rubbing, it creates more sensory signals which will compete with the pain signals and reduce your perception of pain.  Seems to work for me. ;)  Thanks Braun!  I love you!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Little pain (with adequate prep beforehand)&lt;br /&gt;No more messy and painful waxes and screaming&lt;br /&gt;No more razor stubble&lt;br /&gt;Just smoothness &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Learning curve&lt;br /&gt;Requires multiple passes to get everything (But I don&#x27;t care!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**EDIT**  Been using this for half a year now and no ingrown hairs yet. Still love!  However, you definitely do not want to go too long without epilating cause it&#x27;ll hurt more. Once every 2 weeks is sufficient for me.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I was terrified upon reading the reviews about this epilator. But, snce shaving gives me HORRIBLE razor burn all the time, I figured I could give it a try anyways, since waxing turned out to not be THAT big a deal anyways.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, at first it stings like you wouldnt believe, but I honestly got used to it pretty fast. Yes, I did keep my teeth gritted for certain parts, but honestly, for the money, and how long this thing lasts, I wont complain.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, even if a bit painful, though in all honesty, it REALLY isnt as horrifying as some people exaggerate it to be, and I am by NO means a high pain tolerance person.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I would be using it on every inch of my body and it turns out it doesn&#x27;t work like that. I use it mostly for thinning out patches of hair so its easier to shave in certain areas. When I use it anywhere I&#x27;m left with red bumps that turn into little red spots for days. Anything you try to do a weird angle on the guard part falls off and then it pinches your skin. I used it on my back to get the peach fuzz around my neck and it kinda worked but turned into a patch of acne so I&#x27;m never doing that again. I have a very high pain tolerance and I went through with it, but this is a modern day lady torturing device. Epilators suck, except if you want to do a small patch. If you are planning to do your legs save yourself the money and go buy a man razor instead and you will thank me.</li>
            <li> It is a very good option I liked it, I recomend to buy this kind of products. I&#x27;m happy with this</li>
            <li> I really love using this. Easy to use and no pain at all. I use it every month and even if my hair as grown long it does not pain. Handy and easy to carry.love it</li>
            <li> This machine dont have all pieces we need for have a perfect finish, is not working really well, I need review 2 or 3 times for hair.</li>
            <li> We had used this epilator as normal for about four times in the past. Today, we took it out for use again but while in use, the epilator&#x27;s sound became weird. We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong, but we definitely regret buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: We continued using it and then the machine started sounding normal again.</li>
            <li> This thing works really well! It removes the hairs and leaves the skin feeling very smooth! It does hurt but personally I think it&#x27;s totally worth it. Loved the results.</li>
            <li> After years of waxing various parts, I decided that there had to be a better way.  This is it!  When I started researching epilators, I thought I&#x27;d find those coil things, from the 80&#x27;s.  They have come a long way since then.  Anything you can wax, you can epilate!  This is also much easier on the skin than waxing and since it isn&#x27;t sticking to the skin itself, there is less irritation.  My tip is to use anti-biotic cream, after you are done epilating, to reduce little bumps.  I&#x27;ve had little problem with ingrowns.  The minor ones I had were easily removed with a tweezer.  Plus, this is much less expensive than salon waxes or even home kits, over the long run.  And, you have the option of using the lower speed if you want a \\&quot;less intense sensation\\&quot; (good for delicate areas), though the low speed will take longer, of course.  Still when you are staring at a tender spot, trying to work up the nerve to make contact with this thing, a lower speed becomes highly appealing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are just two downsides here.  I found that it really isn&#x27;t worth it for my legs.  I still shave them, like before.  I don&#x27;t want to let the hair grow in long enough to rip out and it grows back at different speeds.  It&#x27;s just easier to shave &#x27;em.  However, I use this handy thing for everything else.  The other downside is that is hurts. (You knew that was coming, didn&#x27;t you?)  I&#x27;d be lying if I said it \\&quot;causes discomfort.\\&quot;  It hurts.  These are lots of little tweezers ripping out your hair.  However, the more you use it, the less it hurts.  The hair will grow in sparser and thinner and the whole process will get faster. After about 3 months of use, I got to the point where it is just a few zips and all done!  Even once I got through the first several uses, it got pretty easy.  I use this thing a bunch and I will never go back to sticky wax, again!  I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several years. At first it&#x27;s painful but worth it. The most painful was the underarm but after using it several times the pain was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lo he usado por varios a&amp;ntilde;os. Al principio es doloroso pero vale la pena. Lo m&amp;aacute;s doloroso fue usarlo en la axilas pero despu&amp;eacute;s de utilizarlo varias veces el dolor desapareci&amp;oacute;.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t open it yet. Very surprised it was electrical one not with batteries. Hope will make the deal. Will let you know</li>
            <li> This epilator works great.  I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because there is a row of spikes on the top that leave painful scratches on my legs. I can only guess that the spikes are meant to &amp;#34;distract&amp;#34; the user from the very bearable discomfort of the hair being pulled out.  I will take the pain of the hair being pulled out any day over the scratches caused by the spikes.  I will try grinding them down with my Dremel.</li>
            <li> my &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; half is using it for a years- no complints</li>
            <li> One of the worst things I&#x27;ve ever bought! I used it every 2-3 days for 6 months and NEVER had smooth legs. Here are reasons I hate this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. Takes a long time to use. I would have to go the same hair 5-6 times to get it.&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t pull hairs that are too short (hence never having smooth legs)&lt;br /&gt;3. It hurts &amp; irritates the skin, the first couple times hurt the worst but even 6 months later it was never painless and my skin would still get irritated.&lt;br /&gt;4. Causes ingrown hairs. The last time I used it I got several in grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend this product and am sorry that I was sucked in by the good reviews. I don&#x27;t how it has ever gotten a good review,</li>
            <li> great epilator. I discovered this while living in South America and people thought I was nuts for shaving every day/every other day. The results last for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! I&#x27;m Native American and have dark course hair.  No problem!!!! I have smooth legs for at least a week and of course it&#x27;s a bit painful at first but after the 3rd use I don&#x27;t even feel it anymore, even in those super sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It works great and I have used it regularly for the last year.  A bit painful, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator to replace the one I previously owned that finally gave out. I  loved my old Braun, so I replaced it with this new one just to be sure I would have a proven appliance.  It is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I will not go into pain involved as many others have done.  I have had no problem with pain at all.  Either you are able to tolerate it or not. If you can tolerate it, you will find that there is less and less regrowth, which cannot be said about many other hair removal methods. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Truth to be told, the item does work! But if you bought this to deal with your pubic hair because you hate the look and feel of hair down there (just like I do), then you will be very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the hairs down there are just rooted way too deep to be pulled out easily with minimal pain. in the first time i tried it, it left a giant red/purple bruise looking thing on my skin in the pelvic area and it was irritated so much that it felt itchy for almost 3 days. showering and then drying off really well or massaging or pulling on the skin will not help, at least in my case it didn&#x27;t. And no, you will NOT get &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to such brutality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for arms or such, i think this thing is ok to go with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, do NOT buy if you are looking to get rid of your pubic hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love using Braun because it is a brand I trust. This epilator in particular is good because it does not have as many tweezers as some other ones do (meaning that it is less painful, but does take longer to remove the hair). I think the design could improve because I have to clean off the hair constantly. I wish there were a pocket or vacuum-like component that could hold the hair so that I don&#x27;t have to clean it off with the brush every second.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over a year now and I haven&#x27;t used it 10 times. It introduced me to the world of epilating.&lt;br /&gt;The pain is just too excrutiating especially for my most sensitive parts.&lt;br /&gt;It is a well made product, just not for me...</li>
            <li> She loves it, I gave it to my wife as a gift and she said it takes getting used to and you must keep the hair short or it hurts. But she loves it!!</li>
            <li> It works like a charm. I only have to go over each area once or twice to remove the hairs. I have an older version so needed a new one. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is my first ever epilator and I am pleased to say that I am not disappointed. I was totally prepared for the small amount of &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; that everyone kept referring to, but its really not noticeable as much. But that also could be because i have fine hair. The first time I got it delivered, I decided to go straight to my underarms and try doing them. It took me some 15 minutes to get a hang of this product and do both my underarms. But the result was really good. Its been 4 days now, and they are just as smooth as day 1.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator does seem to skip a few finer/smaller hair. I use a second smaller epilator to get rid of them (Emoji Epi Slim Epilator). But even with that, I still will go ahead and definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy it.</li>
            <li> very good with this price</li>
            <li> Good product. Good quality. It operates pretty well without leaving any hair on your body. Have to careful with super sensitive area.</li>
            <li> couple years ago i tried using epilator just on one area to try it, and damnnn it hurts really badly! Somehow i convinced myself to give it a try and actually buy one. All i&#x27;ve done is waxing and shaving, but mostly shaving and we know how this works.. very annoying every 2-3days. To tell you the truth starting with my lower part of the legs wasn&#x27;t so bad.Then the next day i continued with my tights and bikini area (oh well now that&#x27;s a whole different story, it most def hurts on some places) but overall i am very pleased with the purchase. It&#x27;s not the complete SMOOTH shaving-like feel, (for this 1st time) because of the previous shaving not all hair has grown properly. But  The pain is def worth it. It&#x27;s my 3rd day, my legs feel great, each day when i feel some hair is coming out i just go over it for couple mins and it gets the smoother feel. It is time consuming though, especially the 1st time. I think after that you get used to it. I do recommended it, also with this purchase i got the Gigi anti bump rx treatment, because i knew from frds and reviews that epilating will get you ingrown hair, especially after you have shaved mostly of the time. I did one leg with the anti bump treatment and one not and it does seem to work. After you epilate the skin becomes very sensitive, red and some places can be a bit bloody but nothing scary. ( so if you&#x27;re planning to go to the beach i recommend to use it the night before)</li>
            <li> All that I can say is OUCH OUCH WTF OUTCH.  Are you serious?  What women go through is beyond words!  I&#x27;m not a hairy person but I wanted to try it out because I too hate having stubbles of hair growing back after 2 days of shaving my arm pits.  My 1st and 2nd attempt, I used it on my underarms.  It hurt so bad.  I did get all the hairs off but it also left me with red blood spots.  Not sure how that is more attractive and very sensitive arm pits for 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still planning on trying it out for a couple more runs.  Like the review said, it will hurt less over time.  Hard to believe).  Using it on my legs and arms is not a big deal.  The skin is tougher there and yet it pinches a little but not a big deal.  Do some really use it for their bikini area?  Wow.  I can&#x27;t even attempt to even think about that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guy roommate tried to use it on his chest and face but after 2 seconds, he screamed like a girl and said no way.</li>
            <li> Well,I ended up returning this item.  It hurt all the time, and it did not get all the hairs out consistently.  I think for a woman focusing on small areas this may do the trick.  But I am a man and was using this for my arms (which barely have any hair) and some parts of my face and YIKES!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have had this Braun Epilator for a little over a month now, and love it!  It is powerful, easy to use, virtually pain free (although I have a pretty high pain threshold), and easy to clean.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Could be a lil bit painful using it it, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This Braun epilator works fast. It takes all the hair and your legs will be very smooth. It doesn&#x27;t come with extra heads for shving the other areas. The massager part is very helpfull with the pain!</li>
            <li> I got this like 3 years ago, it still works like the first day. It doesn&#x27;t pull out every single hair at the first pass, it takes around 4 times of passing it on an area but it does an amazing job. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I received the package in record time and I was elated to find that it is just as it said in the ad.  I can use it on my legs and not have to do it again for a  couple of weeks.  Much better than the old shave every day.</li>
            <li> Very nice and small epilator. The only other one I owned was an old old one (from the 90s) so a slimmer and quieter version was welcomed. It misses some hairs, as the other one, but I´m not complaining. The main job is done.</li>
            <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really enjoy it. In particular the little lamp within. That help you see better even with no day light or good glasses.</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for a long time. I find it very convenient that it is enough to do this procedure just once in 2 weeks. I love this one in particular because it has a light in front for better visibility and results.</li>
            <li> Using it for an year now, no issues and no problems. Works great and is less painfull. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> estoy muy contenta con el producto, llego en perfectas condiciones, funciona de maravilla. en cada lugar que lo use elimino los vellos por completos. 100 recomendado.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the product arrived in perfect condition, works great. in each place that remove the hair by using complete. 100 recommended.</li>
            <li> Vendor shipped right away and arrived in good condition and it has been working fine so far. My daughter says it is okay but she doesn&#x27;t know if any other product out there can work better or not.</li>
            <li> It is super !!! I recommend to all !!! I use more than 2 years, and their work is clearly makes!&lt;br /&gt;That there was no itching, use massage oil after depilating.</li>
            <li> I bought my first epilator 20 years ago in Europe and I just loved it ! I had to replace it 10 years after and was able to find the same model down in south America and 10 years later, brings me to the present time, I needed to replace it again, I got the newer versions of this epilator and had to return it, was a disappointment , then I tried a different brand with 72 tweezers and I though it was going to be great, it was so bad that for the 100 dollars I paid for it I didn&#x27;t think it was worth at all, so I returned that one as well, finally I decided to look for my old model and was able to find it here, I am so happy , finally an epilator that works, just like my old ones. The price is awesome and the product is fabulous .</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve tried this a long time ago. I absolutely love not having to shave my armpits anymore. They are so nice and smooth. I also went brazilian down there. It hurts the first couple times but after that not at all and I am so smooth. I don&#x27;t like using it as much on my legs. I have used it for my legs but just can&#x27;t seem to get them quite as smooth as my other areas. This was a great price too.</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile ago, Its very nice small cute but its really loud. When I turned it on the first time the sound alone scared me. It gets most of the hairs some times there&#x27;s a few stray one&#x27;s but that&#x27;s ok I just pluck them out with a pair tweezers.</li>
            <li> Great epilator! It is exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Very smart purchase, you wont waste your money is a good brand (I think German) i bought since 2011 and still works and my older sister got one +5 years ago and still works!! My lil sister found in waltmart a cheap one (between 10-20 bucks, don&#x27;t remember exactly) from china and the machine just worked for few days, DON&#x27;T waste your money</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind a little pain and a bit of a time investment, this device can definitely give you smooth skin. I used it once and it got rid of most hair, then followed up about a week later. Unfortunately, I have really deep hair follicles and really fast growing hair, so I didn&#x27;t get very good results. There was smoothness, sure, but it had to be repeated weekly to stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse yet, the hair that came back in was frequently ingrown. Yes, I exfoliate. That&#x27;s not the issue. Anything that pulls out hair just causes major problems for me with any amount of exfoliation. A couple skincare professionals have told me that&#x27;s just an unfortunate issue some people have, and the only real fix is laser hair removal. That&#x27;s what I moved on to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have issues with ingrown hairs after waxing (and you have a reasonable pain tolerance), this device could save you a lot of time and money. If waxing gives you ingrown hairs, though, I would recommend skipping this and looking into either salon laser treatments or a home laser device.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to work as well as the original, but it doesn&#x27;t.  It still eventually does the job so I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I still have to shave after using this product but it doesn&#x27;t take me as long and legs stay smoother longer.</li>
            <li> Powerful machine works well in tight areas&lt;br /&gt;And removes all hair on the first try def recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Price was very competitive.</li>
            <li> I had this epilator for about sex months now. I use it often, but always have to shave after. I&#x27;m a student and can&#x27;t afford another yet. THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs: Left a lot of hairs behind. I tried it with creams, after and before showers. Doesn&#x27;t work. Only picks up thick, long hair. Left a lot of ingrown hairs, after epilating my legs were never smooth and I always shaved after to achieve the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms: Works alright, simply cuts some of the hair and they grow out in a day.  Not very painful, but the pain is not worth the result. Pinches without the extra head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini: Doesn&#x27;t reach all the hairs properly, pinches without the extra head, but the head prevents it from getting all the hairs. Takes too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face: cuts the hairs off, making them grow out thicker and very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that if you are serious about getting an epilator, go elsewhere. It doesn&#x27;t do the job properly. It leaves a lot of hairs behind, it cuts hair instead of ripping them out. The epilated area doesn&#x27;t feel smooth. Left harsh bumps behind. It really is worth spending an extra buck for a good product. I am extremely disappointed. I&#x27;ll know better next time.</li>
            <li> After months of reading reviews from other people about Epilators,  I decided to take the plunge and purchase one.  Even before it arrived I was wondering if I had done the right thing as they are not cheap.  Well, it arrived and I gave it a test run. Like one of the reviews I read; I ran out of hair to remove!  I love the little thing!  I should have bought one years ago and saved all that money on waxing, razor blades, etc. It&#x27;s not very big either, so it&#x27;s easy to put in your bag for travelling.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does hurt a bit, you are after all, removing the hair from the root, but I found that the pain is an instant and momentary thing, unlike waxing where you get that stinging sensation for a while afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it&#x27;s another 4-6 weeks before I can play with it again!! Definitely should have bought one YEARS ago!!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and if you are like me and live on the other side of the world,  it came with an american plug so I had to buy an adaptor, which isn&#x27;t very much, but you need to be aware of that. Volts are 110-240, i found this information hard to read on the machine, so it&#x27;s now here for your info.</li>
            <li> This product is really good at removing body hair. It will tickle or hurt for some people in the beginning, but after a few times you get used to it. WARNING: Don&#x27;t use in nether regions, it felt like my vageegee was being ripped out of my body.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this product,but bought based on the number and quality of reviews.  Spot on reviews...it hurts at first, but that fades with continued use, and the product really does remove the hair from the root.  A small investment for a product that will eliminate shaving if used regularly.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for money!</li>
            <li> Can not be used on wet body.  Painful in the beginning and not fit for people with sensitive skin.  I would rather prefer an Epilator that can be used for both wet and dry...</li>
            <li> I swore off shaving 3-4 years ago, and started strictly waxing my body hair so it would grow back thinner, slower, etc. I love waxing, but since moving to Vermont I noted that waxing services (especially full leg) are SO EXPENSIVE. This little machine cost me about 1/3 the price of 1 leg wax, and I&#x27;ve had it for a year without any functional problems. It definitely feels a little bit uncomfy, especially if you let your hair get long, but its kind of expected for what it&#x27;s doing (pulling your hair out from the root).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this strictly on my legs, as I learned the hard way that using it on more sensitive and less taught skin (underarm, bikini) is NOT a good idea as the machine can grab your skin instead of the hairs-- super painful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this little gadget though-- like I said, it&#x27;s saved me so much money, and my leg hair grows back so much finer and slower than it ever has. I only use this about once avery two or three months, and even when my hair gets &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; it&#x27;s still barely noticeable because of how sparse and thin it is.</li>
            <li> I used this kind of product few months ago when i traveled outside the usa, it&#x27;s great thing to use!!!</li>
            <li> Does the job and color is nice.  Seems to be a real nice shaver.  I would have like a bigger shaving surface but happy with the proformance.</li>
            <li> I just got this today, and immediately tried it. I was already anticipating the pain it can cause since it was my first time to epilate my underarms. But it was surprisingly a painless experience! I love the massage rollers, and the little flashlight that&#x27;s very helpful to see if I missed a spot. And another great feature is the dual voltage, so I can use it whenever and wherever I&#x27;d travel.</li>
            <li> A must for any one with quick growth! Easy to use.. eventually becomes fairly painless. I use it on course hairs but works well in areas with fine hair too. Personally I remove the top attachment before use and it just becomes so much more effective! Pulls out even the shortest of hairs this way and I have never damaged my skin. I also think that any form of hair removal like waxing and epilation can distort the hair follicle so it is to be expected to have some ingrown hairs.. especially if your prone like me. Definitely exfoliate and moisturize on a regular basis that helps. Overall highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The product was good but when I opened the packet, it looked like it was already opened and used. I saw some hair in too.</li>
            <li> make the job, sadly it didn&#x27;t can with the little brush to clean afterwork. buy 1 year ago and still working. no problem at all, very good/cheap/helpful little thing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this at all. I used another Braun and that was much better. This is not worth it even if it was given to me for free ! It doesn&#x27;t remove any hair !!!!!!!</li>
