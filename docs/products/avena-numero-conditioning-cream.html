            <li>On the other hand, I saw diferrence on my hair the very first time I used Avena 2 Conditioning Cream.</li>
            <li>I was very upset when I recently ordered it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for coarse and unmanageable hair!</li>
            <li>My hair is very oily at the sculp and very dry at the end.</li>

            <li> Note: I have thick, naturally curly, color processed hair with alot of gray.</li>
            <li> I do this treatment as a once or twice a week hair mask that i&#x27;m applying on damp hair and leave for 15 minutes, then rinse with a little bit cooler</li>
            <li> Money is wasted.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and dry hair, but too dense hair masks or \\&quot;cholesterol\\&quot; products leave my hair either down,heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> so happy i could find it and order it on-line cos ive been searching for it everywhere ! great product ,makes my hair happy ! :))</li>
            <li> I bought it as I heard good reviews from girls. I like it a lot! My hair are nice, silky, shiny! The hair is not greasy, light and nice to touch! I am going to buy more! Want to try shampoo too.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my hair very soft. I have relaxed hair and use this product as a deep conditioner. I put it on and sit under the hairdryer for 15 minutes and then wash it out. My hair is very soft after blow-drying. I would highly recommend this product for coarse and unmanageable hair!</li>
            <li> I bought it Because my friend advised me, she grew a long hair thank you to the product. My hair became better from the first use.     I am looking forward to great long strong hair of mine</li>
            <li> Excelent product for the hair.</li>
            <li> Fisrt time I bought this product in Italy. It works great! My hair is very oily at the sculp and very dry at the end. This mask treated my hair completelly! I love it!</li>
            <li> I uses for a hair reapair so person who I give this product is very happy with it, I works favolous</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost 10 years now. Got to know it while living in Europe and was really glad to find out that it is available for purchase here. I do this treatment as a once or twice a week hair mask that i&#x27;m applying on damp hair and leave for 15 minutes, then rinse with a little bit cooler water.&lt;br /&gt;I feel my hair stronger, fuller after this treatment, I don&#x27;t know if it is because of Numero or not but i have no split ends and never have problems combing. If i wouldn&#x27;t be able to buy it i&#x27;d have to go through search horror again (i&#x27;ve spent so much money before i found the hair mask that is effective and won&#x27;t make your hair look greasy on the second day). I especially need it every summer when my hair gets dry due to the sun and sea salt after swimming.</li>
            <li> nice product , I love it</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioning treatment ever! Beats Moroccanoil! Leaves my hair smooth and silky, eliminates frizz without killing the volume. I have used it back in Europe and after trying a lot of other products here, Im very happy I have found it on Amazon :)</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me years ago and  I have been using it since then.  Avena Numero 2 really leaves my hair hydratated without feeling it down or heavy. I can either blow dry or do rollers set and my hair always feels soft, bouncy and manageable. I have very thick and dry hair, but too dense hair masks or \\&quot;cholesterol\\&quot; products leave my hair either down,heavy or greasy. During my last purshase I also bought the Shampoo (Avena 1) to give it a try by using them both together, but I did not see or feel any difference after using the shampoo. On the other hand, I saw diferrence on my hair the very first time I used Avena 2 Conditioning Cream. Therefore, if you are looking for a good quality hydratating product Avena 2 Conditioning Cream might work for you.</li>
            <li> I did not like this hair conditioning cream at all. The ingredients and the smell is horrible and cheap and it does not make my hair smooth or shiny. I would compare it to the cheapest pharmacy brand. Money is wasted. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product at a salon more than 10 years ago. They applied it as a deep conditioner after my shampoo for about 30 minutes.  Wow, I was sold! Not only does it feel amazing when you rinse it out, the smell is so delicious and fresh, not flowery or overpowering.  When you first put it in the palm of your hands, you can feel the silicone-like texture, but it isn&#x27;t at all heavy. Only Biolage Balm comes close, but this works so much better. Note: I have thick, naturally curly, color processed hair with alot of gray. I blow-out and flat iron my hair constantly, so I need a conditioner that really, really, works and Avena No 2 is it. I have been using it loyally for over 10 years, probably closer to 14-15 years. I highly recommend it. Take the leap of faith and try it.  Wash and rinse your hair, squeeze it dry, then apply about a heaping tablespoonful or two depending on the thickness or length of your hair. I put on a shower cap and wrap my head in a towel.  I then go about my business and leave it it sometimes for an hour.  The transformation is nothing short of miraculous.  I also put a tablespoonful into my hair color before applying and it does help the color absorb more evenly.  Try this product.  Won&#x27;t be disappointed.  You can also use it as a skin conditioner.  They did so at the salon.  Great on your heels overnight with a pair of socks.</li>
            <li> Best conditioning cream for ever!</li>
            <li> I can not get enough, I have tried so many expensive treatments and I still keep coming back to this conditioner. It&#x27;s just the perfect match for my combination hair.  2/21/17 Update:  While this conditioner has been my favorite for years, I am very sad to say, the formula has been changed. It&#x27;s very liquid now, and doesn&#x27;t have the pleasant scent it used to have. I was very upset when I recently ordered it. Even contemplated sending it back.</li>
            <li> NEVER buy when I bought this item it never even came do not buy ever they will steal your money</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! My hair salon always uses this product.  I was so happy to be able to find it and have it for personal use!!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. Can&#x27;t seem to find this product any longer....</li>
            <li> Makes your hair super soft.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser reccomended this item and it works great. I have dry curly hair and this product leaves it soft, shiny and easy to manage.</li>
