            <li>If you want a great hair dryer for cheap</li>

            <li>This works amazing.</li>

            <li>I recommend for anyone who wants a great, affordable lighter dryer that has concentrated heat!</li>
            <li>It does seem to make your hair nice and silky.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice dryer.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair looking nice.</li>
            <li>Nice hair dryer.  </li>

            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry that it will develop its own ideas of where to settle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good power, comfortable to use!</li>
            <li>for  any kind of dryer,  (Dryers are dryers.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer has a lot of nice features.  </li>
            <li>I liked this dryer ...</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this hair dryer &amp; I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>This is a sturdy, sleek dryer, with great heat, power, and cool blast button for setting your style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So when you drying your hair,  it is very easy to change the setting of the dryer by accident.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today was bath day for my very furry, very beloved Duncan dog.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a comfortable dryer and feels good in the hand without fatiguing it, despite the weight.</li>
            <li>Easy to regulate the temperature and the unit has great fit and finish.  </li>
            <li>It blows strong and warm and does a nice job of styling.  </li>
            <li>Excellent seller, good product, was exactly what I ordered, arrived on schedule with no problems and works perfectly, thanks</li>
            <li>Very good high quality</li>
            <li>but I think it is because it is better constructed.  </li>
            <li>and it was her favorite until now.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure as I will</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure is what most of us need and want</li>
            <li>and I feel this baby has just got too many functions to be practical.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We like this stylish Remington Hair Dryer.  </li>
            <li>These are way better than the one I was using before from Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing to see a manufacturer with confidence in their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dryer is actually and excellent value for what it is being sold for on Amazon (about $28).  </li>
            <li>the faster it can get done the better.</li>
            <li>the faster it can get done the better.</li>
            <li>After reading many magazine reviews, this hairdryer had a spot in the top 10 hairdryers (and it&#x27;s affordable).</li>
            <li>Okay overall I love the feel of the blow dryer in my hand, the handle is awesome.  </li>
            <li>It has a button to choose the heat level 3, this machine better than I&#x27;ve ever used, I like it.</li>
            <li>I decided to upgrade my hair dryer and read many reviews before selecting this one.  </li>
            <li>So I trimmed and tidied and clipped his hobbit-y hairy toes a bit and bathed him with his favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s glad, too and makes sure that I know it every day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked ok at the  beginning</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s an OK trade-off.</li>
            <li>It has many buttons.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t pinpoint why this one works better in lightening speed....</li>
            <li>but I am uesd to it now and love the blow dryer</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer but it pulled so much amps</li>
            <li>I was expecting something better</li>
            <li>glad that I selected this hair dryer, and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My non-ionic hair dryers from the 1980&#x27;s were better.</li>
            <li>Has a very concentrated nozzle but great pressure.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough have awesome</li>
            <li>love it wish it had a comb for naturals</li>
            <li>They seem to always be my favorite hair dryers.</li>
            <li>and I am as pleased as can be.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews; but this hair dryer is the absolute best that I have ever owned and very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>After a couple days of that I was VERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily, I purchased this on a very special Amazon Deal, but truthfully I will just keep this one as a spare.</li>
            <li>Nice dryer, quieter than most and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Best blow dryer i have purchased in a long time</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure where I wanted to store the dryer, so I temporarily rested in inside the strong box it comes in and tucked the box in my linen closet between a stack of towels and the wall.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because most of the reviewers received it for free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast at drying my hair and good for styling.</li>
            <li>The cover does come off easily for</li>
            <li>Controls are easy to access and use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and if it didn&#x27;t suck my hair into the motor, it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Users can easily decide which one to use for their hair type and their desired hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is exactly as advertised and is nice to use.  </li>
            <li>Got rid of all my fizz and love how you can set an area with the push of the cool button</li>
            <li>Nice velocity and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  </li>
            <li>It certainly works okay, but !&lt;</li>
            <li>I think It&#x27;s a good product, It leaves your hair soft and it dries it easily, It fullfiled my expectations.</li>
            <li>Light weight and not overly bulky</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used the concentrator, and it fits securely and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to separate the prongs more, without success.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>We now own two of these we like them so much.  </li>
            <li>Even the ones I tried with a diffuser did not leave me with the smooth curly look I wanted.</li>
            <li>If it lasts longer than my last two blow dryers, then I&#x27;ll be really happy.</li>
            <li>Present for my wife, works well, great quality for its price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having used this for the last couple of weeks, I have to say how happy I am with it.</li>
            <li>I find when I am drying my hair, I don&#x27;t need to straighten my hair afterwards because my hair looks nice and straight.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great hairdryer</li>
            <li>It feels light and airy like it does when I leave my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>Great hairdryer and very quiet!</li>
            <li>Good dryer, has held up well so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t quite produce the airflow of my old model, but it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>I like the three speeds, the hot, warm and cool.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good replacement for my old Remington hair dryer</li>
            <li>I found one to be quite hot, one warm, and one cool.  </li>
            <li>The good: powerful, fast drying that leaves hair feeling good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I jokingly told someone I was about to use my brand new hair dryer for the first time and that it was guaranteed to give me perfect hair that was magazine cover photo ready...</li>
            <li>Works just as well as the much more exspensive versions and comes with a great warranty when compared to other products.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>It is relatively quiet, the design is very nice -</li>
            <li>Light to hold and is powerful!</li>
            <li>The hot feels like more of a medium setting to me</li>
            <li>ERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This dryer is powerful!  </li>
            <li>it been cheaper, I would have rated it higher or more favorably.&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth it if it turns to junk this soon!</li>
            <li>Most surprisingly - a 4 year limited warranty against defects!  </li>
            <li>so you can clean it out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked so well that I&#x27;m still using it, but it&#x27;s a nice looking dryer, and I would display it if my bathroom were larger and had more wall space.</li>
            <li>It has some interesting and useful bells and whistles (two speeds, three temperature settings, and some useful</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was admittedly more interested in how this Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer would work for my dog than how it would work for my own hair, and frankly didn&#x27;t even intend to try it.</li>
            <li>She says her hair hasn&#x27;t been this healthy in a while, also it dries her hair super fast!  </li>
            <li>Great Dryer and a long cord too!!</li>
            <li>I have to travel to countries where we have 220Volt power supply and I purchased a special voltage converter for hair dryers only.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The switches make the heat easy to adjust, making it good for drying a pet (I try to not use heat to dry my dog).  </li>
            <li>So far this hair dryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li>speed, cool and</li>
            <li>It provides a good flow of air and has 3 different heat settings and speed settings.</li>
            <li>Cool shot feature which User Guide indicates is used to set style</li>
            <li>Remington suggests &#x27;locking in the style&#x27; with a blast of cool air.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good unit.</li>
            <li>Overall good design</li>
            <li>you are looking for a moderately priced hair dryer, this one is good to consider.</li>
            <li>I like the cool burst.  </li>
            <li>I do have to add that most of the recommended hair dryers were priced well over $50 which just seems like too much to me.  </li>
            <li>This is a powerful, light hairdryer</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that it did a nice job.</li>
            <li>do like the three heat settings, two air speeds and the cool shot of air, which can be used while drying.</li>
            <li>Love how fast it dries my hair and leaves my hair with a shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a cool temp before</li>
            <li>hairdryer has a lot of power, which is great for getting your hair from wet to damp quickly.</li>
            <li>I love it because it dries my hair super fast</li>
            <li>It dries hair quickly, has three temperature buttons and even a cool shot button</li>
            <li>Ouch, my scalp is burning (I never use this setting because my hair is fine and it&#x27;s way too hot for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She says that it makes her hair look a lot better than her much older dryer.</li>
            <li>but in comparison with an older dryer I had, it does feels like it weighs more.</li>
            <li>It wraps up quick and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A couple of the things she has mentioned are how quickly it dries her hair in just seconds</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li>but this hair dryer has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>first I couldn&#x27;t figure out why there are so many positive reviews on this item.</li>
            <li>And the cool shot is powerful as well.</li>
            <li>, this hair dryer has a nice handle that is easy to grip and use when you have to dry hair for awhile.</li>
            <li>Good, steady product so far.  </li>
            <li>Definitely less frizz and fly always.  </li>
            <li>It is a little heavier than a normal hair dryer, but I love it!!!</li>
            <li>However, a major design flaw (in my opinion)warranted a return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch as well as the temp switches are not sliders, but very easy to press switches.  </li>
            <li>Love that it comes with concentrator and diffuser as I use both since I have naturally curly curly hair!</li>
            <li>We all have straight, fine hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>My previous hairdryer, another brand of ionic with 1875 watts, did a good job but rarely was my hair as shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love how quickly it drys my thick hair, it&#x27;s great for blowouts, and thanks to the accompanying accessories you can choose precision for blowouts or diffusing for curls, waves, and scrunching.</li>
            <li>It comes with a diffuser for ease in creating curls and a concentrator to encourage smooth straight flow.  </li>
            <li>so far it works perfect, didnt have any trouble with my hair getting sucked in</li>
            <li>If you want a powerful blow dryer, this is the one for you..</li>
            <li>The blowers&#x27; buttons are set in well and do not feel flimsy, nor are the useful, but goofy-looking attachments.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy how light it is, not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>this is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>Both are 1875 watts and equally powerful; the Revlon is easier to hold.  </li>
            <li>Useful settings and attachments</li>
            <li>The medium is so powerful</li>
            <li>The different speed and heat settings are so nice (2 speeds, 3 heat settings).</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it .</li>
            <li>...medium was too cool and hot</li>
            <li>The Remington AC9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use a lot of the cool setting on it  ..</li>
            <li>but they come in handy for those with long strands that need to isolate and concentrate the air.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m a balding middle-aged man, the primary user for this new hair dryer is my wife.</li>
            <li>I like the rocker power switch location in the \\&quot;neck\\&quot; of the dryer, as it&#x27;s easy to control with my thumb, unlike my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Instructions may not seem important to some people, but the instructions for this dryer are very clear.  </li>
            <li>I loved the narrow flow on this dryer, and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>This in take is larger for more air flow</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s intended to last 4 years!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Remington!</li>
            <li>The ion generator helps reduce static while drying hair and it works well enough.</li>
            <li>, many will go back to their lighter and simpler to use unit.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>short fine hair dries quickly on the lower settings</li>
            <li>For the price, the Remington hair dryer works pretty well for</li>
            <li>It is okay, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy the same model again.</li>
            <li>I panicked since I was getting married in a week</li>
            <li>My last dryer I love and had for 20 years.  </li>
            <li>First of all I like the design of this product and the quality w.r.t performance and functionality.</li>
            <li>I tried holding it different ways, and I was able to when drying certain areas of my head, but there is just no avoiding having to hold it right where the switches are.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was it&#x27;s weight.</li>
            <li>Options for speeds &amp; options for heat settings - exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this hair dryer overall.  </li>
            <li>I love the different settings on this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It does also leave my hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this and will update later if need be because I JUST received it in the mail today.</li>
            <li>Does get as hot  as I would like.</li>
            <li>was too hot.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Hair dryer works great, easy to use, but it&#x27;s heavy on the arm when carrying long.</li>
            <li>When my hair dryer arrived, the first thing I noticed was that it had a good heft; it was slightly heavy, but not too much so, indicative of quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have ultra sensitive hair follicles and wish to avoid hair pulling, you should avoid this Remington dryer as the Conair will do the job nearly as well without the hair-pulling issues, but with a bit more noise.</li>
            <li>The cool air button provides instant cool air.</li>
            <li>I pulled out the nice quiet Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer, and popped on the diffuser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once, so I don&#x27;t know if it was a fluke or my imagination, but my hair does seem particularly nice and soft</li>
            <li>Turn it up to full blast though and it&#x27;s as hot as any professional hair dryer my hair dresser</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying they were coerced to give positive reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**One thing I really like about this hair dryer is that no matter what setting you&#x27;re using, even if it&#x27;s the hottest setting, the dryer itself does not get hot to the touch and remains cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries hair very quickly and has different levels of speed and heat.</li>
            <li>The back pops off easily for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Strong and powerful, however, it&#x27;s a little too powerful for me.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a light dryer and this one works, it&#x27;s not super light</li>
            <li>With this new dryer I can easily change a setting and I find it easy to keep my fingers slightly to the side of the controls to avoid accidentally making changes.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully but just a little heavy.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed a bit large and a bit too heavy, but we&#x27;ve come to appreciate its durability and apparent good build quality.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is also pretty quiet, it doesn&#x27;t have that loud high pitched noise like most dryers do.</li>
            <li>If I had a straight pronged hook, it&#x27;d not be a problem.</li>
            <li>The 2 attachments don&#x27;t &amp;#34;attach&amp;#34; very well, but I don&#x27;t use them much anyway.</li>
            <li>very quickly)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries hair fast</li>
            <li>Would highly reccommend!</li>
            <li>My hair dries silky &amp; straight just how I like it.</li>
            <li>Of course, with naturally curly hair, getting what you want is rarely an option, you learn to like what you get for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>dries my hair so fast with no knots</li>
            <li>Very displeased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Powerful and not too loud</li>
            <li>To much noise but does the work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two speeds: medium and fast.  </li>
            <li>This is what I use to make my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>Drys my hair really fast</li>
            <li>This sleek hair dryer really packs a punch.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy another one tomorrow if this one broke.</li>
            <li>in fact it smooths it really well and gives me that just went to the salon look.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this without much research, so I am to blame for not &amp;#34;loving&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see that it makes my hair that much smoother</li>
            <li>It has not been damaged at all, it&#x27;s not dusty inside, nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>she said her hair dries so much quicker and smoother.</li>
            <li>The diffuser and the \\&quot;narrow concentrator\\&quot; come with the dryer and should be useful for many people</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t really tell you if the ion action is working, because I don&#x27;t have any way to really tell, but it gets my hair dry quickly with lots of volume and it feels fairly smooth when I&#x27;m done, even when I don&#x27;t use a brush to blow it out.</li>
            <li>They are right where your fingers wrap around and hold on, and unfortunately my natural grip keeps changing the settings while drying.</li>
            <li>As noted by others, the screen does clean easily and the whole device feels well-made and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Lite weight, easy too handle, and  dry fast.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased that there wasn&#x27;t one piece when I went to straighten it that sizzled by still being wet!</li>
            <li>Way better quality than I expected for the price!</li>
            <li>I can dry my hair very quickly with this dryer using a large round brush and the end result is soft, smooth, shiny, frizz-free hair that stays frizz free even when I am outdoors.  </li>
            <li>and it is plenty warm enough to dry my hair</li>
            <li>I use it on medium temperature and high speed and my shoulder-length hair, which is also straight and fine, can go from soaking-wet-out-of-the-shower to dry in about 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a hairdryer that would complete the first 50% of hair drying quickly, but then allow me to use a lower speed with my round brush to get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>(but that model is no longer available), so I got her this one based on other positive reviews, and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>The Remington Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer does exactly what it promises:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this hair dryer has proven to be a quality product - I really like it!</li>
            <li>I notice the weight of it when I pick it up and it feels heavy in my hand, but the ergonomic shape of the handle allows me to hold it right near the top</li>
            <li>but she likes how this dryer has given her some body, more than her previous device had.  </li>
            <li>He was dry and comfortable in no time.</li>
            <li>In order to give it a fair trial, we used the diffuser and dried my granddaughter&#x27;s waist length curly red hair.</li>
            <li>I was in a super big hurry and tried this out before reading the directions and without my bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li>Next time I tried it I made sure to read the directions thoroughly and use the mirror to get used to the air intake in the back.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend $150-$200, but I did want something decent.</li>
            <li>Duncan is an older fella and a rescue.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It was really highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>(and the fact that it&#x27;s a bit heavy and unbalanced), this hairdryer yields very smooth results.</li>
            <li>If this dryer had a third, lower speed setting, or if the low speed setting had 30% less power, this would be a GREAT hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, which I wear naturally.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a few different settings too -- Great addition to any household, especially with a lot of girls!</li>
            <li>Otherwise great dryer, just be wary of the rear vent.</li>
            <li>This is unfortunate because I think otherwise this was a great dryer.</li>
            <li>but it is also packed with features that really make my old hair dryer seem like something out of the</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t understand how some say they get their long hair stuck at the intake in the back of the blow dryer because most women do not have knee length hair</li>
            <li>The one minor complaint I have is that the hot setting didn&#x27;t feel as hot as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t normally use those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, for the drying performance, it&#x27;s worth the occasional inconvenience.</li>
            <li>Difficulty cleaning is better than the heavy weight.</li>
            <li>, how quiet it is while in use, and how fresh her hair feels after each use.</li>
            <li>And a fun red, sparkly color too!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be very nosy because I&#x27;ve never had a home hair dryer that wasn&#x27;t; however, it was actually pretty quiet for a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whole reason I bought a new dryer is that my really old dryer died, I had a spare hanging around the house that I started to use, but it has slider controls</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the results are great, I don&#x27;t want to be forced to modify how I dry my hair in order to avoid it being yanked out.</li>
            <li>As far as the ceramic/ionic nature of the dryer, I&#x27;m not fully sure how this works with a blow dryer since it doesn&#x27;t actually touch the hair like a flat iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My thick, rather porous hair dries slightly more quickly with this dryer than my old one; even a little difference can be important to a user in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair does feel nice after I dry it, and if I&#x27;m planning to curl or flat iron after drying then I really appreciate how fast I can get my hair dry.</li>
            <li>So this beautiful looking piece is no more good for me :(</li>
            <li>I needed a new hair dryer as my girlfriend borrowed my BaByliss Pro TT.  </li>
            <li>and now I need to purchase another new hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very soft and no frizz.</li>
            <li>The one item worth noting is that the Remington is about a quarter pound heavier than the BaByliss which may be an issue if you use it for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy, loud and I prefer more ranges in heat than it offers.  </li>
            <li>(I got the Remington when my Vidal Sassoon stopped working on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; and would only work on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>Fine for my short hair, but not for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li>If you always flat iron or curl after drying, or if you don&#x27;t care about style and just want to get your hair dry fast, or (maybe) if you have really thick strands, this could be a great dryer.</li>
            <li>hair does feel quite smooth and seems to be less heat damaged from my drying, though I think time will tell if this hair dryer is truly \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews that said this dryer was good for long thick curly hair</li>
            <li>The screen on the back has holes that are large enough for dry hair to suck in relatively easily if it comes close to the intake, whereas the Conair mesh intake cover prevents that; however, the dryer can be set to a lower speed to reduce the sucking, plus, over time my wife has learned how to position the dryer to prevent this.</li>
            <li>I love the various settings which allows for less frizz.  </li>
            <li>It does have multiple heat and power settings, but I&#x27;m mostly a high heat, high power girl, so that&#x27;s all I use.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if mine just doesn&#x27;t fit well, but that was a little annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very powerful, sturdy, leaves hair soft, dries quickly, not too loud, and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>Still, this is not a bad dryer, it&#x27;s just not right for her.</li>
            <li>Amazingly this Remington model has nearly the same features and design as the Conair; same wattage, same switch arrangement (albeit, one is reversed), same fast motor, same heat settings, and the same weight.</li>
            <li>i just a bonus as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know anything about ionic properties, especially in a hair dryer, but I really like this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Below are her thoughts regarding the &amp;#34;Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair</li>
            <li>(Okay, i picked it out, but he hasn&#x27;t complained )</li>
            <li>/&gt;It IS stronger than my old dryer</li>
            <li>My 5 year old dryer caught fire .</li>
            <li>so having this &#x27;Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer&#x27; has been a dream.</li>
            <li>three setting for hair drying (just like my old</li>
            <li>must faster then my old one&lt;br /&gt;-Two</li>
            <li>My old dryer weight was like nothing in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It comes with a concentrator and a diffuser for straight hair and curly hair, respectively.  </li>
            <li>I was quite surprised when this happened, as others said there was no screen on the hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>In addtion, there are 3 heat settings so if your scalp is sensitive to heat, you have the option of lower heat.</li>
            <li>The problem is that this hairdryer has too much power on the low speed for a polished set and</li>
            <li>This dryer just has too much power going to it at the low speed setting, which means I get lots of flyaways.</li>
            <li>As it is, I break out my old Vidal Sassoon 1875 to finish the style</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels soft and shines.</li>
            <li>I hope this dryer has as long a life as my old one because I REALLY like it!</li>
            <li>the Conair Infinity and Remington Silk, the weight and heat are virtually the same, but the Remington has faster airflow (nozzle is smaller, which concentrates the flow) to push through heavy, wet hair better, and it&#x27;s quieter with significantly lower high-frequency noise.</li>
            <li>Right?), and coming up empty</li>
            <li>Mine is 6-7&amp;#34; long in places, so this dryer will most likely go back to the store where it was purchased (at the same price as online here).</li>
            <li>Everything works as it should and it puts out a bunch of air and cools down quickly when you are through using it.  </li>
            <li>Typical hair dryers are loud, not so with this Remington Silk Ceramic Dryer, and my sensitive eared golden retriever is the proof.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first ceramic styling tool, and I&#x27;ve found that my hair is silky without frizz and quickly dried every time, so ceramic really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely heavier than the average cheap blow dryer</li>
            <li>: It has two speed settings, high and low.</li>
            <li>Also I kept hitting the power button moving it from high to low</li>
            <li>right side up, upside down, my hair never got near the back of the dryer, and there is a decent screen over the intake anyways,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mid-sized, so if you&#x27;re wanting something light and small, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>but I had to try them both back to back to convince myself, the difference is not dramatic.</li>
            <li>And finding a good hairdryer that will dry long, thick hair is a quest of our&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>so it takes a while to get that much hair to dry, but this hair dryer does so with ease.</li>
            <li>It did dry my hair faster but not by much.</li>
            <li>After a few quick looks around my rural&lt;br /&gt;town</li>
            <li>It dries hair quickly but is quite heavy.</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;d stuck my finger in an electrical socket (even with their ion promises) and took a good 10-15 minutes to get my shoulder length medium thick hair dried.</li>
            <li>Curly hair sure can take time to dry and this one does not make your arm or grip ache, due to the long use.</li>
            <li>This is like no other dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>(my hold one would give me major frizz)&lt;br /&gt;-Also</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not heavy for most users but may be a factor for those drying thick and/or long hair and those with arthritis.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a professional AC motor that provides 40% faster airflow than standard hair dryers, meaning your hair will dry much quicker than you&#x27;d imagine.</li>
            <li>The back is a little heavy, but great other than that.</li>
            <li>major disadvantage that I&#x27;ve encountered so far may apply only to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like having two speeds and three temps that operate independently, so you can have high heat and low fan if you want, or vice versa.</li>
            <li>It is heavier than my previous one, but I think this is due to the quality of the motor which I am hoping does in fact help this hair dryer to last longer than most.  </li>
            <li>My faithful old hair dryer blew out its last breath and this one has taken its place.</li>
            <li>* Much quieter than I expected and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old hair dryer is on its last leg</li>
            <li>I particularly like that it has three heat settings, as I prefer cooler air when I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>Cold button a good feature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with two attachments:  1)the nozzle that directs the air flow in a small space, which is great for styling by running the nozzle down a shaft of hair on a round brush.  </li>
            <li>Also my old dryer&#x27;s motor sounds pretty cheap and sick after the hum of this one, but I don&#x27;t find much difference in loudness or tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With 3 heat settings (none of which are as hot as my old one)and 2 speeds, this dryer makes short work of drying my  medium length slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed that several other reviewers had trouble with getting their hair stuck in the rear vent, I have long hair and have yet to have this problem, but I do agree that a cap of some sort would be nice to prevent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too heavy to easily move around quickly and thus is sometimes pretty awkward.</li>
            <li>Normally it takes quite a while to dry my hair</li>
            <li>I previously had a ConAir and in comparison I think this one is of higher quality.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer works better than other blow dryers in the past, in that it is quieter.</li>
            <li>and if my hair ended up a little more wild than usual, so be it.</li>
            <li>Using the same brush, same hair product, and same technique I&#x27;ve always used, this dryer got my hair fully dried, smooth, and silky in approx.</li>
            <li>no frizz leaves hair soft and manageable before I comb it to flat iron it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to be critical of something you got for free.</li>
            <li>My only minor quibble is that I wish you didn&#x27;t have to hold down the cool shot button to use it.  </li>
            <li>but it does not dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>However, it is way too heavy to hold for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I definitely scored some major brownie points with this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maintenance is easier than with many other hair dryers; the small screen in the back comes off for cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly grey hair.</li>
            <li>have complained that their hair gets sucked into the dryer, and that is certainly true.</li>
            <li>you need lots of power to dry thick, long hair, then the Remington and the Conair are better choices than a lower wattage dryer.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and this baby gets my hair dry quickly and WITHOUT frizzies!</li>
            <li>I previously had a $150 professional grade dryer (5 years, and it finally died), and I did some research prior to buying a new one to see if I could save that expense.</li>
            <li>the the plug is frequently falling out of the outlet, as in several times during one blow dry session.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO very upset that this dryer didn&#x27;t even last a month when my previous dryer lasted for 10 YEARS.</li>

            <li> If you want a great hair dryer for cheap</li>

            <li> This works amazing.</li>
            <li> It is excellent for drying curly hair, which needs intense heat in one area.</li>
            <li> I recommend for anyone who wants a great, affordable lighter dryer that has concentrated heat!</li>
            <li> It does seem to make your hair nice and silky.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice dryer.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair looking nice.</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Nice cranberry color.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry that it will develop its own ideas of where to settle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good power, comfortable to use!</li>
            <li> for  any kind of dryer,  (Dryers are dryers.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has a lot of nice features.  </li>
            <li> I liked this dryer ...</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this hair dryer &amp; I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy, sleek dryer, with great heat, power, and cool blast button for setting your style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So when you drying your hair,  it is very easy to change the setting of the dryer by accident.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today was bath day for my very furry, very beloved Duncan dog.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comfortable dryer and feels good in the hand without fatiguing it, despite the weight.</li>
            <li> Easy to regulate the temperature and the unit has great fit and finish.  </li>
            <li> It blows strong and warm and does a nice job of styling.  </li>
            <li> Excellent seller, good product, was exactly what I ordered, arrived on schedule with no problems and works perfectly, thanks</li>
            <li> Very good high quality</li>
            <li> but I think it is because it is better constructed.  </li>
            <li> and it was her favorite until now.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure as I will</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure is what most of us need and want</li>
            <li> and I feel this baby has just got too many functions to be practical.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We like this stylish Remington Hair Dryer.  </li>
            <li> These are way better than the one I was using before from Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing to see a manufacturer with confidence in their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This dryer is actually and excellent value for what it is being sold for on Amazon (about $28).  </li>
            <li> the faster it can get done the better.</li>
            <li> the faster it can get done the better.</li>
            <li> After reading many magazine reviews, this hairdryer had a spot in the top 10 hairdryers (and it&#x27;s affordable).</li>
            <li> Okay overall I love the feel of the blow dryer in my hand, the handle is awesome.  </li>
            <li> It has a button to choose the heat level 3, this machine better than I&#x27;ve ever used, I like it.</li>
            <li> I decided to upgrade my hair dryer and read many reviews before selecting this one.  </li>
            <li> So I trimmed and tidied and clipped his hobbit-y hairy toes a bit and bathed him with his favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s glad, too and makes sure that I know it every day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked ok at the  beginning</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s an OK trade-off.</li>
            <li> It has many buttons.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pinpoint why this one works better in lightening speed....</li>
            <li> but I am uesd to it now and love the blow dryer</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer but it pulled so much amps</li>
            <li> I was expecting something better</li>
            <li> glad that I selected this hair dryer, and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My non-ionic hair dryers from the 1980&#x27;s were better.</li>
            <li> Has a very concentrated nozzle but great pressure.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough have awesome</li>
            <li> love it wish it had a comb for naturals</li>
            <li> They seem to always be my favorite hair dryers.</li>
            <li> and I am as pleased as can be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews; but this hair dryer is the absolute best that I have ever owned and very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> After a couple days of that I was VERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily, I purchased this on a very special Amazon Deal, but truthfully I will just keep this one as a spare.</li>
            <li> Nice dryer, quieter than most and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer i have purchased in a long time</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure where I wanted to store the dryer, so I temporarily rested in inside the strong box it comes in and tucked the box in my linen closet between a stack of towels and the wall.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because most of the reviewers received it for free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast at drying my hair and good for styling.</li>
            <li> The cover does come off easily for</li>
            <li> Controls are easy to access and use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and if it didn&#x27;t suck my hair into the motor, it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Users can easily decide which one to use for their hair type and their desired hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is exactly as advertised and is nice to use.  </li>
            <li> Got rid of all my fizz and love how you can set an area with the push of the cool button</li>
            <li> Nice velocity and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  </li>
            <li> It certainly works okay, but !&lt;</li>
            <li> I think It&#x27;s a good product, It leaves your hair soft and it dries it easily, It fullfiled my expectations.</li>
            <li> Light weight and not overly bulky</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used the concentrator, and it fits securely and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to separate the prongs more, without success.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> We now own two of these we like them so much.  </li>
            <li> Even the ones I tried with a diffuser did not leave me with the smooth curly look I wanted.</li>
            <li> If it lasts longer than my last two blow dryers, then I&#x27;ll be really happy.</li>
            <li> Present for my wife, works well, great quality for its price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used this for the last couple of weeks, I have to say how happy I am with it.</li>
            <li> I find when I am drying my hair, I don&#x27;t need to straighten my hair afterwards because my hair looks nice and straight.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great hairdryer</li>
            <li> It feels light and airy like it does when I leave my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer and very quiet!</li>
            <li> Good dryer, has held up well so far.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite produce the airflow of my old model, but it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> I like the three speeds, the hot, warm and cool.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good replacement for my old Remington hair dryer</li>
            <li> I found one to be quite hot, one warm, and one cool.  </li>
            <li> The good: powerful, fast drying that leaves hair feeling good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I jokingly told someone I was about to use my brand new hair dryer for the first time and that it was guaranteed to give me perfect hair that was magazine cover photo ready...</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the much more exspensive versions and comes with a great warranty when compared to other products.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> It is relatively quiet, the design is very nice -</li>
            <li> Light to hold and is powerful!</li>
            <li> The hot feels like more of a medium setting to me</li>
            <li> ERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer is powerful!  </li>
            <li> it been cheaper, I would have rated it higher or more favorably.&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth it if it turns to junk this soon!</li>
            <li> Most surprisingly - a 4 year limited warranty against defects!  </li>
            <li> so you can clean it out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked so well that I&#x27;m still using it, but it&#x27;s a nice looking dryer, and I would display it if my bathroom were larger and had more wall space.</li>
            <li> It has some interesting and useful bells and whistles (two speeds, three temperature settings, and some useful</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was admittedly more interested in how this Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer would work for my dog than how it would work for my own hair, and frankly didn&#x27;t even intend to try it.</li>
            <li> She says her hair hasn&#x27;t been this healthy in a while, also it dries her hair super fast!  </li>
            <li> Great Dryer and a long cord too!!</li>
            <li> I have to travel to countries where we have 220Volt power supply and I purchased a special voltage converter for hair dryers only.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The switches make the heat easy to adjust, making it good for drying a pet (I try to not use heat to dry my dog).  </li>
            <li> So far this hair dryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li> speed, cool and</li>
            <li> It provides a good flow of air and has 3 different heat settings and speed settings.</li>
            <li> Cool shot feature which User Guide indicates is used to set style</li>
            <li> Remington suggests &#x27;locking in the style&#x27; with a blast of cool air.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good unit.</li>
            <li> Overall good design</li>
            <li> you are looking for a moderately priced hair dryer, this one is good to consider.</li>
            <li> I like the cool burst.  </li>
            <li> I do have to add that most of the recommended hair dryers were priced well over $50 which just seems like too much to me.  </li>
            <li> This is a powerful, light hairdryer</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that it did a nice job.</li>
            <li> do like the three heat settings, two air speeds and the cool shot of air, which can be used while drying.</li>
            <li> Love how fast it dries my hair and leaves my hair with a shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a cool temp before</li>
            <li> hairdryer has a lot of power, which is great for getting your hair from wet to damp quickly.</li>
            <li> I love it because it dries my hair super fast</li>
            <li> It dries hair quickly, has three temperature buttons and even a cool shot button</li>
            <li> Ouch, my scalp is burning (I never use this setting because my hair is fine and it&#x27;s way too hot for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She says that it makes her hair look a lot better than her much older dryer.</li>
            <li> but in comparison with an older dryer I had, it does feels like it weighs more.</li>
            <li> It wraps up quick and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A couple of the things she has mentioned are how quickly it dries her hair in just seconds</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> but this hair dryer has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> first I couldn&#x27;t figure out why there are so many positive reviews on this item.</li>
            <li> And the cool shot is powerful as well.</li>
            <li> , this hair dryer has a nice handle that is easy to grip and use when you have to dry hair for awhile.</li>
            <li> Good, steady product so far.  </li>
            <li> Definitely less frizz and fly always.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than a normal hair dryer, but I love it!!!</li>
            <li> However, a major design flaw (in my opinion)warranted a return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch as well as the temp switches are not sliders, but very easy to press switches.  </li>
            <li> Love that it comes with concentrator and diffuser as I use both since I have naturally curly curly hair!</li>
            <li> We all have straight, fine hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> My previous hairdryer, another brand of ionic with 1875 watts, did a good job but rarely was my hair as shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love how quickly it drys my thick hair, it&#x27;s great for blowouts, and thanks to the accompanying accessories you can choose precision for blowouts or diffusing for curls, waves, and scrunching.</li>
            <li> It comes with a diffuser for ease in creating curls and a concentrator to encourage smooth straight flow.  </li>
            <li> so far it works perfect, didnt have any trouble with my hair getting sucked in</li>
            <li> If you want a powerful blow dryer, this is the one for you..</li>
            <li> The blowers&#x27; buttons are set in well and do not feel flimsy, nor are the useful, but goofy-looking attachments.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy how light it is, not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> this is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> Both are 1875 watts and equally powerful; the Revlon is easier to hold.  </li>
            <li> Useful settings and attachments</li>
            <li> The medium is so powerful</li>
            <li> The different speed and heat settings are so nice (2 speeds, 3 heat settings).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it .</li>
            <li> ...medium was too cool and hot</li>
            <li> The Remington AC9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use a lot of the cool setting on it  ..</li>
            <li> but they come in handy for those with long strands that need to isolate and concentrate the air.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m a balding middle-aged man, the primary user for this new hair dryer is my wife.</li>
            <li> I like the rocker power switch location in the \\&quot;neck\\&quot; of the dryer, as it&#x27;s easy to control with my thumb, unlike my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Instructions may not seem important to some people, but the instructions for this dryer are very clear.  </li>
            <li> I loved the narrow flow on this dryer, and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> This in take is larger for more air flow</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s intended to last 4 years!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Remington!</li>
            <li> The ion generator helps reduce static while drying hair and it works well enough.</li>
            <li> , many will go back to their lighter and simpler to use unit.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> short fine hair dries quickly on the lower settings</li>
            <li> For the price, the Remington hair dryer works pretty well for</li>
            <li> It is okay, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy the same model again.</li>
            <li> I panicked since I was getting married in a week</li>
            <li> My last dryer I love and had for 20 years.  </li>
            <li> First of all I like the design of this product and the quality w.r.t performance and functionality.</li>
            <li> I tried holding it different ways, and I was able to when drying certain areas of my head, but there is just no avoiding having to hold it right where the switches are.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was it&#x27;s weight.</li>
            <li> Options for speeds &amp; options for heat settings - exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this hair dryer overall.  </li>
            <li> I love the different settings on this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It does also leave my hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this and will update later if need be because I JUST received it in the mail today.</li>
            <li> Does get as hot  as I would like.</li>
            <li> was too hot.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer works great, easy to use, but it&#x27;s heavy on the arm when carrying long.</li>
            <li> When my hair dryer arrived, the first thing I noticed was that it had a good heft; it was slightly heavy, but not too much so, indicative of quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have ultra sensitive hair follicles and wish to avoid hair pulling, you should avoid this Remington dryer as the Conair will do the job nearly as well without the hair-pulling issues, but with a bit more noise.</li>
            <li> The cool air button provides instant cool air.</li>
            <li> I pulled out the nice quiet Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer, and popped on the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, so I don&#x27;t know if it was a fluke or my imagination, but my hair does seem particularly nice and soft</li>
            <li> Turn it up to full blast though and it&#x27;s as hot as any professional hair dryer my hair dresser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying they were coerced to give positive reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**One thing I really like about this hair dryer is that no matter what setting you&#x27;re using, even if it&#x27;s the hottest setting, the dryer itself does not get hot to the touch and remains cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries hair very quickly and has different levels of speed and heat.</li>
            <li> The back pops off easily for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Strong and powerful, however, it&#x27;s a little too powerful for me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light dryer and this one works, it&#x27;s not super light</li>
            <li> With this new dryer I can easily change a setting and I find it easy to keep my fingers slightly to the side of the controls to avoid accidentally making changes.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully but just a little heavy.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed a bit large and a bit too heavy, but we&#x27;ve come to appreciate its durability and apparent good build quality.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is also pretty quiet, it doesn&#x27;t have that loud high pitched noise like most dryers do.</li>
            <li> If I had a straight pronged hook, it&#x27;d not be a problem.</li>
            <li> The 2 attachments don&#x27;t &amp;#34;attach&amp;#34; very well, but I don&#x27;t use them much anyway.</li>
            <li> very quickly)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries hair fast</li>
            <li> Would highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> My hair dries silky &amp; straight just how I like it.</li>
            <li> Of course, with naturally curly hair, getting what you want is rarely an option, you learn to like what you get for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dries my hair so fast with no knots</li>
            <li> Very displeased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Powerful and not too loud</li>
            <li> To much noise but does the work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two speeds: medium and fast.  </li>
            <li> This is what I use to make my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> Drys my hair really fast</li>
            <li> This sleek hair dryer really packs a punch.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy another one tomorrow if this one broke.</li>
            <li> in fact it smooths it really well and gives me that just went to the salon look.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this without much research, so I am to blame for not &amp;#34;loving&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see that it makes my hair that much smoother</li>
            <li> It has not been damaged at all, it&#x27;s not dusty inside, nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> she said her hair dries so much quicker and smoother.</li>
            <li> The diffuser and the \\&quot;narrow concentrator\\&quot; come with the dryer and should be useful for many people</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t really tell you if the ion action is working, because I don&#x27;t have any way to really tell, but it gets my hair dry quickly with lots of volume and it feels fairly smooth when I&#x27;m done, even when I don&#x27;t use a brush to blow it out.</li>
            <li> They are right where your fingers wrap around and hold on, and unfortunately my natural grip keeps changing the settings while drying.</li>
            <li> As noted by others, the screen does clean easily and the whole device feels well-made and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Lite weight, easy too handle, and  dry fast.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased that there wasn&#x27;t one piece when I went to straighten it that sizzled by still being wet!</li>
            <li> Way better quality than I expected for the price!</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair very quickly with this dryer using a large round brush and the end result is soft, smooth, shiny, frizz-free hair that stays frizz free even when I am outdoors.  </li>
            <li> and it is plenty warm enough to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I use it on medium temperature and high speed and my shoulder-length hair, which is also straight and fine, can go from soaking-wet-out-of-the-shower to dry in about 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a hairdryer that would complete the first 50% of hair drying quickly, but then allow me to use a lower speed with my round brush to get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> (but that model is no longer available), so I got her this one based on other positive reviews, and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> The Remington Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer does exactly what it promises:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this hair dryer has proven to be a quality product - I really like it!</li>
            <li> I notice the weight of it when I pick it up and it feels heavy in my hand, but the ergonomic shape of the handle allows me to hold it right near the top</li>
            <li> but she likes how this dryer has given her some body, more than her previous device had.  </li>
            <li> He was dry and comfortable in no time.</li>
            <li> In order to give it a fair trial, we used the diffuser and dried my granddaughter&#x27;s waist length curly red hair.</li>
            <li> I was in a super big hurry and tried this out before reading the directions and without my bathroom mirror.  </li>
            <li> Next time I tried it I made sure to read the directions thoroughly and use the mirror to get used to the air intake in the back.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend $150-$200, but I did want something decent.</li>
            <li> Duncan is an older fella and a rescue.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It was really highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> (and the fact that it&#x27;s a bit heavy and unbalanced), this hairdryer yields very smooth results.</li>
            <li> If this dryer had a third, lower speed setting, or if the low speed setting had 30% less power, this would be a GREAT hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, which I wear naturally.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a few different settings too -- Great addition to any household, especially with a lot of girls!</li>
            <li> Otherwise great dryer, just be wary of the rear vent.</li>
            <li> This is unfortunate because I think otherwise this was a great dryer.</li>
            <li> but it is also packed with features that really make my old hair dryer seem like something out of the</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t understand how some say they get their long hair stuck at the intake in the back of the blow dryer because most women do not have knee length hair</li>
            <li> The one minor complaint I have is that the hot setting didn&#x27;t feel as hot as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t normally use those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, for the drying performance, it&#x27;s worth the occasional inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Difficulty cleaning is better than the heavy weight.</li>
            <li> , how quiet it is while in use, and how fresh her hair feels after each use.</li>
            <li> And a fun red, sparkly color too!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be very nosy because I&#x27;ve never had a home hair dryer that wasn&#x27;t; however, it was actually pretty quiet for a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whole reason I bought a new dryer is that my really old dryer died, I had a spare hanging around the house that I started to use, but it has slider controls</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the results are great, I don&#x27;t want to be forced to modify how I dry my hair in order to avoid it being yanked out.</li>
            <li> As far as the ceramic/ionic nature of the dryer, I&#x27;m not fully sure how this works with a blow dryer since it doesn&#x27;t actually touch the hair like a flat iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My thick, rather porous hair dries slightly more quickly with this dryer than my old one; even a little difference can be important to a user in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair does feel nice after I dry it, and if I&#x27;m planning to curl or flat iron after drying then I really appreciate how fast I can get my hair dry.</li>
            <li> So this beautiful looking piece is no more good for me :(</li>
            <li> I needed a new hair dryer as my girlfriend borrowed my BaByliss Pro TT.  </li>
            <li> and now I need to purchase another new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very soft and no frizz.</li>
            <li> The one item worth noting is that the Remington is about a quarter pound heavier than the BaByliss which may be an issue if you use it for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy, loud and I prefer more ranges in heat than it offers.  </li>
            <li> (I got the Remington when my Vidal Sassoon stopped working on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; and would only work on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Fine for my short hair, but not for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> If you always flat iron or curl after drying, or if you don&#x27;t care about style and just want to get your hair dry fast, or (maybe) if you have really thick strands, this could be a great dryer.</li>
            <li> hair does feel quite smooth and seems to be less heat damaged from my drying, though I think time will tell if this hair dryer is truly \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews that said this dryer was good for long thick curly hair</li>
            <li> The screen on the back has holes that are large enough for dry hair to suck in relatively easily if it comes close to the intake, whereas the Conair mesh intake cover prevents that; however, the dryer can be set to a lower speed to reduce the sucking, plus, over time my wife has learned how to position the dryer to prevent this.</li>
            <li> I love the various settings which allows for less frizz.  </li>
            <li> It does have multiple heat and power settings, but I&#x27;m mostly a high heat, high power girl, so that&#x27;s all I use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine just doesn&#x27;t fit well, but that was a little annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very powerful, sturdy, leaves hair soft, dries quickly, not too loud, and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> Still, this is not a bad dryer, it&#x27;s just not right for her.</li>
            <li> Amazingly this Remington model has nearly the same features and design as the Conair; same wattage, same switch arrangement (albeit, one is reversed), same fast motor, same heat settings, and the same weight.</li>
            <li> i just a bonus as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about ionic properties, especially in a hair dryer, but I really like this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Below are her thoughts regarding the &amp;#34;Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair</li>
            <li> (Okay, i picked it out, but he hasn&#x27;t complained )</li>
            <li> /&gt;It IS stronger than my old dryer</li>
            <li> My 5 year old dryer caught fire .</li>
            <li> so having this &#x27;Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer&#x27; has been a dream.</li>
            <li> three setting for hair drying (just like my old</li>
            <li> must faster then my old one&lt;br /&gt;-Two</li>
            <li> My old dryer weight was like nothing in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It comes with a concentrator and a diffuser for straight hair and curly hair, respectively.  </li>
            <li> I was quite surprised when this happened, as others said there was no screen on the hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> In addtion, there are 3 heat settings so if your scalp is sensitive to heat, you have the option of lower heat.</li>
            <li> The problem is that this hairdryer has too much power on the low speed for a polished set and</li>
            <li> This dryer just has too much power going to it at the low speed setting, which means I get lots of flyaways.</li>
            <li> As it is, I break out my old Vidal Sassoon 1875 to finish the style</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels soft and shines.</li>
            <li> I hope this dryer has as long a life as my old one because I REALLY like it!</li>
            <li> the Conair Infinity and Remington Silk, the weight and heat are virtually the same, but the Remington has faster airflow (nozzle is smaller, which concentrates the flow) to push through heavy, wet hair better, and it&#x27;s quieter with significantly lower high-frequency noise.</li>
            <li> Right?), and coming up empty</li>
            <li> Mine is 6-7&amp;#34; long in places, so this dryer will most likely go back to the store where it was purchased (at the same price as online here).</li>
            <li> Everything works as it should and it puts out a bunch of air and cools down quickly when you are through using it.  </li>
            <li> Typical hair dryers are loud, not so with this Remington Silk Ceramic Dryer, and my sensitive eared golden retriever is the proof.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first ceramic styling tool, and I&#x27;ve found that my hair is silky without frizz and quickly dried every time, so ceramic really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely heavier than the average cheap blow dryer</li>
            <li> : It has two speed settings, high and low.</li>
            <li> Also I kept hitting the power button moving it from high to low</li>
            <li> right side up, upside down, my hair never got near the back of the dryer, and there is a decent screen over the intake anyways,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mid-sized, so if you&#x27;re wanting something light and small, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> but I had to try them both back to back to convince myself, the difference is not dramatic.</li>
            <li> And finding a good hairdryer that will dry long, thick hair is a quest of our&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so it takes a while to get that much hair to dry, but this hair dryer does so with ease.</li>
            <li> It did dry my hair faster but not by much.</li>
            <li> After a few quick looks around my rural&lt;br /&gt;town</li>
            <li> It dries hair quickly but is quite heavy.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;d stuck my finger in an electrical socket (even with their ion promises) and took a good 10-15 minutes to get my shoulder length medium thick hair dried.</li>
            <li> Curly hair sure can take time to dry and this one does not make your arm or grip ache, due to the long use.</li>
            <li> This is like no other dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> (my hold one would give me major frizz)&lt;br /&gt;-Also</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not heavy for most users but may be a factor for those drying thick and/or long hair and those with arthritis.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a professional AC motor that provides 40% faster airflow than standard hair dryers, meaning your hair will dry much quicker than you&#x27;d imagine.</li>
            <li> The back is a little heavy, but great other than that.</li>
            <li> major disadvantage that I&#x27;ve encountered so far may apply only to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like having two speeds and three temps that operate independently, so you can have high heat and low fan if you want, or vice versa.</li>
            <li> It is heavier than my previous one, but I think this is due to the quality of the motor which I am hoping does in fact help this hair dryer to last longer than most.  </li>
            <li> My faithful old hair dryer blew out its last breath and this one has taken its place.</li>
            <li> * Much quieter than I expected and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer is on its last leg</li>
            <li> I particularly like that it has three heat settings, as I prefer cooler air when I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Cold button a good feature.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with two attachments:  1)the nozzle that directs the air flow in a small space, which is great for styling by running the nozzle down a shaft of hair on a round brush.  </li>
            <li> Also my old dryer&#x27;s motor sounds pretty cheap and sick after the hum of this one, but I don&#x27;t find much difference in loudness or tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With 3 heat settings (none of which are as hot as my old one)and 2 speeds, this dryer makes short work of drying my  medium length slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed that several other reviewers had trouble with getting their hair stuck in the rear vent, I have long hair and have yet to have this problem, but I do agree that a cap of some sort would be nice to prevent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy to easily move around quickly and thus is sometimes pretty awkward.</li>
            <li> Normally it takes quite a while to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I previously had a ConAir and in comparison I think this one is of higher quality.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer works better than other blow dryers in the past, in that it is quieter.</li>
            <li> and if my hair ended up a little more wild than usual, so be it.</li>
            <li> Using the same brush, same hair product, and same technique I&#x27;ve always used, this dryer got my hair fully dried, smooth, and silky in approx.</li>
            <li> no frizz leaves hair soft and manageable before I comb it to flat iron it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to be critical of something you got for free.</li>
            <li> My only minor quibble is that I wish you didn&#x27;t have to hold down the cool shot button to use it.  </li>
            <li> but it does not dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> However, it is way too heavy to hold for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I definitely scored some major brownie points with this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maintenance is easier than with many other hair dryers; the small screen in the back comes off for cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly grey hair.</li>
            <li> have complained that their hair gets sucked into the dryer, and that is certainly true.</li>
            <li> you need lots of power to dry thick, long hair, then the Remington and the Conair are better choices than a lower wattage dryer.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this baby gets my hair dry quickly and WITHOUT frizzies!</li>
            <li> I previously had a $150 professional grade dryer (5 years, and it finally died), and I did some research prior to buying a new one to see if I could save that expense.</li>
            <li> the the plug is frequently falling out of the outlet, as in several times during one blow dry session.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO very upset that this dryer didn&#x27;t even last a month when my previous dryer lasted for 10 YEARS.</li>
            <li> They are on the handle directly where you hold it, therefore you are constantly switching the heat button without realizing it and then wondering why its taking so long to dry.  </li>
            <li> was very heavy at first</li>
            <li> (My old dryer was very heavy &amp; bulky to hold the whole time I dry</li>
            <li> One switch to control the blast (a little or a lot) and one switch to control the temperture (low med high).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;The hair-pulling issue is much worse than she originally thought.</li>
            <li> It took me half the time to dry my hair than it did in the past and thanks to the ionic setting, my hair looks and feels so much healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li> It comes with two attachments, and I especially like the concentrator attachment to help dry strands of hair nicely without blowing the rest of my hair around like crazy.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer and I was shocked that it actually worked BETTER than my $150 dryer!</li>
            <li> because, despite my squeezing out as much moisture as possible in a microfiber towel and drying and small sections, not staying in one section too long, I have to</li>
            <li> We have long, medium, and short hairstyles between us.</li>
            <li> Our hair tends to get flat, not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost too long for her, especially with attachments installed&lt;br</li>
            <li> you should get the  silk ceramic flat iron 2 inch plates to go with it, this hair drier</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t like that I MUST flat iron or curl my hair to get it to look finished.</li>
            <li> I could go without using my flat iron after using this dryer.</li>
            <li> I also have long hair and didn&#x27;t have a problem with the back as some others have.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it dried it so quickly!</li>
            <li> It does have several levels of heat, including a non-heat blow dry setting.</li>
            <li> As far as time, it seems slightly faster, though not as noticeable as I thought it might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I really thought I was going to love this hair dryer, but I hate it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than my former dryer, but the performance is well worth it, as was the price, and hey, I hardly ever take the time to lift weights, so the extra 6 minutes of an arm-workout</li>
            <li> It might be a little heavy to some people that are not used to Professional hair dryers but the weight doesn&#x27;t bother me, it weighs the same as my old one.</li>
            <li> : Long enough to allow me to easily dry my hair and move the dryer all over the place without running out of cord, but it doesn&#x27;t get tangled or gnarly.</li>
            <li> I recently went on a trip and left my dryer at home, which meant I used the tiny little hair dryer in the hotel.</li>
            <li> In all of our family, the girls have long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, the blow out lasts longer, and it dried faster then my old dryer.</li>
            <li> have long hair and did not experience my hair getting stuck in the fan, although I know that can happen with any dryer.</li>
            <li> my long hair would get quite tangled.  </li>
            <li> I found that it dried my hair quicker than my old hair dryer and seemed a bit quieter as well.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and had no problem with it getting stuck in the dryer.  </li>
            <li> But that is an extremely minor issue.  </li>
            <li> The back intake will suck your hair into it if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> It used to take me 30 minutes to dry my hair, its very long and thick - now it only takes 15 minutes or less and there is a cool setting, so i can finish up with that to bring the temp of the hair back down and lock in the style.</li>
            <li> Who wants to have their head upside down and trying to move a heavy dryer around your head?</li>
            <li> * Dried my thick hair quickly w/o drying it out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the ions have anything to do with that, but my wife&#x27;s hair is very soft after using either dryer and both have ion generators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between</li>
            <li> (and I have very long hair).</li>
            <li> so it look a bit longer than I&#x27;m accustomed to to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I can now dry my hair without serving as an alarm clock for the rest of the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After saying all that, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Today I went to blow dry my hair it turned on and then cut out and died.</li>
            <li> Also, if I use a brush to blow dry it I even manage to straighten it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry evenly.</li>
            <li> My hair is way too dry and doesnt hold its shape.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural, thick, curly/wavy mixed texture.</li>
            <li> It dries my thick hair SO much faster than my other hair dryer.</li>
            <li> One time when I had my hair flipped over and was blow drying upside down my hair got sucked into the back of the dryer through the vent.  </li>
            <li> I live in humid south Florida and have shoulder length thick hair that tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; (if it can even be called that) is I wish the hanging hook was an eensy bit bigger, because I have to finagle it on and off my hanging hook that has a small ball on the end.</li>
            <li> I like the multiple settings, although there is a learning curve, and I found myself pushing the wrong switches at first.</li>
            <li> The opening and attachments are smaller than our previous Remington, which is what I was trying to replace.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife once her previous (different brand) hair dryer broke.</li>
            <li> The highest setting does get hot but the drying ability is so poor, all it seems to do is scorch the closest hairs, while leaving others wet.</li>
            <li> I like to use the concentrator and a round brush to blow dry my hair and with such a smal barrel it took longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly small - you really have to dry your hair in fairly small sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> I lost my last dryer in a flood, researched a little and found this.  </li>
            <li> and it takes us 30 to 45 mins with other dryers to dry our hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really dry the hair any faster than any other dryer and leaves my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> The cold shot of air is a real help in styling, especially for short hair styles.</li>
            <li> My spouse has thin, straight hair</li>
            <li> so my arm doesn&#x27;t really get tired.</li>
            <li> It weighs approximately 1-lb-11-oz , which isn&#x27;t all that much</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have extra time to waste drying my hair, so</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have extra time to waste drying my hair, so</li>
            <li> It is heavier than expected and doesn&#x27;t feel balanced in my hand.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair with a blow dryer that was gonna be too rough on me</li>
            <li> I thought it would be enough to dry my thick, long hair, but it doesn&#x27;t run at its hottest on medium speed.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is less than 3&amp;#34; long, this might not be a problem for you.</li>
            <li> You need one hand to hold it and the other to fluff your hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife has long hair and she&#x27;s complained that her hair occasionally gets sucked in (this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for women with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly quiet (as compared to my previous hair dryers) and dried my hair well.  </li>
            <li> I have always taken care to dry my hair carefully and thoroughly with a round brush; however, after a stint in the Florida heat I am all frizz again.  </li>
            <li> air flow feels weak, yet it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li> Makes a somewhat high-pitched sound, which some people might find unpleasant</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dryer does work faster than other dryers we&#x27;ve had, and it is quieter.</li>
            <li> would say this one has been &amp;#34;Over Engineered&amp;#34; in the extreme</li>
            <li> SHE WONT ORDER AGAIN DUE</li>

            <li> I currently use a Conair ionic Hair Dryer, which is very heavy ...</li>
            <li> I can use my round brush &amp; this dryer and dry &amp; style my hair faster than with any of my specialty  hair stylers.</li>
            <li> but now no longer has any air pressure and takes at least 2x as long to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The air outlet and diffuser for this dryer are very small -- it does not diffuse gently, rather the air blows in a hard stream creating frizz and breaking up curls.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than I expected, but I can handle that.</li>

            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve had the problem of my long hair getting sucked into the dryer.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a hair dryer actually drying hair faster, but was pleasantly surprised when it did seem to cut a few minutes off of my drying time.</li>
            <li> I have thin naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that it is heavy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad: too much power on the low speed leaves lots of flyaways and substantially reduces control over the finished style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My previous blow dryers have intakes on the sides.</li>

            <li> and it cut my drying time in half.  </li>

            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hard to get them to blow dry their hair, but they wanted to use this dryer --</li>
            <li> I was concerned about several people&#x27;s reviews stating their long hair got caught in the intake area, but I think they&#x27;re just blow-drying their hair with a weird technique...</li>
            <li> : It does feel a little heavier than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> It dries her hair a little quicker</li>
            <li> ,  I just went online and with little consideration except price, in 5 minutes I just clicked  the buy button &amp; forgot about it.  </li>
            <li> but it works very well, also like the cold blast button.</li>
            <li> thought the dryer was a bit heavy, but my kids (12 and 14) never mentioned the weight.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s quite heavy</li>
            <li> He literally came running to get his head dried after his bath.</li>
            <li> Biggest issue is the weight, it&#x27;s really heavy.</li>
            <li> A few things to note about this hair dryer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using a crappy Revlon one for a few months, I decided to upgrade.</li>
            <li> I had some issues getting the nozzle to stay on properly, but never experienced issues with my hair getting sucked up into it</li>
            <li> The noise level matters for him, as loud noises make him uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting the concentrator attachment on the end, and then it blew off the dryer both times that I used it.</li>
            <li> but it did seem that my hair dried quicker</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> the round diffuser for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> not too heavy</li>
            <li> Bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Mid-sized and heavy</li>
            <li> ; my hair because the drying is so uneven, I end up with damp</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t buy this dryer directly myself, otherwise I&#x27;d return or exchange it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also not too heavy</li>
            <li> Mine also rattled and it&#x27;s really heavy.</li>
            <li> Though not super heavy, this hair dryer was a little heavier than my previous dryer, which I concede may be an unfair comparison, as that was a compact model from a different manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have very thick and long hair</li>
            <li> 6 minutes with no static or poofy frizzies.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, I have a shower curtain behind me and the power of the dryer tried to suck up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that works, but it feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE ADAPTER THING IS TO SMALL.</li>
            <li> TO THE SMALL ADAPTER.</li>
            <li> If it works on my difficult to straighten hair, it will definitely work on anyones!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some people wrote reviews about the dryer sucking in their hair, I have had no issues with that whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer about a month ago to replace the dryer I owned for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> Not sure what all are for.  </li>
            <li> did this design problem get past quality control?</li>
            <li> The weight is inordinately heavy!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t keep having my hair sucked into the back vent since it damages my hair, but usually needs to be cut to get the hair out.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how small the tip of the barrel is.</li>
            <li> Very heavy and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Quick blast cold button (takes about 2-3 seconds to get cold when you push the button)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair ends up poofy , frizzy, dull, and fried looking.</li>
            <li> Drying time does seem a bit faster but hard to tell as my hair is thick.</li>
            <li> The biggest negative is that the controls are where you would hold the dryer.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about it is its weight.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complaint about its functions.  </li>
            <li> wife&#x27;s hair is shoulder length and thick (according to her stylist)</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick, wavy, shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and unruly.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and needed a hair dryer that could handle it without taking what seems like forever.</li>
            <li> The dryer is a little awkward to hold, however, and I had trouble changing heat and speed while holding it midair and drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Not only painful, it is difficult to avoid, and she was not able to become accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> It does feel slightly awkward due to the weight and length of the barrel, but nothing that I found as a hindrance.  </li>
            <li> Stay away if you have thick hair!</li>
            <li> I got this dryer for my wife, who has very thick, medium-length hair.  </li>
            <li> I like to have some of the worst of the bushy hair trimmed up tight around his back end before I struggle with washing it.</li>
            <li> It is totally frustrating.</li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t rank this dryer a 5 star, is because of the placement/design of the setting buttons.</li>
            <li> I have thin medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll get tired of holding something heavier, but I am hoping that it&#x27;s an indication of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why this dryer would be any worse than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I found it impossible to change settings without stopping and looking and even then it was hard to move the sliders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortably heavier</li>
            <li> I hate weak hair dryers.</li>
            <li> but it feels like an  air conditioner because of how cold it gets.</li>
            <li> Cold temperature setting (so the air blows cold without having to push the button)&lt;br /&gt;  3.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t tell my wife she&#x27;d get mad at me...</li>
            <li> Humidity makes it impossible to do anything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Hate switch placement.</li>
            <li> I hate this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Despite having a perforated metal screen at the air intake, hair can be painfully sucked in!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used hair dryers that were in the $10-$20 range and hated how my hair always got lion-mane poofy with all the baby hairs frizzed out</li>
            <li> Worst hair dryer ever!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely ridiculous!!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible for curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> As much as I hate to admit it, in conjunction with the Cricket Technique 400 thermal brush, my hair is as closest to a salon blowout as I have ever gotten it!</li>

            <li> I had bought this blow dryer in a convenient store and loved it!  I went back and purchased an extra one for my guest bathroom for company to use.  Our family has a lot of birthdays in March and I thought this would be a great gift for my daughters.  The convenient store did not have any of these left, so I went to my Trusty Amazon and bought two from them. All of our daughters have waist length to knee length hair and I have very thick and long hair and it takes us 30 to 45 mins with other dryers to dry our hair.  This blow dryer does my hair in 15 mins.  I love this thing!!  We don&#x27;t understand how some say they get their long hair stuck at the intake in the back of the blow dryer because most women do not have knee length hair and we have never had this issue.  If you want a powerful blow dryer, this is the one for you..</li>
            <li> LOVE this hair dryer! It is excellent for drying curly hair, which needs intense heat in one area. Light weight and not overly bulky, this hair dryer has a nice handle that is easy to grip and use when you have to dry hair for awhile. Curly hair sure can take time to dry and this one does not make your arm or grip ache, due to the long use. I recommend for anyone who wants a great, affordable lighter dryer that has concentrated heat!</li>
            <li> I jokingly told someone I was about to use my brand new hair dryer for the first time and that it was guaranteed to give me perfect hair that was magazine cover photo ready...and then it happened, lol. I&#x27;ve always used hair dryers that were in the $10-$20 range and hated how my hair always got lion-mane poofy with all the baby hairs frizzed out like I&#x27;d stuck my finger in an electrical socket (even with their ion promises) and took a good 10-15 minutes to get my shoulder length medium thick hair dried. Using the same brush, same hair product, and same technique I&#x27;ve always used, this dryer got my hair fully dried, smooth, and silky in approx. 6 minutes with no static or poofy frizzies. It&#x27;s a little heavier than my former dryer, but the performance is well worth it, as was the price, and hey, I hardly ever take the time to lift weights, so the extra 6 minutes of an arm-workout i just a bonus as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I was concerned about several people&#x27;s reviews stating their long hair got caught in the intake area, but I think they&#x27;re just blow-drying their hair with a weird technique...right side up, upside down, my hair never got near the back of the dryer, and there is a decent screen over the intake anyways, so don&#x27;t worry about that downside. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; (if it can even be called that) is I wish the hanging hook was an eensy bit bigger, because I have to finagle it on and off my hanging hook that has a small ball on the end. If I had a straight pronged hook, it&#x27;d not be a problem.</li>
            <li> Good dryer, has held up well so far.</li>
            <li> Very good item. Works as described. Will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. She says her hair hasn&#x27;t been this healthy in a while, also it dries her hair super fast!  This thing has a lot of power, I like playing with it because its like an air gun. But don&#x27;t tell my wife she&#x27;d get mad at me...</li>
            <li> So far this hair dryer is amazing.  I love the various settings which allows for less frizz.  It is heavier than my last hair dryer I owned (different brand) but I think it is because it is better constructed.  Drying time does seem a bit faster but hard to tell as my hair is thick.</li>
            <li> I needed a new hair dryer as my girlfriend borrowed my BaByliss Pro TT.  The Remington works great.  Everything works as it should and it puts out a bunch of air and cools down quickly when you are through using it.  Easy to regulate the temperature and the unit has great fit and finish.  The one item worth noting is that the Remington is about a quarter pound heavier than the BaByliss which may be an issue if you use it for long periods of time.  I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Relatively quite. Wish it had a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> My faithful old hair dryer blew out its last breath and this one has taken its place. The heft is perfect and well balanced. With 3 heat settings (none of which are as hot as my old one)and 2 speeds, this dryer makes short work of drying my  medium length slightly wavy hair. In order to give it a fair trial, we used the diffuser and dried my granddaughter&#x27;s waist length curly red hair. Also swiftly done, and the curls remained intact. I hope this dryer has as long a life as my old one because I REALLY like it!</li>
            <li> I was in a super big hurry and tried this out before reading the directions and without my bathroom mirror.  Immediately got my hair stuck in the intake and had to turn it off and attempt to use it later.   Next time I tried it I made sure to read the directions thoroughly and use the mirror to get used to the air intake in the back.  My previous blow dryers have intakes on the sides. This in take is larger for more air flow but you have to get used to keeping it further away as it will suck in hair as well as air.  The cover does come off easily for the in take so you can clean it out.  I love that it&#x27;s intended to last 4 years!  One thing I did notice is that you aren&#x27;t supposed to store it in a damp area so I keep it in my bedroom and just take it into the bathroom as needed.  The intake has a wire mesh screen  that could possibly rust so I appreciate this extra advice.  It does seem to make your hair nice and silky.  Update: died and the customer service was impeccable! Thanks Remington!</li>
            <li> This dryer has mulitple settings.  One switch to control the blast (a little or a lot) and one switch to control the temperture (low med high).  I have very curly hair, which I wear naturally.  I need my dryer to blast a lot of air, but at a very low temperture, and I need to have a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fits the bill.  The only gripe I have is that I wish the diffuser were bigger. It&#x27;s fairly small - you really have to dry your hair in fairly small sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> **********&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;The hair-pulling issue is much worse than she originally thought. Not only painful, it is difficult to avoid, and she was not able to become accustomed to it. After three weeks of trying, she no longer uses this hair dryer for personal use and has delegated it to the dogs. It works great on the dogs.&lt;br /&gt;************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s hair is shoulder length and thick (according to her stylist) so it takes a while to get that much hair to dry, but this hair dryer does so with ease. She purchased a Conair Infinity Pro a while back and it was her favorite until now. Amazingly this Remington model has nearly the same features and design as the Conair; same wattage, same switch arrangement (albeit, one is reversed), same fast motor, same heat settings, and the same weight. Hmmmm, you&#x27;d think that they&#x27;re made in the same Chinese factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained that their hair gets sucked into the dryer, and that is certainly true. The screen on the back has holes that are large enough for dry hair to suck in relatively easily if it comes close to the intake, whereas the Conair mesh intake cover prevents that; however, the dryer can be set to a lower speed to reduce the sucking, plus, over time my wife has learned how to position the dryer to prevent this. Still, it is a downside and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need lots of power to dry thick, long hair, then the Remington and the Conair are better choices than a lower wattage dryer. The ion generator helps reduce static while drying hair and it works well enough. Silky? I&#x27;m not sure the ions have anything to do with that, but my wife&#x27;s hair is very soft after using either dryer and both have ion generators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the Conair Infinity and Remington Silk, the weight and heat are virtually the same, but the Remington has faster airflow (nozzle is smaller, which concentrates the flow) to push through heavy, wet hair better, and it&#x27;s quieter with significantly lower high-frequency noise. This Remington also comes with a couple of attachments that may be of use but my wife doesn&#x27;t use attachments. If you have ultra sensitive hair follicles and wish to avoid hair pulling, you should avoid this Remington dryer as the Conair will do the job nearly as well without the hair-pulling issues, but with a bit more noise. It&#x27;s a close call, but she slightly prefers the Remington Silk.</li>
            <li> This is exactly as advertised and is nice to use.  I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this hair dryer. My daughters and I have all tested it, and we&#x27;ve had consistently good results. We have long, medium, and short hairstyles between us. We all have straight, fine hair and a lot of it. Our hair tends to get flat, not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer does work faster than other dryers we&#x27;ve had, and it is quieter. Blowouts result in shinier, smoother hair than before. I like the multiple settings, although there is a learning curve, and I found myself pushing the wrong switches at first. The cold shot of air is a real help in styling, especially for short hair styles. We&#x27;ve used the concentrator, and it fits securely and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the dryer was a bit heavy, but my kids (12 and 14) never mentioned the weight. It&#x27;s been hard to get them to blow dry their hair, but they wanted to use this dryer -- a big plus to me, I admit. (I&#x27;d be a stylist if I wanted to give someone a blowout, but I&#x27;m not and I don&#x27;t.) It&#x27;s a full-sized blow dryer and comes with loop so you can hang it if you wish. I wasn&#x27;t sure where I wanted to store the dryer, so I temporarily rested in inside the strong box it comes in and tucked the box in my linen closet between a stack of towels and the wall. It&#x27;s worked so well that I&#x27;m still using it, but it&#x27;s a nice looking dryer, and I would display it if my bathroom were larger and had more wall space.</li>
            <li> I like this hairdryer a lot. Even with the heaviness, which I associate with quality for some reason. It&#x27;s a comfortable dryer and feels good in the hand without fatiguing it, despite the weight. In the past, I&#x27;ve had the problem of my long hair getting sucked into the dryer. I did not have that issue with this dryer. The one minor complaint I have is that the hot setting didn&#x27;t feel as hot as I would have liked. The hot feels like more of a medium setting to me so it look a bit longer than I&#x27;m accustomed to to dry my hair. As far as the ceramic/ionic nature of the dryer, I&#x27;m not fully sure how this works with a blow dryer since it doesn&#x27;t actually touch the hair like a flat iron or curling iron. The science has been lost on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a spot dryer attachment and a diffuser attachment but I don&#x27;t normally use those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great hair dryer! I love it!</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom, who wanted a dryer with a strong &amp;#34;blow.&amp;#34; I have a Remington that is great (but that model is no longer available), so I got her this one based on other positive reviews, and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Excellent this is the best</li>
            <li> Very good high quality</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this blow dryer, I read the reviews.  It is a nice dryer.  I like that is has different heat and fan levels.  I agree with other reviews that it is heavy.  For me, that is not a big deal.  The biggest negative is that the controls are where you would hold the dryer.  So when you drying your hair,  it is very easy to change the setting of the dryer by accident.</li>
            <li> Works great.. very good product</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer!! Light to hold and is powerful!</li>
            <li> all excellent, recommended 100%</li>
            <li> It certainly works okay, but !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very big, it&#x27;s quite heavy and you&#x27;ll need to have a good memory to remember all of the functions.&lt;br /&gt;I would say this one has been &amp;#34;Over Engineered&amp;#34; in the extreme and I&#x27;m sure as I will, many will go back to their lighter and simpler to use unit.&lt;br /&gt;A speed, cool and perhaps two or three heat settings are I&#x27;m sure is what most of us need and want and I feel this baby has just got too many functions to be practical.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I purchased this on a very special Amazon Deal, but truthfully I will just keep this one as a spare.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller, good product, was exactly what I ordered, arrived on schedule with no problems and works perfectly, thanks</li>
            <li> Works good. Hate switch placement. Keep turning accidentally while using it.</li>
            <li> Works really Great! Leaves hair looking nice.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this hair dryer except the the plug is frequently falling out of the outlet, as in several times during one blow dry session. I&#x27;ve tried to separate the prongs more, without success. It is totally frustrating.</li>
            <li> Typical hair dryers are loud, not so with this Remington Silk Ceramic Dryer, and my sensitive eared golden retriever is the proof. He literally came running to get his head dried after his bath. So it&#x27;s a pleasure for humans as well, with no piercing whine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first ceramic styling tool, and I&#x27;ve found that my hair is silky without frizz and quickly dried every time, so ceramic really does make a difference. This is a sturdy, sleek dryer, with great heat, power, and cool blast button for setting your style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t rank this dryer a 5 star, is because of the placement/design of the setting buttons. They are right where your fingers wrap around and hold on, and unfortunately my natural grip keeps changing the settings while drying. However, for the drying performance, it&#x27;s worth the occasional inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Nice dryer, quieter than most and dries quickly. Biggest issue is the weight, it&#x27;s really heavy. I compred to others I have tried and the 1 pound makes a big difference when styling my hair. Keeping as a backup but going back to the Revlon quiet pro. Difficulty cleaning is better than the heavy weight.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! I noticed a big difference after using just once. Hair felt healthier!</li>
            <li> We like this stylish Remington Hair Dryer.  At first it seemed a bit large and a bit too heavy, but we&#x27;ve come to appreciate its durability and apparent good build quality.  It blows strong and warm and does a nice job of styling.  My spouse has thin, straight hair but she likes how this dryer has given her some body, more than her previous device had.  The blowers&#x27; buttons are set in well and do not feel flimsy, nor are the useful, but goofy-looking attachments.  As noted by others, the screen does clean easily and the whole device feels well-made and long lasting.  For $35.00 that&#x27;s a good value these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> In all of our family, the girls have long hair. And finding a good hairdryer that will dry long, thick hair is a quest of our&#x27;s. I think we finally found one! This hairdryer dried my hair within 10 minutes, really well. I was so pleased that there wasn&#x27;t one piece when I went to straighten it that sizzled by still being wet! I love how easy it is to hold and maneuver. Just be careful, I have a shower curtain behind me and the power of the dryer tried to suck up the curtain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 2 attachments, I haven&#x27;t investigated everything about it yet but I know this will be with me for quite awhile. I really enjoy how light it is, not heavy at all. Who wants to have their head upside down and trying to move a heavy dryer around your head? You need one hand to hold it and the other to fluff your hair too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a few different settings too -- Great addition to any household, especially with a lot of girls!</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer.  Very heavy and sturdy.  It doesn&#x27;t quite produce the airflow of my old model, but it&#x27;s good.  The 2 attachments don&#x27;t &amp;#34;attach&amp;#34; very well, but I don&#x27;t use them much anyway.</li>
            <li> It is the 2nd one I have purchased. Love it!</li>
            <li> Sleek, comfortable to hold, works great. So happy that I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> I got this hair dryer to replace a dryer I had for several years.  This one is really good.  It provides a good flow of air and has 3 different heat settings and speed settings. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Why wasn&#x27;t I using a remington before. These are way better than the one I was using before from Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 stars.</li>
            <li> great shipping, great hair dryer</li>
            <li> Does the job just great!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this blow dryer. Very powerful, sturdy, leaves hair soft, dries quickly, not too loud, and aesthetically pleasing. Nice cranberry color. Works well on different hair types. My hair is natural, thick, curly/wavy mixed texture. No breakage. Satisfied with the results. Attachments work well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about ionic properties, especially in a hair dryer, but I really like this dryer.  It&#x27;s surprisingly quiet (as compared to my previous hair dryers) and dried my hair well.  There are three heat levels, two speeds, and it comes with a diffuser and a nozzle.  I have thick, wavy hair and it dried it fast w/o drying my hair out in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Fairly inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Dried my thick hair quickly w/o drying it out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Works well on multiple settings and speeds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cool shot feature which User Guide indicates is used to set style (have not used)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Loop on dryer for hanging up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Safety/test/reset switch on plug&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Much quieter than I expected and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Most surprisingly - a 4 year limited warranty against defects!  It&#x27;s refreshing to see a manufacturer with confidence in their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Though not super heavy, this hair dryer was a little heavier than my previous dryer, which I concede may be an unfair comparison, as that was a compact model from a different manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, especially considering the 4 year warranty</li>
            <li> Very happy with this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this baby gets my hair dry quickly and WITHOUT frizzies! Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great and comes with a diffuser. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I hate weak hair dryers. But this one is AMAAAZING!!! It&#x27;s got A LOT of power!! I don&#x27;t really use a lot of the cool setting on it  ..but it feels like an  air conditioner because of how cold it gets. If you want a great hair dryer for cheap this is absolutely worth it. The only thing I could say that would be a con is the cord. I wish it was retractable.</li>
            <li> This is a well built hair dryer. Uses a AC motor that will extend the life of the hair dryer. Has 2 speed fan with a 2 switch temperature setting. This is one of the quietest hair dryers I have ever heard. Has a removable screen to keep hair and dust out of the dryer. This dryer operates on 1875 watts of power.&lt;br /&gt;This 1,875-watt hair dryer alsofeatures Ceramic Silk technology for a silky-smooth salon finish, while the Silk ion generator emits ions that reduce frizz and create silky styles every time. There&#x27;s also a professional AC motor that provides 40% faster airflow than standard hair dryers, meaning your hair will dry much quicker than you&#x27;d imagine.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves this dryer. She says that it makes her hair look a lot better than her much older dryer. The box says it&#x27;s because of ions. I&#x27;m no rocket surgeon, but my fiance&#x27;s hair DOES look really good.... so...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bald. But it blew my wife away!!</li>
            <li> The Remington Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer does exactly what it promises:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s quiet.  (Gone are the days of dryers sounding like leaf blowers.)  I can now dry my hair without serving as an alarm clock for the rest of the family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) With three heat settings and two speeds, it allows the user to find the heat and speed that work best for her.&lt;br /&gt;My short fine hair dries quickly on the lower settings and I don&#x27;t have to worry that it will develop its own ideas of where to settle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The cool air button provides instant cool air. Remington suggests &#x27;locking in the style&#x27; with a blast of cool air.  I&#x27;m not sure if that works, but it feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It comes with a diffuser for ease in creating curls and a concentrator to encourage smooth straight flow.  I use the concentrator on the crown of my hair, which seems to want to stand at attention at unseemly times. So far so good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major disadvantage that I&#x27;ve encountered so far may apply only to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it to be about half a pound heavier than my previous Revlon.  Both are 1875 watts and equally powerful; the Revlon is easier to hold.  According to my kitchen scale, the Remington weighs one pound, six ounces.  That&#x27;s not heavy for most users but may be a factor for those drying thick and/or long hair and those with arthritis.</li>
            <li> This dryer is actually and excellent value for what it is being sold for on Amazon (about $28).  The power and heat control is a good as units I have paid over $50 for.  The shape is good and it feels very comfortable in my hand.  I have fairly short hair so I don&#x27;t need to use the attachments but they come in handy for those with long strands that need to isolate and concentrate the air.  The switches make the heat easy to adjust, making it good for drying a pet (I try to not use heat to dry my dog).  Overall a good unit.</li>
            <li> A few things to note about this hair dryer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEMPERATURE: It has a total of four settings:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Quick blast cold button (takes about 2-3 seconds to get cold when you push the button)&lt;br /&gt;  2. Cold temperature setting (so the air blows cold without having to push the button)&lt;br /&gt;  3. Medium/warm (this is the setting I always use and it is plenty warm enough to dry my hair very quickly)&lt;br /&gt;  4. Ouch, my scalp is burning (I never use this setting because my hair is fine and it&#x27;s way too hot for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**One thing I really like about this hair dryer is that no matter what setting you&#x27;re using, even if it&#x27;s the hottest setting, the dryer itself does not get hot to the touch and remains cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEIGHT: It does feel a little heavier than I&#x27;m used to. I notice the weight of it when I pick it up and it feels heavy in my hand, but the ergonomic shape of the handle allows me to hold it right near the top so my arm doesn&#x27;t really get tired. It weighs approximately 1-lb-11-oz , which isn&#x27;t all that much but in comparison with an older dryer I had, it does feels like it weighs more. This is the only reason I took off a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CORD: Long enough to allow me to easily dry my hair and move the dryer all over the place without running out of cord, but it doesn&#x27;t get tangled or gnarly. It wraps up quick and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPEEDS: It has two speed settings, high and low. I use it on medium temperature and high speed and my shoulder-length hair, which is also straight and fine, can go from soaking-wet-out-of-the-shower to dry in about 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t really tell you if the ion action is working, because I don&#x27;t have any way to really tell, but it gets my hair dry quickly with lots of volume and it feels fairly smooth when I&#x27;m done, even when I don&#x27;t use a brush to blow it out. I recently went on a trip and left my dryer at home, which meant I used the tiny little hair dryer in the hotel. After a couple days of that I was VERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer. I am a mom of 4 and I don&#x27;t have extra time to waste drying my hair, so the faster it can get done the better. This one definitely gets the job done.ERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer.

            <li> ORDERED FOR Y WIFE. SHE SAYS IT HAS LOTS OF POWER AND DRIES WELL. THE ADAPTER THING IS TO SMALL. MOTOR IS GOOD AND ALL THAT. SHE WONT ORDER AGAIN DUE TO THE SMALL ADAPTER.</li>
            <li> I got this dryer for my wife, who has very thick, medium-length hair.  For the price, the Remington hair dryer works pretty well for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s light&lt;br /&gt;- It dries hair fast&lt;br /&gt;- Controls are easy to access and use&lt;br /&gt;- Useful settings and attachments&lt;br /&gt;- Overall good design&lt;br /&gt;- The diffuser and the \\&quot;narrow concentrator\\&quot; come with the dryer and should be useful for many people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- Makes a somewhat high-pitched sound, which some people might find unpleasant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a moderately priced hair dryer, this one is good to consider.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m a balding middle-aged man, the primary user for this new hair dryer is my wife. Below are her thoughts regarding the &amp;#34;Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros (as compared to other dryers she&#x27;s owned):&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s slightly quieter&lt;br /&gt;- It dries her hair a little quicker&lt;br /&gt;- It has some interesting and useful bells and whistles (two speeds, three temperature settings, and some useful attachments)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s uncomfortably heavier&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s almost too long for her, especially with attachments installed&lt;br /&gt;- My wife has long hair and she&#x27;s complained that her hair occasionally gets sucked in (this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem for women with shorter hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, although my wife likes some features of this hair dryer, its weight and the fact that her hair gets caught in it has made it something she doesn&#x27;t want to use. Still, this is not a bad dryer, it&#x27;s just not right for her. Three stars.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! Used it today and it was amazing. I have thick hair and it dried it so quickly! And I used no products today and my hair is so so silky!!! Normally it takes quite a while to dry my hair and I use 2 products plus a smoothing serum at the end. This was amazing!! Great Dryer and a long cord too!! Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Seems like a good quality product. It&#x27;s fast at drying my hair and good for styling.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I really thought I was going to love this hair dryer, but I hate it. It doesn&#x27;t really dry the hair any faster than any other dryer and leaves my hair frizzy. I&#x27;m really disappointed with this hair dryer. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product to buy. it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li> è¯ æ&lt;br /&gt;Is very nice</li>
            <li> It is heavier than expected and doesn&#x27;t feel balanced in my hand.  The opening and attachments are smaller than our previous Remington, which is what I was trying to replace.  It is okay, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy the same model again.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer!! After using a crappy Revlon one for a few months, I decided to upgrade. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $150-$200, but I did want something decent. After reading many magazine reviews, this hairdryer had a spot in the top 10 hairdryers (and it&#x27;s affordable). It dries hair very quickly and has different levels of speed and heat. The back is a little heavy, but great other than that.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife once her previous (different brand) hair dryer broke. She has been raving about it ever since she got it. I definitely scored some major brownie points with this one. A couple of the things she has mentioned are how quickly it dries her hair in just seconds, how quiet it is while in use, and how fresh her hair feels after each use.</li>
            <li> Okay overall I love the feel of the blow dryer in my hand, the handle is awesome.  I like the three speeds, the hot, warm and cool.  I like the cool burst.  I like the ion equalizer.  The diffuser works well.  The back pops off easily for cleaning.  My hair looked great when I was done.  One time when I had my hair flipped over and was blow drying upside down my hair got sucked into the back of the dryer through the vent.  I panicked since I was getting married in a week and my hair actually had to be cut off.  Sad thing is the hair got sucked in twice more.  Otherwise great dryer, just be wary of the rear vent.</li>
            <li> I like this unit after reading product description. I ordered it. I have to travel to countries where we have 220Volt power supply and I purchased a special voltage converter for hair dryers only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it and read the safety guidlines in the note inside the package, I came to know I can not use this product with extension wires or with voltage converters. So this beautiful looking piece is no more good for me :(</li>
            <li> awesome blow dryer! does the job and does it well!</li>
            <li> Holy Toledo.  This dryer is powerful!  I lost my last dryer in a flood, researched a little and found this.  My last dryer I love and had for 20 years.  It was really highly recommended.  I have thin medium length hair.  It definitely blew it around a lot but I just picked up my brush.  3 minutes later I was done! Definitely less frizz and fly always.  Great quality for a great price.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this dryer is amazing! I have long, thick, naturally curly hair, and I use a hair dryer a few times a week with a round ceramic brush to straighten it. I previously had a $150 professional grade dryer (5 years, and it finally died), and I did some research prior to buying a new one to see if I could save that expense. I bought this dryer and I was shocked that it actually worked BETTER than my $150 dryer! My hair is softer, the blow out lasts longer, and it dried faster then my old dryer. Must buy! If it works on my difficult to straighten hair, it will definitely work on anyones!</li>
            <li> I bought this blowdryer after reading multiple magazine and Amazon reviews. I had some issues getting the nozzle to stay on properly, but never experienced issues with my hair getting sucked up into it (and I have very long hair). This hairdryer cut my blowdry time by half, and gave my hair a glossy, shiny finish before the use of any product. Would highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> First of all I like the design of this product and the quality w.r.t performance and functionality. Delivery was on time as well! therefore I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good replacement for my old Remington hair dryer &amp; I finally found it! I love it because it dries my hair super fast, it has very strong blowing power!  My hair dries silky &amp; straight just how I like it. This dryer is also pretty quiet, it doesn&#x27;t have that loud high pitched noise like most dryers do. It might be a little heavy to some people that are not used to Professional hair dryers but the weight doesn&#x27;t bother me, it weighs the same as my old one. I&#x27;m not sure why some people wrote reviews about the dryer sucking in their hair, I have had no issues with that whatsoever. I am very happy with this hair dryer &amp; I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> very good working and I like me hear after the ions</li>
            <li> I loved the narrow flow on this dryer, and the price was right.  However, a major design flaw (in my opinion)warranted a return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch as well as the temp switches are not sliders, but very easy to press switches.  They are on the handle directly where you hold it, therefore you are constantly switching the heat button without realizing it and then wondering why its taking so long to dry.  Also I kept hitting the power button moving it from high to low so I had to keep switching it back.  I tried holding it different ways, and I was able to when drying certain areas of my head, but there is just no avoiding having to hold it right where the switches are.  This is unfortunate because I think otherwise this was a great dryer.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer works great, easy to use, but it&#x27;s heavy on the arm when carrying long. It has a button to choose the heat level 3, this machine better than I&#x27;ve ever used, I like it.</li>
            <li> It works perfect.....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews; but this hair dryer is the absolute best that I have ever owned and very reasonably priced.  I live in humid south Florida and have shoulder length thick hair that tends to frizz.  I have always taken care to dry my hair carefully and thoroughly with a round brush; however, after a stint in the Florida heat I am all frizz again.  I decided to upgrade my hair dryer and read many reviews before selecting this one.  I do have to add that most of the recommended hair dryers were priced well over $50 which just seems like too much to me.  The Remington AC9096 had both great reviews and a reasonable price and best of all -- IT WORKS.  I can dry my hair very quickly with this dryer using a large round brush and the end result is soft, smooth, shiny, frizz-free hair that stays frizz free even when I am outdoors.  I have not had any issues with my hair getting caught on the dryer, but like I said,  my hair is only shoulder length. If you have hair that tends to frizz in the humidity,  buy this dryer.  You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair amd this dries it in 10min! This is a powerful, light hairdryer I am so happy I bought!</li>
            <li> We now own two of these we like them so much.  Works just as well as the much more exspensive versions and comes with a great warranty when compared to other products.  Can not beat the price for what you get.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly grey hair. For years I haven&#x27;t bothered use a hair dryer, because it just promoted frizz. Even the ones I tried with a diffuser did not leave me with the smooth curly look I wanted. Of course, with naturally curly hair, getting what you want is rarely an option, you learn to like what you get for the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was admittedly more interested in how this Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer would work for my dog than how it would work for my own hair, and frankly didn&#x27;t even intend to try it. But, I did try it, just on a whim. I figured that I had the day off and if my hair ended up a little more wild than usual, so be it. I was surprised to find that it did a nice job. I did use the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was bath day for my very furry, very beloved Duncan dog. So I did a lot of trimming and shaping as I always do pre-bath. I like to have some of the worst of the bushy hair trimmed up tight around his back end before I struggle with washing it. He isn&#x27;t a fan of being brushed back there and it is just easier for us both. So I trimmed and tidied and clipped his hobbit-y hairy toes a bit and bathed him with his favorite shampoo and conditioner. (Okay, i picked it out, but he hasn&#x27;t complained )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Duncan is an older fella and a rescue. WE put him at age 12-13 or so. He was found as a stray ten years ago, and we rescued him from a last chance sanctuary. One of the best decisions I ever made was to take the five hour trip to bring him home. He&#x27;s glad, too and makes sure that I know it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some brisk shaking, then towel drying I pulled out the nice quiet Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer, and popped on the diffuser. He was dry and comfortable in no time. The noise level matters for him, as loud noises make him uncomfortable. He looks beautiful, was not stressed out by the drying and is shiny and beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, we both approve heartily ! And we both recommend it!! And we both recommend it!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works great.  It has enough power to get the job done fast, while not being too heavy and tiring my arms.  I like the rocker power switch location in the \\&quot;neck\\&quot; of the dryer, as it&#x27;s easy to control with my thumb, unlike my old dryer.  This isn&#x27;t a five star review because of the attachments.  I struggled trying to get one of them on and off.  Then, when I got the concentrator on, I didn&#x27;t like it.  It concentrates the air flow in one direction, but as I move the dryer, that position  doesn&#x27;t always work.  I found the dryer works best for me without the attachments.</li>
            <li> Pardon my pun in the title, but I&#x27;m not overly impressed by this blow dryer. The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was it&#x27;s weight. It&#x27;s quite heavy, and much heavier than my last two blow dryers. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll get tired of holding something heavier, but I am hoping that it&#x27;s an indication of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the three heat settings, two air speeds and the cool shot of air, which can be used while drying. It is quieter than my last dryer, which was a Conair with the same wattage. The dryer is a little awkward to hold, however, and I had trouble changing heat and speed while holding it midair and drying my hair. It did dry my hair faster but not by much. I used both attachments to see how they work and diffuser worked like it should - giving curl without the frizz. I had trouble getting the concentrator attachment on the end, and then it blew off the dryer both times that I used it. I don&#x27;t know if mine just doesn&#x27;t fit well, but that was a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem like I&#x27;m being knitpicky in this review, but I&#x27;m just trying to cover all the bases for a blow dryer. After saying all that, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - dry my hair. If it lasts longer than my last two blow dryers, then I&#x27;ll be really happy.</li>
            <li> Love how fast it dries my hair and leaves my hair with a shine.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has good power to it. It is a little heavier than I expected, but I can handle that. What I don&#x27;t like is the cheapness of the two attachments. They both fall off when being used. I have called the company to report this. No matter how I try to twist them or push them, they both fall off with use.</li>
            <li> best hair drier I have ever owned you should get the  silk ceramic flat iron 2 inch plates to go with it, this hair drier dries my hair so fast with no knots no frizz leaves hair soft and manageable before I comb it to flat iron it.</li>
            <li> Worst hair dryer ever! After reading reviews that said this dryer was good for long thick curly hair I purchased it. I&#x27;ve given it a chance over and over but it does not dry my hair.  Stay away if you have thick hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer in March based on Amazon reviews. It worked ok at the  beginning but now no longer has any air pressure and takes at least 2x as long to dry my hair. The return period for this product is one month and now I need to purchase another new hair dryer. Very displeased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Love how quickly it drys my thick hair, it&#x27;s great for blowouts, and thanks to the accompanying accessories you can choose precision for blowouts or diffusing for curls, waves, and scrunching.</li>
            <li> Powerful and not too loud</li>
            <li> I just bought it in Oct. It literally caught on fire and is no longer usable. I had a Remington that lasted 3 years. This lasted 2 mths!!! Not sure that I will buy another in future.</li>
            <li> AWESOME blow dryer. Dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> so far it works perfect, didnt have any trouble with my hair getting sucked in</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer! Options for speeds &amp; options for heat settings - exactly what I wanted. And quieter than my last one, which was a bonus! And a fun red, sparkly color too!</li>
            <li> If I could give 0 stars for the rating I would!!!! Thank you for STEALING my money! I bought this blow dryer about a month ago to replace the dryer I owned for the past 10 years. Today I went to blow dry my hair it turned on and then cut out and died. I&#x27;m SO very upset that this dryer didn&#x27;t even last a month when my previous dryer lasted for 10 YEARS. I would like a replacement or credit to my account so I can purchase an item that will last me LONGER THAN ONE MONTH. This is absolutely ridiculous!!!!! I can&#x27;t even return the item because the return date ended on 2/18 and it is 2/26. I am EXTEREMELY UPSET and DISSATISFIED.</li>
            <li> I think It&#x27;s a good product, It leaves your hair soft and it dries it easily, It fullfiled my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, so I don&#x27;t know if it was a fluke or my imagination, but my hair does seem particularly nice and soft today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair and did not experience my hair getting stuck in the fan, although I know that can happen with any dryer. I don&#x27;t see why this dryer would be any worse than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS stronger than my old dryer but I had to try them both back to back to convince myself, the difference is not dramatic. I like having two speeds and three temps that operate independently, so you can have high heat and low fan if you want, or vice versa. I&#x27;ve never had a cool temp before so I tried it, who knows, maybe that is why my hair feels especially nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely heavier than the average cheap blow dryer but it did seem that my hair dried quicker so I think it&#x27;s an OK trade-off. Also my old dryer&#x27;s motor sounds pretty cheap and sick after the hum of this one, but I don&#x27;t find much difference in loudness or tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the rocker controls. The whole reason I bought a new dryer is that my really old dryer died, I had a spare hanging around the house that I started to use, but it has slider controls and I found it impossible to change settings without stopping and looking and even then it was hard to move the sliders. With this new dryer I can easily change a setting and I find it easy to keep my fingers slightly to the side of the controls to avoid accidentally making changes.</li>
            <li> Amazing design! Good power, comfortable to use!</li>
            <li> This is like no other dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  My 5 year old dryer caught fire . After a few quick looks around my rural&lt;br /&gt;town for  any kind of dryer,  (Dryers are dryers. Right?), and coming up empty,  I just went online and with little consideration except price, in 5 minutes I just clicked  the buy button &amp; forgot about it.  When it arrived and I used it , it was a force!  My hair dryed  practically instantly and with added volume.  It has many buttons.  Not sure what all are for.  Can&#x27;t read them without my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;Just pushed them all until I get fastest &amp; hotest.  I can use my round brush &amp; this dryer and dry &amp; style my hair faster than with any of my specialty  hair stylers. Just a few minutes. ( I have shortish hair)  I&#x27;ve got the &amp;#34;Instyler&amp;#34; $100+  &amp; The Pefecter Fusion Styler $100+  &amp; others.  I can&#x27;t pinpoint why this one works better in lightening speed.... (  I think it was $20 or $30.)....  but it does.  Do yourself a big favor &amp; look no further.  It&#x27;s no gamble at all. With Amazon you can return it.</li>
            <li> was very heavy at first but I am uesd to it now and love the blow dryer</li>
            <li> It dries hair quickly but is quite heavy. It does have several levels of heat, including a non-heat blow dry setting. It seems to be well-made and I like the bright color of this hair dryer. My biggest complaint about it is its weight. It&#x27;s too heavy to easily move around quickly and thus is sometimes pretty awkward.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price. It used to take me 30 minutes to dry my hair, its very long and thick - now it only takes 15 minutes or less and there is a cool setting, so i can finish up with that to bring the temp of the hair back down and lock in the style.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this hair dryer overall.  I previously had a ConAir and in comparison I think this one is of higher quality.  It is heavier than my previous one, but I think this is due to the quality of the motor which I am hoping does in fact help this hair dryer to last longer than most.  It does feel slightly awkward due to the weight and length of the barrel, but nothing that I found as a hindrance.  I noticed that several other reviewers had trouble with getting their hair stuck in the rear vent, I have long hair and have yet to have this problem, but I do agree that a cap of some sort would be nice to prevent this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer includes three different heat settings- I found one to be quite hot, one warm, and one cool.  It also included two speeds.  I have found that the fastest speed is best used with attachments otherwise my long hair would get quite tangled.  As far as time, it seems slightly faster, though not as noticeable as I thought it might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does feel quite smooth and seems to be less heat damaged from my drying, though I think time will tell if this hair dryer is truly \\&quot;salon quality\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer but it pulled so much amps that i can&#x27;t you use it oin my bathroom off of my 15amp GFI outlet</li>
            <li> Present for my wife, works well, great quality for its price. Would consider this again if anything happens to our current one.</li>
            <li> Got rid of all my fizz and love how you can set an area with the push of the cool button</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer i have purchased in a long time</li>
            <li> To much noise but does the work.</li>
            <li> Ive been blowdrying my hair for years why didn&#x27;t I buy this sooner?! It dries my hair in half the time</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my girlfriend! Good price and quality. The product arrived in the stipulated time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something better</li>
            <li> styling hair in style</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is very powerful.  I thought it would be very nosy because I&#x27;ve never had a home hair dryer that wasn&#x27;t; however, it was actually pretty quiet for a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two speeds: medium and fast.  The medium is so powerful I thought it would be enough to dry my thick, long hair, but it doesn&#x27;t run at its hottest on medium speed.  Turn it up to full blast though and it&#x27;s as hot as any professional hair dryer my hair dresser uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two attachments:  1)the nozzle that directs the air flow in a small space, which is great for styling by running the nozzle down a shaft of hair on a round brush.  This is what I use to make my hair straight.  2) the round diffuser for curly hair.  Scrunch your hair in front of it to diffuse the air flow and keep your locks curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch and the switch to change the temperature are convenient to use while drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coolest part is that it&#x27;s red.</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer is on its last leg so having this &#x27;Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer&#x27; has been a dream. Not only does the price work but it is also packed with features that really make my old hair dryer seem like something out of the past.&lt;br /&gt;The features:&lt;br /&gt;-Has three setting for hair drying (just like my old dryer)&lt;br /&gt;-Drys must faster then my old one&lt;br /&gt;-Two cooling air speeds that can be used while drying&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t frizz up hair after using (my hold one would give me major frizz)&lt;br /&gt;-Also not too heavy (My old dryer was very heavy &amp; bulky to hold the whole time I dry my hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used this for the last couple of weeks, I have to say how happy I am with it. Drys my hair really fast &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> This sleek hair dryer really packs a punch. It dries my thick hair SO much faster than my other hair dryer. The different speed and heat settings are so nice (2 speeds, 3 heat settings). It comes with two attachments, and I especially like the concentrator attachment to help dry strands of hair nicely without blowing the rest of my hair around like crazy. So far this hair dryer has proven to be a quality product - I really like it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best dryers I&#x27;ve had.  It dries hair quickly, has three temperature buttons and even a cool shot button and it&#x27;s quiet.  It left my hair softer and fuller.  It&#x27;s easy to hold and if it didn&#x27;t suck my hair into the motor, it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;How did this design problem get past quality control?</li>
            <li> Wife loves it.  Best shes ever used.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair dryers you can buy for the price. Don&#x27;t hesitate and just get it! I have shoulder length hair and haven&#x27;t gotten my hair caught in the vent yet, and I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a month.</li>
            <li> I saw this in People Style and wanted to try it.  I have long thick hair and it cut my drying time in half.  It&#x27;s perfect and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This is MY FAVORITE hair dryer that I have ever bought! It works wonderfully. I would absolutely buy another one tomorrow if this one broke. I love the different settings on this hair dryer. I find when I am drying my hair, I don&#x27;t need to straighten my hair afterwards because my hair looks nice and straight.</li>
            <li> The weight is inordinately heavy! Why? My old dryer weight was like nothing in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job, but I&#x27;d recommend a lighter model to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer. The diffusing attachment is my favorite part!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick, wavy, shoulder length hair.  This dryer drys it in minutes.  Also, if I use a brush to blow dry it I even manage to straighten it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good, steady product so far.  Only concern is the weight. Bit heavy.</li>
            <li> ItÂ´s an Excellent hair dryer :D</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully but just a little heavy.</li>
            <li> it is just what my wife want, she is so happy with the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Terrible for curly hair. The air outlet and diffuser for this dryer are very small -- it does not diffuse gently, rather the air blows in a hard stream creating frizz and breaking up curls. I will be throwing this dryer out or giving it away.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Does not frizz out my hair at all in fact it smooths it really well and gives me that just went to the salon look.</li>
            <li> When my hair dryer arrived, the first thing I noticed was that it had a good heft; it was slightly heavy, but not too much so, indicative of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions may not seem important to some people, but the instructions for this dryer are very clear.  I&#x27;d always wondered how the diffuser and the concentrator attachments with hair dryers work, and these instructions were helpful.  Users can easily decide which one to use for their hair type and their desired hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thick, rather porous hair dries slightly more quickly with this dryer than my old one; even a little difference can be important to a user in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance is easier than with many other hair dryers; the small screen in the back comes off for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that I selected this hair dryer, and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a hair dryer actually drying hair faster, but was pleasantly surprised when it did seem to cut a few minutes off of my drying time. This dryer has a good amount of power and has a compact design.  It does have multiple heat and power settings, but I&#x27;m mostly a high heat, high power girl, so that&#x27;s all I use.  It does also leave my hair smooth and soft.  It&#x27;s a great dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has a lot of nice features.  It comes with a concentrator and a diffuser for straight hair and curly hair, respectively.  It has two speed settings as well as three heat settings.  I particularly like that it has three heat settings, as I prefer cooler air when I dry my hair.  I found that it dried my hair quicker than my old hair dryer and seemed a bit quieter as well.  I have long hair and had no problem with it getting stuck in the dryer.  My only minor quibble is that I wish you didn&#x27;t have to hold down the cool shot button to use it.  But that is an extremely minor issue.  Overall, this is a great hairdryer and I am very impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I liked this dryer ... UNTIL it sucked my hair in the back vent.  I currently use a Conair ionic Hair Dryer, which is very heavy ... but I really like it.  I thought I had found a lighter replacement with this hair dryer.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t keep having my hair sucked into the back vent since it damages my hair, but usually needs to be cut to get the hair out.  This dryer would be great if that vent had some sort of cover to keep the hair out of the fan.</li>
            <li> Despite having a perforated metal screen at the air intake, hair can be painfully sucked in! I was quite surprised when this happened, as others said there was no screen on the hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that (and the fact that it&#x27;s a bit heavy and unbalanced), this hairdryer yields very smooth results. My previous hairdryer, another brand of ionic with 1875 watts, did a good job but rarely was my hair as shiny and smooth. This Remington dries faster and I love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the results are great, I don&#x27;t want to be forced to modify how I dry my hair in order to avoid it being yanked out. If your hair is less than 3&amp;#34; long, this might not be a problem for you. Mine is 6-7&amp;#34; long in places, so this dryer will most likely go back to the store where it was purchased (at the same price as online here).</li>
            <li> Purchased this without much research, so I am to blame for not &amp;#34;loving&amp;#34; this.  It&#x27;s heavy, loud and I prefer more ranges in heat than it offers.  The attachments work well.  It&#x27;s mid-sized, so if you&#x27;re wanting something light and small, this isn&#x27;t it.  Mid-sized and heavy......I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The best hair dryer I have used in 15 years. My hair is thick and unruly. Humidity makes it impossible to do anything but this hair dryer has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer works better than other blow dryers in the past, in that it is quieter. In addtion, there are 3 heat settings so if your scalp is sensitive to heat, you have the option of lower heat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see that it makes my hair that much smoother but it works very well, also like the cold blast button.</li>
            <li> I hate this hair dryer. It&#x27;s the worst hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. My non-ionic hair dryers from the 1980&#x27;s were better. It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly. It doesn&#x27;t dry evenly. My hair ends up poofy , frizzy, dull, and fried looking. Fried because, despite my squeezing out as much moisture as possible in a microfiber towel and drying and small sections, not staying in one section too long, I have to almost &amp;#34;over dry&amp;#34; my hair because the drying is so uneven, I end up with damp areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air flow feels weak, yet it&#x27;s very loud. The highest setting does get hot but the drying ability is so poor, all it seems to do is scorch the closest hairs, while leaving others wet. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t buy this dryer directly myself, otherwise I&#x27;d return or exchange it. It was a replacement for a different model T-studio dryer I bought which was under warranty and malfunctioning. I paid to send it in. Remington sent me this dryer as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I couldn&#x27;t figure out why there are so many positive reviews on this item. I think it&#x27;s because most of the reviewers received it for free. I&#x27;m not saying they were coerced to give positive reviews. It&#x27;s just that, if you look at reviews on any type of product, you&#x27;ll notice that reviewers aren&#x27;t very objective. They take the price into account when giving their opinion. Some will even state, &amp;#34;Had it been cheaper, I would have rated it higher or more favorably.&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s hard to be critical of something you got for free.</li>
            <li> The good: powerful, fast drying that leaves hair feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: too much power on the low speed leaves lots of flyaways and substantially reduces control over the finished style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer has a lot of power, which is great for getting your hair from wet to damp quickly. The problem is that this hairdryer has too much power on the low speed for a polished set and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a hairdryer that would complete the first 50% of hair drying quickly, but then allow me to use a lower speed with my round brush to get a smooth finish. This dryer just has too much power going to it at the low speed setting, which means I get lots of flyaways. If you always flat iron or curl after drying, or if you don&#x27;t care about style and just want to get your hair dry fast, or (maybe) if you have really thick strands, this could be a great dryer. With my medium-fine hair, I just can&#x27;t get that polished set that I&#x27;m looking for. My hair does feel nice after I dry it, and if I&#x27;m planning to curl or flat iron after drying then I really appreciate how fast I can get my hair dry. However, I don&#x27;t like that I MUST flat iron or curl my hair to get it to look finished. If this dryer had a third, lower speed setting, or if the low speed setting had 30% less power, this would be a GREAT hairdryer. As it is, I break out my old Vidal Sassoon 1875 to finish the style (I got the Remington when my Vidal Sassoon stopped working on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; and would only work on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Way better quality than I expected for the price! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to try this.  Maybe BaByliss spoiled me I dunno. My hair is way too dry and doesnt hold its shape. Returning and sticking with BaByliss.</li>
            <li> This is a must! I have thin naturally curly hair and I didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair with a blow dryer that was gonna be too rough on me, I gave this one a try and OMG the diffuser and heat settings are perfect. I still have to use it for straightening, I&#x27;m sure its gonna be perfect though</li>
            <li> Wow. This works amazing. Has a very concentrated nozzle but great pressure. And the cool shot is powerful as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer about three months ago and it was great... now it won&#x27;t turn on, no matter what I do. It has not been damaged at all, it&#x27;s not dusty inside, nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it if it turns to junk this soon!</li>
            <li> The BEST blow dryer I have ever owned. I could go without using my flat iron after using this dryer. I can&#x27;t say enough have awesome this product is. Remington products are supreme for their price. I will continue to recommend this to friends!!</li>
            <li> Cannot use regular hair dryers now.</li>
            <li> One of the best hairdryers around (with two attachments). My only complaint is that it is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> love it wish it had a comb for naturals but it&#x27;s worth it . great blow out Everytime</li>
            <li> Excellent hair dryer!&lt;br /&gt;Kind to hair and dryes hair quicker than other products previously owned.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Received as scheduled</li>
            <li> Strong and powerful, however, it&#x27;s a little too powerful for me. I was looking for a light dryer and this one works, it&#x27;s not super light but it&#x27;s also not too heavy and I didnt want to go through the hassle of returning.</li>
            <li> As much as I hate to admit it, in conjunction with the Cricket Technique 400 thermal brush, my hair is as closest to a salon blowout as I have ever gotten it! It feels light and airy like it does when I leave my hairdresser. It is relatively quiet, the design is very nice - I like the smoothness of the handle. Love that it comes with concentrator and diffuser as I use both since I have naturally curly curly hair! I am pleased with this and will update later if need be because I JUST received it in the mail today. I also have long hair and didn&#x27;t have a problem with the back as some others have.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer and very quiet!</li>
            <li> Lite weight, easy too handle, and  dry fast. Does get as hot  as I would like.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister as a gift, and she loves it she said her hair dries so much quicker and smoother.</li>
            <li> I love it! My hair looks and feels soft and shines. Candy best this deal!</li>
            <li> I returned this hair dryer. I didn&#x27;t like how small the tip of the barrel is. I like to use the concentrator and a round brush to blow dry my hair and with such a smal barrel it took longer. Mine also rattled and it&#x27;s really heavy. I also didn&#x27;t care for the heat settings...medium was too cool and hot was too hot. The back intake will suck your hair into it if you aren&#x27;t careful. I bought a conair to replace this one. They seem to always be my favorite hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complaint about its functions.  However, it is way too heavy to hold for more than a few minutes.  Fine for my short hair, but not for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> The Remington AC9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer is fantastic! I have thick hair and needed a hair dryer that could handle it without taking what seems like forever. I finally found it with this one and I am as pleased as can be. It took me half the time to dry my hair than it did in the past and thanks to the ionic setting, my hair looks and feels so much healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li> Nice velocity and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.  Cold button a good feature.</li>
            <li> little bit heavier than expected.</li>
            <li> Pros:  -- Price    Cons:  -- Build quality, way bigger size and noise</li>
            <li> This dryer is amazing!!! Used it for the first time today. Leaves hair very soft and no frizz. It is a little heavier than a normal hair dryer, but I love it!!!</li>
