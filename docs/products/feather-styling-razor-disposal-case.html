            <li>great way to safely dispose  of safety razors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Works fine happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large and yet it  fits my medicine cabinet shelf perfectly.</li>
            <li>Nice with nice price.</li>
            <li>If you want this to sit on your vanity among your nice chrome razor, stand, and soap bowl...</li>
            <li>Nice for.</li>
            <li>so none of the blades I own came with it&#x27;s own plastic disposal case I could use</li>
            <li>There are some disposable razors that come with ways to dispose of your razor along with their own packaging.</li>
            <li>Great idea well executed and priced right!</li>
            <li>Great, but I don&#x27;t think it will fit as many blades as suggested by others.</li>
            <li>i suggest putting a piece of duck tap on the top to make sure non of your blades fall out if you carry this in your workout bag!</li>
            <li>I guess it suitable for it intended purpose, but I don&#x27;t understand why it would be needed.  </li>
            <li>Very handsome presentation of the product, and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>It does well at storing used blades and can store a good amount until full.</li>
            <li>there are solutions to the issue of disposing blades without having to dish out more money than what it would cost to get a can of soup, a can of dog food, and so on.</li>
            <li>But oh wait, this product was designed for blades so it must be better.</li>
            <li>Or better yet you can use just about any medicine bottle for instance</li>
            <li>Advil Ibuprofen bottles which are now my favorite choice for blades.</li>
            <li>me trying to put a slot in the medicine bottle, it basically destroyed the top.</li>
            <li>just recently got the latest and greatest in blade disposal.</li>
            <li>What makes this better than all others is you can open and close it one-handed and perfect for travel.</li>

            <li>What makes this better than all others is you can open and close it one-handed and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>The sides and corners are scuffed and scraped, the lettering is worn, and best of all there are whiskers inside of it GROSS!</li>
            <li>Stores uses razor blades safely.  </li>
            <li>Ok, it&#x27;s plastic</li>
            <li>Really cheap insurance!</li>
            <li>I wanted a better place to put my used blades.</li>
            <li>Works great and looks like it will hold a couple hundred used blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not very presentable though.  </li>
            <li>better than just tossing them in the trash</li>
            <li>Great product and much safer for storing the blades.</li>
            <li>This holds more than 100 blades.</li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t slip out, and they can be disposed of safely.</li>
            <li>But I am sure that they want you to throw the thing away for safety reasons and then sell you another one.</li>
            <li>Need something to safely dispose of razor blades.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a blade bank, what more could you want?</li>
            <li>so I can leave my razor on the stand without fear of my son touching it and getting hurt.</li>
            <li>The construction is quality and well made, it appears it will hold well more than 100 razors.</li>
            <li>It retains your used blades safely.</li>
            <li>I bought this to dispose of my razor blades in a safe way.</li>
            <li>so need a place to safely store my used razors.</li>
            <li>This disposal case allows me an easy way to safely keep my blades from getting anyone in the house hurt.</li>
            <li>The blades fit in the top.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this disposal case, I feel like it will protect my kids should they ever become curious what it is</li>
            <li>I felt the nice &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; label was worth the $0.50.</li>
            <li>Easy to add razors.</li>
            <li>compact and easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I feel strongly on this point, but in the end I am no position to tell anyone what to do.</li>
            <li>Nothing special; compact and safe.</li>
            <li>Case works fine though I didn&#x27;t realize the feather razor packs already have a slot to discard used blades.</li>
            <li>are huge.</li>
            <li>are huge.</li>
            <li>This thing is HUGE compared to the blades.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t leave rust stains, and not even a quarter filled and been doing that method for 3 years now.</li>
            <li>When filled if ever, tape it shut and throw it away or see about recycling</li>
            <li>Such a great thing to have if you are a safety razor shaver and have children in the house.</li>
            <li>cheap blade bank, does the job.</li>
            <li>Great product idea and holds a ton of discard double edged blades.</li>
            <li>It does keep the blades secure which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>As expected, he loved it!</li>
            <li>How excited can someone get over this?</li>
            <li>It does have a large opening in the top that could pose an issue if you were to play catch with it for whatever reason, but if you go to dispose of this container and place some tape or rubber bands around it, nothing will ever come out.</li>
            <li>Pretty good so far.</li>
            <li>This is a much easier and better solution.</li>
            <li>probably around 1-200 before it&#x27;s full.  </li>
            <li>It does what it is supposed to do, and that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy another as soon as this one is full.  </li>
            <li>Wet blades kind of stick on the way in but otherwise Its better than searching for something to put blades in</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s already in your medicine cabinet, it doesn&#x27;t take up additional space, and since you have to handle it to get the new blade out, it couldn&#x27;t be more convenient.</li>
            <li>Handy little thing for safe disposal of used blades..</li>
            <li>every 2 years+/- investment and worth it.</li>
            <li>and it looks pretty full.</li>
            <li>Also looks nice in the medicine cabinet next to the shave mug and soap.</li>
            <li>This is worth the cost just to alleviate the 5 seconds of frustration as I try to find a safe way to dispose of old blades.  </li>
            <li>I use old prescription plastic cases with a screw top.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the peace of mind and price.</li>
            <li>Definitely useful if you use safety razors in the shower.</li>
            <li>you know I am right on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re throwing it away, right?</li>
            <li>Great thing to have around if you just bought a pack of 100 blades as these are usually packed in bulk and not in the plastic slide packs that have the built in used blades receptacle.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says, just a big safe plastic case for dumping razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A simple, safe, non-reusable blade disposal case.  </li>
            <li>I put all my used blades in an old pill bottle that I got for free with a prescription.</li>
            <li>There really is not too much to say about this blade disposal case, but it does the job it is expected to do, perfectly.</li>
            <li>also the bottom of the feather razor blades has a slot for disposal if you don&#x27;t want to store so many in this larger size.</li>
            <li>Drop your used razor blades into the slot and they&#x27;re safely stored for future disposal.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it supposed to do: hold used razors.</li>
            <li>I always assumed the slot on the back of the case was a &#x27;blade safe&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>exactly what the tin box is and not that is has discarded razors inside.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a safe way to discard their razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a decent size container and looks like it could hold 2-3 years worth of used blades.</li>
            <li>I pretty much get a 4-6 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be frank, do you really need experience to chime in on this product?</li>
            <li>Thanks again MRMOM for the</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be frank, do you really need experience to chime in on this product?</li>
            <li>Thanks again MRMOM for the</li>
            <li>What can you really say about a mini trash can?</li>
            <li>It holds over 50 blades and when it gets filled up I bring it to the fire station where they put it in a sharpes container for proper disposal.</li>
            <li>This looks to be much safer to have around.</li>
            <li>Product is just as described, serves its purpose and doesnt take up much space in your cabinet.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really matter since it will be used for discarded blades anyway.</li>
            <li>Its safer and more secure than sliding the blades back into the empty box.</li>
            <li>After my wife cut her finger cleaning out the trash I had to start disposing of my razors a bit more carefully.  </li>
            <li>This makes blade disposal so much easier.  </li>
            <li>Yes, these can be made out of deodorant cases or other household items, but if you want a ready-made solution, this is cheap, simple, safe, and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Just chuck it once it&#x27;s full - and at the current rate that should be well over a year or two for me.</li>
            <li>Classic Shaving sells medal ones without logo for 99 cents.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have this particular product but wanted to pass on a money saving tip.</li>
            <li>Yes, I highly recommend this if a guy will use it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>If you use double edged razor blades I highly recommend this item!!!</li>
            <li>What is even better, when the next medicine bottle comes, I can just close the previous bottle, dispose of those blades, and a new fresh bottle.</li>
            <li>What is even better, when the next medicine bottle comes, I can just close the previous bottle, dispose of those blades, and a new fresh bottle.</li>
            <li>like those manufacturers that are making their &amp;#34;own&amp;#34; version of a lacrosse ball to massage knots out of your back when a $3.00 lacrosse ball will work just as good if not better, but</li>
            <li>Simple but useful product</li>
            <li>It is so simple and useful.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, most of the plastic blade packs have a disposal side, but after a few dozen paper blade packs, those will fill up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple, safe and necessary appliance for those that use DE blades -- haven&#x27;t filled one yet, but will likely last a year or so with weekly blade changes.</li>
            <li>once filled  i will write sharp blades and drop it into my recycle bin..</li>
            <li>This was advertised as new, but the one I got is anything</li>
            <li>should also note I&#x27;m a new safety razor shaver</li>
            <li>It is made out of hard plastic to store your straight razors safely.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how many razors it can hold.  </li>
            <li>Plenty large enough for 100s of blades.</li>
            <li>You can open it if you have to by squeezing the sides and then pulling back on the top so the tabs come loose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also like to add that the product costs $7.98; I can get at least 2 cans of soup probably more for that amount.</li>
            <li>I can easily fit a few thousand blades in that.</li>
            <li>I can easily fit a few thousand blades in that.</li>
            <li>I have three daughters under 6 years old and they are fascinated with shaving and my razor.  </li>
            <li>Disposal of old blades, does not rust and stain your marble counters like the steel version</li>
            <li>Old fashioned thinking is involved here.</li>
            <li>I hear a lot of people just reuse old containers like Altoids mint tin boxes,</li>
            <li>My kids are nosy and I can see my 3 year old daughter trying to get into Daddy&#x27;s stuff or the garbage and accidentally hurt herself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently going through a big variety pack of razors to find the right one for me</li>
            <li>If you are really lucky and get one of those over-sized prescription containers that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>If you are really lucky and get one of those over-sized prescription containers that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>Too small for myself, I&#x27;ll easily fill one of these in a year.  </li>
            <li>No new cutting edge technology, just a simple safe effective device to store used blades</li>
            <li>While you COULD open this and empty out the blades, it&#x27;s designed to be disposable once full.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily because I have small kids and was concerned about them finding my discarded razor blades.</li>
            <li>I guess I could have used some other plastic containers but my first choice, a camera film box,</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m happy that ibgotbthis, it&#x27;s incredibly ugly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got nice chrome shaving equipment and then this random plastic thing.</li>
            <li>I especially like that I can open it ( using a small screwdriver) and dump out the old blades ( to a safe container for the trash)  when it gets full...and that will be in a LONG time!</li>
            <li>Simple, holds a lot of spent blades without looking tacky and keeps one from having to dispose of them on the reverse side of the 5 blade packages (which is harder to put them into - and as such has a higher potential for blade disposal related nicks)</li>

            <li> just recently got the latest and greatest in blade disposal.</li>
            <li> What makes this better than all others is you can open and close it one-handed and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Or better yet you can use just about any medicine bottle for instance</li>

            <li> The sides and corners are scuffed and scraped, the lettering is worn, and best of all there are whiskers inside of it GROSS!</li>
            <li> Stores uses razor blades safely.  </li>
            <li> Ok, it&#x27;s plastic</li>
            <li> Really cheap insurance!</li>
            <li> I wanted a better place to put my used blades.</li>
            <li> Works great and looks like it will hold a couple hundred used blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not very presentable though.  </li>
            <li> better than just tossing them in the trash</li>
            <li> Great product and much safer for storing the blades.</li>
            <li> This holds more than 100 blades.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t slip out, and they can be disposed of safely.</li>
            <li> But I am sure that they want you to throw the thing away for safety reasons and then sell you another one.</li>
            <li> Need something to safely dispose of razor blades.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a blade bank, what more could you want?</li>
            <li> so I can leave my razor on the stand without fear of my son touching it and getting hurt.</li>
            <li> The construction is quality and well made, it appears it will hold well more than 100 razors.</li>
            <li> It retains your used blades safely.</li>
            <li> I bought this to dispose of my razor blades in a safe way.</li>
            <li> so need a place to safely store my used razors.</li>
            <li> This disposal case allows me an easy way to safely keep my blades from getting anyone in the house hurt.</li>
            <li> The blades fit in the top.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this disposal case, I feel like it will protect my kids should they ever become curious what it is</li>
            <li> I felt the nice &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; label was worth the $0.50.</li>
            <li> Easy to add razors.</li>
            <li> compact and easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I feel strongly on this point, but in the end I am no position to tell anyone what to do.</li>
            <li> Nothing special; compact and safe.</li>
            <li> Case works fine though I didn&#x27;t realize the feather razor packs already have a slot to discard used blades.</li>
            <li> are huge.</li>
            <li> are huge.</li>
            <li> This thing is HUGE compared to the blades.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t leave rust stains, and not even a quarter filled and been doing that method for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> When filled if ever, tape it shut and throw it away or see about recycling</li>
            <li> Such a great thing to have if you are a safety razor shaver and have children in the house.</li>
            <li> cheap blade bank, does the job.</li>
            <li> Great product idea and holds a ton of discard double edged blades.</li>
            <li> It does keep the blades secure which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> As expected, he loved it!</li>
            <li> How excited can someone get over this?</li>
            <li> It does have a large opening in the top that could pose an issue if you were to play catch with it for whatever reason, but if you go to dispose of this container and place some tape or rubber bands around it, nothing will ever come out.</li>
            <li> Pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> This is a much easier and better solution.</li>
            <li> probably around 1-200 before it&#x27;s full.  </li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do, and that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy another as soon as this one is full.  </li>
            <li> Wet blades kind of stick on the way in but otherwise Its better than searching for something to put blades in</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s already in your medicine cabinet, it doesn&#x27;t take up additional space, and since you have to handle it to get the new blade out, it couldn&#x27;t be more convenient.</li>
            <li> Handy little thing for safe disposal of used blades..</li>
            <li> every 2 years+/- investment and worth it.</li>
            <li> and it looks pretty full.</li>
            <li> Also looks nice in the medicine cabinet next to the shave mug and soap.</li>
            <li> This is worth the cost just to alleviate the 5 seconds of frustration as I try to find a safe way to dispose of old blades.  </li>
            <li> I use old prescription plastic cases with a screw top.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the peace of mind and price.</li>
            <li> Definitely useful if you use safety razors in the shower.</li>
            <li> you know I am right on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re throwing it away, right?</li>
            <li> Great thing to have around if you just bought a pack of 100 blades as these are usually packed in bulk and not in the plastic slide packs that have the built in used blades receptacle.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says, just a big safe plastic case for dumping razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A simple, safe, non-reusable blade disposal case.  </li>
            <li> I put all my used blades in an old pill bottle that I got for free with a prescription.</li>
            <li> There really is not too much to say about this blade disposal case, but it does the job it is expected to do, perfectly.</li>
            <li> also the bottom of the feather razor blades has a slot for disposal if you don&#x27;t want to store so many in this larger size.</li>
            <li> Drop your used razor blades into the slot and they&#x27;re safely stored for future disposal.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it supposed to do: hold used razors.</li>
            <li> I always assumed the slot on the back of the case was a &#x27;blade safe&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> exactly what the tin box is and not that is has discarded razors inside.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a safe way to discard their razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a decent size container and looks like it could hold 2-3 years worth of used blades.</li>
            <li> I pretty much get a 4-6 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be frank, do you really need experience to chime in on this product?</li>
            <li> Thanks again MRMOM for the</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be frank, do you really need experience to chime in on this product?</li>
            <li> Thanks again MRMOM for the</li>
            <li> What can you really say about a mini trash can?</li>
            <li> It holds over 50 blades and when it gets filled up I bring it to the fire station where they put it in a sharpes container for proper disposal.</li>
            <li> This looks to be much safer to have around.</li>
            <li> Product is just as described, serves its purpose and doesnt take up much space in your cabinet.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really matter since it will be used for discarded blades anyway.</li>
            <li> Its safer and more secure than sliding the blades back into the empty box.</li>
            <li> After my wife cut her finger cleaning out the trash I had to start disposing of my razors a bit more carefully.  </li>
            <li> This makes blade disposal so much easier.  </li>
            <li> Yes, these can be made out of deodorant cases or other household items, but if you want a ready-made solution, this is cheap, simple, safe, and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just chuck it once it&#x27;s full - and at the current rate that should be well over a year or two for me.</li>
            <li> Classic Shaving sells medal ones without logo for 99 cents.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have this particular product but wanted to pass on a money saving tip.</li>
            <li> Yes, I highly recommend this if a guy will use it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you use double edged razor blades I highly recommend this item!!!</li>
            <li> What is even better, when the next medicine bottle comes, I can just close the previous bottle, dispose of those blades, and a new fresh bottle.</li>
            <li> What is even better, when the next medicine bottle comes, I can just close the previous bottle, dispose of those blades, and a new fresh bottle.</li>
            <li> like those manufacturers that are making their &amp;#34;own&amp;#34; version of a lacrosse ball to massage knots out of your back when a $3.00 lacrosse ball will work just as good if not better, but</li>
            <li> Simple but useful product</li>
            <li> It is so simple and useful.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, most of the plastic blade packs have a disposal side, but after a few dozen paper blade packs, those will fill up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, safe and necessary appliance for those that use DE blades -- haven&#x27;t filled one yet, but will likely last a year or so with weekly blade changes.</li>
            <li> once filled  i will write sharp blades and drop it into my recycle bin..</li>
            <li> This was advertised as new, but the one I got is anything</li>
            <li> should also note I&#x27;m a new safety razor shaver</li>
            <li> It is made out of hard plastic to store your straight razors safely.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how many razors it can hold.  </li>
            <li> Plenty large enough for 100s of blades.</li>
            <li> You can open it if you have to by squeezing the sides and then pulling back on the top so the tabs come loose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would also like to add that the product costs $7.98; I can get at least 2 cans of soup probably more for that amount.</li>
            <li> I can easily fit a few thousand blades in that.</li>
            <li> I can easily fit a few thousand blades in that.</li>
            <li> I have three daughters under 6 years old and they are fascinated with shaving and my razor.  </li>
            <li> Disposal of old blades, does not rust and stain your marble counters like the steel version</li>
            <li> Old fashioned thinking is involved here.</li>
            <li> I hear a lot of people just reuse old containers like Altoids mint tin boxes,</li>
            <li> My kids are nosy and I can see my 3 year old daughter trying to get into Daddy&#x27;s stuff or the garbage and accidentally hurt herself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently going through a big variety pack of razors to find the right one for me</li>
            <li> If you are really lucky and get one of those over-sized prescription containers that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> If you are really lucky and get one of those over-sized prescription containers that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Too small for myself, I&#x27;ll easily fill one of these in a year.  </li>
            <li> No new cutting edge technology, just a simple safe effective device to store used blades</li>
            <li> While you COULD open this and empty out the blades, it&#x27;s designed to be disposable once full.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily because I have small kids and was concerned about them finding my discarded razor blades.</li>
            <li> I guess I could have used some other plastic containers but my first choice, a camera film box,</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m happy that ibgotbthis, it&#x27;s incredibly ugly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got nice chrome shaving equipment and then this random plastic thing.</li>
            <li> I especially like that I can open it ( using a small screwdriver) and dump out the old blades ( to a safe container for the trash)  when it gets full...and that will be in a LONG time!</li>
            <li> Simple, holds a lot of spent blades without looking tacky and keeps one from having to dispose of them on the reverse side of the 5 blade packages (which is harder to put them into - and as such has a higher potential for blade disposal related nicks)</li>
            <li> only improvement that comes to mind would be if the port was from the side because it seems like you&#x27;ll lose some of the &amp;#34;storage&amp;#34; space because the blades need room to go flat.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little high</li>
            <li> I was very careful today when I changed the single edge blades in the blade opening thingy for opening packages or high jacking an airplane.  </li>
            <li> it sort of ruins the old school bathroom vibe.</li>
            <li> This will take quite a long time to fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would be 5 stars if they made it easier to open it to empty and reuse.</li>
            <li> This little box will likely last me a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be worried about having room for a long long time.</li>
            <li> Every Feather DE blade I&#x27;ve ever bought comes in a plastic case; I don&#x27;t think Feather or any blades are sold &#x27;loose&#x27; - in just their paper wrappers.  </li>
            <li> Bitch and moan all you want but deep down inside</li>
            <li> It is very unlikely that any blades should escape, it is incredibly cheap, and it should last for well over a year for even the heaviest of shavers.  </li>
            <li> Simple little case for disposing of razor blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big for its purpose.  </li>
            <li> It might be a little overpriced for a tiny plastic box</li>
            <li> This is a must have disposal for wet shavers especially who have little kids.</li>
            <li> I however think that&#x27;s a little dangerous as most kids will think its</li>
            <li> $5 for a safe place to store my used blades ain&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> Put the blade in it before you get your hand wet.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably just do what the other reviewer said and tape it up to throw it away when it&#x27;s fill.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the blades can slip out, and they&#x27;re still sharp.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive way to store your used blades without possible danger to small children.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very thick and sturdy, as an adult</li>
            <li> I am saying to the consumers on this site that it&#x27;s not worth the money for quite frankly</li>
            <li> So while I didn&#x27;t buy this useless overpriced storage container I use the products that result in people THINKING they need something like this when they really don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the aesthetics though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to do with my blades previously and wrapped them in duct tape</li>
            <li> I realize there are slightly cheaper options on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey for what it is</li>
            <li> Retains used blades as well as, if not better than, any other blade disposal case on the market.</li>
            <li> It could be a little cheaper</li>
            <li> I went with my recently emptied Altoids tin box which I have these at least once a month for I am an Altoid fanatic.</li>
            <li> I went with my recently emptied Altoids tin box which I have these at least once a month for I am an Altoid fanatic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry that they might get into the waste basket.  </li>
            <li> It had a few scuff marks</li>
            <li> so I or others are not injured handling household waste.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done, but it is pretty darn ugly imo</li>
            <li> Hard to give this anything less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> product itself is useless and a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Small hands cannot get in nor can they shake blades out.</li>
            <li> With a small child in the house I toss the blade immediately after shaving</li>
            <li> I would hate to have to wander around the house looking for something to use and this will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard.</li>
            <li> Yes, I recommend this for any guy who has the common sense to use it.  </li>
            <li> It can hold a lot of blades, at least 200</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s where I always put the used blades.  </li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do - keep single razor blades from finding there way to the trash and maybe cutting yourself doing it or carrying out the trash in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> It does its job, but a little expensive since it&#x27;s just a plastic box</li>
            <li> I would rate this product higher because it is helpful but the shipping cost is outrageous.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can store it under the sink or/and in an unused cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Explanation of my 1-star since someone chose to comment that my review was useless here</li>
            <li> If you want to dish it out and buy it IMHO that is sad.</li>
            <li> Seems a bit expensive for a plastic box</li>
            <li> Also I felt a bit uncomfortable with the idea of a lid falling off and having used blades spill all over the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> I would have a difficult time opening this if I tried.</li>
            <li> Safety razors are extremely dangerous to throw away.</li>
            <li> I was afraid my dog would get in my trash bought 4 of these along with my feather blades!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Save your money. Take a can (dog food, soup can, whatever) and use that. I personally have mine in a Zip Lock bag so it doesn&#x27;t leave rust stains, and not even a quarter filled and been doing that method for 3 years now. When filled if ever, tape it shut and throw it away or see about recycling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can store it under the sink or/and in an unused cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Explanation of my 1-star since someone chose to comment that my review was useless here is why I disagree***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is useless and a total waste of money. If you want to dish it out and buy it IMHO that is sad. I am saying to the consumers on this site that it&#x27;s not worth the money for quite frankly there are solutions to the issue of disposing blades without having to dish out more money than what it would cost to get a can of soup, a can of dog food, and so on. Bitch and moan all you want but deep down inside you know I am right on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that the product costs $7.98; I can get at least 2 cans of soup probably more for that amount. But oh wait, this product was designed for blades so it must be better. PLEASE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like those manufacturers that are making their &amp;#34;own&amp;#34; version of a lacrosse ball to massage knots out of your back when a $3.00 lacrosse ball will work just as good if not better, but oh no it wasn&#x27;t sold by XYZ Company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is coming from someone that owns over a 100 Feather Blades, and 1 Futor and a Merkur 34C and others that I gave away. So while I didn&#x27;t buy this useless overpriced storage container I use the products that result in people THINKING they need something like this when they really don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just think outside the box and don&#x27;t spend $7.98 here and there, instead use it towards something of value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, this is my opinion. I feel strongly on this point, but in the end I am no position to tell anyone what to do. It&#x27;s up to the individual to decide for themself. Reviews are to gives ones view/experience with a product. Let&#x27;s be frank, do you really need experience to chime in on this product? Seriously???&lt;br /&gt;***3/9/2015 Update***&lt;br /&gt;As one of my commenters (aka fans of my review) you can also use a medicine bottle. If you are really lucky and get one of those over-sized prescription containers that will last you a long time. Or better yet you can use just about any medicine bottle for instance Advil Ibuprofen bottles which are now my favorite choice for blades. Thanks again MRMOM for the idea.:-D Oh Wait...I could use my Target version of the Ibuprofen for their bottles are huge. I can easily fit a few thousand blades in that. It will probably last longer than me living on this earth. What a concept. I buy it to get medicine for headaches, and when the medicine is all gone, instead of putting it into the recycle-bin, I recycle it myself as a holder to dispose blades. What is even better, when the next medicine bottle comes, I can just close the previous bottle, dispose of those blades, and a new fresh bottle. Man the ideas just keep on coming!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/27/2016 update:&lt;br /&gt;With me trying to put a slot in the medicine bottle, it basically destroyed the top. Since I didn&#x27;t have a replacement within reach I went with my recently emptied Altoids tin box which I have these at least once a month for I am an Altoid fanatic. Just another option you can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/11/2017 update:&lt;br /&gt;I just recently got the latest and greatest in blade disposal. What makes this better than all others is you can open and close it one-handed and perfect for travel. Just don&#x27;t have it in your carry-on people for they don&#x27;t take too well you carrying razor blades on the plane.decide for themself. Reviews are to gives ones view/experience with a product. Let&#x27;s be frank, do you really need experience to chime in on this product? Seriously???&lt;br /&gt;***3/9/2015 Update***&lt;br /&gt;As one of my commenters (aka fans of my review) you can also use a medicine bottle. If you are really lucky and get one of those over-sized prescription containers that will last you a long time. Or better yet you can use just about any medicine bottle for instance Advil Ibuprofen bottles which are now my favorite choice for blades. Thanks again MRMOM for the idea.:-D Oh Wait...I could use my Target version of the Ibuprofen for their bottles are huge. I can easily fit a few thousand blades in that. It will probably last longer than me living on this earth. What a concept. I buy it to get medicine for headaches, and when the medicine is all gone, instead of putting it into the recycle-bin, I recycle it myself as a holder to dispose blades. What is even better, when the next medicine bottle comes, I can just close the previous bottle, dispose of those blades, and a new fresh bottle. Man the ideas just keep on coming!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/27/2016 update:&lt;br /&gt;With me trying to put a slot in the medicine bottle, it basically destroyed the top. Since I didn&#x27;t have a replacement within reach I went with my recently emptied Altoids tin box which I have these at least once a month for I am an Altoid fanatic. Just another option you can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/11/2017 update:&lt;br /&gt;I just recently got the latest and greatest in blade disposal. What makes this better than all others is you can open and close it one-handed and perfect for travel. Just don&#x27;t have it in your carry-on people for they don&#x27;t take too well you carrying razor blades on the plane.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says, just a big safe plastic case for dumping razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement that comes to mind would be if the port was from the side because it seems like you&#x27;ll lose some of the &amp;#34;storage&amp;#34; space because the blades need room to go flat.  On the other hand, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be worried about having room for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I see no issues with this blade case.  It is very unlikely that any blades should escape, it is incredibly cheap, and it should last for well over a year for even the heaviest of shavers.  Yes, these can be made out of deodorant cases or other household items, but if you want a ready-made solution, this is cheap, simple, safe, and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> perfect for keeping used razors out of childrens reach</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a case to put razor blades in. How excited can someone get over this?</li>
            <li> Save your money $$, go buy a piggy bank at the 1.00$ store. Works perfect</li>
            <li> What can you really say about a mini trash can? Does its job and well. A little pricey for what it is but it&#x27;s a one every 2 years+/- investment and worth it.</li>
            <li> Serves it purpose. Perfect</li>
            <li> Great product (&amp; price!)</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> A simple, safe, non-reusable blade disposal case.  Just chuck it once it&#x27;s full - and at the current rate that should be well over a year or two for me.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s intended to do. Safety razors are extremely dangerous to throw away. I found myself trying to put the razors in bottles or cans every week just to discard them.  This is obviously a great solution. I&#x27;ll probably just do what the other reviewer said and tape it up to throw it away when it&#x27;s fill. This will take quite a long time to fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wish someone would invent though is an impermeable liner with a nicer looking disposal so you could just toss the liner. But for now and this really cheap price, it works great!!</li>
            <li> Works well and compact.</li>
            <li> I was afraid my dog would get in my trash bought 4 of these along with my feather blades! Work great i suggest putting a piece of duck tap on the top to make sure non of your blades fall out if you carry this in your workout bag!</li>
            <li> This was advertised as new, but the one I got is anything but. The sides and corners are scuffed and scraped, the lettering is worn, and best of all there are whiskers inside of it GROSS! I suppose that it still holds blades, but I wasn&#x27;t planning on soaking it in bleach to remove all the blood born diseases that also shipped with this order.</li>
            <li> Stores uses razor blades safely.  Seems a bit expensive for a plastic box</li>
            <li> Simple little case for disposing of razor blades.</li>
            <li> This will hold a lot of blades</li>
            <li> Too small for myself, I&#x27;ll easily fill one of these in a year.  I would actually recommend that they move the slot to one of the edges so that it could be laid on it&#x27;s side and blades would just stack inside, neatly, and compactly.</li>
            <li> It is very basic idea. It is made out of hard plastic to store your straight razors safely. If you have kids at home, or worrying about where to throw your razors, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Ok, it&#x27;s plastic so no rust ring, but why would it rust. Put the blade in it before you get your hand wet. Classic Shaving sells medal ones without logo for 99 cents. They&#x27;re coated white. Nice with nice price. You&#x27;re throwing it away, right?</li>
            <li> great way to safely dispose  of safety razors</li>
            <li> Very simple and functional. I didn&#x27;t know what to do with my blades previously and wrapped them in duct tape so I wouldn&#x27;t cut myself. This is a much easier and better solution.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Even ordered one for a friend who loved it.</li>
            <li> I would rate this product higher because it is helpful but the shipping cost is outrageous. It does well at storing used blades and can store a good amount until full.</li>
            <li> Plenty large enough for 100s of blades. You can open it if you have to by squeezing the sides and then pulling back on the top so the tabs come loose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have this particular product but wanted to pass on a money saving tip. I put all my used blades in an old pill bottle that I got for free with a prescription. It holds over 50 blades and when it gets filled up I bring it to the fire station where they put it in a sharpes container for proper disposal.</li>
            <li> Retains used blades as well as, if not better than, any other blade disposal case on the market.</li>
            <li> Great disposal for my feather razor...</li>
            <li> Gave this to my husband on Father&#x27;s Day. As expected, he loved it! Very handsome presentation of the product, and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> The blades fit in the top.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent seller, a real asset for Amazon</li>
            <li> Great, but I don&#x27;t think it will fit as many blades as suggested by others. I have about 20 blades in it and it looks pretty full.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do - keep single razor blades from finding there way to the trash and maybe cutting yourself doing it or carrying out the trash in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Such a great thing to have if you are a safety razor shaver and have children in the house. Small hands cannot get in nor can they shake blades out. Also looks nice in the medicine cabinet next to the shave mug and soap.</li>
            <li> It holds razor blades so you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> Holds all razor blades (not cartriges) - DE, DE, Injector, Feather Artist club, you name it, it fits.  Must have to keep your used blades from injuring someone after disposal.  Will hold a lot of blades - probably around 1-200 before it&#x27;s full.  Really cheap insurance!</li>
            <li> Simple but useful product</li>
            <li> I wanted a better place to put my used blades. I figured this was safer than an Altoid container. While I&#x27;m happy that ibgotbthis, it&#x27;s incredibly ugly. I&#x27;ve got nice chrome shaving equipment and then this random plastic thing. Only complaint is the aesthetics though. If you can get by that then it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great thing to have around if you just bought a pack of 100 blades as these are usually packed in bulk and not in the plastic slide packs that have the built in used blades receptacle. I guess I could have used some other plastic containers but my first choice, a camera film box, has become a rarity since the advent of digital photography. Also I felt a bit uncomfortable with the idea of a lid falling off and having used blades spill all over the bathroom floor. This looks to be much safer to have around.</li>
            <li> Perfect place to stash your used blades and any bills that you don&#x27;t want to pay</li>
            <li> Works great and looks like it will hold a couple hundred used blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not very presentable though.  If you want this to sit on your vanity among your nice chrome razor, stand, and soap bowl...it sort of ruins the old school bathroom vibe.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product, does what they say it will do !!</li>
            <li> better than just tossing them in the trash</li>
            <li> Works well, but a bit pricey for a plastic box with a slot.</li>
            <li> Neat box.  Wet blades kind of stick on the way in but otherwise Its better than searching for something to put blades in</li>
            <li> Good product! I&#x27;m ordering a second just so I will have one for travel!</li>
            <li> it is a perfect system for disposing the razors.. once filled  i will write sharp blades and drop it into my recycle bin..</li>
            <li> A great quality product as advertised!</li>
            <li> Case works fine though I didn&#x27;t realize the feather razor packs already have a slot to discard used blades.</li>
            <li> Great product and much safer for storing the blades.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is so simple and useful.  I have three daughters under 6 years old and they are fascinated with shaving and my razor.  I don&#x27;t have to worry that they might get into the waste basket.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Sturdy. Easy to add razors. Will hold a TON.</li>
            <li> This is worth the cost just to alleviate the 5 seconds of frustration as I try to find a safe way to dispose of old blades.  Yeah, most of the plastic blade packs have a disposal side, but after a few dozen paper blade packs, those will fill up.  I realize there are slightly cheaper options on Amazon.  I felt the nice &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; label was worth the $0.50.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to worry about anybody getting cut in the trashcan.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product! Inexpensive, durable and good quality! Happy with purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Sharp--long lasting. Good</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do, and that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Works fine happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> compact and easy to use</li>
            <li> Simple, holds a lot of spent blades without looking tacky and keeps one from having to dispose of them on the reverse side of the 5 blade packages (which is harder to put them into - and as such has a higher potential for blade disposal related nicks)</li>
            <li> This works for any double edge blades. I use the feather blades. The bottom of the individual blade containers has a space for used blades. The problem is that the blades can slip out, and they&#x27;re still sharp. This holds more than 100 blades. They won&#x27;t slip out, and they can be disposed of safely.</li>
            <li> Very handy for dealing with used blades, no longer worried about whether or not they are going to come through the side of the garbage bag and in eviscerate me.</li>
            <li> There really is not too much to say about this blade disposal case, but it does the job it is expected to do, perfectly.</li>
            <li> cheap blade bank, does the job.</li>
            <li> Product is just as described, serves its purpose and doesnt take up much space in your cabinet.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great idea. Gave it to my husband and asked him what he was doing with his double edged blades. The reply, to my horror, is he said he throws them in the trash. Yikes! This case is sitting well outside the bathroom so who knows if he will be sensible enough to use it. In my opinion this disposal case should be included with the fancy German blades he uses or an ad should be included in any case of double edged blades.  Yes, I recommend this for any guy who has the common sense to use it.  Wake up guys. Don&#x27;t throw a blade in the trash, even if you wrap it well in some animal proof wrappers using the cardboard that could be around the blade. I was very careful today when I changed the single edge blades in the blade opening thingy for opening packages or high jacking an airplane.  Yes, I highly recommend this if a guy will use it. Even animals that go through the trash don&#x27;t deserve a razor blade.</li>
            <li> This thing is HUGE compared to the blades.  This little box will likely last me a couple of years.  It does have a large opening in the top that could pose an issue if you were to play catch with it for whatever reason, but if you go to dispose of this container and place some tape or rubber bands around it, nothing will ever come out.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Nothing special; compact and safe.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive way to store your used blades without possible danger to small children.</li>
            <li> Works as supposed to.</li>
            <li> I especially like that I can open it ( using a small screwdriver) and dump out the old blades ( to a safe container for the trash)  when it gets full...and that will be in a LONG time! It&#x27;s large and yet it  fits my medicine cabinet shelf perfectly.</li>
            <li> My brother purchased this for his razors. The product is very simple. Not much to say about it. It has been working well. It can hold a lot of blades, at least 200 I would say. It had a few scuff marks but it doesn&#x27;t really matter since it will be used for discarded blades anyway.</li>
            <li> This is a great item. If you use double edged razor blades I highly recommend this item!!!</li>
            <li> it gets the job done, but it is pretty darn ugly imo</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> started with a safty razor and made sense to dispose of the used blades</li>
            <li> Simple product with a simple purpose. Its safer and more secure than sliding the blades back into the empty box.</li>
            <li> Would be 5 stars if they made it easier to open it to empty and reuse. But I am sure that they want you to throw the thing away for safety reasons and then sell you another one.</li>
            <li> After my wife cut her finger cleaning out the trash I had to start disposing of my razors a bit more carefully.  This works great...also the bottom of the feather razor blades has a slot for disposal if you don&#x27;t want to store so many in this larger size.</li>
            <li> Great product idea and holds a ton of discard double edged blades. Simple, inexpensive, and functional.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> Nice for. Disposal of old blades, does not rust and stain your marble counters like the steel version</li>
            <li> It does its job, but a little expensive since it&#x27;s just a plastic box</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big for its purpose.  It does keep the blades secure which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Pretty good so far. It could be a little cheaper</li>
            <li> Need something to safely dispose of razor blades.  I am not sure how many razors it can hold.  I figure it will take me 12 months maybe even 18 months to fill. I pretty much get a 4-6 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> I love it. This is a must have disposal for wet shavers especially who have little kids. 5 star</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just what I needed for my discarded blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard. It&#x27;s plastic. Blades won&#x27;t come out (especially if you tape it shut when it&#x27;s full).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. It&#x27;s a blade bank, what more could you want?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, safe and necessary appliance for those that use DE blades -- haven&#x27;t filled one yet, but will likely last a year or so with weekly blade changes.</li>
            <li> Old fashioned thinking is involved here. No new cutting edge technology, just a simple safe effective device to store used blades so I or others are not injured handling household waste. Great idea well executed and priced right!</li>
            <li> Drop your used razor blades into the slot and they&#x27;re safely stored for future disposal. This is a decent size container and looks like it could hold 2-3 years worth of used blades. While you COULD open this and empty out the blades, it&#x27;s designed to be disposable once full. $5 for a safe place to store my used blades ain&#x27;t bad at all. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some money.  I use old prescription plastic cases with a screw top.  Holds a lot of blades and you can throw it away when your done and its secured.  You also get to recycle the plastic cases with an additional use.</li>
            <li> I am a snob and only use my blades once. With a small child in the house I toss the blade immediately after shaving so I can leave my razor on the stand without fear of my son touching it and getting hurt. This disposal case allows me an easy way to safely keep my blades from getting anyone in the house hurt. It might be a little overpriced for a tiny plastic box but it seems like it will hold a ton of blades.</li>
            <li> Hard to give this anything less than 5 stars. It does exactly what it supposed to do: hold used razors.</li>
            <li> Handy little thing for safe disposal of used blades..</li>
            <li> I guess it suitable for it intended purpose, but I don&#x27;t understand why it would be needed.  Every Feather DE blade I&#x27;ve ever bought comes in a plastic case; I don&#x27;t think Feather or any blades are sold &#x27;loose&#x27; - in just their paper wrappers.  I always assumed the slot on the back of the case was a &#x27;blade safe&#x27;.  At least that&#x27;s where I always put the used blades.  And there&#x27;s always plenty of room - even for a ten pack.  Since it&#x27;s already in your medicine cabinet, it doesn&#x27;t take up additional space, and since you have to handle it to get the new blade out, it couldn&#x27;t be more convenient.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily because I have small kids and was concerned about them finding my discarded razor blades. I hear a lot of people just reuse old containers like Altoids mint tin boxes, etc I however think that&#x27;s a little dangerous as most kids will think its exactly what the tin box is and not that is has discarded razors inside. The construction is quality and well made, it appears it will hold well more than 100 razors. The plastic is very thick and sturdy, as an adult I would have a difficult time opening this if I tried. I am very happy with this disposal case, I feel like it will protect my kids should they ever become curious what it is and I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a safe way to discard their razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note I&#x27;m a new safety razor shaver and I bought a bunch of 5 blade sample packs so none of the blades I own came with it&#x27;s own plastic disposal case I could use, I had to find something on my own and again I am very happy with this solution.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  I had it for 2 months and looks like it will take over a year to fill it.</li>
            <li> Great for disposing blades!</li>
            <li> I does what it supposed to do. It retains your used blades safely. The price is a little high but I can amortize the cost over two years.</li>
            <li> I bought this to dispose of my razor blades in a safe way. My kids are nosy and I can see my 3 year old daughter trying to get into Daddy&#x27;s stuff or the garbage and accidentally hurt herself. Definitely worth the peace of mind and price. There are some disposable razors that come with ways to dispose of your razor along with their own packaging. I&#x27;m currently going through a big variety pack of razors to find the right one for me so need a place to safely store my used razors. This works great.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good place to keep razor blades I would recommend this</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product! As Good as Advertised</li>
            <li> This makes blade disposal so much easier.  I would hate to have to wander around the house looking for something to use and this will last a long time.  I plan to buy another as soon as this one is full.  Great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a plastic receptacle for keeping your used DE blades.  Just like you would expect.</li>
            <li> Definitely useful if you use safety razors in the shower.</li>
    </ol>
