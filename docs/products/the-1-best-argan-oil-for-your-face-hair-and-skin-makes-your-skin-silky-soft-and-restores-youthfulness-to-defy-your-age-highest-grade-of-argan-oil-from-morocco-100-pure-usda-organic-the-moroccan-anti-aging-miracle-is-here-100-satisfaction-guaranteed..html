            <li>I LOVE how my skin feels after I apply it.  </li>
            <li>Love the way my face feels after using this for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I really love this oil.</li>
            <li>Not bad for me either :)!</li>
            <li>, I am even more excited to help with this project.</li>
            <li>I love love, love this product; perfect timing for keeping my dry skin extra smooth for the upcoming winter season.  </li>
            <li>great friend for anyone, especially slowing the look of aging skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so surprised when I first opened the email from my friend letting me know about the Beauty By Argan product because I had just learned about argan oil through an organization that is supporting an incredible project in Israel by planting an orchard of 1000 argan trees in the Negev Desert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also put a very tiny amount in my hair, helps with flyaways and gives a beautiful shine without looking greasy (just don&#x27;t use too much).</li>
            <li>Only Argan oil I will buy because of it&#x27;s purity and Fair Trade.</li>
            <li>love it as much as women.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain there are alternative, more hygienic methods of doing the job (the Moroccans were quite resourceful in figuring all this out, actually), but the main thing for me is to find a good source of pure unadulterated Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if this turns out to be just as beneficial as my initial, hand-delivered vial from my daughter; the company assures me that this oil is very fine!  </li>
            <li>It is a new concept to many people</li>
            <li>So far, I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love to put on my feet and hands to keep them soft.  </li>
            <li>It is a great facial moisturizer and product I can use on my unruly, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It smells good, slightly nutty/fruity scent but mild, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>how the goats eat the tough seeds, digest them and at that point the natives are able to extract this amazing oil from them!  </li>
            <li>It is nature&#x27;s balm, right up there with aloe, I believe.  </li>
            <li>I noticed improvement right away.</li>
            <li>It softens the hands dry skin is no match to this amazing oil</li>
            <li>Found another one that is equally good for almost half the price.</li>
            <li>and I was going to have to go see the doctor pretty soon</li>
            <li>This is my first time using any type of Argan Oil and I like it</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>the wrinkles have disappeared by 50% already and my skin has improved so much and not dry any more.</li>
            <li>Through this special project, the organization is able to partner directly with a local grower who will plant, maintain, harvest, process and market the valuable fruit from the tree.  </li>
            <li>If you use this daily on your face, dry spots, overall skin, it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and results can be seen with regular use.  </li>
            <li>, I think; it certainly was to me.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves this product.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Argan before, and this one is a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;Men</li>
            <li>it really gets your attention.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Randy&lt;br /&gt;in Seattle..</li>
            <li>I use it  on my whole body.  </li>
            <li>It will also be a significant step forward in helping preserve the land, and it will be a blessing to future generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many people do not realize that our skin is the largest organ on our bodies so what we put on it is absorbed directly into our systems and has a big impact on our overall health.</li>
            <li>and I am so pleased to say just about all of them have already disappeared in such a short time</li>
            <li>I have been noticing that Argan oil is appearing in many products on American shelves, especially shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Us guys often don&#x27;t pay the attention we should to our looks however as you get older and age spots start to show up</li>
            <li>Having worked in Alternative Health for over 40 years I am always on the look out for all natural products that really work.</li>
            <li>At first time I used it with essence before went to bed, the next morning I was very surprised to find that my face was moisturized very well.</li>
            <li>My original bottle is empty by now.  </li>
            <li>She says it makes her hair appear lively.</li>
            <li>After all the other great things I have discovered about Argan oil after using it for such a short time, I think is what it has done for me on my face and in my hair where I have had several surgery&#x27;s for skin cancer and continually have these places that come up</li>
            <li>Within two days, my nails looked healthier, and my cuticles are nearly completely healed!  </li>
            <li>My hair is curly and dry and sometimes very frizzy but after using a little Argan oil on my hair after shampooing it has improved 95% and so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>My entire family is using it – for scars from insect bites, dry skin, cracked heels, stretch marks, and acne scars - and we are all looking forward to fantastic</li>
            <li>Being pure oil eliminates all the extra ingredients that can cause us harm.</li>
            <li>My hands get irritated from frequent washing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look like an old catchers mitt anymore.</li>
            <li>This Argan oil has brought my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li>Must say, if you use it regularly, it can really change, help and heal your skin for a lot less expense than what we all buy in to.</li>

            <li> I have deep wrinkles on my face and have very dry skin and cannot be in the sun at all but after using the Argan oil for only about two weeks</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> It has done wonders for my dry nails and cuticles too.  </li>
            <li> and I get dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have spent thousands of $$ on skin care...</li>
            <li> I get rough skin on my elbows every winter.</li>
            <li> taking away the dryness and rough feeling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle, but it will last a long time because you use such small amounts.</li>
            <li> My daughter brought a small bottle of Argan oil back to me that she discovered on her trip to Morocco.  </li>
            <li> As a guy that works outside even when it&#x27;s cold it really works well on my hands</li>
            <li> A few drops of Argan Oil on wet hands helps seal in the moisture and prevents them from drying out and cracking.</li>
            <li> I use it from my head (hair) down to me feet.  </li>
            <li> I work in the healthcare field with heavy patient contact and wash my hands at least 40 times in 9 hours, so you can image how dry and rough my skin and nails are.  </li>
            <li> She noticed results within a few applications.</li>
            <li> This really smells bad.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable product.</li>

            <li> This stuff is the real deal. A quality product that lives up to its claims. It&#x27;s a small bottle, but it will last a long time because you use such small amounts.</li>
            <li> I love this product Got it Fast I use it every day for my hair. Its exactly as described with great instructions!</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this product. She noticed results within a few applications. Definitely would buy again and continue using.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully, will order again very soon. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Although we cannot defy the laws of gravity oil can help with skin that has been through a great deal of wear and tear..sun, life.age and chemo.  It takes many days to form a habit.  If you use this daily on your face, dry spots, overall skin, it is wonderful.  I have spent thousands of $$ on skin care...even used to sell it.  Must say, if you use it regularly, it can really change, help and heal your skin for a lot less expense than what we all buy in to.</li>
            <li> I get rough skin on my elbows every winter. This Argan oil has brought my skin back to normal. It took about a week or so of twice a day applications. Now I only apply it once every day or so.</li>
            <li> My hands get irritated from frequent washing. A few drops of Argan Oil on wet hands helps seal in the moisture and prevents them from drying out and cracking. I recommend it for anyone with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> Beauty by argan is amazing!!  I have horrible dry feet and nails. Since using this product my feet and nails have felt amazing!  I&#x27;ve also been using it on my hands and face because of the harsh cold I work in and my skin is so much better. I don&#x27;t look like an old catchers mitt anymore. Haha. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen and have some skin problems. I have deep wrinkles on my face and have very dry skin and cannot be in the sun at all but after using the Argan oil for only about two weeks the wrinkles have disappeared by 50% already and my skin has improved so much and not dry any more. My hair is curly and dry and sometimes very frizzy but after using a little Argan oil on my hair after shampooing it has improved 95% and so much more manageable. After all the other great things I have discovered about Argan oil after using it for such a short time, I think is what it has done for me on my face and in my hair where I have had several surgery&#x27;s for skin cancer and continually have these places that come up and I have to go back to the doctor and have them checked and either removed or frozen. When I received my Argan oil about two weeks ago I had several of these places that had come back and I was going to have to go see the doctor pretty soon but I started using the Argan oil on these places and I am so pleased to say just about all of them have already disappeared in such a short time, I just think this is a miracle. I truly would recommend Argan oil for anyone that has any skin or hair problems. I will be reordering myself in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied customer&lt;br /&gt;George Greenwood</li>
            <li> I need some thing that I could take in my carry on suit case. This was just perfect. It works on all parts of your body, hair,face, legs, feet!!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I ordered Argan oil I give it a five star. It softens the hands dry skin is no match to this amazing oil Your whole body feels so wonderful it is like a miracle oil. I will re-order and also tell my friends about this oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maryann Nezis</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Easy to use and results can be seen with regular use.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My daughter brought a small bottle of Argan oil back to me that she discovered on her trip to Morocco.  I was amazed by the story--how the goats eat the tough seeds, digest them and at that point the natives are able to extract this amazing oil from them!  I&#x27;m certain there are alternative, more hygienic methods of doing the job (the Moroccans were quite resourceful in figuring all this out, actually), but the main thing for me is to find a good source of pure unadulterated Argan oil.  My original bottle is empty by now.  It is nature&#x27;s balm, right up there with aloe, I believe.  Good for your hair, too, as well as skin.  We&#x27;ll see if this turns out to be just as beneficial as my initial, hand-delivered vial from my daughter; the company assures me that this oil is very fine!  They also supply you with ways of using the oil.  It is a new concept to many people, I think; it certainly was to me.  I have been noticing that Argan oil is appearing in many products on American shelves, especially shampoos.  So it is &amp;#34;catching on.&amp;#34;  Mrs. B the B</li>
            <li> Disappointing!  This really smells bad.  Unless you want to smell like diarrhea, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using any type of Argan Oil and I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I never use oil on my skin because I have acne rosacea but after reading about this oil I decided to try it and my skin has almost cleared up since May 15. I have had it 2 weeks. I noticed improvement right away. It feels great on my skin. Thank you!</li>
            <li> So far, I really love this product. Fair price and excellent quality. I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this Argan oil. It smells good, slightly nutty/fruity scent but mild, not overpowering. It is non-greasy, and my skin and hair love it! Very happy, will buy again. Only Argan oil I will buy because of it&#x27;s purity and Fair Trade.</li>
            <li> My wife is enthralled with Argan Oil!  Has made her skin smoother and more supple.  Not bad for me either :)!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and this helps keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this moisturizer!  I work in the healthcare field with heavy patient contact and wash my hands at least 40 times in 9 hours, so you can image how dry and rough my skin and nails are.  One application of this oil on my hands and my skin just drank it in!  Within two days, my nails looked healthier, and my cuticles are nearly completely healed!  This truly is a miracle moisturizer and will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Oil was delivered in timely manner and has met my expectation .  Thank you!</li>
            <li> My wife used this and loves the way it makes her skin feel.</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil truly is a miracle for your skin!  Mine just drinks it in and is never oily or greasy.  I love it for cuticles and nails.&lt;br /&gt;A great friend for anyone, especially slowing the look of aging skin.  I&#x27;ve used Argan before, and this one is a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;Men love it as much as women.  It&#x27;s addicting!!! because it works.</li>
            <li> As a guy that works outside even when it&#x27;s cold it really works well on my hands&lt;br /&gt;and face. Keeps fingers from getting splits! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Having worked in Alternative Health for over 40 years I am always on the look out for all natural products that really work. Argan Oil fits this profile very nicely. Many people do not realize that our skin is the largest organ on our bodies so what we put on it is absorbed directly into our systems and has a big impact on our overall health. Being pure oil eliminates all the extra ingredients that can cause us harm. This product is especially good for people with allergies and has a very pleasant nutty smell too. I purchased my Argan Oil only a short time ago and have now been using it daily for about 2 weeks.  Us guys often don&#x27;t pay the attention we should to our looks however as you get older and age spots start to show up it really gets your attention.  I have had several spots on my face, hands, and arms that have not responded to anything else I have tried over several years.  Now that I have been using Argan Oil they are already starting to disappear. It also makes my skin smoother and look younger. It has done wonders for my dry nails and cuticles too.  If you have any doubts about trying this product just go for it and you will be glad you did. Argan Oil is going on my short list of products to continue to use regularly for the foreseeable future. Thank you Argan for such wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love to put on my feet and hands to keep them soft.  I also put a very tiny amount in my hair, helps with flyaways and gives a beautiful shine without looking greasy (just don&#x27;t use too much).</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this amazing oil! It truly works wonders. My entire family is using it – for scars from insect bites, dry skin, cracked heels, stretch marks, and acne scars - and we are all looking forward to fantastic results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprised when I first opened the email from my friend letting me know about the Beauty By Argan product because I had just learned about argan oil through an organization that is supporting an incredible project in Israel by planting an orchard of 1000 argan trees in the Negev Desert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan Tree, which comes from Morocco and has been called the “tree of life”, is perfectly suited for the Negev Desert.  The oil is quite valuable and is a well-known ingredient in medicines, cosmetics and cooking.  Through this special project, the organization is able to partner directly with a local grower who will plant, maintain, harvest, process and market the valuable fruit from the tree.  The trees will help transform this area in southern Israel. The orchard will eventually provide jobs for people in the region and contribute toward building the local economy.  It will also be a significant step forward in helping preserve the land, and it will be a blessing to future generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that Beauty By Argan has given me the opportunity to actually experience the oil from the argan tree, I am even more excited to help with this project. Thank you Beauty By Argan!!</li>

Remember your skin is your largest organ; treat it well!</li>

            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2KYG9J5KGO7JD]]This is an excellent product.  I have MS and I get dry skin.  I&#x27;m not sure if that goes hand in hand, but this oil works.  I use it  on my whole body.  I LOVE how my skin feels after I apply it.  Amazing results.  I have used numerous lotions and nothing works this good.  If you want beautiful healthy skin, then Argon Oil is what you need.</li>
