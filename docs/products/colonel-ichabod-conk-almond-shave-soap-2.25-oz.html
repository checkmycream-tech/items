            <li>Good shave soap and creates a good lather</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>, it is not overpowering at all and has a good neutral smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Nice lather with a pleasant fragrance.    </li>
            <li>Has a great scent to it and is a very smooth lather.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 pucks of Col. Conks soaps and while both perform great, the almond is my favorite if I had to pick.  </li>
            <li>Handy item, good lather with a brush, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I like the almond scent.</li>
            <li>It also lathers really nicely with a good amount of water</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a good brush and build a good lather.</li>
            <li>This glycerin shaving soap consistently gives me the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had, and my wife agrees.  </li>
            <li>and I love how it smells!</li>
            <li>I definitely am impressed as a first time shaving soap user...</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The almond scent is amazing, not musky so my wife even likes it.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This soap, combined with a good double-edge safety razor (I use the Parker 99R butterfly) and a good blade (I like Derby Extra) gives the best shave I have found.  </li>
            <li>However, this soap will make your shave better, even if you use an injector razor or even a good triple-blade disposable.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>Col Conk&#x27;s Almond performed nicely.  </li>
            <li>This soap lathers really well and has a great scent!  </li>
            <li>The Soap is nice and moist to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used a brush and mug and absolutely obtain the best results with this soap.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also it does not have much of a scent, if you prefer unscented then this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Foams up nicely.</li>
            <li>In fact, he kind of looks like the guy on the logo.</li>
            <li>, this was a nice change instead of using bay rum all the time, and it was kind to my face.</li>
            <li>This is a decent soap at best, I wont be buying it again because in my opinion this soap is just a lot of hype.</li>
            <li>The almond version also smells great: having an understated, not overly sweet aroma.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I do, and find it to be a much more enjoyable experience across the board.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving!</li>
            <li>It stays on your face and creates the good smooth layer of lubrication that is required for a close shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a more cost effective solution.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and smells good.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap when I had a cheap badger brush, and I couldn&#x27;t get a good lather out of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am able to achieve a good lather and it is easy to load on the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Almond scent is very light.</li>
            <li>It has given me a very smooth shave every time I have used it.    </li>
            <li>In the bowl, the smell is amazing and strong.</li>
            <li>Produces a nice lather and the razor glides over it easily.  </li>
            <li>As far as shave soaps go, Colonel Conk&#x27;s are easily among the best.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my boyfriend and I love how this soap smells.  </li>
            <li>This soap is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is more luxurious than the Williams.  </li>
            <li>The lather is so much better.</li>
            <li>I have since tried Swedish Dream Sea Salt Invigorating Bath Soap, and I like that better (richer lather, lighter scent, better lube, ~2x</li>
            <li>the size for ~$2 more).</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite scent</li>
            <li>Using this razor/soap combo, I am able to shave AGAINST the grain.  </li>
            <li>and my husband was really pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d estimate he uses it about 4-5 days a week and at that rate one tub has lasted many months.</li>
            <li>,I TRY TO BUY A COUPLE MORE</li>
            <li>Not even as slick/lubricating as my Cetaphil anti-bacterial bar soap, let alone my favorite shave gel, Tend Skin Air Shave Gel.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shave soap.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a cream.  </li>
            <li>If it lathered a bit more I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>bought this for my son and he loves it, it doesnt break his skin out and works better than shaving cream</li>
            <li>Better products, better tools, better shave.</li>
            <li>my shave is better with this</li>
            <li>my skin still feels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am REALLY glad i made this purchase</li>
            <li>Better yet, rotate your shaving soap, creams.</li>
            <li>Very nice product with a mild, clean scent.</li>
            <li>This soap works up a rich rather and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>If you like strong scents at all, then I suggest passing on this scent, as even the picky will find this scent very light.</li>
            <li>also tried the lime, which has a great &#x27;clean&#x27; smell but didn&#x27;t lather as willingly as the almond</li>
            <li>At just over five bucks, this soap is a bargain, It will last a good while and makes good lather with a boar brush</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use Col. Conk&#x27;s soaps and I must say I really liked it, it smells great and is very soothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used and it was easy to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>I feel well protected using this soap - even as I start to experiment with more advanced razor techniques.  </li>
            <li>Very importantly this soap creates a lush good foam.</li>
            <li>I love the almond scent and he loves the rich lather it makes.</li>
            <li>It took a little bit to find the best way to create the most foam</li>
            <li>It smells great, and it actually works a lot better than some of the high-dollar shaving gels I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>so I can easily control the amount of lather and</li>
            <li>It is a high quality soap and is still a good item.</li>
            <li>Buy it, wear it, attract fine ladies.</li>
            <li>You need hot water, a decent amount of soap, and a good brush speed to get the most from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>All in all a fantastic buy.  </li>
            <li>Then enjoy the feeling of massaging your face and neck with the brush and lather.</li>
            <li>This soap smells AMAZING, and my husband absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>The scent is light.  </li>
            <li>IS ENJOY.</li>
            <li>it lathers very well and has a nice smell for me.</li>
            <li>It leaves ur face really smooth too.</li>
            <li>This soap is far superior to canned shave cream.</li>
            <li>I tried it because I heard that some good, quality shaving soap would clear up razor burn and help with in-grown hairs</li>
            <li>The lather is great; it responds really well to how much water I put on the brush</li>
            <li>The Colonel Conks shaving soap has a great smell and lathers better than other brands they&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The soap creates a very nice slick lubricant for shaving and leaves a nice moisturizing feeling.</li>
            <li>This was a re-order, my original supply having run out.  </li>
            <li>I would describe it as a rich smell, but I use that to describe the way it smells and not the strength of its aroma.  </li>
            <li>Lathers pretty well (better than Willams), lubes my skin well.</li>
            <li>The almond shave soap had a unique smell that just seems to make you want to shave.  </li>
            <li>It is a very pleasant change from the plain soap from Williams.</li>
            <li>The only shaving soap that I feel personally is better is the Proraso brand, or using a Shaving Cream Heater with a nice can of shaving cream like Barbasol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It rinses right out, easy peasy.</li>
            <li>Builds up rich, creamy lather quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent is also very pleasant, masculine and present, but not overpowering or alcohol-like.  </li>
            <li>Have heard good things from friends about the bay rum and amber - will be trying those next.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>Obviously you need a soap container or bowl, but it is a good purchase.</li>
            <li>This soap doesn&#x27;t sting my face like regular soap (e.g., Cetaphil), but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking for a good glycerin-based *shave* soap.</li>
            <li>The smell does not stay with you after you shave, which is a good thing since my after shave is a different scent.</li>
            <li>Shave quality is obviously very subjective, but I haven&#x27;t had any razor burn when used with my favorite blades.  </li>
            <li>And as a person who has asthma, allergies, and is very hypo allergic to many chemicals, this stuff does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>It is not bad at all but just not something i like using every day.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much bad</li>
            <li>Fit right into my shaving mug without any trimming also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many shaving soaps, and this is by far my favorite, smells wonderful, and whips up to a very thick lather.</li>
            <li>it hurts, and I get rash pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Foams/creams up rather quickly and well.</li>
            <li>It has and mild almond smell</li>
            <li>It dries quickly when done with it, but not on your face like the williams does.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and it lathers adequately.</li>
            <li>and it dries quick (when traveling).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found some better shave soaps and really can&#x27;t justify rating this 5/5 anymore even though I liked it starting out.</li>
            <li>Smells great and provides a thick and rich lather for a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>It foams up very quickly, which is really a plus.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that there is not a hint of mint or alcohol [to my knowledge] in this soap-I really do not enjoy all that tingling or feeling of dryness after shaving.</li>
            <li>Seems to be as good as the British soaps costing 2 and 3 times as much.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It seems to be worth the addition price.</li>
            <li>Love this soap so far.  </li>
            <li>Far better than the aerosol cans of shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>Possibly some of the more costly brands may be even better, but this product really works well.</li>
            <li>I spent $3.50 on a boar hair brush) and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that with this soap I was able to get the closest shave I have ever had, I never thought soap mattered for that.</li>
            <li>Finally and most importantly, it performs well for me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to whip up a little more with my shave brush each time.  </li>
            <li>I still use other shaving products for convenience, but when I really want a great shave, I reach for the Colonel Ichabod Conk.</li>
            <li>If you get the amount of water just right</li>
            <li>It has that real nutty smell to it and still has a sweet smell in it.</li>
            <li>It leathers up great - just a small amount on the brush</li>
            <li>I have tried 2 other shaving soaps and this is by far the best so far.</li>
            <li>Colonel Conk certainly knows his shave soap!</li>
            <li>I really like the mild scent of this soap.  </li>
            <li>They all lather well, last until the last bit, and smell and feel great.</li>
            <li>The scent is not strong and will not persist once you&#x27;ve rinsed your face, but it does make the experience of shaving more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>As a newbie wet shaver I sprang for a far pricier Proraso cream the first time out - which was admittedly very nice.  </li>
            <li>I gave it as a Christmas gift because I like it so much!</li>
            <li>The only shaving prep that I like better is Tom&#x27;s of Maine shaving cream.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll find that the lather is better than any of the regular shave creams or foams or gels</li>
            <li>I tried williams because my local grocery store carries it, but once this arrived shaving is for the first time enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I tend to get allergic reactions from fragrances and this is the first shaving lubricant I&#x27;ve ever used without getting blemishes, ingrown hairs, or rashes.</li>
            <li>This was the first Conk soap I have tried and its a keeper.</li>
            <li>so I usually give it a second go for best results.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons I decided to start DE shaving was because I wanted to take better care of my facial skin.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and lathers well, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>First, you need a brush--a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>A solid shaving soap which makes your face nice and slick for your razor to glide over and with a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>Nice rich lather that hangs around long enough to shave.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like shaving very much.</li>
            <li>It is in the middle price wise, and performs better than either for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: if you have hard water, consider getting purified bottled water from the store.  </li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave using the same razor I normally use, gives a very comfortable and probably the closest shave I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li>The almond scent is a bit strong; if I buy again I will try a different scent.</li>
            <li>The almond smell is not for everyone and while pleasant, it&#x27;s really not for big phifs.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Very thick and creamy and provides a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every type of razor (both electrics and wet) and numerous shaving creams and soaps, and nothing compares to a good straight razor and this quality glycerin soap.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shaving soap.</li>
            <li>The lather itself dries FAST.</li>
            <li>Got this when I ordered a straight razor to try to learn to use one to shave.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>He keeps saying how much nicer it is than shaving cream from a can.</li>
            <li>Plus, this doesn&#x27;t have as much impact on the environment.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t care much about it at this value.  </li>
            <li>This means it won&#x27;t take up much space in your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>Much quicker than multi-tracks​ because I don&#x27;t spend so much time trying to get the hair and cream out of the shaver.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>It works well for the intended purpose, however it does not give much lather.</li>
            <li>This type of soap is meant to be used with a mug, brush and safety or straight razor.</li>
            <li>Certainly much close than the Barbasol I have used for ever.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap -</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>But, then he doesn&#x27;t really shave.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t much care for the almond scent.  </li>
            <li>I add a few drops of warm water and to the siap/mug while my brush soaks for about 30 seconds then build the lather with the brush for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Second, you need to get that brush in super hot water for 5-10 seconds.</li>
            <li>We originally bought Colonel Conk shaving soap when liquid, gel or cream toiletries were suddenly not allowed in carry-on luggage onboard airplanes.  </li>
            <li>Just get a decent brush (don&#x27;t spend too much on it -</li>
            <li>Only thing keeping it from 5 stars from me is the very light scent (a little too light IMO) and the high price tag.</li>
            <li>Cheap, lasts a long time, and lathers up well using my badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li>Wow you get a really neat lather with this shaving soap!</li>
            <li>Provides plenty of lather for shaving with my new DE razor!</li>
            <li>For some reason, I can never get the lather I want from glycerin based soaps as opposed to tallow based soaps like Williams and Arko which for me produce way more, richer lather at less money.     </li>
            <li>Easy to use, wet brush and dip a bit of cream onto the bristles and lather up face.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely come back for more.</li>
            <li>I know wet shavers consider these pucks kind of low end</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>will give you a nice thick lather.</li>
            <li>I look forward to trying new fragrances.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My husband flies very frequently, and when he&#x27;s shaving at home he still sometimes uses the canned shaving gel, but even though toiletries under 3oz are allowed on airplanes these days he continues to carry Colonel Conk with him on the road instead of shaving gel or cream.   </li>
            <li>the scent of this soap is very lacking, in puck form you can barely smell the almond, in lather form</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the subtle scent of this soap (if you&#x27;re wondering, it smells similar to an amaretto liqueur, but without the alcohol), and is pretty easy to load up in your brush and make into a lather, though I should disclose this is also the only shave soap I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to aside from shaving cream in a can.  </li>
            <li>but it does not last long free shaving.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, how it lathers and the fact that I can melt it down into my bowl using a double boiler.</li>
            <li>Conks stuff is good for those looking for an above average wet shave.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time choosing this shaving soap for my husband, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Once you lather your face with it, the scent is gone, completely, there is no trace of it.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about as natural as you can hope for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fiance still shaves the old fashioned way and he loves this soap -</li>
            <li>Hence the only ingredients readily shown are avocado oil, vitamin e and almond fragrance(go check out badgerandblade).</li>
            <li>it is not very rich and quickly dries when applied to your face.</li>
            <li>Laters easily and is plenty slick.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of this soap in particular.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this was a little to sweet for me, I also just could&#x27;t get this to lather</li>
            <li>Rub the brush in the soap container pretty vigorously for 10-15 seconds, then move it to your wet face, and keep that brush speed up!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>well it was always really bubbly and dried up fast.</li>
            <li>The puck can be added to your shave cup/bowl, melted down in the microwave, and left to cool into the shape of your cup/bowl.</li>
            <li>It is a rich scent: nutty, soapy, and sweet; but it shows up with very little intensity saving it from the unpleasant cloying effect that torpedoes many similar scentings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I like this brand soap in general and the almound is pleasent.</li>
            <li>general</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small but deep size allows it to fit in almost any shaving cup</li>
            <li>About 20 seconds left me with a completely melted/boiling liquid.</li>
            <li>Far richer and soapier than jerkins almond-cherry, though somewhat similar in character.  </li>
            <li>You get a crazy amount of lather with this stuff, by using a good shaving brush and bowl.</li>
            <li>It lathers up really well (with enough work, big piles of fluffy foam), which was my main concern.  </li>
            <li>I had to experiment with a few different soaps to find the right one.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this over some of the other shaving soaps that contain garbage similar to modern canned shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes as supposedly this soap is glycerin-based (and glycerin soaps are super-slick in my experience), but not enough glycerin and/or too much other ingredients apparently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 5 different soaps so far since I&#x27;ve been DE safety shaving and this one by far is the most disappointing.</li>
            <li>The foam is thick and is full of tiny bubbles that hold up well when applied to the skin.</li>

            <li> Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> smells great and works just as good.</li>
            <li> The pleasant marzipan scent doesn&#x27;t seem as good once its on my face.</li>

            <li> Good shave soap and creates a good lather</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> , it is not overpowering at all and has a good neutral smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Nice lather with a pleasant fragrance.    </li>
            <li> Has a great scent to it and is a very smooth lather.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 pucks of Col. Conks soaps and while both perform great, the almond is my favorite if I had to pick.  </li>
            <li> Handy item, good lather with a brush, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I like the almond scent.</li>
            <li> It also lathers really nicely with a good amount of water</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a good brush and build a good lather.</li>
            <li> This glycerin shaving soap consistently gives me the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had, and my wife agrees.  </li>
            <li> and I love how it smells!</li>
            <li> I definitely am impressed as a first time shaving soap user...</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> The almond scent is amazing, not musky so my wife even likes it.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This soap, combined with a good double-edge safety razor (I use the Parker 99R butterfly) and a good blade (I like Derby Extra) gives the best shave I have found.  </li>
            <li> However, this soap will make your shave better, even if you use an injector razor or even a good triple-blade disposable.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> Col Conk&#x27;s Almond performed nicely.  </li>
            <li> This soap lathers really well and has a great scent!  </li>
            <li> The Soap is nice and moist to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a brush and mug and absolutely obtain the best results with this soap.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also it does not have much of a scent, if you prefer unscented then this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Foams up nicely.</li>
            <li> In fact, he kind of looks like the guy on the logo.</li>
            <li> , this was a nice change instead of using bay rum all the time, and it was kind to my face.</li>
            <li> This is a decent soap at best, I wont be buying it again because in my opinion this soap is just a lot of hype.</li>
            <li> The almond version also smells great: having an understated, not overly sweet aroma.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I do, and find it to be a much more enjoyable experience across the board.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving!</li>
            <li> It stays on your face and creates the good smooth layer of lubrication that is required for a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more cost effective solution.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and smells good.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap when I had a cheap badger brush, and I couldn&#x27;t get a good lather out of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am able to achieve a good lather and it is easy to load on the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Almond scent is very light.</li>
            <li> It has given me a very smooth shave every time I have used it.    </li>
            <li> In the bowl, the smell is amazing and strong.</li>
            <li> Produces a nice lather and the razor glides over it easily.  </li>
            <li> As far as shave soaps go, Colonel Conk&#x27;s are easily among the best.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend and I love how this soap smells.  </li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is more luxurious than the Williams.  </li>
            <li> The lather is so much better.</li>
            <li> I have since tried Swedish Dream Sea Salt Invigorating Bath Soap, and I like that better (richer lather, lighter scent, better lube, ~2x</li>
            <li> the size for ~$2 more).</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite scent</li>
            <li> Using this razor/soap combo, I am able to shave AGAINST the grain.  </li>
            <li> and my husband was really pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d estimate he uses it about 4-5 days a week and at that rate one tub has lasted many months.</li>
            <li> ,I TRY TO BUY A COUPLE MORE</li>
            <li> Not even as slick/lubricating as my Cetaphil anti-bacterial bar soap, let alone my favorite shave gel, Tend Skin Air Shave Gel.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shave soap.  </li>
            <li> Much better than a cream.  </li>
            <li> If it lathered a bit more I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> bought this for my son and he loves it, it doesnt break his skin out and works better than shaving cream</li>
            <li> Better products, better tools, better shave.</li>
            <li> my shave is better with this</li>
            <li> my skin still feels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am REALLY glad i made this purchase</li>
            <li> Better yet, rotate your shaving soap, creams.</li>
            <li> Very nice product with a mild, clean scent.</li>
            <li> This soap works up a rich rather and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> If you like strong scents at all, then I suggest passing on this scent, as even the picky will find this scent very light.</li>
            <li> also tried the lime, which has a great &#x27;clean&#x27; smell but didn&#x27;t lather as willingly as the almond</li>
            <li> At just over five bucks, this soap is a bargain, It will last a good while and makes good lather with a boar brush</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use Col. Conk&#x27;s soaps and I must say I really liked it, it smells great and is very soothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used and it was easy to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> I feel well protected using this soap - even as I start to experiment with more advanced razor techniques.  </li>
            <li> Very importantly this soap creates a lush good foam.</li>
            <li> I love the almond scent and he loves the rich lather it makes.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit to find the best way to create the most foam</li>
            <li> It smells great, and it actually works a lot better than some of the high-dollar shaving gels I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so I can easily control the amount of lather and</li>
            <li> It is a high quality soap and is still a good item.</li>
            <li> Buy it, wear it, attract fine ladies.</li>
            <li> You need hot water, a decent amount of soap, and a good brush speed to get the most from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> All in all a fantastic buy.  </li>
            <li> Then enjoy the feeling of massaging your face and neck with the brush and lather.</li>
            <li> This soap smells AMAZING, and my husband absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> The scent is light.  </li>
            <li> IS ENJOY.</li>
            <li> it lathers very well and has a nice smell for me.</li>
            <li> It leaves ur face really smooth too.</li>
            <li> This soap is far superior to canned shave cream.</li>
            <li> I tried it because I heard that some good, quality shaving soap would clear up razor burn and help with in-grown hairs</li>
            <li> The lather is great; it responds really well to how much water I put on the brush</li>
            <li> The Colonel Conks shaving soap has a great smell and lathers better than other brands they&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The soap creates a very nice slick lubricant for shaving and leaves a nice moisturizing feeling.</li>
            <li> This was a re-order, my original supply having run out.  </li>
            <li> I would describe it as a rich smell, but I use that to describe the way it smells and not the strength of its aroma.  </li>
            <li> Lathers pretty well (better than Willams), lubes my skin well.</li>
            <li> The almond shave soap had a unique smell that just seems to make you want to shave.  </li>
            <li> It is a very pleasant change from the plain soap from Williams.</li>
            <li> The only shaving soap that I feel personally is better is the Proraso brand, or using a Shaving Cream Heater with a nice can of shaving cream like Barbasol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It rinses right out, easy peasy.</li>
            <li> Builds up rich, creamy lather quickly.</li>
            <li> The scent is also very pleasant, masculine and present, but not overpowering or alcohol-like.  </li>
            <li> Have heard good things from friends about the bay rum and amber - will be trying those next.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> Obviously you need a soap container or bowl, but it is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t sting my face like regular soap (e.g., Cetaphil), but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking for a good glycerin-based *shave* soap.</li>
            <li> The smell does not stay with you after you shave, which is a good thing since my after shave is a different scent.</li>
            <li> Shave quality is obviously very subjective, but I haven&#x27;t had any razor burn when used with my favorite blades.  </li>
            <li> And as a person who has asthma, allergies, and is very hypo allergic to many chemicals, this stuff does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> It is not bad at all but just not something i like using every day.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much bad</li>
            <li> Fit right into my shaving mug without any trimming also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many shaving soaps, and this is by far my favorite, smells wonderful, and whips up to a very thick lather.</li>
            <li> it hurts, and I get rash pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Foams/creams up rather quickly and well.</li>
            <li> It has and mild almond smell</li>
            <li> It dries quickly when done with it, but not on your face like the williams does.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it lathers adequately.</li>
            <li> and it dries quick (when traveling).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found some better shave soaps and really can&#x27;t justify rating this 5/5 anymore even though I liked it starting out.</li>
            <li> Smells great and provides a thick and rich lather for a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> It foams up very quickly, which is really a plus.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that there is not a hint of mint or alcohol [to my knowledge] in this soap-I really do not enjoy all that tingling or feeling of dryness after shaving.</li>
            <li> Seems to be as good as the British soaps costing 2 and 3 times as much.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It seems to be worth the addition price.</li>
            <li> Love this soap so far.  </li>
            <li> Far better than the aerosol cans of shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> Possibly some of the more costly brands may be even better, but this product really works well.</li>
            <li> I spent $3.50 on a boar hair brush) and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that with this soap I was able to get the closest shave I have ever had, I never thought soap mattered for that.</li>
            <li> Finally and most importantly, it performs well for me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very easy to whip up a little more with my shave brush each time.  </li>
            <li> I still use other shaving products for convenience, but when I really want a great shave, I reach for the Colonel Ichabod Conk.</li>
            <li> If you get the amount of water just right</li>
            <li> It has that real nutty smell to it and still has a sweet smell in it.</li>
            <li> It leathers up great - just a small amount on the brush</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 other shaving soaps and this is by far the best so far.</li>
            <li> Colonel Conk certainly knows his shave soap!</li>
            <li> I really like the mild scent of this soap.  </li>
            <li> They all lather well, last until the last bit, and smell and feel great.</li>
            <li> The scent is not strong and will not persist once you&#x27;ve rinsed your face, but it does make the experience of shaving more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> As a newbie wet shaver I sprang for a far pricier Proraso cream the first time out - which was admittedly very nice.  </li>
            <li> I gave it as a Christmas gift because I like it so much!</li>
            <li> The only shaving prep that I like better is Tom&#x27;s of Maine shaving cream.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll find that the lather is better than any of the regular shave creams or foams or gels</li>
            <li> I tried williams because my local grocery store carries it, but once this arrived shaving is for the first time enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I tend to get allergic reactions from fragrances and this is the first shaving lubricant I&#x27;ve ever used without getting blemishes, ingrown hairs, or rashes.</li>
            <li> This was the first Conk soap I have tried and its a keeper.</li>
            <li> so I usually give it a second go for best results.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I decided to start DE shaving was because I wanted to take better care of my facial skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and lathers well, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> First, you need a brush--a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> A solid shaving soap which makes your face nice and slick for your razor to glide over and with a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> Nice rich lather that hangs around long enough to shave.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like shaving very much.</li>
            <li> It is in the middle price wise, and performs better than either for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: if you have hard water, consider getting purified bottled water from the store.  </li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave using the same razor I normally use, gives a very comfortable and probably the closest shave I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li> The almond scent is a bit strong; if I buy again I will try a different scent.</li>
            <li> The almond smell is not for everyone and while pleasant, it&#x27;s really not for big phifs.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy and provides a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every type of razor (both electrics and wet) and numerous shaving creams and soaps, and nothing compares to a good straight razor and this quality glycerin soap.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shaving soap.</li>
            <li> The lather itself dries FAST.</li>
            <li> Got this when I ordered a straight razor to try to learn to use one to shave.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> He keeps saying how much nicer it is than shaving cream from a can.</li>
            <li> Plus, this doesn&#x27;t have as much impact on the environment.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t care much about it at this value.  </li>
            <li> This means it won&#x27;t take up much space in your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Much quicker than multi-tracks​ because I don&#x27;t spend so much time trying to get the hair and cream out of the shaver.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> It works well for the intended purpose, however it does not give much lather.</li>
            <li> This type of soap is meant to be used with a mug, brush and safety or straight razor.</li>
            <li> Certainly much close than the Barbasol I have used for ever.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap -</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> But, then he doesn&#x27;t really shave.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t much care for the almond scent.  </li>
            <li> I add a few drops of warm water and to the siap/mug while my brush soaks for about 30 seconds then build the lather with the brush for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Second, you need to get that brush in super hot water for 5-10 seconds.</li>
            <li> We originally bought Colonel Conk shaving soap when liquid, gel or cream toiletries were suddenly not allowed in carry-on luggage onboard airplanes.  </li>
            <li> Just get a decent brush (don&#x27;t spend too much on it -</li>
            <li> Only thing keeping it from 5 stars from me is the very light scent (a little too light IMO) and the high price tag.</li>
            <li> Cheap, lasts a long time, and lathers up well using my badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li> Wow you get a really neat lather with this shaving soap!</li>
            <li> Provides plenty of lather for shaving with my new DE razor!</li>
            <li> For some reason, I can never get the lather I want from glycerin based soaps as opposed to tallow based soaps like Williams and Arko which for me produce way more, richer lather at less money.     </li>
            <li> Easy to use, wet brush and dip a bit of cream onto the bristles and lather up face.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely come back for more.</li>
            <li> I know wet shavers consider these pucks kind of low end</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> will give you a nice thick lather.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying new fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My husband flies very frequently, and when he&#x27;s shaving at home he still sometimes uses the canned shaving gel, but even though toiletries under 3oz are allowed on airplanes these days he continues to carry Colonel Conk with him on the road instead of shaving gel or cream.   </li>
            <li> the scent of this soap is very lacking, in puck form you can barely smell the almond, in lather form</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the subtle scent of this soap (if you&#x27;re wondering, it smells similar to an amaretto liqueur, but without the alcohol), and is pretty easy to load up in your brush and make into a lather, though I should disclose this is also the only shave soap I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to aside from shaving cream in a can.  </li>
            <li> but it does not last long free shaving.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, how it lathers and the fact that I can melt it down into my bowl using a double boiler.</li>
            <li> Conks stuff is good for those looking for an above average wet shave.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time choosing this shaving soap for my husband, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Once you lather your face with it, the scent is gone, completely, there is no trace of it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about as natural as you can hope for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fiance still shaves the old fashioned way and he loves this soap -</li>
            <li> Hence the only ingredients readily shown are avocado oil, vitamin e and almond fragrance(go check out badgerandblade).</li>
            <li> it is not very rich and quickly dries when applied to your face.</li>
            <li> Laters easily and is plenty slick.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this soap in particular.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this was a little to sweet for me, I also just could&#x27;t get this to lather</li>
            <li> Rub the brush in the soap container pretty vigorously for 10-15 seconds, then move it to your wet face, and keep that brush speed up!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> well it was always really bubbly and dried up fast.</li>
            <li> The puck can be added to your shave cup/bowl, melted down in the microwave, and left to cool into the shape of your cup/bowl.</li>
            <li> It is a rich scent: nutty, soapy, and sweet; but it shows up with very little intensity saving it from the unpleasant cloying effect that torpedoes many similar scentings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I like this brand soap in general and the almound is pleasent.</li>
            <li> general</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but deep size allows it to fit in almost any shaving cup</li>
            <li> About 20 seconds left me with a completely melted/boiling liquid.</li>
            <li> Far richer and soapier than jerkins almond-cherry, though somewhat similar in character.  </li>
            <li> You get a crazy amount of lather with this stuff, by using a good shaving brush and bowl.</li>
            <li> It lathers up really well (with enough work, big piles of fluffy foam), which was my main concern.  </li>
            <li> I had to experiment with a few different soaps to find the right one.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this over some of the other shaving soaps that contain garbage similar to modern canned shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes as supposedly this soap is glycerin-based (and glycerin soaps are super-slick in my experience), but not enough glycerin and/or too much other ingredients apparently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 5 different soaps so far since I&#x27;ve been DE safety shaving and this one by far is the most disappointing.</li>
            <li> The foam is thick and is full of tiny bubbles that hold up well when applied to the skin.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> in fact I think makes it less sensitive to the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a daily military shaver (once daily, two directions) and this lasts about 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> It allows me to get a close shave and does not dry out my skin like other shaving products.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about it long time ago.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job, but not a natural soap(if</li>
            <li> The only thing that is a minus with it, is that after shaving you get an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> For me personally it is slightly drying but nothing significant with a moisturizer behind it.</li>
            <li> I find the more expensive creams that explode into thick lather don&#x27;t last as long and the thicker lather just clogs up my razor faster.</li>
            <li> I just got started in DE (dual edged) single blade shaving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a convert to brush, cream and  single blade safety razor and  shaving after 45 years of multi-track shavers.</li>
            <li> only thing i do not completely enjoy is the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li> The scent is not very strong and does not stay with you for very long</li>
            <li> only wish the scent was a little stronger!</li>
            <li> It provides moderate lubrication and very little lather.</li>
            <li> Other than scent, I have not found any difference in this and</li>
            <li> other Col. Conk shave soaps.</li>
            <li> I can say about this or any other Colonel Conk shave soap.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to getting him the other scents.</li>
            <li> This is now my brand for life and can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> Col. Conks on hand and use it as a bench mark to test all other soaps I try.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s other scents you could try too.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with other soaps I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> However compared to other shaving creams in a can and others out there, this stuff is leagues ahead.</li>
            <li> the way, the soap comes in a little plastic container that can be closed, so there&#x27;s no need to put the soap in a mug or other container.  </li>
            <li> It takes quite a bit of work to get it thick and creamy enough</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather up really thick like, but that may only be because I&#x27;m a novice at doing it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t whip up a lather quite as thick as a traditional shave cream -</li>
            <li> you can get down at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> This soap creates a very slick lather - not as thick or heavy as some others but very lubricative.  </li>
            <li> disclosure, I don&#x27;t lather up with a shave brush as one might typically do.</li>
            <li> This tub of soap comes in a little plastic container but lasts forever</li>
            <li> and what little scent it has is not what I would consider almond.</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t bad for your head), it&#x27;ll save you a colossal amount of money over the years.</li>
            <li> I have trouble understanding all the 5 star reviews on this soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now a few yrs.</li>
            <li> Now that being said, there&#x27;s a few things I&#x27;ve learned about this soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has very few ingredients and contains nothing that hasn&#x27;t been around for over a century.</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to get shaving soap in the small town I live in, so I have to take my chances when I purchase this sort of thing on-line.</li>
            <li> I assumed it was my hard water and put this soap away for awhile.</li>
            <li> Col Conk is one of my least favorites soaps I have tried.</li>
            <li> ....but a thick, foamy lather has nothing to do with the lubricity of a shave goo (soap, gel, cream, etc.)</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s very slick on my face.  </li>
            <li> The scent is subtle, which my wife appreciates.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this in lots of situations: with a shavette, with a crappy disposable razor, with long growth, and with short growth.&lt;br /&gt;Short growth shaving for me is horrible...</li>
            <li> Now that I have at least a vague idea of what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li> Lastly the soap is horribly sticky.</li>
            <li> or if I was just doing something wrong</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if a got a bad batch</li>
            <li> But all in all, it really isn&#x27;t a bad deal for the price,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick to death of plastic packages and cans of shave cream that don&#x27;t always get recycled.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have been disappointed with any of the Conk soaps yet.</li>
            <li> Give it a shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> For one the lather is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have now be using this product for a couple months and i am as happy as i can be with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am able to achieve a good lather and it is easy to load on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i do not completely enjoy is the smell. It is not bad at all but just not something i like using every day. I will probably try the four different options next time i need some soap.</li>
            <li> Builds up rich, creamy lather quickly. Seems to be as good as the British soaps costing 2 and 3 times as much. Will definitely try the multi-pack sampler next time. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend and I love how this soap smells.  It&#x27;s small but deep size allows it to fit in almost any shaving cup</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving soap I have used. This was a re-order, my original supply having run out.  I have done a lot of experimenting trying to find the best shave.  This soap, combined with a good double-edge safety razor (I use the Parker 99R butterfly) and a good blade (I like Derby Extra) gives the best shave I have found.  However, this soap will make your shave better, even if you use an injector razor or even a good triple-blade disposable. This soap is far superior to canned shave cream. It stays on your face and creates the good smooth layer of lubrication that is required for a close shave.  The soap also has a good scent. Other than scent, I have not found any difference in this and other Col. Conk shave soaps.</li>
            <li> Smooth and creamy. Foams/creams up rather quickly and well. Almond scent is very light. If you like strong scents at all, then I suggest passing on this scent, as even the picky will find this scent very light. The puck can be added to your shave cup/bowl, melted down in the microwave, and left to cool into the shape of your cup/bowl. About 20 seconds left me with a completely melted/boiling liquid. Zero separation during re-hardening. Worked perfectly. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars from me is the very light scent (a little too light IMO) and the high price tag.</li>
            <li> This shave soap smells great and lathers on nicely.</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to get shaving soap in the small town I live in, so I have to take my chances when I purchase this sort of thing on-line. This soap is fantastic! Great almond smell. Great lather whips up pronto. I am hooked on it.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell to it. Lathers well. Bought a second one to give to my  son.</li>
            <li> Although it is relatively low cost, it is also low quality when compared to competitive albeit more expensive products.  It provides moderate lubrication and very little lather.</li>
            <li> This is good soap and it lasts a while.  I&#x27;m a daily military shaver (once daily, two directions) and this lasts about 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> Purchased the almond variety for use with a DE razor.  As a newbie wet shaver I sprang for a far pricier Proraso cream the first time out - which was admittedly very nice.  Now that I have at least a vague idea of what I&#x27;m doing I&#x27;ve been looking for a more cost effective solution.  Col Conk&#x27;s Almond performed nicely.  This soap creates a very slick lather - not as thick or heavy as some others but very lubricative.  I feel well protected using this soap - even as I start to experiment with more advanced razor techniques.  All in all a fantastic buy.  The almond version also smells great: having an understated, not overly sweet aroma.  Far richer and soapier than jerkins almond-cherry, though somewhat similar in character.  I would describe it as a rich smell, but I use that to describe the way it smells and not the strength of its aroma.  It is a rich scent: nutty, soapy, and sweet; but it shows up with very little intensity saving it from the unpleasant cloying effect that torpedoes many similar scentings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have also tried the lime, which has a great &#x27;clean&#x27; smell but didn&#x27;t lather as willingly as the almond -- this may have something to do with my brush, technique, or local water quality.  Have heard good things from friends about the bay rum and amber - will be trying those next.</li>
            <li> This glycerin shaving soap consistently gives me the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had, and my wife agrees.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every type of razor (both electrics and wet) and numerous shaving creams and soaps, and nothing compares to a good straight razor and this quality glycerin soap.  The scent is also very pleasant, masculine and present, but not overpowering or alcohol-like.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the Bay Rum variety I also bought.</li>
            <li> This soap smells sooo good!!! I got it for my husband. I love smelling his face after he shaves with it!!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. And it moisturizes my shin and helps me get a close shave. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time choosing this shaving soap for my husband, but I&#x27;m glad I did. I love the almond scent and he loves the rich lather it makes. It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  It has given me a very smooth shave every time I have used it.    This soap lathers really well and has a great scent!  I just switched from the Colonel Conk Amber to the Colonel Conk Almond and am very happy!</li>
            <li> Smells great and lathers well. Makes for a great shaving experience. I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it and in fact I think makes it less sensitive to the razor. Be sure to use a good brush and build a good lather. I add a few drops of warm water and to the siap/mug while my brush soaks for about 30 seconds then build the lather with the brush for another 30 seconds. Then enjoy the feeling of massaging your face and neck with the brush and lather.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaving soap. It lasts a long time and keeps my skin soft. I would recemend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> This soap is very nice. It is a very pleasant change from the plain soap from Williams. It seems to be worth the addition price.</li>
            <li> This is a great shave soap to use with my Merkur DE razor and badger brush. The soap has almond and avocado oil as moisturizers. I am so happy that there is not a hint of mint or alcohol [to my knowledge] in this soap-I really do not enjoy all that tingling or feeling of dryness after shaving. This is good quality soap.</li>
            <li> Very good soap.  Smooth and smells good.</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap! Has a great scent to it and is a very smooth lather. I gave it as a Christmas gift because I like it so much!</li>
            <li> Handy item, good lather with a brush, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I like the almond scent.</li>
            <li> I like this brand soap in general and the almound is pleasent. Lathers and shaves well.</li>
            <li> I have trouble understanding all the 5 star reviews on this soap. I&#x27;ve used 5 different soaps so far since I&#x27;ve been DE safety shaving and this one by far is the most disappointing. The biggest issue I have with this soap is the lather. It takes quite a bit of work to get it thick and creamy enough (yes I&#x27;m wetting the soap, soaking my brush ect). For some reason, I can never get the lather I want from glycerin based soaps as opposed to tallow based soaps like Williams and Arko which for me produce way more, richer lather at less money.     The lather itself dries FAST. Faster than the above-mentioned soaps that are cheaper. And I&#x27;m only a 1-2 pass shaver!    The fragrance, well I bought this one and the bay rum. In the bowl, the smell is amazing and strong. Once you lather your face with it, the scent is gone, completely, there is no trace of it. This is a decent soap at best, I wont be buying it again because in my opinion this soap is just a lot of hype.</li>
            <li> my husband and father received this in their stockings. The Colonel Conks shaving soap has a great smell and lathers better than other brands they&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for xmas.  He loves how it feels and I love how it smells!</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. I love the scent, how it lathers and the fact that I can melt it down into my bowl using a double boiler.</li>
            <li> Produces a nice lather and the razor glides over it easily.  I have had no nicks, no irritation, and I don&#x27;t have to use after shave or moisturizer after.  This is more luxurious than the Williams.  It rinses off the razor easier than Proraso.  It is in the middle price wise, and performs better than either for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: if you have hard water, consider getting purified bottled water from the store.  The lather is so much better.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Love this soap so far.  It lathers up really well (with enough work, big piles of fluffy foam), which was my main concern.  Provides plenty of lather for shaving with my new DE razor!</li>
            <li> I really like the mild scent of this soap.  It doesn&#x27;t lather up really thick like, but that may only be because I&#x27;m a novice at doing it.  Works well and my skin tolerates it well.</li>
            <li> this is the second Colonel Ichabod Conk soap I have bought and I will definitely come back for more. A solid shaving soap which makes your face nice and slick for your razor to glide over and with a nice scent to it. The scent is not very strong and does not stay with you for very long but that&#x27;s what aftershave / lotions are for anyway.</li>
            <li> Got this when I ordered a straight razor to try to learn to use one to shave. This soap was something I got to use with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap for the price.  It allows me to get a close shave and does not dry out my skin like other shaving products.  The only shaving prep that I like better is Tom&#x27;s of Maine shaving cream.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much bad I can say about this or any other Colonel Conk shave soap. They all lather well, last until the last bit, and smell and feel great. As far as shave soaps go, Colonel Conk&#x27;s are easily among the best.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend just loves this soap.  It has and mild almond smell and I really like it. It lathers really good. What a great gift.</li>
            <li> Lathers pretty well (better than Willams), lubes my skin well. The almond scent is a bit strong; if I buy again I will try a different scent. I have since tried Swedish Dream Sea Salt Invigorating Bath Soap, and I like that better (richer lather, lighter scent, better lube, ~2x the size for ~$2 more).</li>
            <li> Soapy and foamy does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> This smells sooo goodd!!! It has that real nutty smell to it and still has a sweet smell in it. It also lathers really nicely with a good amount of water</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband who loves it! He keeps saying how much nicer it is than shaving cream from a can. I am looking forward to getting him the other scents. This is a great gift for any man in your life.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap when I had a cheap badger brush, and I couldn&#x27;t get a good lather out of it. I assumed it was my hard water and put this soap away for awhile. when i got my omega 10048 boar brush, I tested its Sturdy bristles out on this soap again, and to my amazement, Lather!! the scent of this soap is very lacking, in puck form you can barely smell the almond, in lather form it is almost scentless. At just over five bucks, this soap is a bargain, It will last a good while and makes good lather with a boar brush</li>
            <li> This soap smells AMAZING, and my husband absolutely loves it. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Far better than the aerosol cans of shaving cream.  Possibly some of the more costly brands may be even better, but this product really works well.</li>
            <li> I have been using a double edge safety razor and shaving soap since 2011. I had to experiment with a few different soaps to find the right one. Col Conk is one of my least favorites soaps I have tried. For one the lather is terrible. Even when you accomplish getting a lather it is not very rich and quickly dries when applied to your face. I would have to constantly relather and then reapply the soap to my face during the shave. Lastly the soap is horribly sticky. After shaving I would have to scrub my face to get rid of the stick soap on my face. It wasn&#x27;t a matter of I didn&#x27;t get all the soap off. I recommend and only use soap from Van Der Hagen.</li>
            <li> You simply have to try this stuff!  I tried it because I heard that some good, quality shaving soap would clear up razor burn and help with in-grown hairs and it&#x27;s true.  Just get a decent brush (don&#x27;t spend too much on it - I spent $3.50 on a boar hair brush) and you&#x27;re good to go.  If you get the amount of water just right you&#x27;ll find that the lather is better than any of the regular shave creams or foams or gels you can get down at the drug store.  Plus, this doesn&#x27;t have as much impact on the environment.  I&#x27;m sick to death of plastic packages and cans of shave cream that don&#x27;t always get recycled.  This tub of soap comes in a little plastic container but lasts forever and you can recycle it at the end.  I do wish it came in a paper or metal or glass container.  I&#x27;ve used it every day for two months and I&#x27;ve only gone through about 3mm out of the 4cm deep bar.        Get the aftershave too.  It&#x27;s great stuff.    [[ASIN:B0007P2ONY Colonel Ichabod Conk Almond Balm After Shave 4 Fl. Oz. Glass Bottle]]</li>
            <li> I tried williams because my local grocery store carries it, but once this arrived shaving is for the first time enjoyable. The almond scent is amazing, not musky so my wife even likes it. It dries quickly when done with it, but not on your face like the williams does. I tend to get allergic reactions from fragrances and this is the first shaving lubricant I&#x27;ve ever used without getting blemishes, ingrown hairs, or rashes. This is now my brand for life and can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> I just got started in DE (dual edged) single blade shaving.  I ordered 2 pucks of Col. Conks soaps and while both perform great, the almond is my favorite if I had to pick.  Lathers great, smells great, shaves great.  I think I&#x27;m always going to have Col. Conks on hand and use it as a bench mark to test all other soaps I try.  ETA:  It&#x27;s now a few yrs. later and I&#x27;m taking a star off to make it 4/5.  I&#x27;ve found some better shave soaps and really can&#x27;t justify rating this 5/5 anymore even though I liked it starting out.</li>
            <li> It is a cake of shaving soap. You need to put it in a mug for best results.  The plastic container it comes in does not allow room to work up a lather. Nonetheless it does a good job of sudsing and softening your beard.</li>
            <li> The Soap is nice and moist to the skin.  I purchased it at the same time I purchased the shaving Set with Mach 3 Handle.</li>
            <li> Cheap, lasts a long time, and lathers up well using my badger hair brush.  What more could you ask for?  The scent is light.  It&#x27;s not my favorite scent but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and doesn&#x27;t linger so I don&#x27;t care much about it at this value.  There&#x27;s other scents you could try too.</li>
            <li> Good product.....I&#x27;m a return customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the quest for the perfect shave ever since I started shaving, which incidentally, is the day I realized I really didn&#x27;t like shaving very much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Combined with a Gillette Mach 3 Turbo razor, this soap gives as close to a perfect shave as I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  Using this razor/soap combo, I am able to shave AGAINST the grain.  I still use other shaving products for convenience, but when I really want a great shave, I reach for the Colonel Ichabod Conk. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;By the way, the soap comes in a little plastic container that can be closed, so there&#x27;s no need to put the soap in a mug or other container.  This means it won&#x27;t take up much space in your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> We originally bought Colonel Conk shaving soap when liquid, gel or cream toiletries were suddenly not allowed in carry-on luggage onboard airplanes.  We bought a shaving brush to go with it and my husband was really pleased with the result.  Nice lather with a pleasant fragrance.    My husband flies very frequently, and when he&#x27;s shaving at home he still sometimes uses the canned shaving gel, but even though toiletries under 3oz are allowed on airplanes these days he continues to carry Colonel Conk with him on the road instead of shaving gel or cream.   I&#x27;d estimate he uses it about 4-5 days a week and at that rate one tub has lasted many months.</li>
            <li> This is a good soap with a good scent.  Obviously you need a soap container or bowl, but it is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I HAVE WANT TO TRY SOMETHING THAT I SAW MY FATHER  US FOR YEARS.I FIND IS ON AMAZOM,I TRY TO BUY A COUPLE MORE WAS NOT IN STOCK SO IF YOUR WANT TO GIVE IS A TRY I KNOW YOU WOULD LIKE IS ENJOY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many shaving soaps, and this is by far my favorite, smells wonderful, and whips up to a very thick lather. I use a vintage style safety razor, btw</li>
            <li> This was a very pleasant surprise. This was the first Conk soap I have tried and its a keeper. It lathers well, smells nice and shaving is great. Leaves your skin soft afterwards. Almost look forward to the next shave. I have been using it for several weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. I wish I knew about it long time ago. The packaging and presentation is rather unremarkable, but the Almond smell and lather texture are very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the subtle scent of this soap (if you&#x27;re wondering, it smells similar to an amaretto liqueur, but without the alcohol), and is pretty easy to load up in your brush and make into a lather, though I should disclose this is also the only shave soap I&#x27;ve used, so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to aside from shaving cream in a can.  The scent is not strong and will not persist once you&#x27;ve rinsed your face, but it does make the experience of shaving more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a brush and mug and absolutely obtain the best results with this soap.</li>
            <li> Smells great and provides a thick and rich lather for a comfortable shave. Colonel Conk certainly knows his shave soap!</li>
            <li> smells great and works just as good. I&#x27;m a convert to brush, cream and  single blade safety razor and  shaving after 45 years of multi-track shavers. Easy to use, wet brush and dip a bit of cream onto the bristles and lather up face. I shave only one or twice a week so I usually give it a second go for best results. Much quicker than multi-tracks​ because I don&#x27;t spend so much time trying to get the hair and cream out of the shaver. It rinses right out, easy peasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good, I liked</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I decided to start DE shaving was because I wanted to take better care of my facial skin. This product has very few ingredients and contains nothing that hasn&#x27;t been around for over a century. It&#x27;s about as natural as you can hope for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used and it was easy to get a good lather. I would recommend this over some of the other shaving soaps that contain garbage similar to modern canned shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Very nice product with a mild, clean scent. For me personally it is slightly drying but nothing significant with a moisturizer behind it. It is def. worth the price. I&#x27;ve had it 2 years without a making a dint in it.</li>
            <li> It leathers up great - just a small amount on the brush and you&#x27;re ready to go. The almond smell is not for everyone and while pleasant, it&#x27;s really not for big phifs. Stop smelling and just start shaving.</li>
            <li> Great scent and great lather. Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well and is long lasting. The only con is the scent. There is almost none and what little scent it has is not what I would consider almond. If you prefer a non-scented or VERY lightly scented soap this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Underwhelmed. Not even as slick/lubricating as my Cetaphil anti-bacterial bar soap, let alone my favorite shave gel, Tend Skin Air Shave Gel. I had high hopes as supposedly this soap is glycerin-based (and glycerin soaps are super-slick in my experience), but not enough glycerin and/or too much other ingredients apparently. This soap doesn&#x27;t sting my face like regular soap (e.g., Cetaphil), but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking for a good glycerin-based *shave* soap. The scent is nice though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure, I don&#x27;t lather up with a shave brush as one might typically do. I simply wet my fingers and rub a bit of lather up directly on the soap and then apply that to my face (with my fingers), and reapply as needed.  ....but a thick, foamy lather has nothing to do with the lubricity of a shave goo (soap, gel, cream, etc.)</li>
            <li> Fiance still shaves the old fashioned way and he loves this soap - it lathers very well and has a nice smell for me.</li>
            <li> Nice rich lather that hangs around long enough to shave.  Skin feels and smells great.</li>
            <li> Good shave soap and creates a good lather but I don&#x27;t like it as much as the Bay Rum. Just a personal preference for the scent.  The pleasant marzipan scent doesn&#x27;t seem as good once its on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent shaving soap. It works well for the intended purpose, however it does not give much lather. Also it does not have much of a scent, if you prefer unscented then this is perfect. It is scented though and should actually have the advertised scent. It is a high quality soap and is still a good item.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shave soap.  It doesn&#x27;t whip up a lather quite as thick as a traditional shave cream - it&#x27;s soap, after all - BUT it&#x27;s very slick on my face.  Much better than a cream.  The scent is subtle, which my wife appreciates.  I&#x27;m shaving in 2 or 3 passes (sometimes 4) and it&#x27;s very easy to whip up a little more with my shave brush each time.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job, but not a natural soap(if that&#x27;s your thing). Hence the only ingredients readily shown are avocado oil, vitamin e and almond fragrance(go check out badgerandblade). When I finish it, I&#x27;ll be switching soaps. This type of soap is meant to be used with a mug, brush and safety or straight razor. Those of you using Mach anything need to learn to shave(though they aren&#x27;t bad for your head), it&#x27;ll save you a colossal amount of money over the years.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Foams up nicely.</li>
            <li> The scent of this was a little to sweet for me, I also just could&#x27;t get this to lather well it was always really bubbly and dried up fast. I don&#x27;t know if a got a bad batch or if I was just doing something wrong but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with other soaps I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it lathers adequately. The smell does not stay with you after you shave, which is a good thing since my after shave is a different scent. The closeness of the shave using the same razor I normally use, gives a very comfortable and probably the closest shave I have ever gotten. Certainly much close than the Barbasol I have used for ever. If it lathered a bit more I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> bought this for my son and he loves it, it doesnt break his skin out and works better than shaving cream</li>
            <li> I really like this soap - it lathers well and it dries quick (when traveling).</li>
            <li> I know wet shavers consider these pucks kind of low end but I like them. Laters easily and is plenty slick. Smells great too. I find the more expensive creams that explode into thick lather don&#x27;t last as long and the thicker lather just clogs up my razor faster. Fit right into my shaving mug without any trimming also. Great value.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have been disappointed with any of the Conk soaps yet. Have not tried the line yet.  This does have an almond smell to it but it does not last long free shaving. Very thick and creamy and provides a great shave.  I will try the lime next.</li>
            <li> Repeat customer.  Better products, better tools, better shave.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and lathers well, but doesn&#x27;t last long. But all in all, it really isn&#x27;t a bad deal for the price,</li>
            <li> i bought this for my fiance who recently started shaving with a saftey razor (I think that&#x27;s what he calls it).  This soap works up a rich rather and smells amazing. Buy it, wear it, attract fine ladies.</li>
            <li> Very good shave soap for me will probable stay with it</li>
            <li> This is really a great shaving soap! It smells great, and it actually works a lot better than some of the high-dollar shaving gels I&#x27;ve used. Now that being said, there&#x27;s a few things I&#x27;ve learned about this soap.&lt;br /&gt;- First, you need a brush--a shaving brush. Yes, it matters.&lt;br /&gt;- Second, you need to get that brush in super hot water for 5-10 seconds. Shake it out. Rub the brush in the soap container pretty vigorously for 10-15 seconds, then move it to your wet face, and keep that brush speed up!&lt;br /&gt;This will give you a nice thick lather. You need hot water, a decent amount of soap, and a good brush speed to get the most from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this in lots of situations: with a shavette, with a crappy disposable razor, with long growth, and with short growth.&lt;br /&gt;Short growth shaving for me is horrible...it hurts, and I get rash pretty easily. With this soap, it went a LOT smoother!&lt;br /&gt;In general my shave is better with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the scent was a little stronger! I definitely am impressed as a first time shaving soap user...this is great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried 2 other shaving soaps and this is by far the best so far. Very importantly this soap creates a lush good foam. The foam is thick and is full of tiny bubbles that hold up well when applied to the skin. It foams up very quickly, which is really a plus. The soap creates a very nice slick lubricant for shaving and leaves a nice moisturizing feeling. I was left with no shaving rash and even without after shave balm my skin still feels nice and smooth. I was surprised to find that with this soap I was able to get the closest shave I have ever had, I never thought soap mattered for that. The smell is also great, not feminine and not overpoweringly masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Great shipping speed, excellent product. Shaving with this makes you feel as if you should have a cigar and a brandy while shaving. Great smell, too</li>
            <li> Wow you get a really neat lather with this shaving soap! It leaves ur face really smooth too. I am REALLY glad i made this purchase</li>
            <li> The almond shave soap had a unique smell that just seems to make you want to shave.  Works well and you smell great.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. The scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this soap in particular.  It&#x27;s got a lot going for it.  I really like the smell, it is not overpowering at all and has a good neutral smell to it.  The lather is great; it responds really well to how much water I put on the brush so I can easily control the amount of lather and how dense I want the soap to go on.  It also seems to last quite a while.  I have used one bar for 2 months and there is plenty left.  Finally and most importantly, it performs well for me.  Shave quality is obviously very subjective, but I haven&#x27;t had any razor burn when used with my favorite blades.  I will definitely purchase again when it finally runs out.</li>
            <li> But, then he doesn&#x27;t really shave. Well, maybe his neck. In fact, he kind of looks like the guy on the logo. So, you be the judge.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Great shave! Great value !! One of my favorites</li>
            <li> I like Conks soaps, this was a nice change instead of using bay rum all the time, and it was kind to my face.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use Col. Conk&#x27;s soaps and I must say I really liked it, it smells great and is very soothing. It took a little bit to find the best way to create the most foam but once you get it, it makes for a great shave. I look forward to trying new fragrances.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well, smells great, and has a great feeling on the face.  I will always have Col. Conk soap on hand.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t much care for the almond scent.  That is totally a personal preference not an idictment of the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing. And as a person who has asthma, allergies, and is very hypo allergic to many chemicals, this stuff does not bother me at all. You get a crazy amount of lather with this stuff, by using a good shaving brush and bowl. The only thing that is a minus with it, is that after shaving you get an oily feeling. However compared to other shaving creams in a can and others out there, this stuff is leagues ahead. The only shaving soap that I feel personally is better is the Proraso brand, or using a Shaving Cream Heater with a nice can of shaving cream like Barbasol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Col Conks stuff is good for those looking for an above average wet shave. Give it a shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Better yet, rotate your shaving soap, creams. That&#x27;s what I do, and find it to be a much more enjoyable experience across the board.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Shaving!</li>
