            <li>The best.</li>
            <li>A very good experience for me.</li>
            <li>It works great at the roots for extending the life of your color.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, if it works.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>Great product...very handy to have on hand in between color redos....</li>
            <li>The bottle lasts a good year for me.  </li>
            <li>My biggest dis of the product is the cost is over the top!  </li>
            <li>This spray is amazing and helps me to go longer between hair coloring appointments.</li>
            <li>and I love the products.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love this to cover my roots when my hair grows out.</li>
            <li>This is a product that is perfect for covering up thinning hair or color regrowth on blonde or light brown hair.</li>
            <li>very pleased with the whole transaction.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light brown.</li>
            <li>I would not buy from Quick E Shop again.</li>
            <li>Nothing else is as fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I loved the product, but it stopped spraying when still over half full.</li>
            <li>goes right through it without having to remove the hair powder first.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser introduced me to this Bumble &amp; Bumble cover-up product nearly 7 years ago and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>So I have to really jump through a lot of hoops to get some!</li>
            <li>The product I ordered arrived in a timely manner, was well packed, and exactly as I ordered.</li>
            <li>The product would be better if it was not a matte (flat) finish; if it had some shine to it.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and goes on fairly dry or dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Also there is no place to buy it where I live - Bumble and Bumble has exclusive right to sell it in their shops.  </li>
            <li>It covers the gray really well until I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>The price was better than other places I shopped.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to dye the new roots so often</li>
            <li>It covers the grey and is easy to use although I like the smaller container</li>
            <li>Although one of those shine sprays over top does shine up the dull finish.  </li>
            <li>Somehow it blends with my blond and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I will NEVER leave the house without first putting this on; never seen any other product do anything like this.</li>

            <li> I will NEVER leave the house without first putting this on; never seen any other product do anything like this.</li>
            <li> which is a real help because it saves my scalp from excessive hair dye irritation.  </li>
            <li> I use this in between hair appointments in order to hide the grey streak</li>
            <li> It covers grey roots</li>
            <li> The spray is a little pricey but lasts a long time as I only use it where my hair parts.</li>
            <li> so it makes thinning hair EXTREMELY less noticeable, actually it basically makes it look like your hair isn&#x27;t even thinning!</li>
            <li> I have dirty blond hair, almost light brown hair,  and the blondish works well for me.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it is extremely pricey.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is it tends to make the hair feel a little stiff so</li>
            <li> It is not available at any other saloon.  </li>
            <li> , sometimes the aerosol runs out half way through the can, lots of wasted product.</li>
            <li> A few spritzes along the rootline</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t mind the hair feeling a little stiff.</li>
            <li> I wish this product was lighter in color and not so stiff but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I spray the product in a shallow dish (sushi soy sauce dish) and then load the root brush.  </li>
            <li> Way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> This is the best! My girlfriend had it and I just had to have it! The color is perfect and it gives you body so no need for hairspray!</li>
            <li> The week before I get a root touch up, I need to hide the white along my part line. My hairdresser introduced me to this Bumble &amp; Bumble cover-up product nearly 7 years ago and it&#x27;s fantastic. A few spritzes along the rootline and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> I loved the product, but it stopped spraying when still over half full. I sent them an email and left a phone message. I did not receive a response. Very disappointing. I would not buy from Quick E Shop again.</li>
            <li> It covers grey roots so I don&#x27;t have to dye the new roots so often which is a real help because it saves my scalp from excessive hair dye irritation.  The product would be better if it was not a matte (flat) finish; if it had some shine to it.  Although one of those shine sprays over top does shine up the dull finish.  My biggest dis of the product is the cost is over the top!  Way too expensive.  It&#x27;s too bad I like the product.  I use it sparingly.  Also there is no place to buy it where I live - Bumble and Bumble has exclusive right to sell it in their shops.  It is not available at any other saloon.  So I have to really jump through a lot of hoops to get some!</li>
            <li> The product I ordered arrived in a timely manner, was well packed, and exactly as I ordered. The price was better than other places I shopped. A very good experience for me.</li>
            <li> I like this product use it all the time.  It covers the grey and is easy to use although I like the smaller container</li>
            <li> Great product...very handy to have on hand in between color redos....the distributor was terrific..very expedient...I believe I had it in 3 days....very pleased with the whole transaction.</li>
            <li> Found this product on a blog for women with thinning hair; this product acts like spray paint &amp; coats your scalp with the same color as your hair so it makes thinning hair EXTREMELY less noticeable, actually it basically makes it look like your hair isn&#x27;t even thinning! I will NEVER leave the house without first putting this on; never seen any other product do anything like this. If your hair is thinning this product will CHANGE your life. 4 stars because it is extremely pricey.</li>
            <li> It is the best stuff.  I have darkish brown hair, but my hair dresser told me to use blondish.  It works great at the roots for extending the life of your color.  Also, I am thinning and it thickens the hair.  The best.</li>
            <li> If you spray to close a clump of color follows. Rub your fingers in your hair to spread the powder and you get proven fingers tips. I wish this product was lighter in color and not so stiff but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This is a product that is perfect for covering up thinning hair or color regrowth on blonde or light brown hair. It is easy to use and goes on fairly dry or dries quickly. Doesn&#x27;t flake or fade off. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is it tends to make the hair feel a little stiff so, only spray it on the scalp or anywheree you don&#x27;t mind the hair feeling a little stiff.</li>
            <li> Love product but expensive, sometimes the aerosol runs out half way through the can, lots of wasted product.</li>
            <li> I use this product for covering my gray roots between coloring appointments!  I use a root brush to apply it.  I spray the product in a shallow dish (sushi soy sauce dish) and then load the root brush.  I apply the product to my roots!  It covers the gray really well until I wash my hair.  Then I reapply!  I have gone to my hair appointment with it still covering my roots and the color treatment goes right through it without having to remove the hair powder first.  The bottle lasts a good year for me.  I have dirty blond hair, almost light brown hair,  and the blondish works well for me.</li>
            <li> While the product would work to cover gray hair, the color is not blonde- it&#x27;s light brown. I would buy it if they improved that.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this product.  We can not find this product anywhere. I want to order it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, if it works.  I bought 3 and one didn&#x27;t have propellant in the can.  $35 dollars in the trash!  Tried to contact company for refund but get no response.</li>
            <li> my third can and I really like it.</li>
