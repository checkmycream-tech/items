            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to help fill in my thinning hair!</li>
            <li>Its best to wash it out of your head before you go to bed</li>
            <li>I find the best prices for this stuff on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>perfect, came faster even then</li>
            <li>Work excellent...</li>
            <li>Love this product!!!</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>You need to have some coverage on a bald spot to make this look good.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing covered my thinning hair and when I ran my fingers through, nothing on my hands.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>My hair color is a perfect match for this blend, and really helps with the thinning spots.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried higher end hairsprays like Kenra, but have found the cheap Treseme hairspray works best for me.</li>
            <li>It is costlier than most others, but I bit the bullet and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Make sure if you purchase any of these products to get the holding spray as well.</li>
            <li>Need more quality presentation</li>
            <li>I love X-fusion.</li>
            <li>I hope they will reduce the price so I can buy more to give away as gifts to friends</li>
            <li>am completely satisfied with X-fusion, and the seller as well.</li>
            <li>I think these &amp;#34;hair building fiber&amp;#34; products are mostly the same, you just need to find the color that works best for you.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife&#x27;s sister many many times.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more to cover my alopecia areata areas.</li>
            <li>I never like the first day of the wash, as the 2nd and 3rd day without washing the hair using this product tends to look best with good coverage.</li>
            <li>My ideal usage is: freshly washed hair, Topix Hair Fattening Gel, Sea Salt Spray, blow dry hair, apply X Fusion</li>
            <li>You spray (sprinkle) it on, it looks like you have a full head of hair and no one is the wiser.</li>
            <li>It uses fibers that are healthy for the hair, it is very natural looking - and boy, does it do the job.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat messy and the particles fly</li>
            <li>Love it, it blends into my natural hair to cover the bald spot.</li>
            <li>so now I can use it to extend times between root touch-ups, so a savings right there.  </li>
            <li>but as someone else said, it cannot be used right at the hairline as it shows.</li>
            <li>put it on and then spray treseme generic hairspray on top to hold it in place.</li>
            <li>Let it absorb a bit, then apply more the 2nd day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trick is NOT to apply too much the first day.</li>
            <li>(Dark Brown is really BLACK) and the Med Brown looks good, although I&#x27;m not as confident as people often ask if I&#x27;ve colored my hair.</li>
            <li>I want to participate in these reviews, but they require a certain number of words, which is rediculous and probably limits the number of reviews received.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>All the products work very well though.</li>
            <li>Possibly the best thing for anyone with thin hair.</li>
            <li>Getting caught in rain or going swimming will be a problem as the stuff washes away pretty easily when wet.  </li>
            <li>Most likely its a temporizing solution until you decide to do something definitive, such as shave your head or get implants</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>This particular shade is near black - so only for very dark hair - was perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After applying the X Fusion powder, I prefer to use the cheap Treseme hair spray over the X Fusion Fiberhold Spray as I don&#x27;t care for the wet look that the Fiber Spray makes my hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It has given me the confidence to style my hair any way I please or not worry in elevators when the light is shining down on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My natural hair color is med.</li>
            <li>I put it on my vertex where I have some wispy hair left most likely due to MPB.</li>
            <li>My stylist told me about this when I was losing a lot of hair, w/some bare spots where you could see my scalp.</li>
            <li>I just feel that it wasn&#x27;t worth the amount charged for such a small amount.</li>

            <li> Sounds crazy, but the hair fibers absorb oil - and yes</li>

            <li> My stylist told me about this when I was losing a lot of hair, w/some bare spots where you could see my scalp. Nightmare. What a life saver! It is not a powder that colors your scalp. It uses fibers that are healthy for the hair, it is very natural looking - and boy, does it do the job. It is costlier than most others, but I bit the bullet and am glad I did. My hair is growing in so now I can use it to extend times between root touch-ups, so a savings right there.  Especially helpful when travelling and can&#x27;t get to a salon.</li>
            <li> Love it, it blends into my natural hair to cover the bald spot. Highly recommend buying it. The only down side is if u scratch your scalp, your nails will be black.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years now and have no complaints. Make sure if you purchase any of these products to get the holding spray as well.</li>
            <li> Need more quality presentation</li>
            <li> This product is amazing covered my thinning hair and when I ran my fingers through, nothing on my hands. I wish I would have found this product years ago...Bye Bye mascara, eyeliner coverup!</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks. It made my hair look purple and dirty.</li>
            <li> I love X-fusion. This is the third time I ordered it. I hope they will reduce the price so I can buy more to give away as gifts to friends</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s great to help fill in my thinning hair! I won&#x27;t use anything else since I&#x27;ve been using this! Doesn&#x27;t turn my pillow colors when I Kay my head on it like the sprays that are out there. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works. Hides thinning spots and is undetectable.</li>
            <li> I lost a lot of my hair while being diagnosed and treated for hashimotos thyroid. Thankfully my hair has stopped falling but doesn&#x27;t seem to be growing back. This gave me my confidence back. I am amazed at how well it covers my scalp. It does require some practice so that the coverage is not spotty and does not look fake. It has given me the confidence to style my hair any way I please or not worry in elevators when the light is shining down on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on and then spray treseme generic hairspray on top to hold it in place. This particular shade is near black - so only for very dark hair - was perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it close to the hairline but as someone else said, it cannot be used right at the hairline as it shows.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  It fills in where you have thinning or gray hair.  It also thickens the hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely satisfied with X-fusion, and the seller as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two years now. I think these &amp;#34;hair building fiber&amp;#34; products are mostly the same, you just need to find the color that works best for you. You need to have some coverage on a bald spot to make this look good. If you are trying to cover up a spot that is just skin and no hair, the results may not work so well. I put it on my vertex where I have some wispy hair left most likely due to MPB. It works well and no one seems to notice. I cover the layer with hair spray to keep it in place and it seems to hold all day. I do find that if you brush your head against something, car ceiling, low hanging blinds, it ca rub off and leave with a spot. Also wearing a hat can cause the same problem. Getting caught in rain or going swimming will be a problem as the stuff washes away pretty easily when wet.  Its best to wash it out of your head before you go to bed or it will ind up all over your pillow case. And it can make a mess of your bathroom as the powder or whatever you want to call it will invade every space of your bathroom, medicine cabinet, etc. Most likely its a temporizing solution until you decide to do something definitive, such as shave your head or get implants</li>
            <li> I put one star because I was forced to put a rating. I have no rating to report, because I returned the product unopened.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the size ofthe package and the amount it cost, I returned it. I should&#x27;ve looked at the amount when I&lt;br /&gt;ordered it, but I didn&#x27;t. I just feel that it wasn&#x27;t worth the amount charged for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> I find the best prices for this stuff on Amazon.  My hair color is a perfect match for this blend, and really helps with the thinning spots.  Can&#x27;t be without it.  Just don&#x27;t get it wet, and keep it out of the bathroom when showering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using X Fusion and Topix products for several years. My ideal usage is: freshly washed hair, Topix Hair Fattening Gel, Sea Salt Spray, blow dry hair, apply X Fusion (Dark Brown is really BLACK) and the Med Brown looks good, although I&#x27;m not as confident as people often ask if I&#x27;ve colored my hair. My natural hair color is med. dark brown. After applying the X Fusion powder, I prefer to use the cheap Treseme hair spray over the X Fusion Fiberhold Spray as I don&#x27;t care for the wet look that the Fiber Spray makes my hair. All the products work very well though. I&#x27;ve tried higher end hairsprays like Kenra, but have found the cheap Treseme hairspray works best for me. I get my haircut once a week and will wash out my hair about 2x a week. Sounds crazy, but the hair fibers absorb oil - and yes - it does rub off on pillowcases. I never like the first day of the wash, as the 2nd and 3rd day without washing the hair using this product tends to look best with good coverage. The trick is NOT to apply too much the first day. Let it absorb a bit, then apply more the 2nd day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only recommendation is for the vendors to include their contact information for reordering. Each time I order though Amazon, it&#x27;s with a different vendor.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. I will continue to use it because it makes me hair look fuller!! Great product</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations.  I want to participate in these reviews, but they require a certain number of words, which is rediculous and probably limits the number of reviews received.</li>
            <li> Works grea!t I will buy it again. and again and again!  Once you used it, you will agree with me.</li>
            <li> You spray (sprinkle) it on, it looks like you have a full head of hair and no one is the wiser.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife&#x27;s sister many many times.  She loves it.  She will not go without it.  Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This was a shade too dark for my hair. I should have purchased&lt;br /&gt;the Medium Brown. It is somewhat messy and the particles fly&lt;br /&gt;when you try to put it on. Also, you will inhale it if not used properly.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Possibly the best thing for anyone with thin hair. I have used it every day for the past 3 years. It has become a necessity. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Product was received as expected. Natural dark brown color. Will buy again for sure</li>
            <li> perfect, came faster even then the delivery date</li>
            <li> Work excellent...I&#x27;ll be buying more to cover my alopecia areata areas.</li>
