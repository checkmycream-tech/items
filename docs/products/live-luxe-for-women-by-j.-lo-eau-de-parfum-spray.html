            <li>lol it smells so fresh &amp; so clean</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet and just amazing.</li>
            <li>My cousin loved the pretty bottle and every time I walk into her bathroom</li>
            <li>sweet &amp; warm in a way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Truthfully this is the best perfume I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time and would recommend it to anyone like myself.</li>
            <li>at first it smells good</li>
            <li>It has a great soft fruity scent which me and my girlfriend love.</li>
            <li>she had a good nose for picking good fragrance combinations, and i will choose another of hers at a later date</li>
            <li>Live Lux by Jennifer Lopez is an exquisite Eau of perfum, I bought it the first time</li>
            <li>clean!</li>
            <li>If you already like the original \\&quot;LIVE\\&quot; fragrance, you&#x27;d love this even more.</li>
            <li>It also arrived on time safe and sound....</li>
            <li>I loved this one so much.</li>
            <li>Love this scent, very fresh and fruity.</li>
            <li>2 pay full price!</li>
            <li>I have purchased other J. Lo products before and founded them of the best quality.</li>
            <li>came in mail very quickly</li>
            <li>but I SWEAR its usually so strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of more of a sweet, fruity type smell, so I bought this for her for Christmas without having smelt it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this without being able to try it first just basing it on the notes (which are mostly fruits) and also on the knowledge that I did love the original JENNIFER LOPEZ</li>
            <li>I first smelled it on a waitress at a popular restaurant</li>
            <li>It is very unique and slightly sweet.</li>
            <li>Arrived safely and quickly.</li>
            <li>Love my product very much!</li>
            <li>Bottle is very pretty!</li>
            <li>the scent is so unique and strong.</li>
            <li>but I got a huge bottle on Amazon for great price and it arrived the next day!!</li>
            <li>&amp; I can finally get it at a great price on Amazon, thank you</li>
            <li>It is light, neutral yet feminine scent.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s another winner by jlo, her perfume is fantastic</li>
            <li>I was trying to find something cheap but</li>
            <li>I was surprise how cheap it was</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, and it&#x27;s opening smells like a burst of tropical fruit and a bit of sparkly freshness.</li>
            <li>want the whole jlo perfume line I never knew they smelled so amazing ❤</li>
            <li>There seems to be another version available</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light scent</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;THATS WHY I REALLY LIKE GREAT DEALS ,,,, SPEND LESS FOR GOOD BUYS....</li>
            <li>This is such a light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li>Its unique fragrance will give you an aura of beauty and confidence.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get Paris Hilton&#x27;s original fragrance, but practically everyone I know wears it.</li>
            <li>I love collecting them and it was too pretty to pass up.</li>
            <li>recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s original brand JLO.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bottle is actually very beautiful and it&#x27;s a pretty large quantity of fluid the scent is just not for me.</li>
            <li>This perfume smelled great and lasted me longer than expected.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter loves this scent and as a Mom I loved the price.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not nauseating or sweet.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too sweet that it gives you a headache either.</li>
            <li>Smells like you swam in a vat of pineapple juice--too sweet for me.  </li>
            <li>I immediately rushed out and bought some for my wife, and she loved it, and wore it daily.      </li>
            <li>She was overjoyed at receiving it and loved the larger bottle.  </li>
            <li>To me the scent is a sweet fruity with a hint of floral</li>
            <li>I love GLOW by JLO, this not so much.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND SMELL VERY WELL</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad..</li>
            <li>i have always loved this scent, it&#x27;s a sweet pomegranate-ish (not citrusy) mysterious smell</li>
            <li>I Love this perfume Live Luxe By Jennifer Lopez!</li>
            <li>Smells so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t smell is potent as normal...</li>
            <li>The scent is very refreshing and gives you a spiritually renewed start in the morning.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love my new perfume, Live Luxe by Jennifer Lopez, and have received many compliments.  </li>
            <li>love both floral and fruity perfumes and Live Luxe is a mix of the two.</li>
            <li>This Is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>If frustratingly sweet is your fragrance then go right ahead and make the purchase.</li>
            <li>Last long and smells great!!</li>
            <li>and I thought, \\&quot;WOW, this smells sweet and refreshing without making me sick\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Will buy again long lasting not over powering, always told how great I smell when ever I wear it!!!!</li>
            <li>But recently, I have rediscovered this perfume and found myself in love with it!</li>
            <li>Fresh, tropical, fruity, fun and flirty.</li>
            <li>this perfume just smells so fun and flirty.</li>
            <li>Fresh, Fruity, Fun, &amp; just smells</li>
            <li>My 17 year old really enjoyed the fragrance</li>
            <li>So this scent is also powerful</li>
            <li>It smells so good, a little strong when u first put it on but levels out n stays with u all day.</li>
            <li>But I think the real reason she likes it (beside the fact that it smells heavenly) is that she has a much easier time getting whatever she wants from me when she is wearing it! :)</li>
            <li>Classy stuff that both my wife and daughter love at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Super fruity, but sexy at the same time.</li>
            <li>This is a very fruity, sweet, youthful perfume that isn&#x27;t flowery or floral at all.</li>
            <li>Definitely not old lady, too strong or sweet!</li>
            <li>First, although the bottle is beautiful it is hard to spray.</li>
            <li>I also purchased Azzaro Chrome at the same time with the same great results.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it so much went out and ordered it immedietly for myself, and keep the other one in my purse.</li>
            <li>Beautiful fragrance reminds me just a little of the old version of Liz Claiborne.  </li>
            <li>Good fragrance, it reminds my a lot of Paris Hilton&#x27;s first fragrance, but it&#x27;s a little sweeter.</li>
            <li>I like this better than Live which I got early this week!</li>
            <li>We both really like it!  </li>
            <li>Of course, that is, we really like it on HER!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite perfumes ever, and for the price it sells on here now, who wouldn&#x27;t want to buy it?</li>
            <li>bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find now, and I&#x27;m so happy to have it again!</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle, and I must say that this is one of my all time favorite scents.</li>
            <li>We purchased this through Amazon after not being able to find it locally.  </li>
            <li>I bought many of these samples and they give them away at the big stores Macys.</li>
            <li>So glad I found the much larger bottle for 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast!</li>
            <li>FIRST BROUGHT IT FOR ME</li>
            <li>My ex-wife likes this stuff and for her birthday recently my daughter had her heart set on getting her some more.</li>
            <li>When I first smell it I said to my self</li>
            <li>I bought my wife a bottle of this perfume a few years ago and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Live Luxe!&lt;br /&gt;You want to attract that special somebody to be your wife?</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance (very fruity), very noticeable and last enough.</li>
            <li>Sometime around 2004, I moved to a different work area, and our inspector walked by, and I caught that familiar scent!</li>
            <li>Back in the late 1980&#x27;s, I caught a whiff of a co-worker&#x27;s perfume, and it was so delightful</li>
            <li>Our former exchange student from Sweden loved this perfume and we had bought some for her last year.  </li>
            <li>&quot; is FRESH and SWEET (a gorgeous blend of the pear, peach, apple, freesia, sweetened honeysuckle), then the scent dries down to a very soft musk and vanilla with very slight hints of amber that gives this scent that SEXY and ALLURING trait.  </li>
            <li>I received the product very quickly, the price was much, much less than if I purchased at a retailer; and I received free shipping.  </li>
            <li>and the price was very decent</li>
            <li>Theres no possible way I can spray too much because its not overpowering or harshly sweet!</li>
            <li>I can still recall a particular scent of a girlfriend in High School years ago, the memory is powerful.</li>
            <li>I Love the bottle, and the box it looks really pretty sitting with my other perfume bottles.</li>
            <li>After wearing it, it is a little stronger than I like, but still a nice floral scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>i would give it to my mom since she likes it so much...</li>
            <li>Got twice as much for the price as I did in the department store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fruity.</li>
            <li>she really likes it.</li>
            <li>It fades like fast</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS FRAGRANCE BY JENNIFER LOPEZ.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that the bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li>but it was just too much for me.</li>
            <li>very inviting.</li>
            <li>Kohl&#x27;s I think it was part of the whole J-Lo collection there.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>smell fades fast....</li>
            <li>she loves it so much</li>
            <li>Those who do not like the very floral smells of other fragrances will LOVE this scent , sometimes I just get overwhelmed with too much flowery smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, this scent is hard to describe because it is so unique ... but the first thing that comes to mind is SWEET!</li>
            <li>In the 21st century, however, I discovered that Liz Claiborn had discontinued the original scent, and replaced it with one that didn&#x27;t work as well with my spouse&#x27;s chemistry.</li>
            <li>I inquired about it, and commented on how similar it was to the original Liz Claiborn.</li>
            <li>This is a fun, youthful fragrance that is more than just your usual fruity celebrity perfume.</li>
            <li>This Smells nice but does not last long at al;l.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;she really likes it &amp; bottle is very pretty &amp; big size you wont be dissapointed if youre a fruity/sweet smell person .</li>
            <li>Just buy it, enjoy it and re order it because you will run out soon due to how much you wear it!</li>
            <li>The description says ingredients of peach, melon, freesia, etc., but what it smells like on my skin actually is a musky sweet berry-ish scent.</li>
            <li>The spray nozzle is quite nice too because it doesn&#x27;t just spray in a close, concentrated area but in a wider mist it&#x27;s not just a small part of you smells like the perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But live is just too much for my senses...</li>
            <li>The main note on me is the passion fruit.</li>
            <li>I like the gourmand fragrances (Nina in particular)</li>
            <li>Stays long time so sweet</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell floral or fresh, just gross.</li>
            <li>It might be a little strong for some when you initially spray it on but the scent when it sits is so lovely and not overpowering however it does last quite awhile.</li>
            <li>I just never found it appealing, it is a bit musky and dark and not very fruity or fresh.</li>
            <li>I have Live by JLo fragrance, now I bought Live Luxe</li>
            <li>LIVE</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;LIVE</li>
            <li>It was Jennifer Lopez Live Luxe.</li>
            <li>year I buy her a new bottle for Christmas</li>
            <li>:B000JLEZN8 Live Luxe By Jennifer Lopez For Women.</li>
            <li>I get compliments when I wear this and LIVE all the time.</li>
            <li>Get you some Live Luxe!&lt;br /&gt;You want any type of girl that has a pulse?</li>
            <li>Live Luxe!&lt;br /&gt;You want JLo?</li>
            <li>Live Luxe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pour out both 3.4OZ containers of Live Luxe into a water bottle.</li>
            <li>It dries off to a soft, sweet, musk that is not masculine smelling.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for a young woman or someone that wants to think they are still a young woman.  </li>
            <li>It goes on really strong but doesn&#x27;t long which is kind of weird, based on experience with other fragrances with this strong of an opening.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t beleive that my favorite perfume , which I usually pay over $ 60 dollars was on Amazon for $28.</li>
            <li>Luckily enough the smell is just as pretty if not</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I think this might be new old stock given the difficulty of finding it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>and i was trying to find the original thing for thirty bucks but ended up buying it for less.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Came early yea, thank you...</li>
            <li>THIS IS A SOFT FRAGRANCE, NOT OVER BEARING.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and long lasting!</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s not a kiddie smell just mainly of fruits, it has that extra something for those wanting a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lasting power seems decent on my skin, maybe 4 hours tops.</li>
            <li>Might be a little sweet</li>
            <li>smelled better than expected...was surprised that the scent lasted that long for this small cost</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets whatsoever.</li>
            <li>but on numerous occasions (store, mall, etc.), I have had random people who are standing next to me tell me I smell really good.  </li>
            <li>The scent reminds me a lot of an Escada scent, which usually tend to be fruity and sweet.</li>
            <li>i was absolutely fooled by the other reviews.</li>
            <li>It is just like new with a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>Definitely a fun, summery scent, not mature or heavy at all.</li>
            <li>A bottle of this size usually lasts me about a year, and then I get a new bottle for myself at the start of the new year.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> sweet &amp; warm in a way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Truthfully this is the best perfume I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time and would recommend it to anyone like myself.</li>
            <li> at first it smells good</li>
            <li> It has a great soft fruity scent which me and my girlfriend love.</li>
            <li> she had a good nose for picking good fragrance combinations, and i will choose another of hers at a later date</li>
            <li> Live Lux by Jennifer Lopez is an exquisite Eau of perfum, I bought it the first time</li>
            <li> clean!</li>
            <li> If you already like the original \\&quot;LIVE\\&quot; fragrance, you&#x27;d love this even more.</li>
            <li> It also arrived on time safe and sound....</li>
            <li> I loved this one so much.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, very fresh and fruity.</li>
            <li> 2 pay full price!</li>
            <li> I have purchased other J. Lo products before and founded them of the best quality.</li>
            <li> came in mail very quickly</li>
            <li> but I SWEAR its usually so strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of more of a sweet, fruity type smell, so I bought this for her for Christmas without having smelt it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this without being able to try it first just basing it on the notes (which are mostly fruits) and also on the knowledge that I did love the original JENNIFER LOPEZ</li>
            <li> I first smelled it on a waitress at a popular restaurant</li>
            <li> It is very unique and slightly sweet.</li>
            <li> Arrived safely and quickly.</li>
            <li> Love my product very much!</li>
            <li> Bottle is very pretty!</li>
            <li> the scent is so unique and strong.</li>
            <li> but I got a huge bottle on Amazon for great price and it arrived the next day!!</li>
            <li> &amp; I can finally get it at a great price on Amazon, thank you</li>
            <li> It is light, neutral yet feminine scent.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s another winner by jlo, her perfume is fantastic</li>
            <li> I was trying to find something cheap but</li>
            <li> I was surprise how cheap it was</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, and it&#x27;s opening smells like a burst of tropical fruit and a bit of sparkly freshness.</li>
            <li> want the whole jlo perfume line I never knew they smelled so amazing ❤</li>
            <li> There seems to be another version available</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light scent</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;THATS WHY I REALLY LIKE GREAT DEALS ,,,, SPEND LESS FOR GOOD BUYS....</li>
            <li> This is such a light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li> Its unique fragrance will give you an aura of beauty and confidence.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get Paris Hilton&#x27;s original fragrance, but practically everyone I know wears it.</li>
            <li> I love collecting them and it was too pretty to pass up.</li>
            <li> recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s original brand JLO.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bottle is actually very beautiful and it&#x27;s a pretty large quantity of fluid the scent is just not for me.</li>
            <li> This perfume smelled great and lasted me longer than expected.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this scent and as a Mom I loved the price.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not nauseating or sweet.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too sweet that it gives you a headache either.</li>
            <li> Smells like you swam in a vat of pineapple juice--too sweet for me.  </li>
            <li> I immediately rushed out and bought some for my wife, and she loved it, and wore it daily.      </li>
            <li> She was overjoyed at receiving it and loved the larger bottle.  </li>
            <li> To me the scent is a sweet fruity with a hint of floral</li>
            <li> I love GLOW by JLO, this not so much.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND SMELL VERY WELL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad..</li>
            <li> i have always loved this scent, it&#x27;s a sweet pomegranate-ish (not citrusy) mysterious smell</li>
            <li> I Love this perfume Live Luxe By Jennifer Lopez!</li>
            <li> Smells so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t smell is potent as normal...</li>
            <li> The scent is very refreshing and gives you a spiritually renewed start in the morning.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my new perfume, Live Luxe by Jennifer Lopez, and have received many compliments.  </li>
            <li> love both floral and fruity perfumes and Live Luxe is a mix of the two.</li>
            <li> This Is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> If frustratingly sweet is your fragrance then go right ahead and make the purchase.</li>
            <li> Last long and smells great!!</li>
            <li> and I thought, \\&quot;WOW, this smells sweet and refreshing without making me sick\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Will buy again long lasting not over powering, always told how great I smell when ever I wear it!!!!</li>
            <li> But recently, I have rediscovered this perfume and found myself in love with it!</li>
            <li> Fresh, tropical, fruity, fun and flirty.</li>
            <li> this perfume just smells so fun and flirty.</li>
            <li> Fresh, Fruity, Fun, &amp; just smells</li>
            <li> My 17 year old really enjoyed the fragrance</li>
            <li> So this scent is also powerful</li>
            <li> It smells so good, a little strong when u first put it on but levels out n stays with u all day.</li>
            <li> But I think the real reason she likes it (beside the fact that it smells heavenly) is that she has a much easier time getting whatever she wants from me when she is wearing it! :)</li>
            <li> Classy stuff that both my wife and daughter love at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Super fruity, but sexy at the same time.</li>
            <li> This is a very fruity, sweet, youthful perfume that isn&#x27;t flowery or floral at all.</li>
            <li> Definitely not old lady, too strong or sweet!</li>
            <li> First, although the bottle is beautiful it is hard to spray.</li>
            <li> I also purchased Azzaro Chrome at the same time with the same great results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it so much went out and ordered it immedietly for myself, and keep the other one in my purse.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance reminds me just a little of the old version of Liz Claiborne.  </li>
            <li> Good fragrance, it reminds my a lot of Paris Hilton&#x27;s first fragrance, but it&#x27;s a little sweeter.</li>
            <li> I like this better than Live which I got early this week!</li>
            <li> We both really like it!  </li>
            <li> Of course, that is, we really like it on HER!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite perfumes ever, and for the price it sells on here now, who wouldn&#x27;t want to buy it?</li>
            <li> bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find now, and I&#x27;m so happy to have it again!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, and I must say that this is one of my all time favorite scents.</li>
            <li> We purchased this through Amazon after not being able to find it locally.  </li>
            <li> I bought many of these samples and they give them away at the big stores Macys.</li>
            <li> So glad I found the much larger bottle for 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast!</li>
            <li> FIRST BROUGHT IT FOR ME</li>
            <li> My ex-wife likes this stuff and for her birthday recently my daughter had her heart set on getting her some more.</li>
            <li> When I first smell it I said to my self</li>
            <li> I bought my wife a bottle of this perfume a few years ago and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Live Luxe!&lt;br /&gt;You want to attract that special somebody to be your wife?</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance (very fruity), very noticeable and last enough.</li>
            <li> Sometime around 2004, I moved to a different work area, and our inspector walked by, and I caught that familiar scent!</li>
            <li> Back in the late 1980&#x27;s, I caught a whiff of a co-worker&#x27;s perfume, and it was so delightful</li>
            <li> Our former exchange student from Sweden loved this perfume and we had bought some for her last year.  </li>
            <li> &quot; is FRESH and SWEET (a gorgeous blend of the pear, peach, apple, freesia, sweetened honeysuckle), then the scent dries down to a very soft musk and vanilla with very slight hints of amber that gives this scent that SEXY and ALLURING trait.  </li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly, the price was much, much less than if I purchased at a retailer; and I received free shipping.  </li>
            <li> and the price was very decent</li>
            <li> Theres no possible way I can spray too much because its not overpowering or harshly sweet!</li>
            <li> I can still recall a particular scent of a girlfriend in High School years ago, the memory is powerful.</li>
            <li> I Love the bottle, and the box it looks really pretty sitting with my other perfume bottles.</li>
            <li> After wearing it, it is a little stronger than I like, but still a nice floral scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> i would give it to my mom since she likes it so much...</li>
            <li> Got twice as much for the price as I did in the department store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fruity.</li>
            <li> she really likes it.</li>
            <li> It fades like fast</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS FRAGRANCE BY JENNIFER LOPEZ.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that the bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li> but it was just too much for me.</li>
            <li> very inviting.</li>
            <li> Kohl&#x27;s I think it was part of the whole J-Lo collection there.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> smell fades fast....</li>
            <li> she loves it so much</li>
            <li> Those who do not like the very floral smells of other fragrances will LOVE this scent , sometimes I just get overwhelmed with too much flowery smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, this scent is hard to describe because it is so unique ... but the first thing that comes to mind is SWEET!</li>
            <li> In the 21st century, however, I discovered that Liz Claiborn had discontinued the original scent, and replaced it with one that didn&#x27;t work as well with my spouse&#x27;s chemistry.</li>
            <li> I inquired about it, and commented on how similar it was to the original Liz Claiborn.</li>
            <li> This is a fun, youthful fragrance that is more than just your usual fruity celebrity perfume.</li>
            <li> This Smells nice but does not last long at al;l.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;she really likes it &amp; bottle is very pretty &amp; big size you wont be dissapointed if youre a fruity/sweet smell person .</li>
            <li> Just buy it, enjoy it and re order it because you will run out soon due to how much you wear it!</li>
            <li> The description says ingredients of peach, melon, freesia, etc., but what it smells like on my skin actually is a musky sweet berry-ish scent.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle is quite nice too because it doesn&#x27;t just spray in a close, concentrated area but in a wider mist it&#x27;s not just a small part of you smells like the perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But live is just too much for my senses...</li>
            <li> The main note on me is the passion fruit.</li>
            <li> I like the gourmand fragrances (Nina in particular)</li>
            <li> Stays long time so sweet</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell floral or fresh, just gross.</li>
            <li> It might be a little strong for some when you initially spray it on but the scent when it sits is so lovely and not overpowering however it does last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I just never found it appealing, it is a bit musky and dark and not very fruity or fresh.</li>
            <li> I have Live by JLo fragrance, now I bought Live Luxe</li>
            <li> LIVE</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;LIVE</li>
            <li> It was Jennifer Lopez Live Luxe.</li>
            <li> year I buy her a new bottle for Christmas</li>
            <li> :B000JLEZN8 Live Luxe By Jennifer Lopez For Women.</li>
            <li> I get compliments when I wear this and LIVE all the time.</li>
            <li> Get you some Live Luxe!&lt;br /&gt;You want any type of girl that has a pulse?</li>
            <li> Live Luxe!&lt;br /&gt;You want JLo?</li>
            <li> Live Luxe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pour out both 3.4OZ containers of Live Luxe into a water bottle.</li>
            <li> It dries off to a soft, sweet, musk that is not masculine smelling.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for a young woman or someone that wants to think they are still a young woman.  </li>
            <li> It goes on really strong but doesn&#x27;t long which is kind of weird, based on experience with other fragrances with this strong of an opening.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t beleive that my favorite perfume , which I usually pay over $ 60 dollars was on Amazon for $28.</li>
            <li> Luckily enough the smell is just as pretty if not</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I think this might be new old stock given the difficulty of finding it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> and i was trying to find the original thing for thirty bucks but ended up buying it for less.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Came early yea, thank you...</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SOFT FRAGRANCE, NOT OVER BEARING.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and long lasting!</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s not a kiddie smell just mainly of fruits, it has that extra something for those wanting a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lasting power seems decent on my skin, maybe 4 hours tops.</li>
            <li> Might be a little sweet</li>
            <li> smelled better than expected...was surprised that the scent lasted that long for this small cost</li>
            <li> and I have no regrets whatsoever.</li>
            <li> but on numerous occasions (store, mall, etc.), I have had random people who are standing next to me tell me I smell really good.  </li>
            <li> The scent reminds me a lot of an Escada scent, which usually tend to be fruity and sweet.</li>
            <li> i was absolutely fooled by the other reviews.</li>
            <li> It is just like new with a long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Definitely a fun, summery scent, not mature or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> A bottle of this size usually lasts me about a year, and then I get a new bottle for myself at the start of the new year.</li>
            <li> I have had it for the last three years but haven&#x27;t paid much attention, since I only sporadically sprayed anything on me in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and subtle at the same time, not much of a musky scent ( which I don&#x27;t like)</li>
            <li> .. doesnt last long</li>
            <li> My second fave, although it doesn&#x27;t stay as long.</li>
            <li> AND LAST A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> doesnt last very long...</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and even spray a little on after a hot shower.</li>
            <li> i can smell it all day long.</li>
            <li> My wife used Euphoria for a long time.  </li>
            <li> shame on me for waiting so long.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get this product from Amazon, but as a gift from my friend who studied in the U.K. and got this fragrance for me when we met after a long parting.</li>
            <li> When Luxe stays on over time, it smells a little bit like the Paris fragrance, but initially it&#x27;s something quite different.</li>
            <li> I had to get the big bottle because I had this and few other j.lo perfumes before when I was younger</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very long lasting, I put a little on yesterday and can still smell it today.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely not my type of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I received what I&#x27;ve ordered and it came faster than I had expected it to.</li>
            <li> i love everything about this product i recommend that you buy it because you will like everything about you won&#x27;t disappointed</li>
            <li> This perfume has a slight fruity slight musk scent.  </li>
            <li> I made a mental note of it, and promptly forgot about it, until it was time for Christmas shopping this past year.</li>
            <li> We were quite disappointed, and she switched brands, but they never quite had that special aroma.      </li>
            <li> This perfume was not available in Sweden either, so it was even</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it everyday</li>
            <li> wear this to work everyday.</li>
            <li> I ordered a week before Mothers day and the shipping took 2 and a half weeks!  </li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable and it arrived in two days.</li>
            <li> my husband and I could hardly detect a fragrance.</li>
            <li> but it is weak.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So now that the secret is out BUY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very expensive smelling (not one of those fruity splash/sprays whose scent disappear after a few minutes).  </li>
            <li> Sorry jenny from the block, not impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> Shipping can be expensive on these.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I suppose in the wrong way for me.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent!</li>
            <li> very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This perfume smells AWFUL.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.. When I put it on it smelled a lot better once it was  settled.. Good for summer time..</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! Love it!</li>
            <li> I loved this one so much.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent. I love citrus scents and I always get compliments on this perfume and you can&#x27;t bet the price.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, when i bought it this time, it didn&#x27;t smell is potent as normal... maybe its just me, but I SWEAR its usually so strong i can smell it all day long. Super fruity, but sexy at the same time.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this scent and as a Mom I loved the price.  A great deal at a great price and prompt shipping.  Thanks</li>
            <li> My wife used Euphoria for a long time.  I&#x27;m a fan of more of a sweet, fruity type smell, so I bought this for her for Christmas without having smelt it.  We both really like it!  Of course, that is, we really like it on HER!  LOL!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this smell. I get compliments all over the place. It&#x27;s definitely a bargain on Amazon. I&#x27;m very, very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a slight fruity slight musk scent.  It smells really good!  The scent is lasting.  I just got it in the mail today and it&#x27;s evening now and it still leaves a scent and it&#x27;s not nauseating or sweet.  I like this better than Live which I got early this week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume for many years and it doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s fragrance nor does it evaporates. Last long and smells great!!</li>
            <li> I came across this perfume, by winning a &amp;#34;girly-froo-froo&amp;#34; basket at a fundraiser. I thought i probably wouldnt like it and was going to give it to one of my nieces. after having it for awhile i finally decided to smell it. I absolutely loved it so much went out and ordered it immedietly for myself, and keep the other one in my purse. shame on me for waiting so long.</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since it came out &amp; I can finally get it at a great price on Amazon, thank you</li>
            <li> I have Live by JLo fragrance, now I bought Live Luxe and  I love it.. My two fragrances are durables and perfect for all occasions</li>
            <li> Love this parfum. The price was the best part, so afordable.  I will be buying all my parfum&#x27;s at AMAZON.COM</li>
            <li> I used to wear it a couple years back, and forgot all about it.  Got it again, and absolutely love it. It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite perfumes ever, and for the price it sells on here now, who wouldn&#x27;t want to buy it? It&#x27;s an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells absolutely amazing. Fresh, tropical, fruity, fun and flirty. The main note on me is the passion fruit.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume!  A bit fruity!  I ordered a week before Mothers day and the shipping took 2 and a half weeks!  Plan ahead!!!</li>
            <li> This Smells nice but does not last long at al;l.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t reorder or recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s purfum people u need to try it at a store before you buy it. Alot of pufums change smells on different people. What smells great on one smells like skunk on others. It&#x27;s a great purfum on me. I will buy it again and it was a great price also..</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing. It is light, neutral yet feminine scent. Definitely not old lady, too strong or sweet! This is my favorite perfume of all kind.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.It&#x27;s one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Absolutely not my type of fragrance. i was absolutely fooled by the other reviews. If frustratingly sweet is your fragrance then go right ahead and make the purchase. The odor of this perfume leaves me gasping for air. Look it&#x27;s quite above par for its price and Jlo didn&#x27;t just put her name on it....she probably had input in the fragrance oils. But live is just too much for my senses...i would give it to my mom since she likes it so much...But i don&#x27;t want to ever smell this again...so she won&#x27;t be keeping it either. I&#x27;ll have to find a stranger...cause the return policy on Amazon for fragrances seems to be more than i need. i should of spend my cash and order something better.</li>
            <li> i love everything about this product i recommend that you buy it because you will like everything about you won&#x27;t disappointed</li>
            <li> My daughters favorite she loved it. I would order this again from them again. She has not been able to find in for ever, so to find this and it to be so great was an awesome birthday gift for her.</li>
            <li> smells fruity .. doesnt last long but I think i will by it again.</li>
            <li> ordered this for my mom for mothers day , smells wonderful very fruity to me &amp; grabs attention ..&lt;br /&gt;she really likes it &amp; bottle is very pretty &amp; big size you wont be dissapointed if youre a fruity/sweet smell person .</li>
            <li> Live Lux by Jennifer Lopez is an exquisite Eau of perfum, I bought it the first time and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> ladies it&#x27;s another must have and it&#x27;s another winner by jlo, her perfume is fantastic i haven&#x27;t purchased anything but wonderful scents by jlo and the seller is equally awesome, packs it great and ships quickly.  A MUST HAVE, LADIES!!</li>
            <li> Got twice as much for the price as I did in the department store. Love this scent, very fresh and fruity. Husband loves it and is always asking me to wear it. I like it enough that this is the second time I have bought it. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, it is a great perfume!</li>
            <li> i have always loved this scent, it&#x27;s a sweet pomegranate-ish (not citrusy) mysterious smell that&#x27;s good for day or night.  The description says ingredients of peach, melon, freesia, etc., but what it smells like on my skin actually is a musky sweet berry-ish scent.</li>
            <li> very nice will buy again</li>
            <li> Wow! I was pleasantly surprised with this fragrance.  I purchased this without being able to try it first just basing it on the notes (which are mostly fruits) and also on the knowledge that I did love the original JENNIFER LOPEZ LIVE fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this scent is hard to describe because it is so unique ... but the first thing that comes to mind is SWEET! It&#x27;s also very expensive smelling (not one of those fruity splash/sprays whose scent disappear after a few minutes).  Those who do not like the very floral smells of other fragrances will LOVE this scent , sometimes I just get overwhelmed with too much flowery smell so I try to stay away from those.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;LIVE LUXE\\&quot; is FRESH and SWEET (a gorgeous blend of the pear, peach, apple, freesia, sweetened honeysuckle), then the scent dries down to a very soft musk and vanilla with very slight hints of amber that gives this scent that SEXY and ALLURING trait.  So, it&#x27;s not a kiddie smell just mainly of fruits, it has that extra something for those wanting a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;I love it! If you already like the original \\&quot;LIVE\\&quot; fragrance, you&#x27;d love this even more.</li>
            <li> It was given as a gift and it was well received.  She really liked it.  Glad I bought it.  May try it myself.</li>
            <li> I love love this scents it&#x27;s sweet and just amazing. My boyfriend always tells me how good I smell. This is a keeper in my book. The scent last for quite a while as well. It&#x27;s sweet and subtle at the same time, not much of a musky scent ( which I don&#x27;t like) it&#x27;s not too sweet that it gives you a headache either.</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. Stays long time so sweet</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t beleive that my favorite perfume , which I usually pay over $ 60 dollars was on Amazon for $28. And it wasn&#x27;t the eau de toillette but is the Eau de Parfum. I have received so many compliments on this perfume.I also love it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I will definitely use Amazon again for my fragrance purchases.  The deals are great.  I received the product very quickly, the price was much, much less than if I purchased at a retailer; and I received free shipping.  I also purchased Azzaro Chrome at the same time with the same great results.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sent. It is difficult to find now, and I&#x27;m so happy to have it again! It is just like new with a long lasting smell. I love it!</li>
            <li> My friend liked the smell--I am giving the bottle to her.  Smells like you swam in a vat of pineapple juice--too sweet for me.  Another reviewer had written smells like a fart from a hairspray factory--I am inclined to agree with that comment.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get this product from Amazon, but as a gift from my friend who studied in the U.K. and got this fragrance for me when we met after a long parting. I have had it for the last three years but haven&#x27;t paid much attention, since I only sporadically sprayed anything on me in the past. But recently, I have rediscovered this perfume and found myself in love with it! The scent is very refreshing and gives you a spiritually renewed start in the morning. Wear it to school, it doesn&#x27;t smell overly-stated but with a nice and pleasant scent appropriate for even a university setting. It makes you feel very good about work and yourself; helps me wake up in the morning and stay in a good mood all day long. I love this perfume! Its unique fragrance will give you an aura of beauty and confidence. Will definitely wear it from time to time when I am in the mood.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.  my husband and I could hardly detect a fragrance.</li>
            <li> Back in the late 1980&#x27;s, I caught a whiff of a co-worker&#x27;s perfume, and it was so delightful, I thought it would be perfect for my wife. I asked the co-worker what scent she was wearing, and she told me it was Liz Claiborn. I immediately rushed out and bought some for my wife, and she loved it, and wore it daily.      In the 21st century, however, I discovered that Liz Claiborn had discontinued the original scent, and replaced it with one that didn&#x27;t work as well with my spouse&#x27;s chemistry. We were quite disappointed, and she switched brands, but they never quite had that special aroma.      Sometime around 2004, I moved to a different work area, and our inspector walked by, and I caught that familiar scent! I inquired about it, and commented on how similar it was to the original Liz Claiborn. She explained that she discovered it at a perfume bar in a mall store, and thought the same thing! It was Jennifer Lopez Live Luxe. I made a mental note of it, and promptly forgot about it, until it was time for Christmas shopping this past year. I did a search for it, and found it on Amazon, and for an excellent price, too! It was, and is quite a hit with my wife, and me, as well, and she wears it daily.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, and I must say that this is one of my all time favorite scents. Yes!</li>
            <li> I looked around for a better price and this beat all others. Love the bottle as well as the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume since, like, 2005 and this is the only one I have every worn and I love it.  I would be exaggerating if I said I get complimented every time I wear it, but on numerous occasions (store, mall, etc.), I have had random people who are standing next to me tell me I smell really good.  It&#x27;s very fruity.</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent!!! Every where I go I get compliments!! It has  wonderful fruity scent and it goes great with my body chemistry!  Fantastic seller and price!!!</li>
            <li> smooth product in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Always have loved this perfume! Happy to not run out!</li>
            <li> Use to love this perfume, and I still do.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my mother.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of her favorite scents.&lt;br /&gt;She absolutely loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it was a great price.</li>
            <li> I did not expect to like any Jennifer Lopez fragrance. I don&#x27;t know why; I just thought that celebrity fragrances were overrated. I sprayed this on me on a whim and I thought, \\&quot;WOW, this smells sweet and refreshing without making me sick\\&quot;. I like the gourmand fragrances (Nina in particular) but I needed something that would be lighter and more bearable on a day to day basis. I wanted to get Paris Hilton&#x27;s original fragrance, but practically everyone I know wears it. When Luxe stays on over time, it smells a little bit like the Paris fragrance, but initially it&#x27;s something quite different. I love it and I&#x27;m glad I accidentally tried it!</li>
            <li> bought for female friend. she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Save your money honey. First, although the bottle is beautiful it is hard to spray. The scent is okay but it is weak. It fades like fast so I end up using my v.s. sprays anyway. Sorry jenny from the block, not impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> Nice size bottle and smells amazing totally worth it</li>
            <li> It is so perfect and delicious. I really love this perfum is so good. Its perfect for a date, so sexy.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS FRAGRANCE BY JENNIFER LOPEZ. IT GOES WELL FOR ANY OCCASSION. I HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF LADIES TELL ME IN THE STORE I SMELLED NICE AND ASK ME WHAT IT WAS.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it, the package came with no damage at all, great price</li>
            <li> Bright, tropical fruit and smooth caramel. This is a fun, youthful fragrance that is more than just your usual fruity celebrity perfume. I adore it!</li>
            <li> Classy stuff that both my wife and daughter love at a very reasonable price. I will order more and won&#x27;t hesitate to use this seller.</li>
            <li> I bought my wife a bottle of this perfume a few years ago and she loved it. It is not overpowering but it is most assuredly irresistible!&lt;br /&gt;Each year I buy her a new bottle for Christmas and I enjoy the intoxicating scent throughout the year! ....But I think the real reason she likes it (beside the fact that it smells heavenly) is that she has a much easier time getting whatever she wants from me when she is wearing it! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> this perfume is one of my favorites honestly. anytime i&#x27;m out of stock i just go buy another one. the scent is so unique and strong. must say jlo outdid herself</li>
            <li> We purchased this through Amazon after not being able to find it locally.  Our former exchange student from Sweden loved this perfume and we had bought some for her last year.  This was a much larger bottle at the same price.  She was overjoyed at receiving it and loved the larger bottle.  This perfume was not available in Sweden either, so it was even better.[[ASIN:B000JLEZN8 Live Luxe By Jennifer Lopez For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 OZ]]</li>
            <li> Exquisite scent! My second fave, although it doesn&#x27;t stay as long.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume... you use in the morning and in the evening you still smell it!</li>
            <li> Came early yea, thank you... Love it</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! Arrived safely and quickly. The price was amazing, so I ordered two and my husband said I should have gotten more and stock up. Haha great stuff</li>
            <li> good fragrance and original perfume</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my new perfume, Live Luxe by Jennifer Lopez, and have received many compliments.  I first smelled it on a waitress at a popular restaurant so I let her know how wonderful it smells and immediately asked her for the name of the perfume.  Price was great and I have no regrets whatsoever. Smells so clean and fresh.  Thanks, Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This smells like the fart from a hairspray factory. Five stars if you work on the street corner that said factory has farted upon.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance (very fruity), very noticeable and last enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for over 6 years, and I love it.  A bottle of this size usually lasts me about a year, and then I get a new bottle for myself at the start of the new year.</li>
            <li> My sister had this perfume and I loved it I was trying to find something cheap but something that smelled good and I seen this in Amazon I was surprise how cheap it was I had to get it I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume, my husband loves it too and everytime I wear it I get tons of compliments! I&#x27;m not a JLo fan but I am a fan of her perfume!</li>
            <li> need to sign up for prime account to avoid shipping on these. I bought many of these samples and they give them away at the big stores Macys. Shipping can be expensive on these.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for a gift I love the bottle hope she likes it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite smell on me. :)</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.. don&#x27;t worry about the under tones, over tones and so on. Just buy it, enjoy it and re order it because you will run out soon due to how much you wear it! Wife loves it, I love it.. can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent! It&#x27;s sweet and long lasting!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. The price is unbelievable and it arrived in two days. I&#x27;m very happy with my  purchase!!</li>
            <li> Daughter in college loves the scent..</li>
            <li> this is without a doubt the best to get this perfume.  this is the best price I have ever paid for it.  Recieved it two days after ordering!</li>
            <li> Interesting smell for my day to day activities.  Will recommend and order again.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume at Kohls before (1.7 oz bottle) paid an arm and a leg for it too! So glad I found the much larger bottle for 1/3 the price. :) I love the fragrance! It is very unique and slightly sweet. There aren&#x27;t very many perfumes that don&#x27;t give me a headache! This is one that does not! I do recommend this one.</li>
            <li> My wife loves she keep asking me to buy its her all purpose perfuse on our 4th bottle maybe more...</li>
            <li> Excellent. Juse as described.</li>
            <li> My cousin loved the pretty bottle and every time I walk into her bathroom I&#x27;m glad to see that the bottle is almost empty. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> WASNT PRIME AS POSTED, I WANT A DISCOUNT FOR HAVING TO WAIT. IT WAS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR MY MOM!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product excellent price came when i ordered its a great buy!!! i would recommend any one to purchase this!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells lovely. Might be a little sweet but with time it fades  so is not scandalous to wear.</li>
            <li> Got the item 24 HOURS later! Used it about 4 years ago. The smell and look of the bottle bring back memories.</li>
            <li> This perfume is wonderful! I love the smell and it lasts!!</li>
            <li> this perfume just smells so fun and flirty. Theres no possible way I can spray too much because its not overpowering or harshly sweet! I don&#x27;t wear it everyday but most all my nights out about town I wear it, and the smell itself makes me, and my bf, happy :)</li>
            <li> MY YOUNGEST DOUTHER LOVES THIS FRAGANCE  SHES MMM IT FRUTIE .&lt;br /&gt;THATS WHY I REALLY LIKE GREAT DEALS ,,,, SPEND LESS FOR GOOD BUYS....</li>
            <li> This is a very fruity, sweet, youthful perfume that isn&#x27;t flowery or floral at all. It&#x27;s light, and it&#x27;s opening smells like a burst of tropical fruit and a bit of sparkly freshness. It smells like a mix of mango, pineapple, melon, maybe apple or honeysuckle? It dries off to a soft, sweet, musk that is not masculine smelling. Lasting power seems decent on my skin, maybe 4 hours tops. The scent reminds me a lot of an Escada scent, which usually tend to be fruity and sweet. Bottle is very pretty! Looks great in a lit display or under a lamp. I would recommend this perfume for women under 30. Definitely a fun, summery scent, not mature or heavy at all. Not my favorite perfume in the world, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s boss loves this.  I have purchased two bottles as gifts for her.  The price i good and the packaging is just as pictured.  My wife said she loves it.</li>
            <li> Thank You I Like The Smell</li>
            <li> Delivered fast! Great purchase!! I Love this perfume Live Luxe By Jennifer Lopez!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SOFT FRAGRANCE, NOT OVER BEARING. CAN BE WORN DAY OR NIGHT, REALLY ENJOY THIS ONE, IT&#x27;S AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find this perfume online because it was one of my favorites, but it&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore. It smells AMAZING and I never have to work about someone wearing the same perfume as me. I get compliments when I wear this and LIVE all the time.</li>
            <li> Yet another product stores no longer carry but I got a huge bottle on Amazon for great price and it arrived the next day!!</li>
            <li> These two fragrances are the best in her line!  Love them both!</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance reminds me just a little of the old version of Liz Claiborne.  I usually don&#x27;t like buying perfume without trying it first but I decided to take a chance on this one and am very glad that I did. It&#x27;s also very long lasting, I put a little on yesterday and can still smell it today.  To me the scent is a sweet fruity with a hint of floral</li>
            <li> Good fragrance, it reminds my a lot of Paris Hilton&#x27;s first fragrance, but it&#x27;s a little sweeter. It goes on really strong but doesn&#x27;t long which is kind of weird, based on experience with other fragrances with this strong of an opening. I Love the bottle, and the box it looks really pretty sitting with my other perfume bottles.</li>
            <li> I loved it.... I need another&lt;br /&gt;I want the whole jlo perfume line I never knew they smelled so amazing ❤️</li>
            <li> This perfume smells AWFUL. Period. There is no way to even sugarcoat it; it&#x27;s discusting. Purchased it online without knowing what it smelled like. Do not waste your money on this product. It doesn&#x27;t smell floral or fresh, just gross.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume my boyfriend loves it 2 lol it smells so fresh &amp; so clean clean! its fruity but not too fruity and it lasts all dayy not to mention it smells reaaal sexy. I recommend :)</li>

            <li> I love this perume it  smells amazing one of my top favorites of all time. I had to get the big bottle because I had this and few other j.lo perfumes before when I was younger, it was the best! came in mail very quickly im very happy!!!!</li>
            <li> I love GLOW by JLO, this not so much. My 17 year old really enjoyed the fragrance but it was just too much for me.</li>
            <li> smelled better than expected...was surprised that the scent lasted that long for this small cost</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE LUXE IT SMELLS SO GOOD AND LAST A LONG TIME ON YOU MY HUSBAND FIRST BROUGHT IT FOR ME AND I LOOK FOR IT EVERY CHANCE I GET A MUST BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> I smelled this at Kohls and thought I liked it.  After wearing it, it is a little stronger than I like, but still a nice floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;i was glad I got the great price purchasing it from this seller.  Will be a good summer scent.</li>
            <li> Female age 23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear this to work everyday. This smells great :) makes me feel beautiful and sexy. I love it. I&#x27;m gonna get forever glo by j.lo next.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for a great perfume!</li>
            <li> sweet &amp; warm in a way. very inviting. I hope they never stop making it. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on this perfume, but I hate having to say it&#x27;s by JLo lol.</li>
            <li> My ex-wife likes this stuff and for her birthday recently my daughter had her heart set on getting her some more. Stores don&#x27;t seem to have this anymore, I got the last batch at Kohl&#x27;s I think it was part of the whole J-Lo collection there. Anyway, I think this might be new old stock given the difficulty of finding it anywhere else. There seems to be another version available but it&#x27;s not the same so we couldn&#x27;t get that one. The bottle is actually very beautiful and it&#x27;s a pretty large quantity of fluid the scent is just not for me. Perfumes are such a personal experience there is just no explaining what it is, to me it is chemical and physical. I can still recall a particular scent of a girlfriend in High School years ago, the memory is powerful. So this scent is also powerful but I suppose in the wrong way for me. I just never found it appealing, it is a bit musky and dark and not very fruity or fresh. Well my daughter was happy for mom and that&#x27;s all that matters. So the low star rating is just the whim of my personal subjective nose.</li>
            <li> muy buen producto la mujer encantada con esto lo unico es que deberian envalarlo mas pequeño para que el envio no sea tan costoso</li>
            <li> Just a wonderful, pleasant smell.....Thanks</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell of this!!!!!! !10 plus</li>
            <li> Great product, quick service..</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume! Packaging it came in was great.</li>
            <li> My mother enjoyed the product. She also loved the beautiful bottle. I have purchased other J. Lo products before and founded them of the best quality.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I like to gamble with perfumes and this was one of those times. I chose it based on the bottle. I love collecting them and it was too pretty to pass up. Luckily enough the smell is just as pretty if not even more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love both floral and fruity perfumes and Live Luxe is a mix of the two. It might be a little strong for some when you initially spray it on but the scent when it sits is so lovely and not overpowering however it does last quite awhile. The spray nozzle is quite nice too because it doesn&#x27;t just spray in a close, concentrated area but in a wider mist it&#x27;s not just a small part of you smells like the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully this is the best perfume I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time and would recommend it to anyone like myself.</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume!  As soon as I opened the box I got a whiff of this beautiful sweet fragrance. I sprayed just a bit on and Wow!  The smell is divine! This Is my new favorite perfume. This is one of those perfumes where if you walk by wearing it, it will get people turning around to follow the scent! A Must have!</li>
            <li> Is nice!  Arrived in perfect conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s original brand JLO.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND SMELL VERY WELL</li>

            <li> Love my product very much!</li>
            <li> I like the smell but i don&#x27;t think this is a teenager scent.  I would recommend it for a young woman or someone that wants to think they are still a young woman.  LOL i think it can be pulled off either way.</li>

            <li> doesnt last very long...smell fades fast....at first it smells good but you might need to carry it around all day</li>
