            <li>This is a nice kit.</li>

            <li>Compact size Nice for travel or to slip in your purse.</li>
            <li>Great product, its well worth the price.</li>
            <li>All tools included are well made, and they look definitely adorable.</li>
            <li>The tools could have a better quality feeling to them.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this kit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and efficient.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s OK, but the quality of the set was just OK.</li>
            <li>Bought this set for our 10 year old son so he could start taking good care of his own nails.</li>
            <li>They have held up great so far.</li>
            <li>But for this price... good deal thanks.</li>
            <li>The case is very functional and the bright color makes it easy to find in a drawer.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can easily put it in any of my purses.</li>
            <li>I realize they may very well work for others needs, and everything was packaged beautifully and they appear to be very well made.</li>
            <li>This was a great deal at the reduced price but would still be a strong value at regular price.</li>
            <li>Considering the modest price, I would say this was a good buy.  </li>
            <li>The quality is very good, the scissors are sharp and the tweezers get the finest of hair.  </li>
            <li>Sharp scissors, good tweezers!</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li>The implements are the most important element of this set, and they are very well made.</li>
            <li>I also love how compact the whole set is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it is not bad, so I give it three stars.</li>
            <li>Great set and very sharp.</li>
            <li>It is a nice cherry red in color and has a sturdy zipper.  </li>
            <li>Thos whole set is professional quality, and has a nice heft and feeling of quality of each piece.</li>
            <li>I am new to DIY manicure and found this set useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and you would only have to cut your nails one more time ever.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still use the old one and it still beats the new one even at a respectable age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The savings come in the case, which is imitation leather as it says, and it is a nice case.</li>
            <li>The red plastic cuticle pusher/under nail cleaner is a good, sturdy tool, and the long black cuticle tool has a flexible, rubber angled tip, making working with cuticles even more comfortable.</li>
            <li>The two pair of scissors are sharp and smoothly opetating, edges even and precise.</li>
            <li>The cutters are easy to hold and the red enamel makes it even easier to grasp them.</li>
            <li>It would make a nice little gift.  </li>
            <li>They are stainless steele, madecin Solingen.</li>
            <li>In One 11pc Stainless Steel Manicure &amp; Pedicure Kit, Travel &amp; Grooming Set, which is the one I use....much higher quality and clearly that set is a 5 star.</li>
            <li>All of the implements appear to be fairly sturdy and of above average quality.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty little manicure set, which would easily fit into your handbag or a carry-on suitcase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order a few more for gifts.</li>
            <li>These are just not precision (fine) enough for me, they are too big</li>
            <li>These are as good if not better than expensive tweezers i already own.</li>
            <li>Other reviews helped me decide to take a chance on this kit , and the special pricing was the tipping point for me.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for a young teenager.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li>Really the German quality.</li>
            <li>Each cutting tool is precision, cuts cleanly and surely.</li>
            <li>and I can barely get them near my cuticle!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Works exactly like it should be not much to say about it!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I am new to personal manicures and would like to learn.</li>
            <li>Very sharpen sharper than other Revlon units I have.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very sharpen sharper than other Revlon units I have.</li>
            <li> Neat little set, the scissors are high quality and do the job well.  </li>
            <li> big scissors were no aligned properly, and the small ones were not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> that is of a better quality, so this one was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;ll hopefully take care of it and keep it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Nothing is sharp enough.</li>
            <li> If you pay them enough I bet they could make it in solid nuclear waste</li>
            <li> The case contains the usual manicure implements, which are all the same cherry red as the case.  </li>
            <li> It is decent but not really good.</li>
            <li> Has performed as expected.</li>
            <li> The kit is small enough to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough for travel.</li>
            <li> The tools were sharp.</li>
            <li> I have bought other kits</li>
            <li> The clippers and scissors are sharp.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are sharp.</li>
            <li> The scissors are OK (certainly not great) while the nail file is quite disappointing by being small and too rough even on the &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It was missing a piece and had to be returned.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed because the tools are small and would not be useful for a pedicure.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a quality kit (above the level of a random kit) and bought this one.</li>
            <li> This kit actually looks expensive.  </li>
            <li> I  am not happy with the quality of this set.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry getting this set.</li>
            <li> That is very poor to send something at Christmas without all the parts.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Has performed as expected. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and love th color and price.</li>
            <li> Great collection of nail care products. Sharp scissors, good tweezers! Nice carrying case.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for a young teenager. Very impressed with the quality for the price and she is happy, too! I am thinking of ordering one for myself, too.</li>
            <li> Awesome, my office wife keep borrowing my clippers so I bought her own set and a set for me.  Happy wife happy office.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife.  She says the components function well.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Very sharpen sharper than other Revlon units I have.</li>
            <li> hehehe c&#x27;mon.. Germans make precision everything ever since God created mountains... this kit is no exception.  If you pay them enough I bet they could make it in solid nuclear waste and you would only have to cut your nails one more time ever.  But for this price... good deal thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought this set for our 10 year old son so he could start taking good care of his own nails. His fave colour is red so he loves this set. He&#x27;ll hopefully take care of it and keep it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because the tools are small and would not be useful for a pedicure. This is a manicure kit - not a &amp;#34;manicure &amp; pedicure&amp;#34; set</li>
            <li> Great set and very sharp. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty little manicure set, which would easily fit into your handbag or a carry-on suitcase.  It is a nice cherry red in color and has a sturdy zipper.  The case contains the usual manicure implements, which are all the same cherry red as the case.  All of the implements appear to be fairly sturdy and of above average quality.  Considering the modest price, I would say this was a good buy.  It would make a nice little gift.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, great price.</li>
            <li> Nice set; happy with the quality, and would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> very nice. leather case and tools well made</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought this set because I needed a good pair of cuticle scissors. These are just not precision (fine) enough for me, they are too big and I can barely get them near my cuticle! I realize they may very well work for others needs, and everything was packaged beautifully and they appear to be very well made. Unfortunately not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I was contacted by the seller and offered another set which works great:) I appreciate them taking time to find sissors that work for me. Thank you thank you!! I am happy!</li>
            <li> Great product, its well worth the price. Not junk made in China or Japan.</li>
            <li> Neat little set, the scissors are high quality and do the job well.  This was a great deal at the reduced price but would still be a strong value at regular price.</li>
            <li> Received on time.  Was a gift and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 for gifts well before the holidays.  Great quality, nice case.  They are made in Germany, and the tools work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I like this set. The tools are great for the price and they look good too.  comparable sets seemed to be twice the price.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  The quality is very good, the scissors are sharp and the tweezers get the finest of hair.  I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love this set! I am new to DIY manicure and found this set useful and easy to use. All tools included are well made, and they look definitely adorable. I also love how compact the whole set is. I can easily put it in any of my purses.</li>
            <li> looks great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping it holds up as well as reviews indicate</li>
            <li> I bought this set in hopes of it having normal-sized fingernail clippers. Nope. Since when did they get downsized? Fingernails aren&#x27;t getting smaller...are they?</li>
            <li> I was looking for a quality kit (above the level of a random kit) and bought this one. It is decent but not really good. The tools could have a better quality feeling to them. The scissors are OK (certainly not great) while the nail file is quite disappointing by being small and too rough even on the &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have another kit of the same brand (purchased some 10 years ago) that is of a better quality, so this one was a disappointment. I still use the old one and it still beats the new one even at a respectable age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it is not bad, so I give it three stars.</li>
            <li> I  am not happy with the quality of this set. Nothing is sharp enough. The only piece that works well is the file. I would not suggest this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Beautiful manicure kits! The kit is small enough to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Really the German quality. Recommend it to  everyone.</li>
            <li> It was missing a piece and had to be returned.  That is very poor to send something at Christmas without all the parts.</li>
            <li> Wonderful tools for the price!  This kit actually looks expensive.  They have held up great so far.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this kit. It&#x27;s small enough for travel. It&#x27;s cute and efficient. It is great quality in my opinion and at a wonderful price. I am thrilled with this kit!</li>
            <li> Great set, great quality, fast shipping. My wife loves it. With 3 kids she has 80 fingers and toes to take care of!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> The kit was really nice. The tools were sharp. I would like an explanation on how to use the tools with a label. I am new to personal manicures and would like to learn. I have bought other kits but I like this one the best</li>
            <li> After a lot of research and comparison, I decided to order this kit. And Im glad I did! Other reviews helped me decide to take a chance on this kit , and the special pricing was the tipping point for me. The savings come in the case, which is imitation leather as it says, and it is a nice case. Nice quality, very nicely made and fitted out with the implements. The implements are the most important element of this set, and they are very well made. They are stainless steele, madecin Solingen.Each cutting tool is precision, cuts cleanly and surely. The two pair of scissors are sharp and smoothly opetating, edges even and precise. The cutters are easy to hold and the red enamel makes it even easier to grasp them. The tweezers are qualitu too, with evenly ground tips that match perfectly. These are as good if not better than expensive tweezers i already own. The red plastic cuticle pusher/under nail cleaner is a good, sturdy tool, and the long black cuticle tool has a flexible, rubber angled tip, making working with cuticles even more comfortable. Thos whole set is professional quality, and has a nice heft and feeling of quality of each piece. I&#x27;m going to order a few more for gifts. You won&#x27;t be sorry getting this set.</li>
            <li> This is a nice kit. The clippers and scissors are sharp.  The case is very functional and the bright color makes it easy to find in a drawer.</li>
            <li> very nice quality and really good price</li>
            <li> Excellent product  I would buy it again, and recommend it to anyone looking for  especially for this price&lt;br /&gt;Works exactly like it should be not much to say about it!&lt;br /&gt;What a color my wife Love it!</li>
            <li> I just returned the set.&lt;br /&gt;The big scissors were no aligned properly, and the small ones were not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> I love it good quality and nice color</li>
            <li> Very nice set. The clippers are sharp. Compact size Nice for travel or to slip in your purse.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK, but the quality of the set was just OK. I also ordered the PUEEN All In One 11pc Stainless Steel Manicure &amp; Pedicure Kit, Travel &amp; Grooming Set, which is the one I use....much higher quality and clearly that set is a 5 star.</li>
