            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like tanning lotion at all which I love.  </li>
            <li>Would I buy it again, probably. :)</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I have bought similiar tanning products that did not work as well for much more money I like the smell and non streaking of this item.</li>
            <li>It is okay.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh scent</li>
            <li>but this stuff can be very streaky if not rubbed in good.</li>
            <li>the color is perfect, just like a gold,not to dark or light.no strikes on your legs or arms.</li>
            <li>Also the smell was nice at first</li>
            <li>Thank you for fine product.</li>
            <li>Going back to &#x27;Label me Beautiful&#x27; by Designer Skin until I find something else I enjoy.</li>
            <li>I am not to impressed with this product, it promised a rich dark color inhancement and for the price it matched cheaper lotions results.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the.</li>
            <li>But the over all lotion is awesome, and if you want an amazing tan Black Is Back will give you the results you are looking for.</li>
            <li>There is nothing that isn&#x27;t true about the description of this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion and am red headed.....</li>
            <li>It worked quick.</li>
            <li>Another great lotion in the series of what I call &amp;#34;The Black Lotions&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>PRICE IS RIGHT SHIPPED WITH PRIME  </li>
            <li>ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time!</li>
            <li>THESE PRODUCTS R U MUST GO IN A BRONZER BED OR HIGHER LEVEL THEN</li>
            <li>It arrived in a very timely manner!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>did exactly as it said it would do.</li>
            <li>Almost through first bottle,not really any change with tan</li>
            <li>Its pretty much self tanner.</li>
            <li>I have bought them in the past and loved them.</li>
            <li>AND WAS THE REAL DEAL...</li>
            <li>Our weather has been unusually sunny and it took about a week to go 3 shades darker.  </li>
            <li>Too much bronzer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much and the after tan smell is unbearable.</li>
            <li>BUT IT WAS VERY PRICEY----YEAH</li>
            <li>It is a thick lotion so it does not take much, and needs to be rubbed in really good or it will leave streaks...</li>
            <li>I have gotten better results from other Millenium products.  </li>
            <li>I love to tan and get naturally dark anyway, but this lotion took my color to a whole new level.</li>
            <li>Tanned quickly with nice color but left my skin terribly dry and flaky, wouldn&#x27;t recommend if your skin is dry at all</li>
            <li>I tan easily and get dark, this lotion had my color on another level.</li>
            <li>The only thing you have to be careful of is making sure you wash your hands after you apply the lotion because you may get the webbing between your fingers dyed from excess lotion.</li>
            <li>the skin after tanning  very soft.</li>
            <li>SHIPPED EARLY ...</li>
            <li>it has some high rating bronzers in the bottle it never turned me orange unlike some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve purchased .</li>
            <li>this product is okay.it definitely turns your skin orange if you are sensitive to bronzers but its not like oompa loompa orange and if you leave it on too long</li>
            <li>I really like the tanning lotion Black is back.</li>
            <li>I have nothing good or bad to say about this product.</li>

            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Now I only use every other week to maintain.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money should have sent it back my fault that I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t loose all of my tan.</li>
            <li> Package arrived as promised  and expected.</li>
            <li> I already have from two other lotions.</li>
            <li> If you want to be really dark.</li>
            <li> it works but dosen&#x27;t get me as dark as I want</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me as dark as I thought it would</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make me dark like I was expecting.</li>
            <li> NO WATERED DOWN SCAM HERE</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a boost in my tan in the past few days since using this lotion!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to tan everyday to keep my color up.</li>
            <li> It has a bronzer but not enough to make you look orange or fake.</li>
            <li> I am at least 3 shades darker just from one use.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have to say about this lotion is its smell...</li>
            <li> Big disappointment!</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all!</li>
            <li> so obtaining color when tanning can be a difficult task.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed with coloring..slightly orange.</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion after I already had a base tan, and it pushed my color over the edge.</li>
            <li> but now I hate it.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells awful!</li>
            <li> Rubs in terrible!</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone to just wanting a base tan and beyond!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I enjoy the. Scent , I use it outdoors and I do turn tan....I will use more ! Thank you for fine product.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion! Even tho it has some high rating bronzers in the bottle it never turned me orange unlike some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve purchased . All in all it gave me a great tan complexion.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Back is Back\\&quot; but the verdict is still out.Almost through first bottle,not really any change with tan I already have from two other lotions.Also using a moisturizer that enhances and maintains tanning results.Will update after second bottle is used.</li>
            <li> this lotion is great. I really loved it.</li>
            <li> Great product, have used this item with great results will buy again when the time comes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for a while now and I was amazed that I turned orange</li>
            <li> Its pretty much self tanner. It smells like self tanner and you must be sure to wash it off.. Wah online shopping.</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion after I already had a base tan, and it pushed my color over the edge. The only bad thing I have to say about this lotion is its smell... It has a burnt smell after you tan. But the over all lotion is awesome, and if you want an amazing tan Black Is Back will give you the results you are looking for. It is a thick lotion so it does not take much, and needs to be rubbed in really good or it will leave streaks...</li>
            <li> this product is okay.it definitely turns your skin orange if you are sensitive to bronzers but its not like oompa loompa orange and if you leave it on too long</li>
            <li> Used this lotion four times for tanning and I saw no difference at all. Such a waste of money should have sent it back my fault that I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Tanned quickly with nice color but left my skin terribly dry and flaky, wouldn&#x27;t recommend if your skin is dry at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I Amazon has Millenium  lotions. I have bought them in the past and loved them. If you want to be really dark. Go with the Millenium tanning products!!! They are the best on the market... Thank you Amazon for having them!!!</li>
            <li> ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time! I work at a gym/tan salon and own my own bed, I wouldnt go anywhere but here!</li>
            <li> LOVE ANY MILLENIUM PRODUCT BUT THIS SEEMED TO TAKE ME TO THE NEXT LEVEL...THE THING WH THESE PRODUCTS R U MUST GO IN A BRONZER BED OR HIGHER LEVEL THEN STANARD BEDS TO SE MAXIMUM RESULTS ...SHIPPED EARLY ...LOOOVE ! QUALITY PROUCT AND WAS THE REAL DEAL... NO WATERED DOWN SCAM HERE THAT I HEAR  CAN BE THE CASE BUYING ON LINE  ...BUY BUY  BUY</li>
            <li> This is an ok product. I have nothing good or bad to say about this product. But I will not buy again</li>
            <li> This lotion smells awful! Rubs in terrible! Not impressed at all! Would never buy again or recommend to anybody! Big disappointment!</li>
            <li> I do tanning for 2 years,and still trying to  find the good lotion . I think this is the one of them.  very good for the body,not for face. nice smell. the skin after tanning  very soft. the color is perfect, just like a gold,not to dark or light.no strikes on your legs or arms. I will order it again for sur</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is as described &amp; the scent is very good.  It arrived in a very timely manner!</li>
            <li> This was a very smooth transaction. Package arrived as promised  and expected. Would do repeat business with this seller again in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for 7 years and use to own a tanning salon for two years, and this lotion is all you could want and more. I love to tan and get naturally dark anyway, but this lotion took my color to a whole new level. It has kept my skin from plateauing and makes it so I don&#x27;t have to tan everyday to keep my color up. Black is back gives you a natural looking tan and doesn&#x27;t dye your skin, making you look like a oompa loompa. The only thing you have to be careful of is making sure you wash your hands after you apply the lotion because you may get the webbing between your fingers dyed from excess lotion. Other than that, I love this lotion! I recommend to anyone to just wanting a base tan and beyond!</li>
            <li> There is nothing that isn&#x27;t true about the description of this tanning lotion. It is amazing. I tan easily and get dark, this lotion had my color on another level. It is beautiful. I am at least 3 shades darker just from one use. The best lotion I have ever used in all my years of tanning. THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> it works but dosen&#x27;t get me as dark as I want</li>
            <li> Love it. Got great color.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Awesome on time delivery! Flawless victory!</li>
            <li> Our weather has been unusually sunny and it took about a week to go 3 shades darker.  After the third week people are asking me if I&#x27;m Mexican or Native American.  Now I only use every other week to maintain.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me as dark as I thought it would (I tan 3-4 times a week).  I have gotten better results from other Millenium products.  However, the smell is AMAZING!  It doesn&#x27;t smell like tanning lotion at all which I love.  Would I buy it again, probably. :)</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but it tends to stain your hands even after wiping them off after application. Too much bronzer.</li>
            <li> I really like the tanning lotion Black is back. It worked quick. It lasts a long time. I tanned for 1 month and went a week to 2 weeks not tanning and I didn&#x27;t loose all of my tan. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. I can tan 2-3 times a week and keep my tan with this lotion. It has a nice fresh scent and I have been complemented with the smell often. It has a bronzer but not enough to make you look orange or fake. You will love this!!</li>
            <li> Another great lotion in the series of what I call &amp;#34;The Black Lotions&amp;#34;. As in &amp;#34;Paint It Black&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Solid Black&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Black &amp; Tan&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;For those that like a tingle product, try &amp;#34;Insanely Black&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;Black Is Back&amp;#34; has a great aroma to it, great texture and really good bronzers. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am not to impressed with this product, it promised a rich dark color inhancement and for the price it matched cheaper lotions results.</li>
            <li> I have bought similiar tanning products that did not work as well for much more money I like the smell and non streaking of this item.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a great purchase!!  I have a fair complexion and am red headed.....so obtaining color when tanning can be a difficult task.  But this lotion is amazing.  I can get wonderful color and get it faster.  Definately would recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> wonderful product and service. did exactly as it said it would do. only used 3 times and took my tan to another level. will def buy again with same seller. came sooner that what they said 2 expect it. would give 10 stars if it was avail.</li>
            <li> I bought this and got great color results when rubbed in good. I tan all year so I have good color but this stuff can be very streaky if not rubbed in good. Everyone compliments my color though. Also the smell was nice at first but now I hate it. It&#x27;s too much and the after tan smell is unbearable.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a boost in my tan in the past few days since using this lotion! I personally just don&#x27;t like the smell &amp; the Orange streaks that I&#x27;ve gotten. Overall, I would recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with coloring..slightly orange. Didn&#x27;t make me dark like I was expecting. Don&#x27;t forget to wipe your hands and feet! Definitely don&#x27;t like the burnt lotion after smell. I took a shower and I still smell it! Definitely going to avoid using this again. Going back to &#x27;Label me Beautiful&#x27; by Designer Skin until I find something else I enjoy.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO TRY THIS PRODUCT BUT IT WAS VERY PRICEY----YEAH AMAZON  PRICE IS RIGHT SHIPPED WITH PRIME  AND THE PRODUCT IS GREAT - SMELLS GOOD WORKS WELL WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> It is okay.  I don&#x27;t feel like I get great color from it, and I do not like the smell of it after tanning.  My husband and daughter always know when I&#x27;ve been tanning because they can smell it.</li>
