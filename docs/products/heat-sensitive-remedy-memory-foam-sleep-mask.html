            <li>The best part is the shape of this mask.  </li>
            <li>one, though, is perfect.</li>
            <li>Best mask out there.  </li>
            <li>BEST EVAR.</li>
            <li>I am SO happy that I chose this!  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful choice.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping that it would be a good replacement for my trusted Sharper Image sleep mask</li>
            <li>It also does a superb job of keeping out almost all light.  </li>
            <li>The quality is good, of course is a memory foam.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with this product and it has really helped me sleep through our bright summers.</li>
            <li>the good side, it does block ambient light very nicely.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sleep mask!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the bulk this is a great mask, if the a bulky (but light) fabric on your face causes problems then this might not be for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are fairly bulky and take some getting used to, but once I did I&#x27;ve never been able to sleep without them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially good if you&#x27;re a back-sleeper, or a frequent airplane/car traveler who sleeps in an upright seat.</li>
            <li>They are the absolute best at blocking out the light and can be washed.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable when sleeping on my side.</li>
            <li>Love mine.</li>
            <li>The light was driving me nuts!</li>
            <li>Every one I&#x27;ve tried has leaked light OR felt like my head was wrapped in a t-shirt (I said I&#x27;d tried em all!).</li>
            <li>I thought, ok..</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t do better.</li>
            <li>Also sometimes it feels a bit abrasive, most times I don&#x27;t notice it</li>
            <li>has so many kinks you need muscle relaxers..</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these</li>
            <li>This eye mask may be memory foam, but it is bulky and kind of rigid, doesn&#x27;t conform too well to the face, although it does block the light and has the velcro wrap to adjust it with.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering these - they looked bulky.</li>
            <li>This item does a phenomenal job of keeping the light out, and most of the time is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I consider pretty good wear for having been worn every day and washed a lot.</li>
            <li>The memory foam in front is very comfortable against your face and cheekbones; and the nose indentation is a thoughtful touch that makes it easier to breathe.</li>
            <li>Fits snuggly, although it takes some adjustment, it doesnt let any light through and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love this mask because it covers well and is ver comfortable.</li>
            <li>every bit as comfortable as the masks costing much more.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully for blocking light all the way around through, even the bottom where it had extra pad to block light rom leaking in under the lower eye socket.</li>
            <li>and, As far as blocking light, this thing is suitable for falling asleep on the bright side of Mercury.  </li>
            <li>Plus, if you live in a warm climate, your eyes will get super warm under there.</li>
            <li>Super comfortable and blocks out all light, the velcro strap could be a little bit better, but its perfectly foamy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of the box, it looks HUGE.</li>
            <li>This was a HUGE improvement (but perhaps the manufacturer should consider offering two styles).</li>
            <li>Also, I have a huge nose, and I have not had any problems with the nose part on the mask.</li>
            <li>For those of us side-sleepers, there is a great deal of memory-foam padding on the sides that doesn&#x27;t actually permit your head to fully touch the pillow.</li>
            <li>Blots out all light comfortably</li>
            <li>Works great for  my husband who works third shift!</li>
            <li>It breathes, stays on, and keeps the light out.</li>
            <li>This product does block out the light</li>
            <li>What a comfortable sleep mask.</li>
            <li>I find that my sleep is much deeper and more fulfilling when I sleep with a light-blocking mask, and the one I&#x27;d gotten from the airlines was working OK, but it was time for an upgrade.</li>
            <li>True, it does block out the light.  </li>
            <li>This is a very cushy, comforting mask that will definitely block out nearly all forms of light.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found this sleep mask.</li>
            <li>Ok, I will say that the cover is soft and the memory foam pliable, BUT...this thing is HUGE!  </li>
            <li>It is a quick fix</li>
            <li>This is light, stays cool and, most excitingly, because most don&#x27;t, stays on without tight straps.</li>
            <li>but if I had to sleep during the day, I would keep trying to get used to it because it really does block the light.</li>
            <li>This eye mask is a very comfy memory foam mask that blocks out the light for a restful night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>The back is adjustable via velcro, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Soft &amp; are comfortable!</li>
            <li>No too manly, but a dudes gotta sleep, right?  </li>
            <li>Mine did seem a little flimsy and the sowing isn&#x27;t all that great, but it really does the job</li>
            <li>The Velcro closure on the back is great, but needs to be easier to rip open.</li>
            <li>While this product does perform well in darkening the room, I find it too bulky and hot.</li>
            <li>It may work better in the winter when extra warmth in wanted.</li>

            <li>This is my first attempt at sleeping with a mask.</li>
            <li>Great to use as travel mask for those long overnight and international flights.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does get hot after 8 hours of sack time.</li>
            <li>The two problems with it are that the sides (which are a great idea) are too thick, it takes getting used to when I turn from side to side</li>
            <li>This is comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li>It was definitely an essential necessity since its daylight for more than 20 hours</li>
            <li>My dog decided to use the first as a chew toy, so I needed a</li>
            <li>It also had a funny, perfumy scent.</li>
            <li>I ride the train a lot long distance, and fly, and these have saved me from countless shi77y conversations.</li>
            <li>Very soft, easily strap around my big head, and immediately block out ALL light.</li>
            <li>Very bulky to sleep with head on the pillow sideways at first, but blocks light like no other sleep mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really molded to me and I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for 3 months.</li>
            <li>though, they are pretty much</li>
            <li>I sleep on both side and back and the mask stays on easily, and Inhave forgotten it was on.</li>
            <li>This item is so huge and weighty, the only use for it imaginable would be as eye protection during a boxing match.</li>
            <li>The Memory foam is very bulky and does not flatten to form to your face.</li>
            <li>I really like the concept of this mask</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll really use it very often.</li>
            <li>Why pay so much.</li>
            <li>The added softness and full-coverage feel really make you feel encapsulated, which is soothing.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li>replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this item has gone down since I first purchased them (a year ago or so), but not terribly.</li>
            <li>The bits that fall beneath my eyes to keep the light out were too small and flimsy, meaning plenty of light snuck in from the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did not completely block the light.</li>
            <li>They really should explain themselves a little better.</li>
            <li>Too big and bulky, and it leaves a big gap at the bottom, which lets light in!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Wow, this really works.  </li>
            <li>The foam is much too firm when compared to the one from Sharper image and the straps are significantly shorter, which with my large noggin seems to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you just push it up or down on your face to fit in the right spot, it is quite cozy and blocks out ALL light.</li>
            <li>Works the same for my tiny headed (but hugely brained)</li>
            <li>so if you sleep on your back no problem otherwise just be aware.</li>
            <li>While it is comfortable, the memory foam is to bulky to allow you to  sleep on your side  or face down.</li>
            <li>This is made from EXACTLY the same material as my old tempurpedic brand mask.  </li>
            <li>this one though it is very comfortable its too thick to the point you cannot sleep on your side with it on.</li>
            <li>Wish the velcro strap was a little longer, but other than that seems to help him get better sleep!</li>
            <li>Heat sensitive?  </li>
            <li>I go to bed early.</li>
            <li>I would hope it wouldnt let in any light round the nose opening</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li>It heat sensitive.</li>
            <li>I had one before and it was soft.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t say much for the initial quality of the product.</li>
            <li>The foam isn&#x27;t as soft and the fabric isn&#x27;t as soft either.</li>
            <li>After one hour of wearing it I developed a headache.</li>
            <li>It really blocks the light well, much more than those silly little masks that are a piece of fabric and some string.  </li>
            <li>Sleep masks tend to fall off of me, slide around, or let in the light around my nose (it isn&#x27;t a small nose!)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>they are thicker than normal ones you have to sleep on your back when wearing</li>
            <li>Blocks out 100% of the light, at least on me.</li>
            <li>That said, generally I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li>Its soo thick that you can still see light because its not flush to your face.</li>
            <li>Nicely thick but does not match the quality of the original from Sharper Image.</li>
            <li>I started to get into the habit of using a sleep mask recently, but my previous one was a small simple fabric mask, and it was only somewhat effective.</li>
            <li>It is dark, fits snug (adjustable) and really does the job, even during the day time if you are sleeping during the day.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of the large black glasses (TIMES</li>
            <li>I get the same amount of sun block from cheap little covers and the elastic is not as heavy feeling as the velcro strap on this.</li>
            <li>A little thick &amp; heavy, but good mask</li>

            <li> I go to bed early.</li>
            <li> I would hope it wouldnt let in any light round the nose opening</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> It heat sensitive.</li>
            <li> I had one before and it was soft.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t say much for the initial quality of the product.</li>
            <li> The foam isn&#x27;t as soft and the fabric isn&#x27;t as soft either.</li>
            <li> After one hour of wearing it I developed a headache.</li>
            <li> It really blocks the light well, much more than those silly little masks that are a piece of fabric and some string.  </li>
            <li> Sleep masks tend to fall off of me, slide around, or let in the light around my nose (it isn&#x27;t a small nose!)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> they are thicker than normal ones you have to sleep on your back when wearing</li>
            <li> Blocks out 100% of the light, at least on me.</li>
            <li> That said, generally I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Its soo thick that you can still see light because its not flush to your face.</li>
            <li> Nicely thick but does not match the quality of the original from Sharper Image.</li>
            <li> I started to get into the habit of using a sleep mask recently, but my previous one was a small simple fabric mask, and it was only somewhat effective.</li>
            <li> It is dark, fits snug (adjustable) and really does the job, even during the day time if you are sleeping during the day.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of the large black glasses (TIMES</li>
            <li> I get the same amount of sun block from cheap little covers and the elastic is not as heavy feeling as the velcro strap on this.</li>
            <li> A little thick &amp; heavy, but good mask</li>
            <li> Not bad but too thick , really only good to use in air travel for seated sleep , for regular in bed sleep  is way too thick and can ble uncomfortable at times.</li>
            <li> It is SO cozy and soft, and the memory foam really makes it a nice thing to sleep with on your face (sometimes having things on your face when you&#x27;re sleeping is really annoying).</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on the sensitivity of the person, I usually notice the abrasiveness when i really can&#x27;t sleep</li>
            <li> The velcro gets caught in my hair because it&#x27;s not quite long enough when wrapping around my head, so the velcro is exposed.</li>
            <li> I wish there no forms on the sides (flat side may help)</li>
            <li> Some others complained about the thick velcro strap in back - if you push it up higher or lower on the back of your head that problem really is resolved.</li>
            <li> After a while, the insulating factor of that thick foam made me quite hot, so then I was sweating into the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But they are feather light, but thick and fluffy.</li>
            <li> The mask is relatively good, but the foam is so thick that it is somewhat uncomfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it is hard to understand why some things even exist -- swamps, nerve gas, clowns, people who stand in doorways to have an intimate chat that can&#x27;t be interrupted...  </li>
            <li> So comfortable, it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to sleep without it now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and you can open your eyes wide and not hit the mask.</li>
            <li> It is a tad thicker than other similar masks.</li>
            <li> Spend a little extra and get one that does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and don&#x27;t double buy like I did.</li>
            <li> I like the review that said to cut open the padding under the eyes and let that flap down</li>
            <li> The thickness around the nose actually presses down -- interfering with breathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Velcro elastic band around the back of my head was hook-side facing in, and it wasn&#x27;t just a little patch toward the end.  </li>
            <li> It is so heavy that it bruised my eyes when I lay on my back trying to overcome a migraine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It is way to thick and not too soft.</li>
            <li> Only detractor was that small flaps which form a bumper under your eyes came loose almost immediately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely comfy.</li>
            <li> They are not hot, but they do pick up loads of lint.</li>
            <li> Recommended for travelers or other people who sleep a lot sitting up.</li>
            <li> It is a gift for my daughter who has extreme insomnia.</li>
            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes working night shift and sleeping during the day extremely delightful.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> i have vampire hours due to my business and sleep odd hours.</li>
            <li> And this is the BIG complaint:</li>
            <li> My only complaint is bc</li>
            <li> The wife,however likes to rev down by reading in bed or using her laptop.</li>
            <li> The thickness of the sleep mask takes a little getting used to because other brands are so flimsy in comparison.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even sleep in it because it titled my head at an odd level and made my neck hurt.  </li>
            <li> The product is listed as black velvet.  </li>
            <li> -- I think that would make the mask less bulky.</li>
            <li> It is cheap polyester fabric and sofa cushion bulky, darn it.  :(  </li>
            <li> Those little pillow things on the inside keep the mask away from your eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a little face</li>
            <li> This one is soft on your face but impossible to sleep in any position except on your back.</li>
            <li> waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> No light leaks from a ANY angle.  </li>
            <li> and it just begins to feel heavy and burdensome.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t apply any pressure unevenly, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing an elastic band on your head.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> But all is not lost since it forced me yo seek out other solutions which lead me to the wrap-a-nap.</li>
            <li> Too bulky &amp; stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick black cloth wrapped slab of memory foam with a couple little pillowy things on the inside.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask every night for the past year, and it has served me well.</li>
            <li> The Velcro pulls out hair and it makes it hard o breath.</li>
            <li> I have eclectic sleeping habits and sometimes have a really hard to sleep.</li>
            <li> I found it to be bulky and hard to wear for sleeping.</li>
            <li> It is bulky and the sides are so hard and lumpy</li>
            <li> Side note: it stretches out with time, but I have just kept tightening the back strap and cutting off the excess velcro.</li>
            <li> Wish I had read all the negative comments before I purchased this sleep mask.  </li>
            <li> The bulk of it is way too thick.  </li>
            <li> but it was waaaay too thick on the sides.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very thick and the velcro strap becomes a nuisance when you are asleep</li>
            <li> Or maybe you could wear one on each knee for a midnight hockey game on Lake Saskatchewan.  </li>
            <li> Worse fabric and shorter strap.</li>
            <li> This is a poorly designed/assembled mask and I do not recommend purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Trying to lay down with my head turned to the side was very uncomfortable since there was an inch of foam lifting my temple up off the pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging also was weird.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was totally wrong.  </li>
            <li> It seems weird</li>
            <li> The thing I did like is the comfort, when I&#x27;m sleep the form at each side is really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like sleeping with a pillow on your face without suffocating you.</li>
            <li> The stitches holding it in place merely fell away.</li>
            <li> to bulky and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> And its uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Your neck is placed in awkward positions and you wake up your neck</li>
            <li> Terrible, too puffy, stiff</li>
            <li> Was very uncomfortable ,to bulky  did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> but if you sleep on your side it is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask for years, having switched to it after loosing a couple of the very expensive &amp;#34;hibermate&amp;#34; masks.  </li>
            <li> The mask has a couple of inches of velcro as the closure, a really bad design concept when strapping it to an unshaved head.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this product is that the sticky part of the Velcro strap faces your head and gets caught in your hair!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very bulky to sleep with head on the pillow sideways at first, but blocks light like no other sleep mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I use this thing every night! I repurchased when my last one was accidentally thrown away.</li>
            <li> Heat sensitive?  Coulda fooled me.</li>
            <li> The Memory foam is very bulky and does not flatten to form to your face. The Velcro closure on the back is great, but needs to be easier to rip open.</li>
            <li> While this product does perform well in darkening the room, I find it too bulky and hot. It may work better in the winter when extra warmth in wanted.</li>
            <li> Love mine. It&#x27;s extremely comfy. Just wish it was elastic attachment though. The velcro gets caught in my hair because it&#x27;s not quite long enough when wrapping around my head, so the velcro is exposed.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is hard to understand why some things even exist -- swamps, nerve gas, clowns, people who stand in doorways to have an intimate chat that can&#x27;t be interrupted...  Ditto for this product.  When I opened the box, my first reaction was \\&quot;Oh my, they&#x27;ve sent me a cat bed instead.\\&quot;  My second reaction was \\&quot;You&#x27;re kidding.\\&quot;  My third was to return it.  This item is so huge and weighty, the only use for it imaginable would be as eye protection during a boxing match. Or maybe you could wear one on each knee for a midnight hockey game on Lake Saskatchewan.  True, it does block out the light.  But so does sheet rock, and I&#x27;m not going to wear that on my head.  No offense to the manufacturer or anything, but I just can&#x27;t see why this product exists.  They really should explain themselves a little better.</li>
            <li> This monster of a sleep mask squeezed my nose shut, when I rolled to the side. It is way to thick and not too soft. The packaging also was weird. A brown box with no label, as if it was a return.  I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my first attempt at sleeping with a mask. This one is soft on your face but impossible to sleep in any position except on your back. I also had a problem with the strap around my head, but that&#x27;s something I could probably get accustomed to. I stopped using it after about 5 days but if I had to sleep during the day, I would keep trying to get used to it because it really does block the light.</li>
            <li> 1. The bulk of it is way too thick.  Trying to lay down with my head turned to the side was very uncomfortable since there was an inch of foam lifting my temple up off the pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. After a while, the insulating factor of that thick foam made me quite hot, so then I was sweating into the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The bits that fall beneath my eyes to keep the light out were too small and flimsy, meaning plenty of light snuck in from the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. And this is the BIG complaint: The Velcro elastic band around the back of my head was hook-side facing in, and it wasn&#x27;t just a little patch toward the end.  It was the entire length.  That meant that the Velcro hooks grabbed onto my hair each time I wore it, and they don&#x27;t want to let go.  So, removing it became a hair-pulling exercise EVERY TIME.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest, bulkiest sleep mask I have ever seen.  I couldn&#x27;t even sleep in it because it titled my head at an odd level and made my neck hurt.  It is so heavy that it bruised my eyes when I lay on my back trying to overcome a migraine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> The product is listed as black velvet.  It so not velvet.  It is cheap polyester fabric and sofa cushion bulky, darn it.  :(  People, don&#x27;t&#x27; stop here, keep shopping.  It was $10.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The back is adjustable via velcro, which is nice.  The best part is the shape of this mask.  It has a ridge on the bottom to meet your cheekbones which elevate the cushion off of the orbs of your eyes.  They are not hot, but they do pick up loads of lint.</li>
            <li> This eye mask is a very comfy memory foam mask that blocks out the light for a restful night&#x27;s sleep. It is a tad thicker than other similar masks. Great to use as travel mask for those long overnight and international flights.</li>
            <li> Me and the wire have different schedules. I go to bed early. The wife,however likes to rev down by reading in bed or using her laptop. The light was driving me nuts! So I tried a sleep mask. No too manly, but a dudes gotta sleep, right?  Every one I&#x27;ve tried has leaked light OR felt like my head was wrapped in a t-shirt (I said I&#x27;d tried em all!). Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hit amazon and found this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, it looks HUGE. It&#x27;s a thick black cloth wrapped slab of memory foam with a couple little pillowy things on the inside. I thought, ok.. This is gonna suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was totally wrong.  This is light, stays cool and, most excitingly, because most don&#x27;t, stays on without tight straps. and, As far as blocking light, this thing is suitable for falling asleep on the bright side of Mercury.  No light leaks from a ANY angle.  And I have a big noggin.  Works the same for my tiny headed (but hugely brained) wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and you can open your eyes wide and not hit the mask. Those little pillow things on the inside keep the mask away from your eyes. Blink away in the darkness. Go ahead. No claustrophobia at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah.  I like the thing. I sleep on both side and back and the mask stays on easily, and Inhave forgotten it was on. Very comfortable when sleeping on my side. It&#x27;s like a little face pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. You won&#x27;t do better.</li>
            <li> Blocks out 100% of the light, at least on me. I am a side sleeper and do have to make adjustments to deal with the mask digging into my face. I like the review that said to cut open the padding under the eyes and let that flap down -- I think that would make the mask less bulky. I would hope it wouldnt let in any light round the nose opening if I do.&lt;br /&gt;It does get hot after 8 hours of sack time.</li>
            <li> I really like the concept of this mask but it was waaaay too thick on the sides. I just cannot wear it. I&#x27;d say if you are strictly a back sleeper, then go for it, but if not, then avoid this one. Plus, if you live in a warm climate, your eyes will get super warm under there. It seems weird but I would have to air out my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like the mask, but it is a bit to bulky for it to stay in place as it should while one is sleeping.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll really use it very often.</li>
            <li> This is a very cushy, comforting mask that will definitely block out nearly all forms of light. It&#x27;s especially good if you&#x27;re a back-sleeper, or a frequent airplane/car traveler who sleeps in an upright seat. For those of us side-sleepers, there is a great deal of memory-foam padding on the sides that doesn&#x27;t actually permit your head to fully touch the pillow. I solved this by opening the seams and simply trimming out the extra foam at the sides. This was a HUGE improvement (but perhaps the manufacturer should consider offering two styles). The memory foam in front is very comfortable against your face and cheekbones; and the nose indentation is a thoughtful touch that makes it easier to breathe.</li>
            <li> While it is comfortable, the memory foam is to bulky to allow you to  sleep on your side  or face down. Recommended for travelers or other people who sleep a lot sitting up.</li>
            <li> Wow, this really works.  It is dark, fits snug (adjustable) and really does the job, even during the day time if you are sleeping during the day.  The thickness of the sleep mask takes a little getting used to because other brands are so flimsy in comparison.  But once you get used to the thickness, it is terrific.  I would definitely recommend.  Also, it holds up well in the wash/dryer.</li>
            <li> i have vampire hours due to my business and sleep odd hours. i use these out of necessity. this one though it is very comfortable its too thick to the point you cannot sleep on your side with it on. so if you sleep on your back no problem otherwise just be aware.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would be a good replacement for my trusted Sharper Image sleep mask ive had forever and accidentally left on a greyhound bus. The foam is much too firm when compared to the one from Sharper image and the straps are significantly shorter, which with my large noggin seems to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im really kicking myself for not having bought a few replacements as a backup when Sharper Image went under.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all it falls short of my expectations. But all is not lost since it forced me yo seek out other solutions which lead me to the wrap-a-nap.</li>
            <li> This is made from EXACTLY the same material as my old tempurpedic brand mask.  This is MUCH bigger and works just as well.</li>
            <li> Not bad but too thick , really only good to use in air travel for seated sleep , for regular in bed sleep  is way too thick and can ble uncomfortable at times.</li>
            <li> Blots out all light comfortably</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this product is that the sticky part of the Velcro strap faces your head and gets caught in your hair!</li>
            <li> A little thick &amp; heavy, but good mask</li>
            <li> Was very uncomfortable ,to bulky  did not meet my expectations. Too pricy for the quality. Seem like something you could find in a dollar store.</li>
            <li> I love this mask because it covers well and is ver comfortable. The two problems with it are that the sides (which are a great idea) are too thick, it takes getting used to when I turn from side to side and I am a side sleeper. Also I have a smaller head that the velcro closing seems to think shouldn&#x27;t exist therefore, I wish it had a slide buckle like the Lewis and Clark. Works wonderfully for blocking light all the way around through, even the bottom where it had extra pad to block light rom leaking in under the lower eye socket.</li>
            <li> The mask is relatively good, but the foam is so thick that it is somewhat uncomfortable to wear.  The thickness around the nose actually presses down -- interfering with breathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the good side, it does block ambient light very nicely.</li>
            <li> Ok, I will say that the cover is soft and the memory foam pliable, BUT...this thing is HUGE!  There is no way I could sleep in this, memory foam or not!  It reminds me of the large black glasses (TIMES 10)that patients wear after eye surgery. I purchased this with a discount, but I&#x27;m still out of $10.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sleep mask! I&#x27;ve bought a number of them over the years. They are the absolute best at blocking out the light and can be washed.</li>
            <li> It heat sensitive. The thing I did like is the comfort, when I&#x27;m sleep the form at each side is really uncomfortable. I wish there no forms on the sides (flat side may help) I feel like something is on my way, I&#x27;m a side sleeper so it did work for. It may work  for people that are supine ( back sleeper people).</li>
            <li> This is comfortable and soft. Mine did seem a little flimsy and the sowing isn&#x27;t all that great, but it really does the job so it was east to overlook.</li>
            <li> Works great for  my husband who works third shift! Wish the velcro strap was a little longer, but other than that seems to help him get better sleep!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask every night for the past year, and it has served me well. It is SO cozy and soft, and the memory foam really makes it a nice thing to sleep with on your face (sometimes having things on your face when you&#x27;re sleeping is really annoying). Some others complained about the thick velcro strap in back - if you push it up higher or lower on the back of your head that problem really is resolved. Also, I have a huge nose, and I have not had any problems with the nose part on the mask. If you just push it up or down on your face to fit in the right spot, it is quite cozy and blocks out ALL light. I am really impressed with this product and it has really helped me sleep through our bright summers. I highly recommend this product. Side note: it stretches out with time, but I have just kept tightening the back strap and cutting off the excess velcro. I have used it a lot this last year and it is finally just coming apart which I consider pretty good wear for having been worn every day and washed a lot.</li>
            <li> Nicely thick but does not match the quality of the original from Sharper Image. Worse fabric and shorter strap. Attracts lint and the strap scratches in the neck.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this sleep mask. It is a gift for my daughter who has extreme insomnia.</li>
            <li> The mask has a couple of inches of velcro as the closure, a really bad design concept when strapping it to an unshaved head.  I am going to have to cut off the straps &amp; replace them with elastic to keep from ripping the hair from my head.  sigh.</li>
            <li> I had one before and it was soft. This one looks like it but is nothing like it. I would not recommend it. The Velcro pulls out hair and it makes it hard o breath.</li>
            <li> I have eclectic sleeping habits and sometimes have a really hard to sleep. The slightest light or noise can keep me up until I get so tired that I just drop off. I started to get into the habit of using a sleep mask recently, but my previous one was a small simple fabric mask, and it was only somewhat effective. This item does a phenomenal job of keeping the light out, and most of the time is very comfortable. My only gripe is that the memory foam doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;remember&amp;#34; anything. It hasn&#x27;t really molded to me and I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for 3 months. Also sometimes it feels a bit abrasive, most times I don&#x27;t notice it but others such as my mom, who I bought it for as a Christmas present might find it to abrasive to use.I guess it depends on the sensitivity of the person, I usually notice the abrasiveness when i really can&#x27;t sleep and I tend to chalk it up as my body keying into anything that will keep me awake. That said, generally I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sleep masks tend to fall off of me, slide around, or let in the light around my nose (it isn&#x27;t a small nose!)&lt;br /&gt;This one, though, is perfect. It breathes, stays on, and keeps the light out. It is comfy too, and doesn&#x27;t press on my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product does block out the light but if you sleep on your side it is very uncomfortable. Your neck is placed in awkward positions and you wake up your neck has so many kinks you need muscle relaxers..</li>
            <li> Did not like! Too bulky &amp; stiff. Did not completely block the light.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very thick and the velcro strap becomes a nuisance when you are asleep and it just begins to feel heavy and burdensome. I get the same amount of sun block from cheap little covers and the elastic is not as heavy feeling as the velcro strap on this. Why pay so much. I won&#x27;t again.</li>
            <li> Went to Alaska to work this summer. What a comfortable sleep mask. It was definitely an essential necessity since its daylight for more than 20 hours</li>
            <li> Soft &amp; are comfortable! My only complaint is bc they are thicker than normal ones you have to sleep on your back when wearing but sometimes i can get away with sleeping on my side(i move around when i sleep) other than that I absolutely love these</li>
            <li> Best mask out there.  It doesn&#x27;t apply any pressure unevenly, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re wearing an elastic band on your head.  It also does a superb job of keeping out almost all light.  The added softness and full-coverage feel really make you feel encapsulated, which is soothing.  It&#x27;s like sleeping with a pillow on your face without suffocating you.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It makes working night shift and sleeping during the day extremely delightful.&lt;br /&gt;Very calming and tranquel</li>
            <li> every bit as comfortable as the masks costing much more. Only detractor was that small flaps which form a bumper under your eyes came loose almost immediately. The stitches holding it in place merely fell away. It is a quick fix but it doesn&#x27;t say much for the initial quality of the product.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, of course is a memory foam. However the adjustable Velcro strap length is short and it will pulling the hair when you unstrap the strap.</li>
            <li> Terrible, too puffy, stiff</li>
            <li> So comfortable, it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to sleep without it now. Fits snuggly, although it takes some adjustment, it doesnt let any light through and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> ...but without the quiilt cover and I had no idea where I would find a peice of memory foam. Prevention Magazine Literature recommends that it keeps your face from wrinkling and the only problem is to remember to use it!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this mask for just over a month (it was a Christmas gift). I found it to be bulky and hard to wear for sleeping. It constantly fell off during the night. Now, after just over a month of use, the elastic has snapped, the stitching holding on the Velcro is separating, and the foam is exposed. This is a poorly designed/assembled mask and I do not recommend purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask for years, having switched to it after loosing a couple of the very expensive &amp;#34;hibermate&amp;#34; masks.  This mask is bulky, but, despite the fact that I sleep on my stomach and side I&#x27;ve had no problems with the bulk. It really blocks the light well, much more than those silly little masks that are a piece of fabric and some string.  If you don&#x27;t mind the bulk this is a great mask, if the a bulky (but light) fabric on your face causes problems then this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair of these. My dog decided to use the first as a chew toy, so I needed a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this item has gone down since I first purchased them (a year ago or so), but not terribly. The foam isn&#x27;t as soft and the fabric isn&#x27;t as soft either. Other than that though, they are pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are fairly bulky and take some getting used to, but once I did I&#x27;ve never been able to sleep without them.</li>
            <li> Wish I had read all the negative comments before I purchased this sleep mask.  It is bulky and the sides are so hard and lumpy it hurt my head when I tried to lay on my side.  After one hour of wearing it I developed a headache. It also had a funny, perfumy scent.</li>
            <li> BEST EVAR. I ride the train a lot long distance, and fly, and these have saved me from countless shi77y conversations.</li>
            <li> This. Too big and bulky, and it leaves a big gap at the bottom, which lets light in!  Also, it is not comfortable. Spend a little extra and get one that does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and don&#x27;t double buy like I did.</li>
            <li> This eye mask may be memory foam, but it is bulky and kind of rigid, doesn&#x27;t conform too well to the face, although it does block the light and has the velcro wrap to adjust it with.</li>
            <li> to bulky and uncomfortable.  I would not buy it again.. If it was not such a hassle to return it, I would</li>
            <li> Its soo thick that you can still see light because its not flush to your face. And its uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering these - they looked bulky. But they are feather light, but thick and fluffy. Very soft, easily strap around my big head, and immediately block out ALL light. I am SO happy that I chose this!  I find that my sleep is much deeper and more fulfilling when I sleep with a light-blocking mask, and the one I&#x27;d gotten from the airlines was working OK, but it was time for an upgrade. This is a wonderful choice. HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> Super comfortable and blocks out all light, the velcro strap could be a little bit better, but its perfectly foamy</li>
