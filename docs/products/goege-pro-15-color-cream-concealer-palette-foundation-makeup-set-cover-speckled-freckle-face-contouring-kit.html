            <li>I just wish there was more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s okay for a play date / princess party, but not for a person expecting quality</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and natural looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the product itself was quite nice, no damage, new condition, lovely look and does not irritate the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of highlighters and I&#x27;m happy to say the highlighter in this makeup kit didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>other wise its a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a beautifully natural highlighter that adds a nice glow to my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, if you work fast, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Product also arrived quick and undamaged.</li>
            <li>All my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>First I just want to say this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a cream contouring kit</li>
            <li>First, it came damaged.</li>
            <li>that is has a large variety of cream concealer shades for blending all in one case.</li>
            <li>I personally do like powder contours better as I am new and it is easier for me to blend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very new to contour and highlighting.</li>
            <li>I think this is a decent starter kit for beginning makeup users.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>though I usually am not very comfortable with cream contours, this one was very easy to apply and use.</li>
            <li>After a few tutorials and this palette, I am confident in my skills.</li>
            <li>I am new to the contouring world and have used some cream contours and some powder contours.</li>
            <li>used a kabuki blush to blend everything all together and the creamy formula was easy to blend and work with to make my face that started as red, tired and round to a more awake, chiseled and strong</li>
            <li>broke my skin out and the only colors that really show on my skin are the darkest ones</li>
            <li>Product came completely melted.</li>
            <li>The quality and the texture of the product is very good, the only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it dry very fast, and is a little difficult to blend it.</li>
            <li>will make do since this is by far the nicest set i have had, and i will definitely be getting it again.</li>
            <li>There are many skin tone shades to make any shade of skin with several lights, mediums and darks as well as green for redness, pink to brighten and white to highlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This  pallet is very small for the price( could of  been a little cheaper), descent coverage, but not complete coverage.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very very small</li>
            <li> it was not melted since I ordered it in the middle of summer to Austin, Texas during the dreadful heat 100 degree weather week.</li>
            <li> The product is creamy, not greasy (which is bad for my oily skin).</li>
            <li> This Goege Pro 15 Color Cream makeup kit has everything you need for the base of your makeup!</li>
            <li> Awful like walmart Halloween makeup</li>

            <li> This Goege Pro 15 Color Cream makeup kit has everything you need for the base of your makeup! There are many skin tone shades to make any shade of skin with several lights, mediums and darks as well as green for redness, pink to brighten and white to highlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of carrying a makeup bag with a ton of different products, this one makeup set can be your all in one. I personally have red, tired eyes because of insomnia and eczema and the green took the redness away without using my normal concealer. After using the green to cancel out the redness, I then used the pink to brighten my eyes, making this a concealar palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I moved onto the skin tone colors and began contouring. First I just want to say this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a cream contouring kit and I love it. It is so much better than using powder. It&#x27;s easier to blend, easier to get exactly the amount you need and less messy. The colors are beautiful and natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of highlighters and I&#x27;m happy to say the highlighter in this makeup kit didn&#x27;t disappoint. It&#x27;s a beautifully natural highlighter that adds a nice glow to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a kabuki blush to blend everything all together and the creamy formula was easy to blend and work with to make my face that started as red, tired and round to a more awake, chiseled and strong featured more attractive face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> This product has been used by my teenage daughter. She is hesitant to use it daily because she feels like it is going to clog her pores and make her break out. So she has only used it occasionally. It has plenty of colors to get the coverage and concealing she desires. She learns tricks to using it by watching videos on Youtube as it didn&#x27;t have any explanation.  Sample received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I am new to the contouring world and have used some cream contours and some powder contours. I personally do like powder contours better as I am new and it is easier for me to blend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I usually am not very comfortable with cream contours, this one was very easy to apply and use. It blended well and I loved the range of color options it provided. Its comes in a nice palette which has shades for contouring and even for using as blush. Its a perfect kit for good contour and highlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this set came with a brush and a contour chart but other wise its a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars for now bc I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I tested some of the colors and they seem to have a great pigment. Product also arrived quick and undamaged. For this price the quality is great and I&#x27;m one very satisfied customer ! (Picture taken before testing colors)</li>
            <li> Wonderful I love it but it&#x27;s very very small</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Although I have not use it yet. Because i don&#x27;t know how to contour my face. The colors are very perfect. It was the same as the picture. Thank you George pro. If you are a lover of makeup please go for this.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great packaging, and the product is as seen in the picture... Thank you</li>
            <li> This was a well packed item - only just received so I will update as soon as I start to use this on a daily basis.  Product Review update:- I have been using this product for the last two weeks or so on a daily basis and I am very happy with it. The range of shades is great and I use them in different combinations depending on the look I am going for. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very new to contour and highlighting. After a few tutorials and this palette, I am confident in my skills. This palette takes the guess work out. The product is creamy, not greasy (which is bad for my oily skin). Definite repurchase!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I am a makeup artist and this is a great and inexpensive palette!</li>
            <li> I got to try the Pro 15 Color Cream Concealer Palette Foundation Makeup Set by Geoge.  I think this is a decent starter kit for beginning makeup users.  I like that is has a large variety of cream concealer shades for blending all in one case. I received this product in exchange for a review. All my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.</li>
            <li> I just wish there was more. This worked very nicely with contouring. It did not come with instructions, but I found great videos to help me along.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend liked it</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping and excellent product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Awful like walmart Halloween makeup</li>
            <li> broke my skin out and the only colors that really show on my skin are the darkest ones</li>
            <li> the product itself was quite nice, no damage, new condition, lovely look and does not irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that you have to use quite a bit in order to see a difference or use the darkest colors in the pallet.&lt;br /&gt;I will make do since this is by far the nicest set i have had, and i will definitely be getting it again.</li>
            <li> This  pallet is very small for the price( could of  been a little cheaper), descent coverage, but not complete coverage. Was delivered on time, thank goodness it was not melted since I ordered it in the middle of summer to Austin, Texas during the dreadful heat 100 degree weather week. I think the only reason mines was not melted because I had ordered it on Amazon prime 2 day shipping and I live at a apartment complex which the office received my package.  Don&#x27;t order during summer unless  you  live at a apartment complex or keep track of your package when being delivered! Oh when I ordered this pallet I ordered another pallet but a different  brand at a cheaper price, it was the same product! People compare prices, pictures, ingredients and reviews so you can get you money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> I like it... Especially for the price</li>
            <li> The quality and the texture of the product is very good, the only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it dry very fast, and is a little difficult to blend it. But, if you work fast, it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> for the price this is a great product just like any highend palette :)</li>
            <li> First, it came damaged. I contacted the vendor, and was not offered any ramification, or solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the palette is very tiny, and the picture is photographed to appear larger than life-size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the product is inferior. It&#x27;s the type of product you&#x27;d receive from a big box discount store at Christmas. Looks pretty, but is nothing more than a child play make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay for a play date / princess party, but not for a person expecting quality results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a savings price, or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. Yours may differ from mine.</li>
            <li> Product came completely melted. Shouldve been better packaged :( cant even use 2 colors at all!!!!</li>
