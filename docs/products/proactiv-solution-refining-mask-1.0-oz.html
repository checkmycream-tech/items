            <li>The best way to use it is to put it on before bed and sleep in it on any problem areas.</li>
            <li>Proactive is the best product I have tried for occassional blemishes,  </li>
            <li>Happy with the results from using this product.</li>
            <li>It really is a great \\&quot;on</li>
            <li>and I thought it was great for a while</li>
            <li>Its a great product to toss on for a couple hours, watch a movie, jump in the shower and wash it off.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>but AMAZON UR TRULY AMAZING KEEP</li>
            <li>Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good reason why this product sells, has celebrity endorsements, is costly, and is offered in so many Kiosks and infomercials.</li>
            <li>Great price and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li>Comes a gift or you have to request to come with a order wayyyy more money than wat is listed on...</li>
            <li>I think the two ounce was a better deal.</li>
            <li>I need to use something that is both effective but gentle.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product to help with the recent acne issues I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s right around the corner, but I still do get a blemish or two once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m already familiar with the product ,, because Iam a proactiv user...</li>
            <li>ok it&#x27;s not like the proactive when it first came out.</li>
            <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not crazy about it as a mask.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 years old and assumed that entering my 30&#x27;s would be more about age defying products.</li>
            <li>By morning, it&#x27;s 90% gone---but most of the time it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li>This one truly lives up to my skins expectations and my own personal expectations.</li>
            <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li>My favorite daily mask ever.</li>
            <li>but once I figured the magic of amazon instantly searched it on here...</li>
            <li>this was the first thing I ever purchased on here,, not knowing if I would get charged for nd then not show up in the mail</li>
            <li>I will be reordering very soon!</li>
            <li>This item was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I love this mask, its the only mask that I use.</li>
            <li>*: When I get a blemish, I literally dab on a bit of this cream right on top of the pimple, and allow it to dry.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff although I must admit I thought this one was going to be different than the larger size I ordered.</li>
            <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get rid of your acne fast, i don&#x27;t have that much</li>
            <li>The Refining Mask works really well as a twice weekly mask and spot treatment.</li>
            <li>Really help the blemishes.</li>
            <li>I ordered the WHOLE proactive system before</li>
            <li>this product works with or without the whole system, thats why I got it.</li>
            <li>and I have found that the refining mask is all you really need.  </li>
            <li>and it works better than any other spot treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It really did help clear up my face much faster.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face very soft after using it.</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with sensitive skin, i do not know what the cause of the burning sensation was, but I discontinued use!</li>
            <li>i use it every other week and it quickly firms your skin while drying up blemishes.  </li>
            <li>having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sooo surprised Cus</li>
            <li>but I have used it every night and did not see wow results....</li>
            <li>Not harsh on my skin</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>Obviously nothing will take it completely away</li>

            <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Do use all three components of the set if you can. Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li> this clay mask is wonderful.  i use it every other week and it quickly firms your skin while drying up blemishes.  this product also works well with or without the other proactiv products.</li>
            <li> I had to hurry and wash this off because my skin felt like it was on fire! I have never had a problem with sensitive skin, i do not know what the cause of the burning sensation was, but I discontinued use! I would definitely not recommend to anyone with skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works so well as a spot treatment. Thank you and I will be ordering again soon!</li>
            <li> My favorite daily mask ever.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m already familiar with the product ,, because Iam a proactiv user... I usually order it off tv but once I figured the magic of amazon instantly searched it on here... Soo amazed at the price nd the deals that here I was in heaven... I get sent a kit in mail from proactiv they self but the mask only. Comes a gift or you have to request to come with a order wayyyy more money than wat is listed on... I am sooo surprised Cus this was the first thing I ever purchased on here,, not knowing if I would get charged for nd then not show up in the mail but AMAZON UR TRULY AMAZING KEEP IT UP</li>
            <li> This works very well. The best way to use it is to put it on before bed and sleep in it on any problem areas.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get rid of your acne fast, i don&#x27;t have that much but I have used it every night and did not see wow results....</li>
            <li> I only use this as a spot treatment. (I&#x27;m not crazy about it as a mask.) Not harsh on my skin and it works better than any other spot treatment I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my skin at all real waste &amp; im super disappointed....</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive, combination skin. I have to be careful what products I use on my skin. With Proactiv, I can only use the Deep Cleansing wash. The basic was (white cleanser) causes my skin to dry out. The Deep Cleansing Wash (blue cleanser, meant for entire body also), includes added moisturizers that my skin tolerates. I need to use something that is both effective but gentle. I use this specific product to get rid of problem breakouts. I&#x27;m 32 years old and assumed that entering my 30&#x27;s would be more about age defying products. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s right around the corner, but I still do get a blemish or two once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**GREAT TIP**: When I get a blemish, I literally dab on a bit of this cream right on top of the pimple, and allow it to dry. I leave it on overnight. By morning, it&#x27;s 90% gone---but most of the time it&#x27;s completely gone. This is a terrific product. There&#x27;s a good reason why this product sells, has celebrity endorsements, is costly, and is offered in so many Kiosks and infomercials. This one truly lives up to my skins expectations and my own personal expectations. I will be reordering very soon!</li>
            <li> The Refining Mask works really well as a twice weekly mask and spot treatment. This item was exactly what I wanted. Great price and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff although I must admit I thought this one was going to be different than the larger size I ordered. It&#x27;s the same acne treatment as the two oz I brought. I think the two ounce was a better deal. It&#x27;s the same pore refining mask product. Happy with the results from using this product.</li>
            <li> Really help the blemishes.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It really is a great \\&quot;on the spot\\&quot; skin treatment for those blemishes that seem to creep up out of nowhere.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to help with the recent acne issues I&#x27;ve experienced. It really did help clear up my face much faster.</li>
            <li> I ordered the WHOLE proactive system before and I thought it was great for a while but you have to KEEP buying it which is just too much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product works with or without the whole system, thats why I got it. Its a great product to toss on for a couple hours, watch a movie, jump in the shower and wash it off. I usually use it 2 times a week and I usually pair with the St. Ives Apricot Scrub and sometimes a pore strip but sometimes just using it alone works just as well. I still struggle with acne at 21 because of some other medical problems but this definitely helps keep it at bay. Obviously nothing will take it completely away otherwise everyone would jump on that band wagon.</li>
            <li> This is such a rip off.  Only 1 oz for $7.99.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, its the only mask that I use. It leaves my face very soft after using it.</li>
            <li> ok it&#x27;s not like the proactive when it first came out. the one that came dry all the pimple in your face this one didn&#x27;t do that at all.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfy, the product comes on time, i like it, the seller means serious and i want to share to another about this.&lt;br /&gt;very good product.</li>
            <li> Proactive is the best product I have tried for occassional blemishes,  It works well and I have found that the refining mask is all you really need.  I just put some on the area, and by morning it is almost gone.</li>
