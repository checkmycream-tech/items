            <li>It seems to be working great.</li>
            <li>Plus it is a good investment because I save money from not having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li>a good 10x</li>
            <li>Instead it keeps trimming your good hair that don&#x27;t even need to be cut.</li>
            <li>When i bought this item i thought it would work great seeing that most of the reviews where 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I love the consept of the product and it is very effective</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>So far this is the best product I found that can trim my hair with out reducing the length.</li>
            <li>but my problem is the quality of the product it is very very very cheaply made.    </li>
            <li>i would recommend this product esp if you are trying to grow out your hair :)</li>
            <li>I felt confident in using it.  </li>
            <li>That is more than what others have done for me.  </li>
            <li>I WOULD HAVE LOVE TO TRY IT</li>
            <li>the product i believe worked it make my hair nice and smooth</li>
            <li>so the product was ok</li>
            <li>i believe i will have better customer service there than here</li>
            <li>but it did get most of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had healthy hair in varied lengths all my life and never had splits ends.</li>
            <li>Since they don&#x27;t allow for a place to put a review, I would like to share with the fortunate ones here.</li>
            <li>was very soft and shiny and I was very pleased</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a split-ender user since it first came out many years ago.</li>
            <li>The product came in a nice package and new, like it was advertised.</li>
            <li>For more ways to identify the real from counterfeit visit here [...]</li>
            <li>but when I informed saby that I never recv&#x27;d order they did give me a full refund.</li>
            <li>the product is not bad at all..</li>
            <li>I didnt give it a 5 because I think I would rather have the rechargable one but not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>I got the product really quick.</li>
            <li>I only used it once, so far so good.  :-)</li>
            <li>But i highly recommend u not to buy this !!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this authentic device directly from ([...] and after reading raving reviews on it.</li>
            <li>as long as your ends are cut straight you should be able to use this for months without going to a salon :)</li>
            <li>and the right side makes a buzzing sounds.</li>
            <li>always use small sections or it pulls on your hair but over all great product i think this should save be quite a bit of money a year.</li>
            <li>its worth spending time on something that is a one time thing and actually works versus spending 2 hours each time using the machine and it doing nothing but creating more split ends in the process.</li>
            <li>After reading the directions for the split End Hair Trimmer I made my first attempt to use it.</li>
            <li>The motor made a humming sound but the blade inside of the unit didn&#x27;t move, I figured that maybe the batteries I used were old or something.</li>
            <li>Once I received it I had to go out and buy batteries for it, then used it to the exact instructions</li>
            <li>and I was very scared at first.</li>
            <li>before it got most of my single strand knots...</li>
            <li>Saby sent me a new item right away will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>On the machines the left side works fine when running</li>
            <li>Although I was concerned about how much hair the trimmer would really take off in single glide, I used it anyway was really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>oh and fast shipping</li>
            <li>It trimmed about as much as it said it would.  </li>
            <li>Now I CAN CONTROL HOW MUCH HAIR IS BEING CUT, NOT</li>
            <li>This product has horizontal blades in which the real one has vertical blades.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>but im still thinking on if i should buy it here again or from the real site even though the real one is pricey</li>
            <li>This worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I have really straight hair and this machine didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>I bought because i really didn&#x27;t want to cut my hair.</li>
            <li>I manually cut all the split ends (PROPERLY) with the good old fashioned scissors, I don&#x27;t have to worry about them growing back.</li>
            <li>By trimming a tiny tip off, not cutting centimeters off the hair you&#x27;re trying to grow!</li>
            <li>So it can really take hours to complete your whole hair.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t worth the heat damage you get from flat ironing your hair straight.  </li>
            <li>So now my hair looks shorter and even more uneven.</li>
            <li>I had to flat iron my hair first because it requires your hair to be straight.  </li>
            <li>So today I brought brand new batteries</li>
            <li>Cordless Split End Hair Trimmer - New</li>
            <li>I bought this \\&quot;NEW IN BOX\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and I was able to slide the Split-Ender through my hair, in small sections, without a problem.  </li>
            <li>And after much researching and reading raving reviews, I was convinced to buy this to save myself the time of removing split ends and after initially trying it I decided to give it more time and each time has been a waste of 2+ hours with no results.</li>
            <li>but when I got it that was not the case - It was clearly returned by a dissatisfied customer because there were strands of hair in my product</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m a sucker for being like ok.</li>
            <li>It may work for you, if your hair is straight to begin with, but I have to flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li>, I have long straight hair</li>
            <li>It takes ages to trim because you can only add very little hair strand at a time (even if you have smooth straight non frizzy/curly hair it gets caught up and pulls on to your hair and has to be taken out and put back in over and over again until you finally reach the tips of your hair).</li>
            <li>Either invest in natural oils that restore your split ends or manually trim the split ends with scissors without trimming your entire hair.</li>
            <li>After a few passes on the right side of my head, the motor seized up.  </li>
            <li>I never recv&#x27;d the item to try it out and was really looking forward to it due to the fact</li>
            <li>It only cut super small pieces of hairs that were split.</li>
            <li>When you hold your freshly cut strand against the light you can see that it didn&#x27;t cut it properly at all, the split end was only pulled/ripped, there is still small uneven end that will grow back even though it may appear that this \\&quot;SPLIT ENDER\\&quot; actually cut the entire split end.</li>
            <li>i had to press hard down on the top of the machine just to get the blade to BARELY</li>
            <li>For a short period of time (a month or so) my hair started suffering from split ends because I didn&#x27;t have time to dry and comb out my washed hair and had to put them directly in a bun before going to work due to excessive tangles that resulted, the hair became prone to split ends during this short period and the Split Ender seemed like the only quick and promising solution.</li>

            <li> Short of going to a salon that specializes in long hair - they take thin strands of hair, twist them, and then snip of the split ends that are not in the twist - this product does basically the same thing in a fraction of the time and there are no expensive salon charges.</li>

            <li> the dry ends</li>
            <li> Back to no split ends NO THANKS to the (NOT SO) SPLIT ENDER!!!</li>
            <li> no hace lo que dice, y no se como harian para que segun en los videos de propaganda ellos saquen tal cantidad de cabello del contenedor,</li>
            <li> i have hair extenions and this is the only product i have found to tame the frizzies that plague</li>
            <li> I tried it on dry straight hair and it did not do the job I think something is wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> when i got to the second small section of hair it BROKE OFF.</li>
            <li> and they say its new , but its not .. the hair plate lever its broken .</li>
            <li> I took it apart, cleaned it and no success.  </li>
            <li> For some of the strands with split ends that it does seem to catch, it ends up cutting them incorrectly causing split ends to simply grow back again because it simply pulls the ends causing them to tear and break.</li>
            <li> contacted the seller, they said make sure you have batteries..as if im an idiot.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Talavera Split-ender, in hopes that it would cut down on the amount of haircuts I got a year.</li>
            <li> i find that odd About the seller i had to report the seller not like 4 times</li>
            <li> but i still have breakages and there was a little screw that came out</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> The Split-Ender only took off small, very small, slivers of hair that was split or sticking out.  </li>
            <li> I did have some trouble with the opperation of the product.</li>
            <li> this product to be honest.. IS HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few throughout the years but</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders as long as you do small sections of hair, (very small ones if you have very thick hair) and only use it once every 3 or 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after wanting to tame my split-ends.</li>
            <li> I would have been better off just cutting it myself!!</li>
            <li> I have repaired my long, broken, and damaged hair this way</li>
            <li> I have given up on this after trying it for the past 8 months and wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money and not to mention time on this.</li>
            <li> the box was beat up and when i tried putting in the batteries it was a little tricky and hard to get them in there.</li>
            <li> I used very little heat protectant.  </li>
            <li> you have to use small small pieces of hair</li>
            <li> After using this useless device one last time this week and wasting time I&#x27;ve decided to toss it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Its very messy (because the trimmed hair fall out of the compartment and onto you or nearby area.</li>
            <li> I do wonder, though, if the blades will become dull.</li>
            <li> but it hardly did anything.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the buy!!!</li>
            <li> The product sucks.</li>
            <li> Since I have THICK,</li>
            <li> (so this was annoying, since i have soo much hair)</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I would say using it once to twice a week depending on the amount of broken hair you have.</li>
            <li> Talavera sold me a broken product.</li>
            <li> It does work if you keep using it consistantly by cutting the broken hairs to keep them from splitting as they grow out.</li>
            <li> I have to manually cut them with scissors and that is what I have been doing now instead of using this useless device.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I ended up getting my hair cut.</li>
            <li> I am so mad.</li>
            <li> is very expensive</li>
            <li> CONCERN FOR SELLING A BAD PRODUCT AND REFUCE</li>

    <ol>
            <li> it does what it says it will do. always use small sections or it pulls on your hair but over all great product i think this should save be quite a bit of money a year. as long as your ends are cut straight you should be able to use this for months without going to a salon :) oh and fast shipping i got it in 4 days (over weekend) and the order guesstimated 7-14 days. i would recommend this product esp if you are trying to grow out your hair :)</li>
            <li> So far this is the best product I found that can trim my hair with out reducing the length. Plus it is a good investment because I save money from not having to go to the salon. I only used it once, so far so good.  :-)</li>
            <li> Although I was concerned about how much hair the trimmer would really take off in single glide, I used it anyway was really pleased with the results.  It trimmed about as much as it said it would.  I do wonder, though, if the blades will become dull.</li>
            <li> The Seller Saby sold me this product.  The product came in a nice package and new, like it was advertised. The product worked great.  I am African-American and I was able to slide the Split-Ender through my hair, in small sections, without a problem.  The Split-Ender only took off small, very small, slivers of hair that was split or sticking out.  I felt confident in using it.  This is what I wanted and needed.  Now I CAN CONTROL HOW MUCH HAIR IS BEING CUT, NOT THE STYLIST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What made this really a treat was that the seller, Saby, offered to give me money back because she was late in sending the product out.  That is more than what others have done for me.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I did have some trouble with the opperation of the product. The item in the orginal shipment was damaged. Saby sent me a new item right away will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after wanting to tame my split-ends. Since I have THICK, Curly/Wavy hair and I straighten it alot, I always have splitends!  I bought this product and used it, it is noisy- you have to use small small pieces of hair (so this was annoying, since i have soo much hair) When I called to get my 30-day money back guarantee, no one answered. I left a message, and had to keep calling. Once i reached someone which sounded like the man himself, he told me to try it again after straightening my hair. Maybe I&#x27;m a sucker for being like ok. Did not make a difference. I called back over and over, and obviously my 30 days were up. So i just threw the damn thing away!</li>
            <li> When i bought this item i thought it would work great seeing that most of the reviews where 5 stars. When the packaged arrived, it was just rapped in fed-ex paper... the box was beat up and when i tried putting in the batteries it was a little tricky and hard to get them in there. when i was trying to get it to work, i turned it to the on button.. and nothing worked. this product to be honest.. IS HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a split-ender user since it first came out many years ago. I&#x27;ve gone through quite a few throughout the years but only because my friends \\&quot;BORROW\\&quot; my split-enders but never give them back! If you&#x27;re trying to grow long hair, THIS is the way to do it. By trimming a tiny tip off, not cutting centimeters off the hair you&#x27;re trying to grow! This product works wonders as long as you do small sections of hair, (very small ones if you have very thick hair) and only use it once every 3 or 4 weeks. I love it!</li>
            <li> [...] said that the product pictured in this review is counterfeit. This product has horizontal blades in which the real one has vertical blades. For more ways to identify the real from counterfeit visit here [...]</li>
            <li> It does work if you keep using it consistantly by cutting the broken hairs to keep them from splitting as they grow out. I would say using it once to twice a week depending on the amount of broken hair you have. I have repaired my long, broken, and damaged hair this way but it may take months using this product before you notice a big difference in the condition of your hair.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before i bought the splitend ender. Blogs, reviews and youtube videos. It didn&#x27;t so anything for my hair.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I never recv&#x27;d the item to try it out and was really looking forward to it due to the fact I have a lot of hair and going to the salon is very expensive but when I informed saby that I never recv&#x27;d order they did give me a full refund.I WOULD HAVE LOVE TO TRY IT</li>
            <li> I got the product really quick. I don&#x27;t think this is for African-American Women. I had to flat iron my hair first because it requires your hair to be straight.  It also stated that I couldn&#x27;t have product on my hair, which I guess a heat protectant may count as a product.  I used very little heat protectant.  After a few passes on the right side of my head, the motor seized up.  I took it apart, cleaned it and no success.  I will continue to \\&quot;dust\\&quot; my ends myself.  This product isn&#x27;t worth the heat damage you get from flat ironing your hair straight.  It may work for you, if your hair is straight to begin with, but I have to flat iron my hair.  Hope this helps and you don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I but this product and it did not work for me at all. On the machines the left side works fine when running and the right side makes a buzzing sounds. I tried it on dry straight hair and it did not do the job I think something is wrong with the product. It did not trim anything at all.</li>
            <li> recieved the split ender and it didnt work. contacted the seller, they said make sure you have batteries..as if im an idiot. i had to press hard down on the top of the machine just to get the blade to BARELY rotate.the handle would creek, when i got to the second small section of hair it BROKE OFF. i contacted the seller numerous times, to no avail. shotty product and SLUM USERY MOTIVATATED SELLERS.NO CONCERN FOR SELLING A BAD PRODUCT AND REFUCE TO RESPOND WHEN YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK!</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Talavera Split-Ender and I like it, I have long straight hair&lt;br /&gt;and it does what it says it does. If you have wavy or curly hair then this product is NOT for you.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Talavera Split-ender, in hopes that it would cut down on the amount of haircuts I got a year. When I received it, it seemed that the product didn&#x27;t work. When I removed the \\&quot;hair catcher\\&quot; a tiny gear fell out. Talavera sold me a broken product. Upon attempting to contact the seller for a return or refund, there was no response. Please use caution when buying from this vendor.</li>
            <li> El producto no hace lo que dice, y no se como harian para que segun en los videos de propaganda ellos saquen tal cantidad de cabello del contenedor, aparte de que cuesta trabajo estar cambiando y cambiando la direccion de las navajas no tinen filo y solo maltratan mas el cabello. Yo no lo recomiendo y la entrega tardo mas de lo esperado, el empaque es de los mas corriente y el material del producto tambien. Disculpen por tan mala opinion pero es la verdad y no me gusta que enganen a las mujeres que como yo solo buscan hacer del cuidado de la belleza lo mas facil posible.</li>
            <li> I just got this product and it wont even start.. and they say its new , but its not .. the hair plate lever its broken . Hopefully i can get my money back. But i highly recommend u not to buy this !!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It really works. It only cut super small pieces of hairs that were split. My friend and I did each other&#x27;s hair to ensure we did it properly and not have to worry about the direction the blade is turned. I look forward to continued use of it!</li>
            <li> the product is not bad at all.. it beats going to the haridresser and having my hair chopped off when I only want my split ends cut. What I can say is read the directions. I have really thick hair and I was very scared at first. It seems to be working great. I didnt give it a 5 because I think I would rather have the rechargable one but not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> After reading the directions for the split End Hair Trimmer I made my first attempt to use it. The motor made a humming sound but the blade inside of the unit didn&#x27;t move, I figured that maybe the batteries I used were old or something. So today I brought brand new batteries and I have the same problem the motor hums but the blade doesn&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> the product i believe worked it make my hair nice and smooth but i still have breakages and there was a little screw that came out so the product was ok i guess the box was all beat up and it could have been used the box wasn&#x27;t wrapped in plastic i find that odd About the seller i had to report the seller not like 4 times so she can reply to me about the product 4 times!!!!! you need to keep in contact with your customers or they wont buy from you ever again im thinking about buying another when ever this one stops working but im still thinking on if i should buy it here again or from the real site even though the real one is pricey i believe i will have better customer service there than here any day i will shop here if you step up your cookies</li>
            <li> This worked better than I expected. Being african-american, I had to straighten my hair before using it, and i had to go over the section a good 10x before it got most of my single strand knots...but it did get most of them. It made an overall improvement, but don&#x27;t expect any miracles.</li>
            <li> I want split ender machine, when you republic??</li>
            <li> This thing never lasts long.  This was the third one I ordered for the amount they charge you wouldn&#x27;t thing it was disposable.</li>
            <li> If only there was an option to give it 0 or -1 star! I purchased this authentic device directly from ([...] and after reading raving reviews on it. Since they don&#x27;t allow for a place to put a review, I would like to share with the fortunate ones here. It \\&quot;may\\&quot; work on extremely short super thin hair but this is definitely not made for all other hair types. Its very messy (because the trimmed hair fall out of the compartment and onto you or nearby area. It takes ages to trim because you can only add very little hair strand at a time (even if you have smooth straight non frizzy/curly hair it gets caught up and pulls on to your hair and has to be taken out and put back in over and over again until you finally reach the tips of your hair). So it can really take hours to complete your whole hair. Even after following their instructions of going over each strand up to 3 times, it doesn&#x27;t capture the split ends to cut. Instead it keeps trimming your good hair that don&#x27;t even need to be cut. When I do try to feed hair strands with split ends manually, it doesn&#x27;t trim them. I have to manually cut them with scissors and that is what I have been doing now instead of using this useless device. For some of the strands with split ends that it does seem to catch, it ends up cutting them incorrectly causing split ends to simply grow back again because it simply pulls the ends causing them to tear and break. When you hold your freshly cut strand against the light you can see that it didn&#x27;t cut it properly at all, the split end was only pulled/ripped, there is still small uneven end that will grow back even though it may appear that this \\&quot;SPLIT ENDER\\&quot; actually cut the entire split end. I have given up on this after trying it for the past 8 months and wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money and not to mention time on this. I&#x27;ve had healthy hair in varied lengths all my life and never had splits ends. For a short period of time (a month or so) my hair started suffering from split ends because I didn&#x27;t have time to dry and comb out my washed hair and had to put them directly in a bun before going to work due to excessive tangles that resulted, the hair became prone to split ends during this short period and the Split Ender seemed like the only quick and promising solution. And after much researching and reading raving reviews, I was convinced to buy this to save myself the time of removing split ends and after initially trying it I decided to give it more time and each time has been a waste of 2+ hours with no results. Save yourself the hassle if it hasn&#x27;t work it won&#x27;t work 8 months later! Either invest in natural oils that restore your split ends or manually trim the split ends with scissors without trimming your entire hair. After using this useless device one last time this week and wasting time I&#x27;ve decided to toss it in the garbage. I manually cut all the split ends (PROPERLY) with the good old fashioned scissors, I don&#x27;t have to worry about them growing back. Yes, it took another 2 hours to do this but its worth spending time on something that is a one time thing and actually works versus spending 2 hours each time using the machine and it doing nothing but creating more split ends in the process. Back to no split ends NO THANKS to the (NOT SO) SPLIT ENDER!!!</li>
            <li> i have hair extenions and this is the only product i have found to tame the frizzies that plague the dry ends</li>
            <li> I have really straight hair and this machine didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  My hair would just slide by without getting any trim what so every.</li>
            <li> Short of going to a salon that specializes in long hair - they take thin strands of hair, twist them, and then snip of the split ends that are not in the twist - this product does basically the same thing in a fraction of the time and there are no expensive salon charges. I love this!</li>
            <li> The product sucks. I did not like it, I don&#x27;t even think it does anything. And the it broke. No complains about the shipping or anything. I did not send the product back because used it a lot before it broke but i don not think it works.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the buy!!! I bought because i really didn&#x27;t want to cut my hair. Once I received it I had to go out and buy batteries for it, then used it to the exact instructions but it hardly did anything. Needless to say I ended up getting my hair cut.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001KNST04 Talavera Split-Ender Cordless Split End Hair Trimmer - New In Box]]    I bought this \\&quot;NEW IN BOX\\&quot; but when I got it that was not the case - It was clearly returned by a dissatisfied customer because there were strands of hair in my product (eeewwww but no biggie)    I love the consept of the product and it is very effective and it did what it said it would do my hair was very soft and shiny and I was very pleased but my problem is the quality of the product it is very very very cheaply made.    I was just using it and it started to hum but the blade is not moving so I thought that my hair was caught in it so I washed it out and tried it again same thing the motor is humming but the blade is not moving this is only my second time using it I am so mad.</li>
            <li> When I received this in the mail it looked used, the box was worn and not well sealed at all. I straightened my hair and parted it into teeny tiny parts to use this. It does what it says it does...I guess...But it snags and yanks your hair out just as well as it snips away split ends. Not worth it! So now my hair looks shorter and even more uneven. I would have been better off just cutting it myself!!</li>
            <li> Broke as soon as I used it. I was refunded</li>
            <li> This product did not do the job</li>
