            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Essie Go Overboard 782 Nail Polish, is a beautiful nail color and looks great.</li>
            <li>Price is cheap from most of the supermarket cosmetics section like Target.</li>
            <li>but its a nice color I really like it. :)</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I wanted this precise color.</li>
            <li>, I thought it was going to be bright and pretty as shown on the website but its much MUCH darker in person...</li>
            <li>I originally ordered to use it as a summer color, but will save for fall/winter time, as it is a darker shade.</li>
            <li>, I was really excited about this color..</li>
            <li>I purchased Essie Go Overboard for my best friend who LOVES teal.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it dries super quickly!  </li>
            <li>Go Overboard: this is a great color!</li>
            <li>Essie is by far my favorite polish, this is a stunning color.</li>
            <li>This is only my second Essie nail polish, but I really like the quality and they have a lot of great colors I would like to own, so I intend to buy more.</li>
            <li>i was hoping it would be true to the color of the photo, but it is a darker hue.</li>
            <li>Also very well wrapped in bubble wrap for protection and fits in your mailbox :)</li>
            <li>It arrived at my house quickly.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, deep color, great formula, long lasting.</li>
            <li>This color is so fun and is so pretty!</li>
            <li>i am a HUGE essie fan, but this polish is much darker than it appears in the photo.</li>
            <li>The color looks beautiful in the bottle, but it seemed much darker once applied - so dark</li>
            <li>Its a nice blue, but not this oceany color the picture shows.</li>
            <li>The nailpolish doesn&#x27;t chip off right awa.</li>
            <li>I bought it as the contrast color to the Mint Candy Apple and they go really well together if you want to do the one contrast nail thing that&#x27;s really in right now!</li>
            <li>I love Essie products in general.  </li>
            <li>quality is great - only one coat necessary.</li>
            <li>It came to my house VERY FAST.</li>
            <li>This was a little darker than the color I really wanted, but Essie is nice!</li>
            <li>This color has shimmer/glitter in it, it goes on streaky, it chipped so much!</li>
            <li>and I love blue...</li>
            <li>It went on opaque in only one coat and is shiny without a top coat.  </li>
            <li>its really pretty.</li>
            <li>one thing I have to say is that when I first saw this I thought it came with all those colors that&#x27;s why I got it.</li>
            <li>It is pretty just not what i was expecting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time Essie buyer...</li>
            <li>the color appeared much darker on my nails than on the website and bottle!</li>
            <li>Even though Essie colours have never disappointed me, I should say that this colour is a little bit more darker than the picture and in person.</li>
            <li>i love nail polish nad essie has slowly but surely becoming one of my favorites...</li>
            <li>This color is MUCH darker than the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fall/winter color.</li>
            <li>i really like this color.</li>
            <li>I really like the color.</li>
            <li>The picture on the page from where I ordered it showed a much lighter shade than what I received.</li>
            <li>I loved the product and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>Since I never wear blue, it would not be a favorite of mine, but it was extremely well received by the young lady who wanted it, and a request for more colors also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting my old color off right now</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not thick at all, the way some very opaque polishes are.  </li>
            <li>more dark green.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even most of my black polishes can&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li>Less of a teal and more of a... greenish navy?</li>
            <li>I threw a top coat on it, and it&#x27;s lasted a couple of days without starting to look gross or chippy or anything.</li>
            <li>I just hope it would look a little more bluish...</li>
            <li>but it is darker and more green than in the picture.</li>
            <li>WOW this is an opaque polish!</li>
            <li>I love Essie, and as usual, this delivered.</li>
            <li>Looks black in even remotely dim light.</li>
            <li>color is a little darker on my nails than the picture looks on my monitor, and a bit more blue.  </li>
            <li>This is a total rip off, it&#x27;s nothing like the real essie.</li>
            <li>overall I really like it.</li>
            <li>good quality just skeptical about ordering it off line....</li>
            <li>It only took one coat to completely cover my nail.  </li>
            <li>and it dried a lot darker than it looked in the bottle (which I know is typical, but seems more so with this color).  </li>
            <li>I went to target to shop the other day &amp; went to the nail polish section &amp; saw the real \\&quot;go overboard\\</li>
            <li>all being dark black or brown, and this color looks fantastic with my skin.  </li>

            <li> I was kind of sick of fall colors</li>
            <li> They have helped to repair my dry, brittle nails.</li>
            <li> Essie&#x27;s fall within a close range of what the bottle says but this one seemed a little different...</li>
            <li> big let down!</li>
            <li> What I received is a very dark, almost navy tealish blue color.</li>
            <li> The color I received is a very dark blue-</li>
            <li> This color is a little darker than i expected but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My bestie has very pale white skin</li>
            <li> one thing is its a little clumpy but not much.</li>
            <li> It has a sparkle in it that keeps it from being too dark.</li>
            <li> Its dark but not too dark that it looks black like a lot of colors.</li>
            <li> it was difficult to find (and way more expensive than others)...</li>
            <li> It is a little darker than what it appears in the photo</li>
            <li> One coat came out a very dark green.</li>
            <li> The Go Overboard polish is A LOT darker than the one shown here resulting in a dark blue/green color depending on the lighting..</li>
            <li> it looked like a midnight green.  </li>
            <li> I use it year round</li>
            <li> I was a little dissapointed usually</li>
            <li> &quot; but people seemed to think this was a green polish!</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like how the brush is small.</li>
            <li> so other people wont get confused like me.</li>
            <li> I could have just bought the real thing if I knew this :(</li>
            <li> but I do get confused</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to polish - I&#x27;ve got to stop, but I saw this product at Target advertised on the wall</li>
            <li> And just one layer leaves streaks (the nail polish is quite thin), so keep that in mind before buying.</li>
            <li> I get compliments every time I wear it!&lt;br /&gt;it was difficult to find this color in some of the salons for a while, so I just brought this one with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color was disappointing.</li>
            <li> &quot; I wanted to get it so bad..but $8 for a nail polish is expensive!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with my polish.</li>
            <li> :-(  :-(</li>
            <li> I use it as a base and accent-</li>

            <li> The color is nice, it just seems to look darker in person compared to the color it looks like online. I originally ordered to use it as a summer color, but will save for fall/winter time, as it is a darker shade.</li>

I could have just bought the real thing if I knew this :(, I was really excited about this color..big let down! I went to target to shop the other day &amp; went to the nail polish section &amp; saw the real \\&quot;go overboard\\&quot; I wanted to get it so bad..but $8 for a nail polish is expensive!</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled when I ordered this polish... it was difficult to find (and way more expensive than others)... After picking it up in the mail I saw a bottle at Walmart and decided to buy it since I&#x27;ve seen pictures on the web and I love blue... I was a little dissapointed usually Essie&#x27;s fall within a close range of what the bottle says but this one seemed a little different... It might have been the fact that I used it with \\&quot;Bobbing for baubles\\&quot; but people seemed to think this was a green polish! I just hope it would look a little more bluish...</li>
            <li> I love this color for fall.  It is a little darker than what it appears in the photo and it dried a lot darker than it looked in the bottle (which I know is typical, but seems more so with this color).  It went on opaque in only one coat and is shiny without a top coat.  This is only my second Essie nail polish, but I really like the quality and they have a lot of great colors I would like to own, so I intend to buy more.</li>
            <li> Essie are great nail polishes. Love the color</li>
            <li> Very happy with this color. It has a sparkle in it that keeps it from being too dark. Very nice.</li>
            <li> This was a little darker than the color I really wanted, but Essie is nice! I just don&#x27;t like how the brush is small. But that&#x27;s not really a big problem. I like it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love Essie nail polish! This color is a little darker than i expected but lasts a long time. One coat should master the color shown in the description. Will be shopping for more soon!</li>
            <li> i really like this color. its really pretty. one thing is its a little clumpy but not much. overall I really like it. one thing I have to say is that when I first saw this I thought it came with all those colors that&#x27;s why I got it. but that was my mistake. I would suggest to the seller to make take or get a photo of the color so other people wont get confused like me. but I do get confused easy lol. but its a nice color I really like it. :)</li>
            <li> I really rate this nail polish is the best color fo the fall. Essie has the best nail polish for fall 2012. I reccomend people should try this color. It looks very good on my nails.</li>
            <li> I loved the product and it arrived earlier than expected. The Essie go over board nail polish is a great product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat Essie quality and this is a great color.  Also got the top coat and base coat and really like them also.</li>
            <li> I love essie polish! This color is so fun and is so pretty! I use it as a base and accent- everyone needs it!</li>
            <li> The Go Overboard polish is A LOT darker than the one shown here resulting in a dark blue/green color depending on the lighting..</li>
            <li> i am a HUGE essie fan, but this polish is much darker than it appears in the photo. i was hoping it would be true to the color of the photo, but it is a darker hue.</li>
            <li> I purchased Essie Go Overboard for my best friend who LOVES teal.  She put this color on her fingers and it looked amazing.  My bestie has very pale white skin and I thought the color was perfect for her skin tone.  This with red lipstick and she was all set for work or a night out :)</li>
            <li> Even though Essie colours have never disappointed me, I should say that this colour is a little bit more darker than the picture and in person.</li>
            <li> The color looks beautiful in the bottle, but it seemed much darker once applied - so dark it looked like a midnight green.  Not what I was hoping.</li>
            <li> WOW this is an opaque polish! It only took one coat to completely cover my nail.  Even most of my black polishes can&#x27;t do that.  And it&#x27;s not thick at all, the way some very opaque polishes are.  Goes on smooth and perfect in one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a little darker on my nails than the picture looks on my monitor, and a bit more blue.  Less of a teal and more of a... greenish navy? If that helps.</li>
            <li> Good product. Price is cheap from most of the supermarket cosmetics section like Target.</li>
            <li> This color is absolutely adorable and I get so many compliments on it. I use it year round but its awesome in the fall!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to polish - I&#x27;ve got to stop, but I saw this product at Target advertised on the wall and I totally had to get it.  It&#x27;s gorgeous - I was kind of sick of fall colors all being dark black or brown, and this color looks fantastic with my skin.  In addition, it dries super quickly!  I threw a top coat on it, and it&#x27;s lasted a couple of days without starting to look gross or chippy or anything.</li>
            <li> I get compliments every time I wear it!&lt;br /&gt;it was difficult to find this color in some of the salons for a while, so I just brought this one with me.&lt;br /&gt;even one of the technicians asked me which color it was because she wanted to order one for her shop!</li>
            <li> I always like essie nail polishes. I do like this color. However, it is not the color that is shown here. What I received is a very dark, almost navy tealish blue color. It is pretty just not what i was expecting. It arrived at my house quickly. Packaged appropriately.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and I LOVE THIS COLOR! Also very well wrapped in bubble wrap for protection and fits in your mailbox :)</li>
            <li> Rated 4 stars because I love essie and I love this polish however the color is deceiving or it would&#x27;ve been a 5! If you are looking for a lighter summer color do not order this!</li>
            <li> One coat came out a very dark green. Looks black in even remotely dim light. It&#x27;s beautiful, but absolutely nothing close to what it looks like in the pic or through the glass of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like the color. Its dark but not too dark that it looks black like a lot of colors. It came to my house VERY FAST.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with my polish. The picture on the page from where I ordered it showed a much lighter shade than what I received. The color I received is a very dark blue- again-- not what was displayed when I ordered.  :-(  :-(</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I wanted this precise color. I love the color. Essie is always great. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time Essie buyer...I heard a lot of great reviews so I ordered a color that I liked , I thought it was going to be bright and pretty as shown on the website but its much MUCH darker in person...good quality just skeptical about ordering it off line....</li>
            <li> Great Essie polish and colors</li>
            <li> the color appeared much darker on my nails than on the website and bottle! still an essie buyer.its great quality</li>
            <li> Essie Go Overboard 782 Nail Polish, is a beautiful nail color and looks great. The nailpolish doesn&#x27;t chip off right awa.</li>
            <li> Go Overboard: this is a great color! I absolutely love it. It is,however, darker than it appears to be, especially after 2 layers. And just one layer leaves streaks (the nail polish is quite thin), so keep that in mind before buying. Still, loving the color. I bought it as the contrast color to the Mint Candy Apple and they go really well together if you want to do the one contrast nail thing that&#x27;s really in right now!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know where they got this picture, but this is not the color. Not even close! Its a nice blue, but not this oceany color the picture shows. Don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> Essie is by far my favorite polish, this is a stunning color. I&#x27;m getting my old color off right now so I can start getting compliments!</li>
            <li> Since I never wear blue, it would not be a favorite of mine, but it was extremely well received by the young lady who wanted it, and a request for more colors also</li>
            <li> Perfect, beachy summer color, and the color payoff in a single coat is amazing! I plan to wear it all summer!</li>
            <li> I love Essie, and as usual, this delivered. Beautiful, deep color, great formula, long lasting. Got a ton of compliments on this and two friends asked to borrow it. Versatile, will work with any season.</li>
