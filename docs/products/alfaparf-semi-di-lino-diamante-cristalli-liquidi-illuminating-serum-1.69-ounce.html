            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase at my salon and they stopped carrying it.  I have been using for years and love the shine I get from it and the smell is so wonderful!  A lot of glossers weigh my already heavy hair down.  This is so light you don&#x27;t even realize you have it on your hair. Does not leave it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Semi di lino r the best oil drops for hair. Has been using cristale liquidi it for years ! In Europe is avaliable in any store in Usa not , unfortunately ! Great price for great purchase.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works fantastically..does not weigh down your hair, but adds gorgeous shine. (I was given a sample of the Diamante Cristalli shampoo, conditioner and masque. After those incredible results..I knew I wanted this too, INEXPENSIVE!!! What a gorgeous smell and result.  Jo Ann</li>
            <li> This makes my hair soft and silky.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I like it and the product arrived in my home at time</li>
            <li> Really great serum for my hair. Smells great</li>
            <li> Have Cristalli liquidi illuminating serum and find that it gives my hair shine and &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A hair stylist introduced me to this product 8 years ago. At that time, I had very dry hair.  With continued use, the dryness diminished and I could actually style my hair again. I apply the recommended amount to towel dried hair.  After I blow dry and style it, I add just a dab more to make my hair gleam.  It has a very light fragrance and the 1.69 oz size lasts for months.  In addition, my hair has blonde highlights and this really makes them pop.</li>
            <li> Adds the perfect amount of volume and texture to my hair, with a little added shimmer. 2-4 pumps are all that is needed for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  A friend introduced me to this product and my hair has never been better.  It definitely keeps the frizz out, and leaves the hair beautifully soft.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my hair stylist.  He used it to add shine and fragrance to my styled hair.  After this stylist was no longer available, I could not find the product in my area so I ordered it.  I like the sheen and fresh but not overpowering scent.  I would recommend this product to anyone who likes a natural shine and sheen on their hair.  This product can also be used to detangle freshly shampooed hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this on my hair and I loved it but it was very expensive at the salon! I found it on Amazon for about 1/2 the price and it makes my hair super soft and shiny! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> smells great,i saw some reviews about the strong smell but when you applied to your hair it goes away,my hair is shiny and no more frizz</li>
            <li> Great product! This is not just a basic shine product for you hair. It makes your hair feel soft and look healthy. My hair is bleached and damaged. And when I use this product my hair becomes smooths to looks perfect.</li>
