            <li>I very recommended my skin feel smooth  thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older, like ya do, and it seems with every year, I see more and more wrinkles and dark spots in addition to the already existing acne scars.</li>

            <li> I have been using this cream for 3 months and I can say is a good cream, because it faded my brown spots from the sun damage accumulated after years of sun exposure. I used many creams from famous skincare companies, but no cream was as good as this. It does not dry the skin and it makes the skin very bright.</li>
            <li> After just two days of use, several of my dark spots were almost completely gone.  I was reticent to use such a product as I have extremely sensitive skin.  However, I&#x27;m happy to report that I&#x27;ve had no sensitivity issues.  It is a product that simply does what it says it is going to do immediately and effectively.  I&#x27;ve found a winner!</li>
            <li> Smells good but does nothing else.</li>
            <li> Did not help at all. Still searching for product to clear brown spots.</li>
            <li> My dark spots have significantly lightened up with use of this product! I&#x27;m planning to try more of the skin products from this brand. Very impressed! Shipping was good, no problems. This container lasted about 4/5 months for me. Not much is needed to cover concern areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older, like ya do, and it seems with every year, I see more and more wrinkles and dark spots in addition to the already existing acne scars. I am not too proud to admit to being vain and being vain, I like to look for products to aid in my quest to retain a youthful appearance. Although I&#x27;ve been inclined to believe that the anti-aging creams were scams, I am happy to say that my tune has changed. I am very happy with this product. The container is attractive with clear and informative labeling. The cream itself is not oily in the slightest. It&#x27;s smooth and my family tells me it smells very nice (as I have no sense of smell). More impressively, I began to see results right away. My complexion looks so much smoother and more even. Unlike other products also, it does not feel harsh on the skin. It&#x27;s pleasant and moisturizing. I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for a genuine critique.</li>
            <li> I was hopefully whit this cream l used mamy cream for my spot l think this cream was the last l used , but not .</li>
            <li> It is ok for a moisturizer but does absolutely nothing to lighten age spots which is why I purchased this product. I consider it a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks for ereasing my long time sun damage spots.  I can see the spots getting lighter.  I will continue to use it and will update the data after 3 bottles of this product if the spots are gone.  I have already recommended to my friends.</li>
            <li> I used an entire jar of this expensive cream and saw no difference in the dark spots on my skin. I understand that I might need to use more than one jar to see results, but I didn&#x27;t like the flakiness. I have tried many lightening lotions and the one I like, so far, is Robanda Anti-agng hand treatment.  It is not too expensive, it goes on smoothly, absorbs completely, doesn&#x27;t flake, has sunscreen (SPF 15), and smells nice.  I use it not only on my hands but on my arms and shoulders.  It does lighten dark spots but doesn&#x27;t eliminate them completely. Also it works slowly - I had to use it daily for over a year to see any results at all.  If you find a lotion or cream that&#x27;s better, please let me know. I&#x27;d appreciate it.  I won&#x27;t be buying any additional Gerovital.</li>
            <li> It was an amazing product i use it forever. i have gotten many benefit from this cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everyone noticed that my skin became white and shine</li>
            <li> I have no clue if this works or not - I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks or so. The jury is definitely still out on this. There&#x27;s a lot left, so when the bottle is empty, I hope to see improvement!</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome ! After one week it diminished a lot many dark spots on my face even freckles ! I will surly buy more ! It is the best product on the market and I used many many products like this one. Much better than Clinique!!!</li>
            <li> Well. Not as effective as originally expected. You&#x27;ve got to constantly put cream over the area and still the results are not that striking.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice cream. It goes on smoothly and my face feels so smooth after using this. It did not irritate my skin. My face seems evenly toned after using it. So far it seems good .Fast shipping and packaged well .&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for free for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Did not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SOFT , BUT IT DOES NOT DO WHAT IT SUPPOSE TO DO</li>
            <li> Why am I using this product â€“ too much time under Caribbean sun resulting the Big Dark Sunspots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third week of using this wonderful product and my dark spots are fading. I can even hide them using the foundationâ€¦  I also stopped having occasional breakouts.  I think my pores got smaller â€¦. but cannot confirm that  ( that was not my main goal and this is not why I selected this cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall â€“ my face looks younger , lighter, clearer and evenly tonedâ€¦&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I suggest this product â€“ YES!!! It is on my list of must have.</li>
            <li> I received  half of container.. not worth it...i regret  so much..and does not do any good this cream.</li>
            <li> this does not do nothing, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Bought this cream when I went on a trip to Romania, it works but you have to give it time.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s hard to leave a fair review of this product because it did nothing for what appeared to be a dark spot on my husband&#x27;s cheek. We then found out it wasn&#x27;t a dark spot per se so he&#x27;s now having the spot frozen off over multiple appointments. It did lighten his skin some around the spot.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this product functions well; however it leaves a film behind wherever it is applied. This could be by design but was not good for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using it regularly for more than a month and I can see the results already. I trust the Gerovital products because they are based on real science and have been on the market for a long time maintaining the same great performance</li>
            <li> I guess I was looking for a miracle.  I have age spots on my forehead and I think I will need to have something done to remove them....maybe need to go see a derm doctor.</li>
            <li> I have old age spots on my hands and I&#x27;ve been trying many products.  Nothing worked until I tried Gerovital H3 Evolution.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month - once daily and my old age spots are much lighter.  Hardly noticable and no new ones have appeared.  Now I&#x27;m wondering if I should go back and read the application instructions.</li>
            <li> I love this cream I very recommended my skin feel smooth  thanks</li>
            <li> After reading the review, I thought I&#x27;ll try it.  It works but slowly--- almost un-noticeable... but it seems to be working.  The Jar says three months before results... .so I am watching.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t faded the brown spots yet. However, I like the way it makes my skin look. It has a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I just received the cream, don&#x27;t know if it will work.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this product every day for over three weeks and I do not see any changes as a acne dark spot remover. Look else wear!</li>
