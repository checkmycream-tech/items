            <li>It&#x27;s good for no-smudge but there is way too much mascara on the applicator when you pull it out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>My friend recommended this product, and it is light and easily applicated to my eyelashes.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a photographer and this mascara does not smudge even after a long day shooting in the heat.</li>

            <li> My daughter swears by this and doesn&#x27;t mind the expense. Tube lasts forever and doesn&#x27;t get gross.</li>
            <li> This product really is smudge proof but washes off w/soap &amp; water.  I learned about it from a recommendation in a travel magazine.</li>
            <li> My new go to mascara.  I&#x27;m a photographer and this mascara does not smudge even after a long day shooting in the heat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for no-smudge but there is way too much mascara on the applicator when you pull it out of the tube.  Even if you dip it up and down through the opening it&#x27;s still way too much on the brush.  I have to carefully scrape down each side of the brush so I don&#x27;t get big clumpy eyelashes.  It&#x27;s not the end of the world but it&#x27;s a pain to have to go through this extra step.  I have used other mascaras that don&#x27;t have this same issue so I believe it&#x27;s a problem with the design of the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite no smudge mascara!  This is the only mascara that I have found that doesn&#x27;t smudge under my eyes, even when I workout and sweat a lot.  I love the way it goes on and it washes off easily with water and a little cleanser.  It is my go to mascara from now on!</li>
            <li> Omg first non-waterproof mascara that does not smudge and I&#x27;ve tried all there&#x27;s out there and paid a lot of money for some crappy Dior stuff.</li>
            <li> The only mascara I&#x27;ve tried that really, truly, doesn&#x27;t smudge. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge.  It makes my lashes look long without clumping, and comes off without any damage to my lashes.</li>
            <li> The ONLY mascara that doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes. Just wish it made my lashes thicker. Definitely smudge proof but still easy to take off.</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on nicely, and if my eyelash is bent, it straightens it and it stays. I don&#x27;t have to keep brushing and brushing which usually results in too much when I use other mascara. It also stays on incredibly good without flake. It does not smudge. It holds as if it were glue. I think it is worth the money. I will buy it in the future. I won&#x27;t waste my money on other mascara. This is the first one I really found that is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> WoW. Definitely not as good as younique&#x27;s moodstruck 3D fiber mascara from www.lashalert.com  I&#x27;ve never seen a mascara do what it can do! Now, everything else is blah!</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years because it doesn&#x27;t smear on me, stays on all day, and comes off easily.&lt;br /&gt; It is almost the perfect mascara.  One caveat though,  it flakes off rather than smears off and the flakes end up in the corners of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I really liked this mascara.  I would still be using it had I not decided to try a mascara that would be less potentially irritating from Whole Foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be going back to Estee Lauder mascara, but only because I found something less irritating, does what I want it to, and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Had lettering crossed out.  Not for individual sale.  What&#x27;s that about? It feeling real confidant it is sanitary.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product, and it is light and easily applicated to my eyelashes. Definitely smudge free!</li>
            <li> Not as smudge proof as advertised...at least not on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Makes lashes thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin in places and use an eye smoother below my make-up.  Often my mascara smudges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product goes on beautifully and works well with just one coat for those days when I want to wear less makeup.  I am very happy with this and will order again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge at all but it goes on a little gloppy. Might be the brush.</li>
            <li> I received a sample...not for individual resale ???  Had to return.</li>
