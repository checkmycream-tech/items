            <li>I bought this item, and while it worked, absolutely LOVED IT!!!!!  </li>
            <li>4 of us went on a 4 days girls trip, and all used my iron for &#x27;giggles&#x27; - after claiming it the best ever.</li>
            <li>All in all, I was extremely impressed.</li>
            <li>and the best I can say for it is that it saved me a couple of trips to the salon.</li>
            <li>The problem with the Solia is that it still gives flyaways and some unwanted bends, while the Runway seemed just about flawless.  </li>
            <li>When the iron is functioning, they work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This iron is the best I ever had.</li>
            <li>THE BEST....</li>
            <li>my friends were all impressed - its the ceramic.  </li>
            <li>this is the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made.  </li>
            <li>That is to provide excellent heating and recovery as opposed to one plate (Hana Elite).</li>
            <li>Since I tried all the rest, I thought I would try the best.</li>
            <li>if it the best.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t want to spend the money and got cheaper versions and weren&#x27;t as impressed - but goes to show what a great iron this is.  </li>
            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>After about 10 months of use, my hair is in great condition.    </li>
            <li>They are great, but I could have saved myself $340 for the results.  </li>
            <li>it works great in both.</li>
            <li>But besides that its a GREAT straightener...</li>
            <li>you want the best, BUT is the best worth the money???</li>
            <li>I have used many straighteners and I thought it was the best.</li>
            <li>After reading all the good reviews about this product i decided to take a chance to buy it.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s the reason for my two stars Good luck</li>
            <li>and it will do the job just as good, and you won&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking, and breaking your bank.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of straightening tools.  </li>
            <li>and it never looked or felt as good as it does with the FHI</li>
            <li>they both seem to do a superior job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible and I could be happy with the results, it&#x27;s just that it takes longer to straighten your hair with it</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>Its amazing...</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to spend that kind of money again</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I will not purchase another flatiron from them.</li>
            <li>The best thing about the CHI is that it is made in the USA (real ones sold at salons, not the fakes).  </li>
            <li>Basically, it is not in a league of its own.</li>
            <li>I use the CHI iron guard and keratin mist when blow drying along with some foam (KeraCare has a nice foaming product) and then coat my hair with the CHI Silkener before ironing.  </li>
            <li>The FHI is the best of them all and keeps working for me although it does have the highest price tag of all the irons I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I know, it&#x27;s sounds to good to be true.</li>
            <li>Yes, will put a huge dent in your wallet!</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best investment I&#x27;ve made in terms of a styling tool ever!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.  </li>
            <li>and I just don&#x27;t feel that my hair is healthy.</li>
            <li>I have chemically treated hair, the iron helps my hair look healthy.</li>
            <li>in this time, I&#x27;m feeling better and better about this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve \\&quot;straightness\\&quot; like this without a relaxer or a trip to the hair salon, and this allows me to look like I made a trip to my stylist whenever I want.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve dropped it many times...</li>
            <li>It takes 40 minutes and loads more sectioning.  </li>
            <li>Having tried the Hana Elite, it was ok.</li>
            <li>Loved this flat iron took great care of it</li>
            <li>The FHI is, bar none, the best flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I believe this is one of the best flat irons out there.  </li>
            <li>I was able to set the temperature for my hair type and easily straighten my curly head of hair.</li>
            <li>&amp; i got it in a couple days of ordering which was impressive for me since i do not live in USA.     </li>
            <li>They gladly took my money and then spend over a month emailing me to tell me that it was out of stock--BTW they still have it available for purchase on their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been hearing that the CHIs break easily these days</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong...</li>
            <li>In addition, the iron is really light, easy to handle</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>and it was fine every time.  </li>
            <li>BUT...while I did, this iron was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I had such a great experience with the Runway that it pains me to have to go find another one.  </li>
            <li>How amazed was I to find that I enjoy this thing?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the cheap straighteners when that was all that was there for me in college</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide as smooth as the Sedu</li>
            <li>While it worked, this flat iron was great.</li>
            <li>It did a GREAT job and actually convinced my friends who have straight hair to buy straighteners for their own straight hair, as after using mine, their hair looked so much better.</li>
            <li>The CHI Original ($90) and the Solia 1\\&quot; ($80).  </li>
            <li>Super shinning and smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s straight and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>It did flat iron my hair in 10 mins but any good iron can do that also</li>
            <li>, i must say that all it takes is one quick movement of the iron into your hair</li>
            <li>Not only did the Runway meet my expectations in that area, it left my hair softer than ever and with a sheen that is quite impressive.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and stays that way without any hair damage.</li>
            <li>I rarely used it</li>
            <li>My advice to others would be to try something else that is cheaper because for the price this iron isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny you pay for it.</li>
            <li>Ladies treat yourself in &#x27;08 with this worth while tool.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth $450, go buy a $50 wet/dry hair straightener</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the Runway is worth buying after trying the cheaper Solia.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I also bought it before buying the FHI and decided it was worth keeping.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>the flat iron works AMAZING</li>
            <li>After much research and debate with myself, I decided to make this special purchase as a treat to myself and my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t go to the salon very much anymore.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through many flat irons and this is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had hands down..</li>
            <li>So maybe the new box design signifies a new and better Runway iron -- who knows?    </li>
            <li>This is the new improvement on the original FHI Runway that was prone to breaking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve more than made my money back on this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heat is very even and consistent and allows me to make my hair look like I have a fresh relaxer in my hair every time I use it with salon results.  </li>
            <li>I have more volume now than I could have imagined back in my chemical straightening days.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use FHI Hot Sauce as I don&#x27;t like the affect the alcohol in the product</li>
            <li>When I first bought my iron, I took it with me to my stylist and had her set the temperature.  </li>
            <li>Multiple ceramic plates is always better instead of one.</li>
            <li>I use it with a little bit of the fhi heat hot sauce or biosilk and my hair is SUPER silky!!!</li>
            <li>Does anyone make a flat iron that lasts more than a year or two?    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now purchased two more flat irons since my Runway broke.  </li>
            <li>then most flat irons</li>
            <li>I would have to say that the Sedu was my favorite until I used the Sedu flat iron cleaner and it took the coating off of the plates.</li>
            <li>It gets pretty hot, so be careful and make sure the setting is right for you.  </li>
            <li>So far that&#x27;s $40/year for amazingly straight smooth hair in 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>This gives me shiny, soft, light weight, extremely straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I honestly do not think I&#x27;ll find a better iron or would even need to find a better one with the results I&#x27;m getting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a stylist for 18 years and have pretty much lived through all the technological changes that have occurred during that time.  </li>
            <li>and it uses a single plate design that I can tell works better.  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re ready to spend $400 for a year of flattening hair with this iron don&#x27;t bother buying it.</li>
            <li>My hair stays straight no matter what</li>
            <li>and it straight for days not hours</li>
            <li>The iron really works with one stroke over hair.  </li>
            <li>It gets my hair straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>I NEVER thought I could have that 90&#x27;s style sleek straight hair like Avril Lavine (?)</li>
            <li>Highly reccoment it to anyone!</li>
            <li>NO MATTER how much heat protectants you use.</li>
            <li>and it gives more flyaways than the other two.  </li>
            <li>As much as I loved the Runway, the company leaves MUCH to be desired and the fact that it can&#x27;t last more than a year (when I barely straighten my hair 2x a month) is RIDICULOUS.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s results mimic a much cheaper but high quality iron that Vidal Sassoon produces.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t stop working fortunately, but I had a plate physically break on a trip--and I was in the market for a new iron.</li>
            <li>My hair type ranges from a little bit of 4A on the sides, some 3B at the top and Center but is mostly 3C.  </li>
            <li>I have used this iron on all my friends, it works just as good on all my friends, even my african american ones and friends with coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I am East Indian in decent</li>
            <li>The red light indicator is dim and not flashing as it should be when it&#x27;s at the desired temperature.  </li>
            <li>I highly rec.</li>
            <li>The HAI, CHI and other moderately priced tools I have used produced nice results the first day, but I found I had to really stretch my style to last a week.  </li>
            <li>I really didnt see the WOW factor in this product as others mentioned.</li>
            <li>I think that for this kind of money, it should have lasted me at least five years.</li>
            <li>I recently cut it into a bob, which also eliminated the bun option and meant that it had to be straightened pretty much all the time for work.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, the Runway is -technically- the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried and gave me \\&quot;A\\&quot; quality results that were close to what one could achieve with Japanese hair straightening (thermal reconditioning), but I would not recommend purchasing it due to it possibly breaking and the price you are paying to get one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m partial to HAI flat irons if you have not already noticed- although I do not rate them as highly as the FHI RUNWAY since the results are satisfactory (Great for it&#x27;s price) but not quite the same since my hair does not remain straight as long.  </li>
            <li>My stylist is probably upset that I don&#x27;t visit as frequently (every other week), but I&#x27;m happy that I onlyneed to visit her every other month for a trim/new style, especially at $80 a visit.  </li>
            <li>I recommend trying the Vidal Sassoon Studio Tools Professional High Heat Ceramic irons.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t be fooled by the small plates... little bits of hair done faster is great.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does a good job but as far as the \\&quot;best\\&quot; I will have to give it a few more trys</li>
            <li>The CHI original is the weakest of the three irons, due to the fixed temperature.  </li>
            <li>The style for the FHI lasts for a full 6-7 days in the summer, compared to the 2-3 days I get with other tools in the summer.  </li>
            <li>pin straight if I use that itsy bitsy iron to get my roots first as my roots are a bit stubborn and I don&#x27;t have the patience to blow the slight bump out normally.  </li>
            <li>To certain hair types that thick and/or really curly that require a very high heat setting, a single plate may well be beneficial to flatten but in the long run, will also provide the most damage,</li>
            <li>and really does last for days.</li>
            <li>In any event, I have natural 3C hair, until April it was mid-back length.</li>
            <li>It went from being normal hot to just warm, to now just cold.  </li>
            <li>I should have returned them then as now they are completely unreliable.  </li>
            <li>I finally made the decision to grow out my hair from shoulder length and find I can flat-iron as much as once/week and retain my length (abt 8ins/yr with trims).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural since August 2005, so</li>
            <li>I also scouted for irons for nearly a year while using the HAI, CHI, Andis, Babyliss and whatever iron</li>
            <li>My old Chi straightener...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Hana Elite is good iron</li>
            <li>I use it on my daughters one with coarse hair and the other one has fine curly hair</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe I dropped $400 for a flat iron, but 3 years later I feel the investment was worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The RUNWAY iron (as well as my little HAI) curls fairly well, when wearing a bob, loose flips or loose spirals.  </li>
            <li>I called, emailed and got no response from them because I didn&#x27;t buy from their site or an authorized retailer (I bought the first at a trade show, the second on the website I mentioned above).</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had my FHI Runway iron for over 18 months, and have passed through nearly every haircut including the Rihanna cut early last year to hair just below my shoulders now.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I won&#x27;t try other irons, provided they have temperature controls; however, I&#x27;m pretty sold on the FHI.  </li>
            <li>My hair is bouncy, pliable, healthy and thick!  </li>
            <li>(I live in New York), but that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li>(I think the most it&#x27;s ever been is slightly wavy, but that&#x27;s because my head had been slightly rained on)</li>
            <li>It is made in Korea, same place as the Runway, and looks very much the same as the Runway except the plates are blue and not white.  </li>
            <li>Also, while the Runway emits positive ions that can strengthen my hair, I felt like the other flatirons that I&#x27;ve tried (H2Pro, Chi, Missiko, are breaking and pulling it</li>
            <li>I have coarse African American hair and it make my tresses silky straight</li>
            <li>well really any other straightner besides fhi would take forever to straighten my hair...</li>
            <li>For less than 1/3 of the price I can&#x27;t really be picky here.  </li>
            <li>As an African American female, there are few tools that yield the same result as freshly curled hair by way of the marcel irons.</li>
            <li>This is with my hair being a little below shoulder length when straight.  </li>
            <li>The style really only lasted four days in the winter with the other tools, which is problematic when I live in hotels and airplanes.  </li>
            <li>When it broke, I was desperate for a replacement and THOUGHT I&#x27;d found it for an amazing price on a site called hair products pro dot-com.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is good or bad.  </li>

            <li> The FHI is the best of them all and keeps working for me although it does have the highest price tag of all the irons I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I know, it&#x27;s sounds to good to be true.</li>
            <li> Yes, will put a huge dent in your wallet!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best investment I&#x27;ve made in terms of a styling tool ever!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.  </li>
            <li> and I just don&#x27;t feel that my hair is healthy.</li>
            <li> I have chemically treated hair, the iron helps my hair look healthy.</li>
            <li> in this time, I&#x27;m feeling better and better about this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve \\&quot;straightness\\&quot; like this without a relaxer or a trip to the hair salon, and this allows me to look like I made a trip to my stylist whenever I want.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve dropped it many times...</li>
            <li> It takes 40 minutes and loads more sectioning.  </li>
            <li> Having tried the Hana Elite, it was ok.</li>
            <li> Loved this flat iron took great care of it</li>
            <li> The FHI is, bar none, the best flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I believe this is one of the best flat irons out there.  </li>
            <li> I was able to set the temperature for my hair type and easily straighten my curly head of hair.</li>
            <li> &amp; i got it in a couple days of ordering which was impressive for me since i do not live in USA.     </li>
            <li> They gladly took my money and then spend over a month emailing me to tell me that it was out of stock--BTW they still have it available for purchase on their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been hearing that the CHIs break easily these days</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong...</li>
            <li> In addition, the iron is really light, easy to handle</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> and it was fine every time.  </li>
            <li> BUT...while I did, this iron was fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I had such a great experience with the Runway that it pains me to have to go find another one.  </li>
            <li> How amazed was I to find that I enjoy this thing?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cheap straighteners when that was all that was there for me in college</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t glide as smooth as the Sedu</li>
            <li> While it worked, this flat iron was great.</li>
            <li> It did a GREAT job and actually convinced my friends who have straight hair to buy straighteners for their own straight hair, as after using mine, their hair looked so much better.</li>
            <li> The CHI Original ($90) and the Solia 1\\&quot; ($80).  </li>
            <li> Super shinning and smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s straight and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> It did flat iron my hair in 10 mins but any good iron can do that also</li>
            <li> , i must say that all it takes is one quick movement of the iron into your hair</li>
            <li> Not only did the Runway meet my expectations in that area, it left my hair softer than ever and with a sheen that is quite impressive.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and stays that way without any hair damage.</li>
            <li> I rarely used it</li>
            <li> My advice to others would be to try something else that is cheaper because for the price this iron isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny you pay for it.</li>
            <li> Ladies treat yourself in &#x27;08 with this worth while tool.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth $450, go buy a $50 wet/dry hair straightener</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the Runway is worth buying after trying the cheaper Solia.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I also bought it before buying the FHI and decided it was worth keeping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> the flat iron works AMAZING</li>
            <li> After much research and debate with myself, I decided to make this special purchase as a treat to myself and my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go to the salon very much anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through many flat irons and this is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had hands down..</li>
            <li> So maybe the new box design signifies a new and better Runway iron -- who knows?    </li>
            <li> This is the new improvement on the original FHI Runway that was prone to breaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve more than made my money back on this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The heat is very even and consistent and allows me to make my hair look like I have a fresh relaxer in my hair every time I use it with salon results.  </li>
            <li> I have more volume now than I could have imagined back in my chemical straightening days.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use FHI Hot Sauce as I don&#x27;t like the affect the alcohol in the product</li>
            <li> When I first bought my iron, I took it with me to my stylist and had her set the temperature.  </li>
            <li> Multiple ceramic plates is always better instead of one.</li>
            <li> I use it with a little bit of the fhi heat hot sauce or biosilk and my hair is SUPER silky!!!</li>
            <li> Does anyone make a flat iron that lasts more than a year or two?    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now purchased two more flat irons since my Runway broke.  </li>
            <li> then most flat irons</li>
            <li> I would have to say that the Sedu was my favorite until I used the Sedu flat iron cleaner and it took the coating off of the plates.</li>
            <li> It gets pretty hot, so be careful and make sure the setting is right for you.  </li>
            <li> So far that&#x27;s $40/year for amazingly straight smooth hair in 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> This gives me shiny, soft, light weight, extremely straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I honestly do not think I&#x27;ll find a better iron or would even need to find a better one with the results I&#x27;m getting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a stylist for 18 years and have pretty much lived through all the technological changes that have occurred during that time.  </li>
            <li> and it uses a single plate design that I can tell works better.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re ready to spend $400 for a year of flattening hair with this iron don&#x27;t bother buying it.</li>
            <li> My hair stays straight no matter what</li>
            <li> and it straight for days not hours</li>
            <li> The iron really works with one stroke over hair.  </li>
            <li> It gets my hair straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> I NEVER thought I could have that 90&#x27;s style sleek straight hair like Avril Lavine (?)</li>
            <li> Highly reccoment it to anyone!</li>
            <li> NO MATTER how much heat protectants you use.</li>
            <li> and it gives more flyaways than the other two.  </li>
            <li> As much as I loved the Runway, the company leaves MUCH to be desired and the fact that it can&#x27;t last more than a year (when I barely straighten my hair 2x a month) is RIDICULOUS.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s results mimic a much cheaper but high quality iron that Vidal Sassoon produces.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t stop working fortunately, but I had a plate physically break on a trip--and I was in the market for a new iron.</li>
            <li> My hair type ranges from a little bit of 4A on the sides, some 3B at the top and Center but is mostly 3C.  </li>
            <li> I have used this iron on all my friends, it works just as good on all my friends, even my african american ones and friends with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I am East Indian in decent</li>
            <li> The red light indicator is dim and not flashing as it should be when it&#x27;s at the desired temperature.  </li>
            <li> I highly rec.</li>
            <li> The HAI, CHI and other moderately priced tools I have used produced nice results the first day, but I found I had to really stretch my style to last a week.  </li>
            <li> I really didnt see the WOW factor in this product as others mentioned.</li>
            <li> I think that for this kind of money, it should have lasted me at least five years.</li>
            <li> I recently cut it into a bob, which also eliminated the bun option and meant that it had to be straightened pretty much all the time for work.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, the Runway is -technically- the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried and gave me \\&quot;A\\&quot; quality results that were close to what one could achieve with Japanese hair straightening (thermal reconditioning), but I would not recommend purchasing it due to it possibly breaking and the price you are paying to get one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m partial to HAI flat irons if you have not already noticed- although I do not rate them as highly as the FHI RUNWAY since the results are satisfactory (Great for it&#x27;s price) but not quite the same since my hair does not remain straight as long.  </li>
            <li> My stylist is probably upset that I don&#x27;t visit as frequently (every other week), but I&#x27;m happy that I onlyneed to visit her every other month for a trim/new style, especially at $80 a visit.  </li>
            <li> I recommend trying the Vidal Sassoon Studio Tools Professional High Heat Ceramic irons.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be fooled by the small plates... little bits of hair done faster is great.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does a good job but as far as the \\&quot;best\\&quot; I will have to give it a few more trys</li>
            <li> The CHI original is the weakest of the three irons, due to the fixed temperature.  </li>
            <li> The style for the FHI lasts for a full 6-7 days in the summer, compared to the 2-3 days I get with other tools in the summer.  </li>
            <li> pin straight if I use that itsy bitsy iron to get my roots first as my roots are a bit stubborn and I don&#x27;t have the patience to blow the slight bump out normally.  </li>
            <li> To certain hair types that thick and/or really curly that require a very high heat setting, a single plate may well be beneficial to flatten but in the long run, will also provide the most damage,</li>
            <li> and really does last for days.</li>
            <li> In any event, I have natural 3C hair, until April it was mid-back length.</li>
            <li> It went from being normal hot to just warm, to now just cold.  </li>
            <li> I should have returned them then as now they are completely unreliable.  </li>
            <li> I finally made the decision to grow out my hair from shoulder length and find I can flat-iron as much as once/week and retain my length (abt 8ins/yr with trims).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural since August 2005, so</li>
            <li> I also scouted for irons for nearly a year while using the HAI, CHI, Andis, Babyliss and whatever iron</li>
            <li> My old Chi straightener...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Hana Elite is good iron</li>
            <li> I use it on my daughters one with coarse hair and the other one has fine curly hair</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe I dropped $400 for a flat iron, but 3 years later I feel the investment was worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The RUNWAY iron (as well as my little HAI) curls fairly well, when wearing a bob, loose flips or loose spirals.  </li>
            <li> I called, emailed and got no response from them because I didn&#x27;t buy from their site or an authorized retailer (I bought the first at a trade show, the second on the website I mentioned above).</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had my FHI Runway iron for over 18 months, and have passed through nearly every haircut including the Rihanna cut early last year to hair just below my shoulders now.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I won&#x27;t try other irons, provided they have temperature controls; however, I&#x27;m pretty sold on the FHI.  </li>
            <li> My hair is bouncy, pliable, healthy and thick!  </li>
            <li> (I live in New York), but that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> (I think the most it&#x27;s ever been is slightly wavy, but that&#x27;s because my head had been slightly rained on)</li>
            <li> It is made in Korea, same place as the Runway, and looks very much the same as the Runway except the plates are blue and not white.  </li>
            <li> Also, while the Runway emits positive ions that can strengthen my hair, I felt like the other flatirons that I&#x27;ve tried (H2Pro, Chi, Missiko, are breaking and pulling it</li>
            <li> I have coarse African American hair and it make my tresses silky straight</li>
            <li> well really any other straightner besides fhi would take forever to straighten my hair...</li>
            <li> For less than 1/3 of the price I can&#x27;t really be picky here.  </li>
            <li> As an African American female, there are few tools that yield the same result as freshly curled hair by way of the marcel irons.</li>
            <li> This is with my hair being a little below shoulder length when straight.  </li>
            <li> The style really only lasted four days in the winter with the other tools, which is problematic when I live in hotels and airplanes.  </li>
            <li> When it broke, I was desperate for a replacement and THOUGHT I&#x27;d found it for an amazing price on a site called hair products pro dot-com.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is good or bad.  </li>
            <li> My hair is normally extremely kinky but this iron straightens it completely.</li>
            <li> I had read SEVERAL reviews before purchasing this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The Runway is a phenomenal iron but people fail to realize that they don&#x27;t use a solid single plate design but use 6 layers fused together instead.  </li>
            <li> I spend about about 20 minutes blowing my hair dry and could eliminate the bumps at my roots if I cared enough to use it for an extra 10 to 15 minutes, which I do on occasion.  </li>
            <li> (hot tools - BAD for your hair, vidal sassoon ceramic - hair gets caught between the plates causing pulling) and some pricier ones now that I&#x27;m working (CHI original, CHI Nano, HAI, etc.).  </li>
            <li> so this flat iron needs to work well for me to get my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron b/c like everybody else</li>
            <li> This is a $450 top-of-the-line flat iron.</li>
            <li> Although I know I probably don&#x27;t need it set that high, my former stylist set me at 370, I like it because I&#x27;m lazy</li>
            <li> how is it that this flat iron cost 450 and if it drops ONCE it doesn&#x27;t work anymore!</li>
            <li> once in the toilet</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit to liking to use the super thin HAI iron in conjunction with this iron since it helps my hair to come out</li>
            <li> it takes roughly 30 minutes total to iron my hair using small sections and applying a drop of silkener to the section rather than a dollop to rub throughout my whole head.  </li>
            <li> She bought one that is for both wet and dry hair, and performance-wise it is VERY comparable to the Fhi...and it was less than $50!</li>
            <li> I use the high setting and take small section and once over my hair</li>
            <li> Except grad school and my Pomeranian (the cat was free, sorry Mac)</li>
            <li> long, like the front and one side of the Rihanna cut (that part I ironed once a week using the RUNWAY).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The time it takes to style my hair has definitely cut down, making me a far less patient person.  </li>
            <li> That was a total disappointment because i&#x27;ve used many other irons that allows you to have have this however</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like is that the plates are white and when the products comes off on the plates it burns and stains the plates a little with a brownish organgish color.</li>
            <li> I had to iron the back of my hair every other day with the HAI to keep the lay in the back and the RUNWAY is too big for hair that short, although it handles well for hair that is at least 3/4\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I did notice FHI changed the packaging of the box to be in red and black and show the runway and a girl.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but when I do I really put it to work (long, thick, frizzy hair here).  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and coarse hair, so it cut my styling time in half and keeps my hair straight for days.</li>
            <li> In addition, I use much less hair product since receiving my flat iron.</li>
            <li> The little HAI helped me pull off the Rihanna cut which I HAD TO HAVE for a few months while still remaining natural.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, yesterday, in the middle of getting ready to go out of a date, it died.</li>
            <li> and I actually feel uncomfortable at the 450 setting, which I absolutely did not with the FHI).</li>
            <li> I spent to straighten my hair...</li>
            <li> did not work as expected</li>
            <li> I was ULTRA careful with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I bought another Runway just a few months after this (when I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore) and, out of the blue, it stopped working 9 months in.</li>
            <li> That being said, my sister bought a flat iron from Target a few weeks after I splurged on my $450 FHI.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t burn your fingers when you grab the other end like the Sedu.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s near impossible to get my hair to stay straight, it&#x27;s ALWAYS frizzy if it&#x27;s the least bit humid outside, no matter what hair products I put in it...</li>
            <li> Several reviews that I read warned about the delicate plates.</li>
            <li> $400 down the drain basically</li>
            <li> Used to have a CHI, but hands down</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I do have to update that not shortly after receiving the iron I started to notice that the cord would short dependent upon on it was turned.  </li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;m combing out less hair.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have frizzy or slightly burnt ends (my issue with the CHI tools).  </li>
            <li> They cost less than $30 but produce results that rival to the $200 FHI Heat curling Iron.  </li>
            <li> I used to hate my frizzy curls, but lately, if I decided to let my hair air dry, it still dries supple and healthy.    </li>
            <li> so i have really thick, long hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought it new on ebay without a warranty, so after 6 months</li>
            <li> My hair grew like crazy, even with the excess heat, and I barely had any split ends when it came time for my next trim.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the style held for a little under 3 days even with nightly wrapping.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure about the other brands out there.  </li>
            <li> It leaves ridiculous amounts of unwanted bends, flyaways, frizziness, and my hair is not soft or shiny.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about 6 months, it completley quit turning on and heating up - completely just stopped working.  </li>
            <li> You can spend a 1/4th of the price and get something that is only a hair or two worse, literally.  </li>
            <li> Repeated use of the CHI made my ends split heavily and eventually it could straighten everything up to my ends which would remain frizzy after ironing or cause pulling when my ends fried a bit.  </li>
            <li> broke after a few months, but mine is still hanging in there.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little time to use and I never have that burned hair smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried Solia, Sedu, Chi &amp; Fhi(regular) in the past.</li>
            <li> gotta knock on wood because I want to make at least the 5yr anniversary mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never knew that I had a LOT of hair and that it was so thick, since the chemicals thinned it out</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li> I was deathly afraid of frying my hair with a flat iron and decided to buy the top-or-the-line model recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I could get my hands on in the mean time, waiting to find this baby on sale or at a discount.  </li>
            <li> I have stretched the style for two weeks in the winter and could have gone longer if I didn&#x27;t mind having dirty hair.  </li>
            <li> FHI has a RIDICULOUS warranty policy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little shy of my 4yr anniversary with this iron</li>
            <li> To say the least, I am annoyed.</li>

            <li> I bought this item, and while it worked, absolutely LOVED IT!!!!!  Unfortunately, after about 6 months, it completley quit turning on and heating up - completely just stopped working.  So, I can&#x27;t rate it well, as that makes it about $100 per month I spent to straighten my hair...BUT...while I did, this iron was fabulous.  It did a GREAT job and actually convinced my friends who have straight hair to buy straighteners for their own straight hair, as after using mine, their hair looked so much better. 4 of us went on a 4 days girls trip, and all used my iron for &#x27;giggles&#x27; - after claiming it the best ever. They didn&#x27;t want to spend the money and got cheaper versions and weren&#x27;t as impressed - but goes to show what a great iron this is.  Unfortunately I bought it new on ebay without a warranty, so after 6 months, I&#x27;ll have to pitch it, bummer. Looking to buy another one though, still.  Loved it!</li>
            <li> If I could give this iron zero stars I would. The quality of this product is horrendous. It broke on me once and for $70 FHI replaced it. I rarely used it however it broke a second time. I was told that at this point they cannot repair the their irons and I should hold on to it until they figure out how fix them. The iron itself does work well but if you&#x27;re ready to spend $400 for a year of flattening hair with this iron don&#x27;t bother buying it. Customer service is useless.</li>
            <li> After reading all the good reviews about this product i decided to take a chance to buy it. I am East Indian in decent so i have really thick, long hair so this flat iron needs to work well for me to get my hair the way i am accustomed to having it...I really didnt see the WOW factor in this product as others mentioned. It did flat iron my hair in 10 mins but any good iron can do that also, my hair had no glossy effect after i was done...That was a total disappointment because i&#x27;ve used many other irons that allows you to have have this however, i must say that all it takes is one quick movement of the iron into your hair and it&#x27;s instantly done...No touch ups necessary and really does last for days. In addition, the iron is really light, easy to handle &amp; i got it in a couple days of ordering which was impressive for me since i do not live in USA.     My advice to others would be to try something else that is cheaper because for the price this iron isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> While it worked, this flat iron was great. I was deathly afraid of frying my hair with a flat iron and decided to buy the top-or-the-line model recommended by my hairdresser. I was able to set the temperature for my hair type and easily straighten my curly head of hair. After about 10 months of use, my hair is in great condition.    Unfortunately, yesterday, in the middle of getting ready to go out of a date, it died. It wasn&#x27;t dropped or mishandled. I think that for this kind of money, it should have lasted me at least five years. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> did not work as expected</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying a straightener, especially because I was skeptical about any of them being able to actually add to the health of my hair.     All in all, I was extremely impressed. It&#x27;s near impossible to get my hair to stay straight, it&#x27;s ALWAYS frizzy if it&#x27;s the least bit humid outside, no matter what hair products I put in it...until FHI Runway.    My hair stays straight no matter what (I think the most it&#x27;s ever been is slightly wavy, but that&#x27;s because my head had been slightly rained on) and I do not lie, my hair quality has actually improved. I used to hate my frizzy curls, but lately, if I decided to let my hair air dry, it still dries supple and healthy.    I know, it&#x27;s sounds to good to be true. But it worked for me. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have fine hair. Anyway, that&#x27;s my two cents.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron b/c like everybody else you want the best, BUT is the best worth the money??? I dropped this thing ONCE... And it stopped working! I was about to cry b/c it was just over a year and the warranty is for a year so they wouldn&#x27;t replace it. I&#x27;m so upset b/c I didn&#x27;t see this coming at all. This is just sad b/c how is it that this flat iron cost 450 and if it drops ONCE it doesn&#x27;t work anymore! smh I won&#x27;t buy another one unless the warranty is longer than 2years SORRY If I&#x27;m going to spend that kind of money again they have to back me up for a couple of years not just one But If you read this and decide to buy it anyway the flat iron works AMAZING it gives your hair a shine all it takes is one pass and it straight for days not hours Loved this flat iron took great care of it But that&#x27;s the reason for my two stars Good luck</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to this styling iron in performance.  It&#x27;s worth every penny you pay for it.</li>
            <li> After much research and debate with myself, I decided to make this special purchase as a treat to myself and my hair. This is definitely the best investment I&#x27;ve made in terms of a styling tool ever! What else can I say but I love it! As an African American female, there are few tools that yield the same result as freshly curled hair by way of the marcel irons. Not only did the Runway meet my expectations in that area, it left my hair softer than ever and with a sheen that is quite impressive. Ladies treat yourself in &#x27;08 with this worth while tool. After I&#x27;m done I look like I&#x27;ve stepped out of the salon!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.  I have coarse African American hair and it make my tresses silky straight</li>
            <li> I had read SEVERAL reviews before purchasing this flat iron. This is a $450 top-of-the-line flat iron. I have very thick and coarse hair, so it cut my styling time in half and keeps my hair straight for days. I discovered the runway because my stylist uses it, and I got hooked. I have used many straighteners and I thought it was the best. That being said, my sister bought a flat iron from Target a few weeks after I splurged on my $450 FHI. She bought one that is for both wet and dry hair, and performance-wise it is VERY comparable to the Fhi...and it was less than $50! Several reviews that I read warned about the delicate plates. Mine was dropped once, and now is completely useless (it wont even turn on), there is a hairline crack in the plate, and it is no longer covered by the 1 year manufacturer warranty.    If you drop this thing one time it wont last. My friend dropped it from probably 2-3 feet. I was ULTRA careful with it (my friend was the one who dropped it), but it just takes ONE time, there is no mercy with this (or the warranty).    It isn&#x27;t worth $450, go buy a $50 wet/dry hair straightener and it will do the job just as good, and you won&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking, and breaking your bank.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a stylist for 18 years and have pretty much lived through all the technological changes that have occurred during that time.  The Runway is a phenomenal iron but people fail to realize that they don&#x27;t use a solid single plate design but use 6 layers fused together instead.  I&#x27;ve recently moved onto the Hana Elite which is another 100% ceramic iron and it uses a single plate design that I can tell works better.  Plus I like that the plates do not get discolored like the white on the runway.</li>
            <li> The FHI is, bar none, the best flat iron that I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used plenty. I had it for over 3 years, but recently it broke--didn&#x27;t stop working fortunately, but I had a plate physically break on a trip--and I was in the market for a new iron. I think it was stepped on or thrown and, as it&#x27;s ceramic it just cracked. In any event, I have natural 3C hair, until April it was mid-back length. I recently cut it into a bob, which also eliminated the bun option and meant that it had to be straightened pretty much all the time for work. When it broke, I was desperate for a replacement and THOUGHT I&#x27;d found it for an amazing price on a site called hair products pro dot-com. They gladly took my money and then spend over a month emailing me to tell me that it was out of stock--BTW they still have it available for purchase on their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I gave up and accepted a shipment of the H2Pro, which is comparable only to a CHI. It leaves ridiculous amounts of unwanted bends, flyaways, frizziness, and my hair is not soft or shiny. Additionally, the style held for a little under 3 days even with nightly wrapping. I was appalled to say the least. Also, while the Runway emits positive ions that can strengthen my hair, I felt like the other flatirons that I&#x27;ve tried (H2Pro, Chi, Missiko, are breaking and pulling it and I actually feel uncomfortable at the 450 setting, which I absolutely did not with the FHI). Although I know I probably don&#x27;t need it set that high, my former stylist set me at 370, I like it because I&#x27;m lazy (story for another blog)...But, the 370 setting required 3-5 pass throughs with the H2Pro and Missiko (2-3 with the Chi) and I just don&#x27;t feel that my hair is healthy. It feels scorched and brittle on the ends, which I never EVER got with the Runway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I bought another Runway just a few months after this (when I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore) and, out of the blue, it stopped working 9 months in. FHI has a RIDICULOUS warranty policy. I called, emailed and got no response from them because I didn&#x27;t buy from their site or an authorized retailer (I bought the first at a trade show, the second on the website I mentioned above). To say the least, I am annoyed. $400 down the drain basically and the best I can say for it is that it saved me a couple of trips to the salon. I have to find another flatiron and I am TOTALLY disappointed in FHI as a company. I can honestly say that I will not purchase another flatiron from them. As much as I loved the Runway, the company leaves MUCH to be desired and the fact that it can&#x27;t last more than a year (when I barely straighten my hair 2x a month) is RIDICULOUS.</li>
            <li> September 2, 2009 Update  ______________________    It pains me to say this but after 8 joyous straight-hair months, my Runway stopped working.  I was doing my mother&#x27;s hair tonight and I was about 1/4th of the way finished when I noticed the iron wasn&#x27;t heating up anymore.  It went from being normal hot to just warm, to now just cold.  The red light indicator is dim and not flashing as it should be when it&#x27;s at the desired temperature.  I will not try to contact FHI for a replacement because they will not give a warranty to anyone who doesn&#x27;t buy it from a salon or their website.    I had such a great experience with the Runway that it pains me to have to go find another one.  I have been hearing that the CHIs break easily these days and I&#x27;m not sure about the other brands out there.  Does anyone make a flat iron that lasts more than a year or two?    I did notice FHI changed the packaging of the box to be in red and black and show the runway and a girl.  My box is white and blue and just shows the iron.  So maybe the new box design signifies a new and better Runway iron -- who knows?    September 19, 2009 Update  _______________________    I&#x27;ve now purchased two more flat irons since my Runway broke.  The CHI Original ($90) and the Solia 1\\&quot; ($80).  Here&#x27;s how I&#x27;d compare them to the Runway.    The CHI original is the weakest of the three irons, due to the fixed temperature.  The best thing about the CHI is that it is made in the USA (real ones sold at salons, not the fakes).  I am keeping the CHI as a backup iron in case my Solia ever stops working.  It&#x27;s not horrible and I could be happy with the results, it&#x27;s just that it takes longer to straighten your hair with it and it gives more flyaways than the other two.  Overall quality grade: C    The Solia 1\\&quot; gives similar results compared to the Runway.  For less than 1/3 of the price I can&#x27;t really be picky here.  The problem with the Solia is that it still gives flyaways and some unwanted bends, while the Runway seemed just about flawless.  The Solia heats up faster than the Runway though.  I don&#x27;t think the Runway is worth buying after trying the cheaper Solia.  It is made in Korea, same place as the Runway, and looks very much the same as the Runway except the plates are blue and not white.  Overall quality grade: B    In conclusion, the Runway is -technically- the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried and gave me \\&quot;A\\&quot; quality results that were close to what one could achieve with Japanese hair straightening (thermal reconditioning), but I would not recommend purchasing it due to it possibly breaking and the price you are paying to get one.  You can spend a 1/4th of the price and get something that is only a hair or two worse, literally.  Basically, it is not in a league of its own.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I do have to update that not shortly after receiving the iron I started to notice that the cord would short dependent upon on it was turned.  I should have returned them then as now they are completely unreliable.  When the iron is functioning, they work perfectly.  I just wish they were built to last.</li>
            <li> The iron really works with one stroke over hair.  I use the high setting and take small section and once over my hair it&#x27;s straight and looks healthy.  I have chemically treated hair, the iron helps my hair look healthy. It gets very hot and stays that way without any hair damage.</li>
            <li> This iron is the best I ever had. I no longer have to go to the hairdresser to get my hair pressed.  My hair is normally extremely kinky but this iron straightens it completely. I was spending $80 a week to get my hair pressed.  I cherish this iron and you will too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like things like curling wands and straightening combs--I guess I&#x27;m just afraid of heat. How amazed was I to find that I enjoy this thing? It gets my hair straight and shiny. It takes very little time to use and I never have that burned hair smell. The curls last and last and I think I&#x27;m combing out less hair. In addition, I use much less hair product since receiving my flat iron.</li>
            <li> 11/20/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This buddy is still ticking after 5.5years and my loves it.  I finally made the decision to grow out my hair from shoulder length and find I can flat-iron as much as once/week and retain my length (abt 8ins/yr with trims).  In-between I wrap and pin-curl.  My friend has gone through 3 CHIs (starting on her 4th one) in this time, I&#x27;m feeling better and better about this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/23/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little shy of my 4yr anniversary with this iron and it&#x27;s still going strong...gotta knock on wood because I want to make at least the 5yr anniversary mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;10/7/09&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I&#x27;ve had my FHI Runway iron for over 18 months, and have passed through nearly every haircut including the Rihanna cut early last year to hair just below my shoulders now.  I travel as a consultant, so the hair must be on point!  My hair type ranges from a little bit of 4A on the sides, some 3B at the top and Center but is mostly 3C.  I&#x27;ve been natural since August 2005, so I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of straightening tools.  I&#x27;ve used the cheap straighteners when that was all that was there for me in college (hot tools - BAD for your hair, vidal sassoon ceramic - hair gets caught between the plates causing pulling) and some pricier ones now that I&#x27;m working (CHI original, CHI Nano, HAI, etc.).  The FHI is the best of them all and keeps working for me although it does have the highest price tag of all the irons I&#x27;ve used so far.  I think it&#x27;s worth the price.  I also scouted for irons for nearly a year while using the HAI, CHI, Andis, Babyliss and whatever iron I could get my hands on in the mean time, waiting to find this baby on sale or at a discount.  It paid off because I bought the iron for $260 last year.  My stylist is probably upset that I don&#x27;t visit as frequently (every other week), but I&#x27;m happy that I onlyneed to visit her every other month for a trim/new style, especially at $80 a visit.  I&#x27;ve more than made my money back on this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get fewer split ends with my RUNWAY iron, and have NOT had the displeasure of it pulling my hair.  The heat is very even and consistent and allows me to make my hair look like I have a fresh relaxer in my hair every time I use it with salon results.  I still have to touch up my roots if I come back in from a night of dancing or have been walking around the city all day in 90 degree weather (I live in New York), but that is to be expected.  I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve \\&quot;straightness\\&quot; like this without a relaxer or a trip to the hair salon, and this allows me to look like I made a trip to my stylist whenever I want.  My hair is bouncy, pliable, healthy and thick!  I could not say this about my hair when I used chemical straighteners.  I have more volume now than I could have imagined back in my chemical straightening days.  I never knew that I had a LOT of hair and that it was so thick, since the chemicals thinned it out so badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my FHI iron in conjunction with the FHI Nano blow dryer, CHI and KeraCare products.  I don&#x27;t use FHI Hot Sauce as I don&#x27;t like the affect the alcohol in the product has on my hair which seems to cause flyaways for my hair.  I use the CHI iron guard and keratin mist when blow drying along with some foam (KeraCare has a nice foaming product) and then coat my hair with the CHI Silkener before ironing.  This gives me shiny, soft, light weight, extremely straight hair.  Because I can set the temperature my hair comes out softer, I don&#x27;t have flyaways and I don&#x27;t have frizzy or slightly burnt ends (my issue with the CHI tools).  When I first bought my iron, I took it with me to my stylist and had her set the temperature.  I would recommend and advise for anyone to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit to liking to use the super thin HAI iron in conjunction with this iron since it helps my hair to come out pin straight if I use that itsy bitsy iron to get my roots first as my roots are a bit stubborn and I don&#x27;t have the patience to blow the slight bump out normally.  I also bought it before buying the FHI and decided it was worth keeping.  The little HAI helped me pull off the Rihanna cut which I HAD TO HAVE for a few months while still remaining natural.  I had to iron the back of my hair every other day with the HAI to keep the lay in the back and the RUNWAY is too big for hair that short, although it handles well for hair that is at least 3/4\\&quot; long, like the front and one side of the Rihanna cut (that part I ironed once a week using the RUNWAY).  My hair grew like crazy, even with the excess heat, and I barely had any split ends when it came time for my next trim.  If only the FHI RUNWAY came in a .3\\&quot; plate size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time it takes to style my hair has definitely cut down, making me a far less patient person.  I don&#x27;t know if that is good or bad.  I spend about about 20 minutes blowing my hair dry and could eliminate the bumps at my roots if I cared enough to use it for an extra 10 to 15 minutes, which I do on occasion.  This is with my hair being a little below shoulder length when straight.  Since I use the HAI .3\\&quot; iron to straighten my roots then go over my hair with the FHI it takes roughly 30 minutes total to iron my hair using small sections and applying a drop of silkener to the section rather than a dollop to rub throughout my whole head.  So I can style my hair in just under an hour saving me about 20-30 minutes compared to blow dryers and irons I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RUNWAY iron (as well as my little HAI) curls fairly well, when wearing a bob, loose flips or loose spirals.  Tighter curls, flips and spirals made to last all day need a curling iron.  I do have an FHI curling iron, and I like it but it&#x27;s results mimic a much cheaper but high quality iron that Vidal Sassoon produces.  I recommend trying the Vidal Sassoon Studio Tools Professional High Heat Ceramic irons.  They cost less than $30 but produce results that rival to the $200 FHI Heat curling Iron.  I have both Vidal Sassoon and FHI Heat curling irons in the 3/4\\&quot; and 1.5\\&quot; sizes.  I bought the Vidal Sassoon irons from a drugstore four years ago and they died on me last year.  I replaced them with the FHI Heat irons.  They are great, but I could have saved myself $340 for the results.  I did repurchase my Vidal irons and keep them packed in my suitcase since I&#x27;m afraid of what the wear and tear of traveling will do to the FHI irons even with a heat pouch.  I use the FHI curling irons at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m partial to HAI flat irons if you have not already noticed- although I do not rate them as highly as the FHI RUNWAY since the results are satisfactory (Great for it&#x27;s price) but not quite the same since my hair does not remain straight as long.  I iron my hair once a week with the RUNWAY only because I have to wash it.  I have stretched the style for two weeks in the winter and could have gone longer if I didn&#x27;t mind having dirty hair.  The HAI, CHI and other moderately priced tools I have used produced nice results the first day, but I found I had to really stretch my style to last a week.  The style really only lasted four days in the winter with the other tools, which is problematic when I live in hotels and airplanes.  The style for the FHI lasts for a full 6-7 days in the summer, compared to the 2-3 days I get with other tools in the summer.  Repeated use of the CHI made my ends split heavily and eventually it could straighten everything up to my ends which would remain frizzy after ironing or cause pulling when my ends fried a bit.  I still have not tried the SEDU, Solis, Metropolis or GHD irons, although I&#x27;ve attempted everything else out there, literally.  I can&#x27;t say that I won&#x27;t try other irons, provided they have temperature controls; however, I&#x27;m pretty sold on the FHI.  I honestly do not think I&#x27;ll find a better iron or would even need to find a better one with the results I&#x27;m getting (I can&#x27;t even fathom such a thing).</li>
            <li> THE BEST....don&#x27;t be fooled by the small plates... little bits of hair done faster is great.  my friends were all impressed - its the ceramic.  I had two..the only issue is ONE of them used to snag my hair at the corner - don&#x27;t know why only one of them did this..it might have just been a fluke.  I tried to return it but the place I got it from went out of business.</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for almost 6 years now.  I have thick, curly, stubborn hair.  I NEVER thought I could have that 90&#x27;s style sleek straight hair like Avril Lavine (?) has.  It&#x27;s possible.  It&#x27;s happened.&lt;br /&gt; Except grad school and my Pomeranian (the cat was free, sorry Mac) this is the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made.  The plates turn brown, and it doesn&#x27;t look like $500.  It feels like $500.  I paid $240 on eBay.  So far that&#x27;s $40/year for amazingly straight smooth hair in 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It still heats up in 30 seconds.  Also, I&#x27;ve dropped it many times...once in the toilet (it wasn&#x27;t on)...and it was fine every time.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing this...I also put it in my checked luggage and wrap it in socks/scarves for padding.&lt;br /&gt;I keep a cheaper (but still expensive) her styler iron at my boyfriends house, and I can&#x27;t deal.  It takes 40 minutes and loads more sectioning.  Any bit of wetness is a big problem.  My hair is never &amp;#34;sleek&amp;#34;. The chi I had before this would catch my hair in the corner of the plates and rip it out.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe I dropped $400 for a flat iron, but 3 years later I feel the investment was worth it.  I don&#x27;t go to the salon very much anymore.  The FHI Runway is a miracle worker.  Have read alot of reviews here from unhappy folks who&#x27;s Runway broke after a few months, but mine is still hanging in there.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but when I do I really put it to work (long, thick, frizzy hair here).  Traveled with it, but still have not had any problems.  It gets pretty hot, so be careful and make sure the setting is right for you.  Nqw that I know it&#x27;s fragile, I will take extra caution when handling it (i&#x27;m such a klutz sometimes!).  Used to have a CHI, but hands down I believe this is one of the best flat irons out there.  Yes, will put a huge dent in your wallet!</li>
            <li> I highly rec. the runway.  I use it on my daughters one with coarse hair and the other one has fine curly hair it works great in both. Super shinning and smooth. I have the CHI and it never looked or felt as good as it does with the FHI It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> My old Chi straightener... well really any other straightner besides fhi would take forever to straighten my hair... I&#x27;m talking two hours probably.... now it takes max 40 minutes to straighten my hair. I have used this iron on all my friends, it works just as good on all my friends, even my african american ones and friends with coarse hair. Its amazing... I use it with a little bit of the fhi heat hot sauce or biosilk and my hair is SUPER silky!!! I do have to say, I cannot notice a difference between this straightener and the fhi platform model... they both seem to do a superior job. The only thing I do not like is that the plates are white and when the products comes off on the plates it burns and stains the plates a little with a brownish organgish color. But besides that its a GREAT straightener... LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Highly reccoment it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have gone through many flat irons and this is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had hands down..yes it&#x27;s more expensive then most flat irons but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Having tried the Hana Elite, it was ok. Compared to this, that iron is a mere pretender. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Hana Elite is good iron but it is nothing compared to the FHI Runway. My hair felt silkier with this iron. This is the new improvement on the original FHI Runway that was prone to breaking. Multiple ceramic plates is always better instead of one. FHI specifically made the decision to use multiple ceramic plates. That is to provide excellent heating and recovery as opposed to one plate (Hana Elite). To certain hair types that thick and/or really curly that require a very high heat setting, a single plate may well be beneficial to flatten but in the long run, will also provide the most damage, NO MATTER how much heat protectants you use.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try since it is supposed to be the \\&quot;best\\&quot;. It should be for the price. I have tried Solia, Sedu, Chi &amp; Fhi(regular) in the past. I would have to say that the Sedu was my favorite until I used the Sedu flat iron cleaner and it took the coating off of the plates. Since I tried all the rest, I thought I would try the best. I have only used it once so I cannot say yet if it the best. It doesn&#x27;t glide as smooth as the Sedu but it doesn&#x27;t burn your fingers when you grab the other end like the Sedu. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does a good job but as far as the \\&quot;best\\&quot; I will have to give it a few more trys and then I will post another review.</li>
