            <li>Great summer color and good formula.  </li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t look nice on at all!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You like bright?</li>
            <li>This color is so bright.  </li>
            <li>Good quality stuff.</li>
            <li>but it still is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous cream color.</li>
            <li>It is still looking good though after 2 weeks of wear.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>Both colors are phenomenal and work great together (results in picture gallery).</li>
            <li>Bright color that covers nicely in 2 coats, doesn&#x27;t run to the sides as some gel polishes do.</li>
            <li>My very favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of color when you go on a vacation to a popular beach destination and step into the beachwear shops and see bright neon colors....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more colors!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use more shades!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I was able to apply it without any issues!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and looks great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to use more than two coats of Gellish polish to get a good coverage before this one.  </li>
            <li>, I get so many complements when I use this color, it is gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and excellent polish!</li>
            <li>I received the polish really fast &amp; the polish is great!</li>
            <li>Will revisit when I do my own nails to see if a nail line is visible with two coats.</li>
            <li>It is very strong and durable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a gelish girl so far the best gel brand 2 coats</li>

            <li>Thanks gelish for another great color.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color &amp; polish.</li>
            <li>Would probably look even better on tan</li>
            <li>And they have a better range of colors than CND.  </li>
            <li>I love gelish products.  </li>
            <li>Love the Gelish line of products.</li>
            <li>Great product at a reasonable price.</li>

            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on this color.</li>
            <li>More like a cotton candy to me.</li>
            <li>Although, under the lamp on the polish bubbled up on a couple of my nails but after applying the top coat you couldn&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>Color is a bit more neon than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>9 times out of 10 Gelish does a great job and the color is as pictured, but this one was even better in real life.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite to apply.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Gotta love that.</li>
            <li>I love this bright pink-almost fluorescent under the right lights.  </li>
            <li>I can easily say it&#x27;s my very top favorite right now!</li>
            <li>Super cute!</li>
            <li>Perfectly pink this polish is great!</li>
            <li>The color is bubblegum pink, perfect for summer.</li>
            <li>pink tips are awesome</li>
            <li>Loved it so much, I bought it for myself.</li>
            <li>It lasted a full 2 weeks without any chips!</li>
            <li>FULL size bottle by the way!</li>
            <li>This is the best neon pink color!</li>
            <li>This was the first color that I&#x27;ve tried and I received many compliments on it!</li>
            <li>Bright &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; pink that wears bright.</li>
            <li>Everything I was looking for and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Holy moly BRIGHT pink, but absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Very bright pink.</li>
            <li>It did go on smooth.  </li>
            <li>it also looks great with either Vegas Nights or Ambience glitter for that extra pop!</li>
            <li>Love, love this color, it&#x27;s hot pink and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Takes 2-3 coats to get a streak free finish.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on it and every time I looked down at my own hands I fell in love again!</li>
            <li>and it is perfect hot pink</li>
            <li>A beautiful neon pink!</li>
            <li>Color is accurate to the picture, I&#x27;ve had great results with the gelish brand versus other cheaper off brand shellac.</li>
            <li>Very bright pretty pink color.</li>
            <li>I paid for the full bottle $8.99 I got</li>
            <li>so it takes about 3 coats to get full coverage.</li>
            <li>it does fade a bit after a few days of wear, but even the faded color is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>lucky it was on sale ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>Gelish is my new favorite nail polish.</li>
            <li>So not super great coverage..</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Gelish color so far!</li>
            <li>It is a super fun bright pink!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bright Barbie pink...</li>
            <li>If you like to show off your fun side, this is one color to try.</li>
            <li>This color took several coats to get the nice bright pink shown in the sample.  </li>
            <li>Bright, fun, pink color.</li>
            <li>I only use one coat looks really nice.</li>
            <li>It applied nicely on her hands with two coats, but her nail were short.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice pink it is a true bright pink with a lavender undertone</li>
            <li>Bright peppy pink!</li>
            <li>The color is pretty and is a bright Barbie pink after about 3 coats.</li>
            <li>The quality is consistent with CND Shellac.  </li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love gelish and have about 15 different colors.</li>
            <li>this is really a nice pink</li>
            <li>Such a cute color.</li>
            <li>This was EXACTLY the color I was wanting.  </li>
            <li>Pretty color</li>
            <li>Was what I expected from others pictures and works great with my Gelish UV light and other Gelish nail prepping items.</li>
            <li>Super cute bubble gum pink color!</li>
            <li>My nails usually look pretty good after doing the gelish but not with this color.</li>
            <li>i wish it was more of a hot pink color</li>
            <li>Love this hot pink color!</li>
            <li>Apply to much and it&#x27;ll crinkle.</li>
            <li>the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Its more of a pastel pink with a neon tint to it.</li>
            <li>I have heard the pinks fade, but since I just put it on yesterday I cannot say much on that fact.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this really is a beautiful color, it truly is a Barbie pink!</li>
            <li>love this polish color - it is very very pink!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast and item was new as described.</li>
            <li>after 4 coats of this thin polish it was at best a baby pink.</li>
            <li>Very summery, a little more of a neon pink than a medium pink as pictured, but I like the true color even better.</li>
            <li>Hot Hot Hot pink, makes your nails pop</li>
            <li>Bright but not as bright without a white base underneath.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how much I really like it.</li>
            <li>Good summer crazy kind of pink.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of the polish is normal and has held up over time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a neon pink that is true light pink without a coral cast</li>
            <li>It definitely takes three coats to get the deep, opaque pink, but it is a really nice color...</li>
            <li>This color is a true neon pink.</li>
            <li>Love the color, but I will put it on a little thicker next time or do 3 coats.</li>
            <li>Full size bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li>You need to make sure you are really using thin coats.</li>
            <li>Need 3 coats to be opaque but no wrinkling and nice thin consistency.</li>
            <li>Very pretty pink for summer!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty pink.</li>
            <li>Barbie pink, and it really pops!  </li>
            <li>Pretty color, low star rating because it takes at least three layers to get the color true to what you see on the bottle.</li>
            <li>but that might be due to my application as the other nails wore fine for almost two weeks until I took the color</li>
            <li>Despite being super pale, Irish, it worked with my coloring.</li>
            <li>Needs very thin and multiple layers to look nice</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This color took several coats to get the nice bright pink shown in the sample.  </li>
            <li> Bright, fun, pink color.</li>
            <li> I only use one coat looks really nice.</li>
            <li> It applied nicely on her hands with two coats, but her nail were short.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice pink it is a true bright pink with a lavender undertone</li>
            <li> Bright peppy pink!</li>
            <li> The color is pretty and is a bright Barbie pink after about 3 coats.</li>
            <li> The quality is consistent with CND Shellac.  </li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love gelish and have about 15 different colors.</li>
            <li> this is really a nice pink</li>
            <li> Such a cute color.</li>
            <li> This was EXACTLY the color I was wanting.  </li>
            <li> Pretty color</li>
            <li> Was what I expected from others pictures and works great with my Gelish UV light and other Gelish nail prepping items.</li>
            <li> Super cute bubble gum pink color!</li>
            <li> My nails usually look pretty good after doing the gelish but not with this color.</li>
            <li> i wish it was more of a hot pink color</li>
            <li> Love this hot pink color!</li>
            <li> Apply to much and it&#x27;ll crinkle.</li>
            <li> the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Its more of a pastel pink with a neon tint to it.</li>
            <li> I have heard the pinks fade, but since I just put it on yesterday I cannot say much on that fact.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this really is a beautiful color, it truly is a Barbie pink!</li>
            <li> love this polish color - it is very very pink!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast and item was new as described.</li>
            <li> after 4 coats of this thin polish it was at best a baby pink.</li>
            <li> Very summery, a little more of a neon pink than a medium pink as pictured, but I like the true color even better.</li>
            <li> Hot Hot Hot pink, makes your nails pop</li>
            <li> Bright but not as bright without a white base underneath.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I really like it.</li>
            <li> Good summer crazy kind of pink.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of the polish is normal and has held up over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a neon pink that is true light pink without a coral cast</li>
            <li> It definitely takes three coats to get the deep, opaque pink, but it is a really nice color...</li>
            <li> This color is a true neon pink.</li>
            <li> Love the color, but I will put it on a little thicker next time or do 3 coats.</li>
            <li> Full size bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> You need to make sure you are really using thin coats.</li>
            <li> Need 3 coats to be opaque but no wrinkling and nice thin consistency.</li>
            <li> Very pretty pink for summer!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty pink.</li>
            <li> Barbie pink, and it really pops!  </li>
            <li> Pretty color, low star rating because it takes at least three layers to get the color true to what you see on the bottle.</li>
            <li> but that might be due to my application as the other nails wore fine for almost two weeks until I took the color</li>
            <li> Despite being super pale, Irish, it worked with my coloring.</li>
            <li> Needs very thin and multiple layers to look nice</li>
            <li> The picture, as usual, does not convey the true color of this pink.</li>
            <li> I used three thin coats, there was no wrinkling, and a coat of Izzy Wizzy Let&#x27;s Get Busy to add that purple-ly pretty sparkle.</li>
            <li> The pink in the picture looks different than what actually goes on you hand.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this polish is super thin and when you paint it on your nails it spreads out.</li>
            <li> I did use three, thin coats, which is pretty standard for me.</li>
            <li> It takes at least 3 coats to look decent.</li>
            <li> Really runny polish and not a bright pink at all.</li>
            <li> this color is one of those colors, neon pink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a shock of neon pink.</li>
            <li> You want this pink.</li>
            <li> : in the picture I put Gelish &amp;#34;Champagne&amp;#34; over the pink, there are no sparkles in the &amp;#34;Make</li>
            <li> A must have for any pink polish collector.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a neon pink color and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perky pink color (almost neon but not quite).</li>
            <li> Color was as expected!  </li>
            <li> I have had some trouble getting gelish to stay on as long as the salons do it</li>
            <li> The color liquid is extremely watery....</li>
            <li> It is not as dark.</li>
            <li> I tried shaking up the bottle for a few minutes and that did seem to help a little.</li>
            <li> It does take a few coats.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve been disappointed with a gelish color.</li>
            <li> I usually do</li>
            <li> You do have to soak off (or risk ripping a fingernail off) but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for not having to pay pro prices for a manicure</li>
            <li> Makes a very uneven coat..</li>
            <li> Hard to use.</li>
            <li> The sides of a couple nails are missing polish because of the thin consistency and the way it spreads when you paint it onto your nails.</li>
            <li> Thick in some parts, very thin in others.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> Looove this color! It&#x27;s a bright Barbie pink... I used three thin coats, there was no wrinkling, and a coat of Izzy Wizzy Let&#x27;s Get Busy to add that purple-ly pretty sparkle. Both colors are phenomenal and work great together (results in picture gallery). The item was shipped within two days and I had it on my nails on three. Perfect summer color!!</li>
            <li> I would give this color 10 stars if I could! This color is a true neon pink. I&#x27;ve been looking for this color in a gel polish for some time. It&#x27;s the kind of color when you go on a vacation to a popular beach destination and step into the beachwear shops and see bright neon colors....this color is one of those colors, neon pink. It took about 3 even coats for a finished look. Apply to much and it&#x27;ll crinkle. I absolutely love this color. I can easily say it&#x27;s my very top favorite right now! Can&#x27;t wait to receive the I&#x27;m Brighter Than You color from this line, which I hear is a neon peach.&lt;br /&gt;If you like bright or neon colors, you have to get this one!</li>
            <li> Bright but not as bright without a white base underneath. Chipping on two nails after a couple days but that might be due to my application as the other nails wore fine for almost two weeks until I took the color off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and item was new as described.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments on this color. Everyone was like I&#x27;m coming over ASAP! Thanks gelish for another great color.</li>
            <li> Perfectly pink this polish is great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color &amp; polish. It is a super fun bright pink! It lasted a full 2 weeks without any chips! I did use the Gelish Foundation with it. It took about 5 coats to achieve the opaqueness that I wanted.</li>
            <li> my go-to summer pink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a shock of neon pink. I was surprised how much I really like it. Despite being super pale, Irish, it worked with my coloring. Would probably look even better on tan tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You like bright? You want this pink.</li>
            <li> I got tons of compliment on this nail polish. It looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a neon pink that is true light pink without a coral cast and I have finally found one.  Again, Gelish is a great gel nail polish.  The quality is consistent with CND Shellac.  And they have a better range of colors than CND.  If you like to show off your fun side, this is one color to try.</li>
            <li> It was muchlighter than the color shows. Did not like at all .</li>
            <li> This color took several coats to get the nice bright pink shown in the sample.  I&#x27;ve never had to use more than two coats of Gellish polish to get a good coverage before this one.  This one took FOUR!</li>
            <li> I love this bright pink-almost fluorescent under the right lights.  Looks great with every skin tone. Goes on easy and looks great. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Color was as expected!  Very bright, brilliant and neon!!! I love this color!!!  The product exceeded my expectations for both color quality and coverage.</li>
            <li> Bright, fun, pink color. I have had some trouble getting gelish to stay on as long as the salons do it but it is still the best gel polish out there.</li>
            <li> This is very similar to oh cabana boy in orly.  It will take 2-3 coats to get the color you want.  It did go on smooth.  Good summer crazy kind of pink.  Neon bubble gum.</li>
            <li> A beautiful neon pink! Stays on for weeks if you know what you&#x27;re doing. I love gelish products.  Good quality stuff. FULL size bottle by the way! The minis are $15 at Sally&#x27;s Beauty!</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments when I wear this color.  Great for summer.  Love the Gelish line of products.</li>
            <li> Bright color that covers nicely in 2 coats, doesn&#x27;t run to the sides as some gel polishes do. My current manicure with Gelish polish has been on for close to 2 weeks and shows no chips or signs of wear. Great product at a reasonable price. I&#x27;m buying more colors!</li>
            <li> Hot Hot Hot pink, makes your nails pop, I get so many complements when I use this color, it is gorgeous.  Great for summertime.  I don&#x27;t mind using this color for 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gelish girl so far the best gel brand 2 coats and it is perfect hot pink the price was reasonable. I paid for the full bottle $8.99 I got lucky it was on sale ðŸ˜€ maybe in the future I&#x27;ll try OPI gel polish.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love gelish and have about 15 different colors. This is the first time I&#x27;ve been disappointed with a gelish color. The consistency of this polish is super thin and when you paint it on your nails it spreads out. It takes at least 3 coats to look decent. My nails usually look pretty good after doing the gelish but not with this color. The sides of a couple nails are missing polish because of the thin consistency and the way it spreads when you paint it onto your nails. The color is pretty and is a bright Barbie pink after about 3 coats. I tried shaking up the bottle for a few minutes and that did seem to help a little. I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this color.</li>
            <li> This is the best neon pink color! I got so many compliments on it and every time I looked down at my own hands I fell in love again! Perfect color for summer!</li>
            <li> Love this color. It&#x27;s translucent so it takes about 3 coats to get full coverage. I use it with my French mani. I only use one coat looks really nice.</li>
            <li> Had this color put on while at the nail salon. Loved it so much, I bought it for myself. Now I can take it with me to any salon and have them put it on. Looks great on fingers or toes. Very bright. Great summertime color!</li>
            <li> Applies smooth and good coverage. The color is bubblegum pink, perfect for summer. I get many compliments on this color. Also have used Waterfield over it to add some sparkle.</li>
            <li> The pink in the picture looks different than what actually goes on you hand. Its more of a pastel pink with a neon tint to it. Its beautiful though!! Might take 2 or 3 coats to fully cover the nail.</li>
            <li> Very summery, a little more of a neon pink than a medium pink as pictured, but I like the true color even better. Fast shipping and excellent polish!</li>
            <li> Bright peppy pink! Love it! Would buy another bottle when this one runs out! 2 coats is all it takes!</li>
            <li> GORGEOUS color! Very bright pink. Great summer color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: in the picture I put Gelish &amp;#34;Champagne&amp;#34; over the pink, there are no sparkles in the &amp;#34;Make You Blink Pink&amp;#34; color</li>
            <li> Very bright and summery color, love it!</li>
            <li> love this polish color - it is very very pink!  i wish it was more of a hot pink color but it still is gorgeous. pink tips are awesome</li>
            <li> A must have for any pink polish collector. Bright &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; pink that wears bright. I have heard the pinks fade, but since I just put it on yesterday I cannot say much on that fact. The picture, as usual, does not convey the true color of this pink. It is not as dark. Remember to check for swatches before buying!</li>
            <li> I received the polish really fast &amp; the polish is great!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, but I had wrinkling/bubbling, even with thinner coats. You need to make sure you are really using thin coats. I had to do 3 coats to get an opaque color. Other than that, this really is a beautiful color, it truly is a Barbie pink!</li>
            <li> The color liquid is extremely watery.... Spills over all over the place. Needs very thin and multiple layers to look nice</li>
            <li> Holy moly BRIGHT pink, but absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty pink. More like a cotton candy to me. I usually do about 2-3 coats and gelish always gets the job done. Great product.</li>
            <li> Flawless application. I did use three, thin coats, which is pretty standard for me. This is a gorgeous cream color. Must have for summer!</li>
            <li> This color is so bright.  I painted my granddaughter&#x27;s nails and she loved it!  It applied nicely on her hands with two coats, but her nail were short.  Will revisit when I do my own nails to see if a nail line is visible with two coats.</li>
            <li> The color is sassy and I get lots of compliments! Everything I was looking for and arrived quickly! Thank u!</li>
            <li> Really runny polish and not a bright pink at all. I was hoping for a neon pink color and after 4 coats of this thin polish it was at best a baby pink. Wish I would have took a photo - when I wear it again I will update with a photo.</li>
            <li> Super cute bubble gum pink color! Although, under the lamp on the polish bubbled up on a couple of my nails but after applying the top coat you couldn&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> Love this hot pink color! The consistency of the polish is normal and has held up over time. The perfect color for summer</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, very happy!! Color is a bit more neon than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> Horrible! This polish is so watery it wouldn&#x27;t even stay on my nail to cure it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Gelish color so far! It&#x27;s a perky pink color (almost neon but not quite). This was the first color that I&#x27;ve tried and I received many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice pink it is a true bright pink with a lavender undertone this is really a nice pink it also looks great with either Vegas Nights or Ambience glitter for that extra pop!</li>
            <li> Very bright pretty pink color. Was what I expected from others pictures and works great with my Gelish UV light and other Gelish nail prepping items.</li>
            <li> Such a cute color. Very pretty pink for summer!! Went on great with just two coats. Full size bottle should last a long time. Gelish is my new favorite nail polish. Can&#x27;t wait to use more shades!</li>
            <li> This was EXACTLY the color I was wanting.  Barbie pink, and it really pops!  9 times out of 10 Gelish does a great job and the color is as pictured, but this one was even better in real life.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Color is accurate to the picture, I&#x27;ve had great results with the gelish brand versus other cheaper off brand shellac. It stays on for weeks. You do have to soak off (or risk ripping a fingernail off) but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for not having to pay pro prices for a manicure</li>
            <li> Love the color, but I will put it on a little thicker next time or do 3 coats. It is still looking good though after 2 weeks of wear.&lt;br /&gt;No chipping or breaking nails.. It is very strong and durable. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping, beautiful color, just as described.</li>
            <li> This color is awesome!!! Super cute! I do always need to do 3 coats though, then it&#x27;s perfect! So not super great coverage..</li>
            <li> Love, love this color, it&#x27;s hot pink and beautiful. Takes 2-3 coats to get a streak free finish. My very favorite.</li>
            <li> I like this color, but.... It does take a few coats. I now use it over white. I will say its a bit blotchy. Not my favorite to apply.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing! It is bright and perfect for summer! The consistency of the polish is perfect. I was able to apply it without any issues!</li>
            <li> Awesome bright Barbie pink. I love it. Great summer color and good formula.  Need 3 coats to be opaque but no wrinkling and nice thin consistency. And Beauty Shine had it in my mailbox within 36 hours of order. Gotta love that.</li>
            <li> Hard to use. Thick in some parts, very thin in others. Makes a very uneven coat.. Pretty color but doesn&#x27;t look nice on at all!</li>
            <li> Pretty color, low star rating because it takes at least three layers to get the color true to what you see on the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color! It definitely takes three coats to get the deep, opaque pink, but it is a really nice color...it does fade a bit after a few days of wear, but even the faded color is gorgeous!</li>
