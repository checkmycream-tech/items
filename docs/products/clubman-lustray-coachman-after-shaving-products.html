            <li>In short, I am  a happy customer.</li>
            <li>They both smell great, but I feel they should have let pinaud alone to be different, then we would have a variety.</li>
            <li>The product smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>; aroma  - reminds me of the barbershops of the 1940s and the 1950&#x27;s when real barbers (not &amp;#34;hairstylists&amp;#34;) would give a man a good weekly haircut, and then massage in a manly aftershave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a virtual clone of  Clubman Eduard Pinaud in the funny shaped bottle with the picture of the man all dressed up wearing a top hat.</li>
            <li>Great old time aftershave and is very similiar to the original clubman fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet.</li>

            <li>Old barbershop in a bottle!</li>
            <li>Have purchased this product in the past and love it.</li>
            <li>I have an old time barber in town who uses the clubman Pinaud  in his shop and that is just about all you can smell while waiting for a haircut or shave.  </li>
            <li>it was slightly more floral and complex smelling than this coachman.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my 15 year old grandson who has eclectric retro tastes, he likes it and uses it.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the amygdala (memory) is located near the olfactory lobe in the brain.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time; Exactly as described, but not quite what I expected ... Smells like my Grandpa&#x27;s old barbershop cologne.  </li>
            <li>Since the aroma is strong, I only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like sweet things</li>
            <li>The problem with this order was no one made sure the bottle cap was tight how hard is that?</li>

            <li> I rec&#x27;vd this product wrapped very professionally &amp; no spillage concern was exercised.The product was shipped very fast.In short, I am  a happy customer.Their concern for my package exceeded my expectations.(that&#x27;s an understatement)I would strongly recommend this product &amp; these website(s) for future purchases.I&#x27;ve been using this product for 25 years .</li>
            <li> Great old time aftershave and is very similiar to the original clubman fragrance. Has a slight sting which is good and than a blast of menthol or eucalyptus alot like Osage Rub.  Than it mellows out quickly settles into that woodsy[ASIN:B00127YNPI Clubman After Shave Lotion 12.5 oz.]][[ASIN:B001711FMI Osage Rub 14oz]]y Pinault smell that you either love or hate.  Super price and the seller from the LA area was fast and professional.  Add it too your collection I sure did.</li>
            <li> This is not a clubman product..&lt;br /&gt;It is Lustray...&lt;br /&gt;Cap already broke.&lt;br /&gt;Smells fine I guess.</li>
            <li> THe scent I have been searching for for two years now.  Lavendar barvershop scent my dad used when he was alive and cutting hair.  Great smell</li>
            <li> This is great aftershave.  Like others have said, this is the quintessential USA barber shop smell.  I have an old time barber in town who uses the clubman Pinaud  in his shop and that is just about all you can smell while waiting for a haircut or shave.  Now here is the kicker, As of the time of this writing, I believe that this coachman is re-branded clubman pinaud sold slightly cheaper.  Currently, the ingredients list is identical for the two and I have for about a week used both side by side in smell and use tests and they are identical.  That was not always the case.  Earlier in the 2000s I bought a bottle of clubman pinaud and that formulation was slightly different--there was no treemoss in the ingred. list and it was slightly more floral and complex smelling than this coachman.  It appears, now, that treemoss has been added to pinaud and it changed the smell of pinaud to be the same as coachman.  They both smell great, but I feel they should have let pinaud alone to be different, then we would have a variety.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like anything else most people are familiar with so I can&#x27;t describe it in terms of &amp;#34;Something like Aqua Velva&amp;#34; etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a virtual clone of  Clubman Eduard Pinaud in the funny shaped bottle with the picture of the man all dressed up wearing a top hat. Except that this stuff is a lighter version of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad scent. Definitely something different. Has a bit of a &amp;#34;Sweet&amp;#34; smell to it. Literally. That&#x27;s not code for anything. It smells sweet. I usually don&#x27;t like sweet things but this has enough of an appeal to it that I use it in my rotation of after shaves</li>
            <li> I ran across this stuff years ago and loved it.  Got some more and yes, it has the aroma I liked.  Since the aroma is strong, I only need a small amount.  On a cotton ball in a saucer, it makes a decent room air sweetener.&lt;br /&gt;All in all good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;old time&amp;#34; aroma  - reminds me of the barbershops of the 1940s and the 1950&#x27;s when real barbers (not &amp;#34;hairstylists&amp;#34;) would give a man a good weekly haircut, and then massage in a manly aftershave. The Coachman aftershave is similar to, but a little lighter in depth, to the Clubman Pinaud aftershave.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling and easy on the pocket book.  Smells kind of like the original Clubman , but a little weaker. Doesn&#x27;t last as long either , so you can be liberal with application . Thumbs up .</li>
            <li> The product smells fantastic.  It&#x27;s a lighter version of Pinaud Clubman which has that classic barber shop fragrance.  The seller promised to deliver by April 01 but it arrived on the 3rd.  Upon opening the box a portion of the contents had already spilled out.  I would suggest taping the screw top cap to the bottle as well.</li>
            <li> fresh from the barber shop when you would sit in the reclining leather and Steal posted barber chairs. scent was everything i was looking for and very pleased with. will order again in the future and will also recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of scent it is almost identical to Pinaud Clubman but just a tad lighter. And for some reason when I use Clubman (which I have and rotate from time to time), it sometimes can give me minor allergy issues. Coachman doesn&#x27;t do that at all and it leaves my face I think more toned and feeling fresh and slightly less dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you love Pinaud Clubman like most men do, you will love Coachman.</li>
            <li> This product is sort of a throwback to my childhood days of going to the barbershop and seeing all the bottles on the shelves behind the barber. And on top of that it smells good!</li>
            <li> Got this for my 15 year old grandson who has eclectric retro tastes, he likes it and uses it.  Smells like you just walked out of the barbershop on Saturday morning in 1961.</li>
            <li> Smells good...a good deal, smells like Clubman..but has a softer lighter smell.  Fast shipping great price...nice handy plastic bottle and hole</li>
            <li> Old barbershop in a bottle! Hubby loves them all.</li>
            <li> I bought both this and the Clubman Pinaud aftershave.  I swear they smell identical, except that perhaps this one lasts a bit longer.  Nevertheless, the amygdala (memory) is located near the olfactory lobe in the brain.  The smell of either of these brings back some great old barber shop memories from what might be considered a better time.</li>
            <li> I love the mellow, kind of old fashioned, smell. Not over powering and it seems to hang around for most of the day. I specifically asked a lady I work with who is super-sentative to &amp;#34;perfume smells&amp;#34; and she said it does not bother her at all.</li>
            <li> As a Pinaud fan I like this one alot. It&#x27;s some what lighter maybe than the clubman which I really like so it&#x27;s a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time; Exactly as described, but not quite what I expected ... Smells like my Grandpa&#x27;s old barbershop cologne.  Definitely not what I wanted, was looking for a Bay Rum scent.</li>
            <li> A good aftershave. It adds some variety to my choice. Glad I got it.&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m thinking about it, sometimes I give 5 stars to products. The&lt;br /&gt; description of 5 reads &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;. Well, I don&#x27;t actually. I took advice&lt;br /&gt; from someone decades ago to &amp;#34;Never love something that can&#x27;t love&lt;br /&gt; you back.&amp;#34;I just happen to think those are extra good quality products&lt;br /&gt; for some reason or reasons.</li>
            <li> I like the smell. You can really feel the burn from the alcohol in the aftershave. Solid sized bottle. Only complaint is the shipping took a really long time.</li>
            <li> Strange stuff. May work for some.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s a traditional ole-timey barbershop scent, that never fails to please.  I&#x27;m working my way through the Lustray scents, and it has been a fun trip.  Lustray has found the perfect formula that makes their scents last, without overdoing it when you splash them on.  Coachman is one of my favs.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this product in the past and love it. The problem with this order was no one made sure the bottle cap was tight how hard is that? With that error on the shipper I lost over half product in the box will find another source on my next purchase.</li>
            <li> great product really happy</li>
