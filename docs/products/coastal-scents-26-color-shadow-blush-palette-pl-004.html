            <li>88 shimmer and matte palette are good too.</li>
            <li>I just wish there were some good lid or highlight shades in it.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a lot of shadows at home, this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li>The blushes are gorgeous too.</li>
            <li>Awesome quality for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>As soon as I saw this palette, I loved the shades.</li>
            <li>You do have to apply an eye primer because without it the shadows don&#x27;t look as good.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and they look great on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love all of the colors in this palette and was happy to add this to my collection.</li>

            <li>I love this palette!</li>

            <li>this palette is amazing.</li>
            <li>i loved it :)</li>
            <li>The good thing about this palette is the many color options.</li>
            <li>I own the shimmer 88 palette and the warm palette as well and just added this one to my collection.</li>
            <li>but I have seen so many good things about Coastal Scents that I wanted to try some out.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would be much better than a brand like ELF.</li>
            <li>I would have loved a couple lighter colors like a matte cream and a matte light tan.</li>
            <li>This is good for bronzey rosey looks, some colors are different on than what they look like, nonetheless very good product.</li>
            <li>I think blushes are also great the lightest color can be used as a powder and others for pretty blush.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best CS palettes I have, no dissapointment whatsoever..very pigmented and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I love to have many many options for my makeup</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this palette</li>
            <li>I LOVE this palette.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>I find that I use most of the shades for the crease, outer-v, and liner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably used the blushes in this palette more than anything.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>If you love neutral colors this palette is for you.</li>
            <li>I recommend this one the most out of all the palettes they have here on amazon :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Lovely to have in your beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li>Love this pallet.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these</li>
            <li>This is my favorite go to palette.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I love about this .</li>
            <li>and I love the variety.</li>
            <li>Love this palette.</li>
            <li>Be sure and check those out too.</li>
            <li>I love the colors in this palette.  </li>
            <li>The purple is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this product, the colors are mostly matte and the blushes as well, there are just a couple with a bit of glitter.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>Love this palette.</li>
            <li>My favorite is a shimmery taupe in the right bottom corner that even a 43-year-old can pull off (love, love, love this color for my crease and as a liner for my bottom lid)  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the palette is really wonderful.</li>
            <li>Also the rose colored blush is the most powdery of them all it even cracked a bit upon delivery not too much though.</li>
            <li>I just received the product last night and the colors are beautiful.  </li>
            <li>the pallet itself is fine and pigmented but</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t your typical neutrals where all you get is browns, it has some great shimmery fun and bright colors.</li>
            <li>I typically only go for the more natural looking colors and all of these are perfect!</li>
            <li>Fantastic palette.</li>
            <li>I do recommend for women of color that you have to blend the light colors with the correct undertones for it to shine.</li>
            <li>also ordered both the Revealed palettes and they are really great especially the Revealed 2 palette.</li>
            <li>Like many coastal scents fans, this is my second time buying one of their gorgeous palettes.</li>
            <li>This was my intro into Coastal Scents palettes and I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>The shadows and blushes are fairly pigmented; however, the eyeshadows, especially the brown shades, tend to be somewhat chalky and don&#x27;t apply as smoothly as I would like.  </li>
            <li>Even if you tap out the excess before you apply it on your eyelid, you&#x27;ll get eyeshadow under yours eyes and probably have to clean up your face afterwards, for a clean finish.</li>
            <li>I liked the 88 warm palette as well, but not nearly as much as this one.  </li>
            <li>Colors are great, and some say it&#x27;s too small, but honestly girls rarely ever use all of their shadows.</li>
            <li>Color goes on true.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s good product.</li>
            <li>This is my first palette from Coastal Scents and the one that appealed to me the most at first.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I have that color on another palette.</li>
            <li>I love it and love the different shades of blushes that match the eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>the colors are very pretty</li>
            <li>This palette was my very first purchase in makeup.</li>
            <li>The palette is a reasonable size and is easily transported during trips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally a high end kind of makeup gal and normally use brands like Urband Decay and Too Faced</li>
            <li>So some ppl might be overwhelmed with BRIGHT RED eye shadow, and BRIGHT GREEN e/s.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented so use with a light hand.    </li>
            <li>I own the shimmery version 88 shadows and wanted something matt and something that can be used as a highlighter at the same time.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows have different finishes--matte and shimmery, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I ordered both this and the 88 warm palette recently.  </li>
            <li>It(88 warm) does have some greenish and bluish colors that this lacks, as well as silvers and lighter highlight colors, however If I had to pick just one it would definitely be the 26 Color Shadow Blush Combo Palette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much fun to play with.</li>
            <li>Out of all my coastal scents palettes this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Planning to buy some more other palettes from coastal scents :))</li>
            <li>The packaging was just right and the shipment was very fast.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite coastal scents palette thus far.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how easily they applied.</li>
            <li>I honestly use this palette every single day.  </li>
            <li>And the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOOOOVE this palette!</li>
            <li>Packaged very well!</li>
            <li>Very pigmented!</li>
            <li>The colors will look exactly like they look like on the picture.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast and colors are very Vibrant.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dark skinned and all these colors look amazing.</li>
            <li>Very nice pigmented colors that  are still subtle.</li>
            <li>I am African American and was a little hesitant about the many choices but majority of them work great.</li>
            <li>my favorite is the pretty pink color the 1st row 4th color.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with and the color last all day.</li>
            <li>I just received the make up today, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It really makes a world of difference.  </li>
            <li>i really recomended</li>
            <li>I really like this palette.</li>
            <li>The order was shipped in a very timely and prompt manner (which I appreciate).  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>These colors show up very well.</li>
            <li>They were very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These shadows/blushes are really pigmented.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy, classic.</li>
            <li>Very nice for formal everyday looks or occasional too.</li>
            <li>But for the variety of warm fall shades you get and a few decent blushes along with it</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are long lasting ( about 8-10 hours if worn on top of primer) and the blushes are actually really pretty as well.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main downside of this palette.  </li>
            <li>and these came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d HIGHLY suggest this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone into makeup</li>
            <li>High pigments&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to someone who likes natural looking colors and wants some shimmer, some matte.</li>
            <li>This has a few basic selections for a reasonable price, but don&#x27;t expect amazing quality.</li>
            <li>Seems to have good pigments, arrived on time and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li>The product is nicely pigmented, the only down fall was that one of the eye shadows broke into a thousand pieces.</li>
            <li>The blushes are all matte except one (2nd from right)  </li>
            <li>On some of the very light colors, I dipped my brush just slightly in a drop of water and then used the colors which actually worked out really well.</li>
            <li>Not cheap, lasts long, creating colors, love it and worth it</li>
            <li>I had to write a review on my new Coastal Scents palette.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This is my first Coastal Scents purchase and will not be my last.    </li>
            <li>They seem to be a fairly high quality of powders that last well without being too much.</li>
            <li>I was wrong, this palette is not only beautiful in the shades</li>
            <li>It is a little on the cheap side</li>
            <li>Many dupes and some hard to find colors as well.</li>
            <li>There are several colors in this that I absolutely adore -</li>
            <li>I will probably repurchase directly from the company.</li>
            <li>They are a bit darker in person but not too far off from the picture.</li>
            <li>So far no compaints.</li>
            <li>Colors are muted and soft.</li>
            <li>The blushes are gorgeous, a few of the eye shadows and a few of the blushes have flex in them, which provides shimmer.</li>
            <li>I have brown hair and green eyes and find these colors very complimentary.  </li>
            <li>The reason I got this palette was due to the reviews, and yes they were right</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s not surprising that I love these eyeshadows/blushes.  </li>
            <li>It is a combination of shimmer and matte neutral colors for all types of skin tone including few gold, orange, peach and purple shades.&lt;br /&gt;For full review and Pictures and swatches</li>
            <li>Yet, I take back one star back since the powder sometimes gets into my eyes too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very wearable neutral palette with pops of color such as purple, peach, and copper, along with your standard browns.  </li>
            <li>First of all, to get the most of these eyeshadows I highly recommend an eyeshadow base.  </li>
            <li>Also, shipping was very fast--I received this in less than a week.</li>
            <li>The blushes are also pretty, although I&#x27;m not sure how I would wear the pale pink shade to the very left or the deep plum shade to the very right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented even without a little eye primer..</li>
            <li>For the same reason, the palette also gets dirty very quickly and it&#x27;s a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>The berry color blush on the bottom end is really pretty, and a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> This is good for bronzey rosey looks, some colors are different on than what they look like, nonetheless very good product.</li>
            <li> I think blushes are also great the lightest color can be used as a powder and others for pretty blush.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best CS palettes I have, no dissapointment whatsoever..very pigmented and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love to have many many options for my makeup</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this palette</li>
            <li> I LOVE this palette.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I find that I use most of the shades for the crease, outer-v, and liner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably used the blushes in this palette more than anything.</li>
            <li> but I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> If you love neutral colors this palette is for you.</li>
            <li> I recommend this one the most out of all the palettes they have here on amazon :)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Lovely to have in your beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> Love this pallet.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of these</li>
            <li> This is my favorite go to palette.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I love about this .</li>
            <li> and I love the variety.</li>
            <li> Love this palette.</li>
            <li> Be sure and check those out too.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this palette.  </li>
            <li> The purple is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the colors are mostly matte and the blushes as well, there are just a couple with a bit of glitter.</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> Love this palette.</li>
            <li> My favorite is a shimmery taupe in the right bottom corner that even a 43-year-old can pull off (love, love, love this color for my crease and as a liner for my bottom lid)  </li>
            <li> Other than that, the palette is really wonderful.</li>
            <li> Also the rose colored blush is the most powdery of them all it even cracked a bit upon delivery not too much though.</li>
            <li> I just received the product last night and the colors are beautiful.  </li>
            <li> the pallet itself is fine and pigmented but</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t your typical neutrals where all you get is browns, it has some great shimmery fun and bright colors.</li>
            <li> I typically only go for the more natural looking colors and all of these are perfect!</li>
            <li> Fantastic palette.</li>
            <li> I do recommend for women of color that you have to blend the light colors with the correct undertones for it to shine.</li>
            <li> also ordered both the Revealed palettes and they are really great especially the Revealed 2 palette.</li>
            <li> Like many coastal scents fans, this is my second time buying one of their gorgeous palettes.</li>
            <li> This was my intro into Coastal Scents palettes and I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The shadows and blushes are fairly pigmented; however, the eyeshadows, especially the brown shades, tend to be somewhat chalky and don&#x27;t apply as smoothly as I would like.  </li>
            <li> Even if you tap out the excess before you apply it on your eyelid, you&#x27;ll get eyeshadow under yours eyes and probably have to clean up your face afterwards, for a clean finish.</li>
            <li> I liked the 88 warm palette as well, but not nearly as much as this one.  </li>
            <li> Colors are great, and some say it&#x27;s too small, but honestly girls rarely ever use all of their shadows.</li>
            <li> Color goes on true.</li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s good product.</li>
            <li> This is my first palette from Coastal Scents and the one that appealed to me the most at first.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I have that color on another palette.</li>
            <li> I love it and love the different shades of blushes that match the eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> the colors are very pretty</li>
            <li> This palette was my very first purchase in makeup.</li>
            <li> The palette is a reasonable size and is easily transported during trips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a high end kind of makeup gal and normally use brands like Urband Decay and Too Faced</li>
            <li> So some ppl might be overwhelmed with BRIGHT RED eye shadow, and BRIGHT GREEN e/s.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented so use with a light hand.    </li>
            <li> I own the shimmery version 88 shadows and wanted something matt and something that can be used as a highlighter at the same time.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows have different finishes--matte and shimmery, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> I ordered both this and the 88 warm palette recently.  </li>
            <li> It(88 warm) does have some greenish and bluish colors that this lacks, as well as silvers and lighter highlight colors, however If I had to pick just one it would definitely be the 26 Color Shadow Blush Combo Palette.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much fun to play with.</li>
            <li> Out of all my coastal scents palettes this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Planning to buy some more other palettes from coastal scents :))</li>
            <li> The packaging was just right and the shipment was very fast.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite coastal scents palette thus far.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how easily they applied.</li>
            <li> I honestly use this palette every single day.  </li>
            <li> And the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOOOOVE this palette!</li>
            <li> Packaged very well!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented!</li>
            <li> The colors will look exactly like they look like on the picture.</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast and colors are very Vibrant.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skinned and all these colors look amazing.</li>
            <li> Very nice pigmented colors that  are still subtle.</li>
            <li> I am African American and was a little hesitant about the many choices but majority of them work great.</li>
            <li> my favorite is the pretty pink color the 1st row 4th color.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with and the color last all day.</li>
            <li> I just received the make up today, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It really makes a world of difference.  </li>
            <li> i really recomended</li>
            <li> I really like this palette.</li>
            <li> The order was shipped in a very timely and prompt manner (which I appreciate).  </li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> These colors show up very well.</li>
            <li> They were very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These shadows/blushes are really pigmented.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy, classic.</li>
            <li> Very nice for formal everyday looks or occasional too.</li>
            <li> But for the variety of warm fall shades you get and a few decent blushes along with it</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are long lasting ( about 8-10 hours if worn on top of primer) and the blushes are actually really pretty as well.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the main downside of this palette.  </li>
            <li> and these came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d HIGHLY suggest this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone into makeup</li>
            <li> High pigments&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to someone who likes natural looking colors and wants some shimmer, some matte.</li>
            <li> This has a few basic selections for a reasonable price, but don&#x27;t expect amazing quality.</li>
            <li> Seems to have good pigments, arrived on time and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> The product is nicely pigmented, the only down fall was that one of the eye shadows broke into a thousand pieces.</li>
            <li> The blushes are all matte except one (2nd from right)  </li>
            <li> On some of the very light colors, I dipped my brush just slightly in a drop of water and then used the colors which actually worked out really well.</li>
            <li> Not cheap, lasts long, creating colors, love it and worth it</li>
            <li> I had to write a review on my new Coastal Scents palette.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> This is my first Coastal Scents purchase and will not be my last.    </li>
            <li> They seem to be a fairly high quality of powders that last well without being too much.</li>
            <li> I was wrong, this palette is not only beautiful in the shades</li>
            <li> It is a little on the cheap side</li>
            <li> Many dupes and some hard to find colors as well.</li>
            <li> There are several colors in this that I absolutely adore -</li>
            <li> I will probably repurchase directly from the company.</li>
            <li> They are a bit darker in person but not too far off from the picture.</li>
            <li> So far no compaints.</li>
            <li> Colors are muted and soft.</li>
            <li> The blushes are gorgeous, a few of the eye shadows and a few of the blushes have flex in them, which provides shimmer.</li>
            <li> I have brown hair and green eyes and find these colors very complimentary.  </li>
            <li> The reason I got this palette was due to the reviews, and yes they were right</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not surprising that I love these eyeshadows/blushes.  </li>
            <li> It is a combination of shimmer and matte neutral colors for all types of skin tone including few gold, orange, peach and purple shades.&lt;br /&gt;For full review and Pictures and swatches</li>
            <li> Yet, I take back one star back since the powder sometimes gets into my eyes too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very wearable neutral palette with pops of color such as purple, peach, and copper, along with your standard browns.  </li>
            <li> First of all, to get the most of these eyeshadows I highly recommend an eyeshadow base.  </li>
            <li> Also, shipping was very fast--I received this in less than a week.</li>
            <li> The blushes are also pretty, although I&#x27;m not sure how I would wear the pale pink shade to the very left or the deep plum shade to the very right.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented even without a little eye primer..</li>
            <li> For the same reason, the palette also gets dirty very quickly and it&#x27;s a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> The berry color blush on the bottom end is really pretty, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this palette for a wedding and with a base the colors stayed all day and the middle blush is very pretty!!!!</li>
            <li> the way they packed up this pallet was sad and I&#x27;m lucky it was only one.</li>
            <li> a little lighter, almost white</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> If you want the dark brown smokey eye that&#x27;s what you will apply to your eye.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment and have fun if it&#x27;s not working for you all you have to do is take it off.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s messy and crumbly.</li>
            <li> The do leave a bit of fallout , so apply in small amounts at a time.</li>
            <li> Not good if your looking for nudes or dark browns as like I said they r bronzey rosey and plums.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in the palette but the pigmentation is awful.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with makeup lately</li>
            <li> The only thing bad I can say is that there is not a brow highlight color.</li>
            <li> the flimsy package and case itself left a bad taste in my mouth I guess.</li>
            <li> However, the shimmer isn&#x27;t overbearing or over-the-top dramatic.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> one of my shadows were broken!!</li>
            <li> I am often disappointed when I buy shadows</li>
            <li> and I used a base eyeshadow (like Maybelline Color Tatoos).&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it smells HORRIBLE.</li>

            <li> Like many coastal scents fans, this is my second time buying one of their gorgeous palettes. I own the shimmery version 88 shadows and wanted something matt and something that can be used as a highlighter at the same time. This one can def cover everything. Colors are great, and some say it&#x27;s too small, but honestly girls rarely ever use all of their shadows. I think blushes are also great the lightest color can be used as a powder and others for pretty blush. I love to have many many options for my makeup and this will be my ultimate makeup set! Yet, I take back one star back since the powder sometimes gets into my eyes too much. However, for the money I paid, this is like beyond nice!! Go get one!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received the make up today, and I really like it. Seems to have good pigments, arrived on time and nothing was broken. So yes I am happy.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this palette.  This is my first palette from Coastal Scents and the one that appealed to me the most at first.

            <li> I am so in love with this palette the eyeshadows are gorgeous in person my favorite is the pretty pink color the 1st row 4th color. The packaging was just right and the shipment was very fast. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> A good Fall palette. This was my intro into Coastal Scents palettes and I&#x27;m not disappointed.  Colors are pigmented.  The berry color blush on the bottom end is really pretty, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I ordered both this and the 88 warm palette recently.  I have been experimenting with makeup lately (mid-life crisis, I guess!) and these came highly recommended.  First of all, to get the most of these eyeshadows I highly recommend an eyeshadow base.  It really makes a world of difference.  Also, You Tube has a lot of great reviews and swatches of all of the Coastal Scents products.  That said, this is an incredibly beautiful palette!  The colors are in the gold/peach/brown/purple family... some with shimmer (NOT sparkle!) and some matte.  There are several colors in this that I absolutely adore - My favorite is a shimmery taupe in the right bottom corner that even a 43-year-old can pull off (love, love, love this color for my crease and as a liner for my bottom lid)  The blushes are all matte except one (2nd from right)  I honestly use this palette every single day.  I liked the 88 warm palette as well, but not nearly as much as this one.  It(88 warm) does have some greenish and bluish colors that this lacks, as well as silvers and lighter highlight colors, however If I had to pick just one it would definitely be the 26 Color Shadow Blush Combo Palette.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this palette. I have the 88 shimmer and the 88 matte pallette&#x27;s and I like them. BUT.... THIS PALETTE?!?! I LOOOOOOOOOOVE. it&#x27;s the perfect colors. highly pigmented. Great palette. I&#x27;d HIGHLY suggest this palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 88 shimmer and matte palette are good too. You just have to know how to blend colors to create the look you want. So some ppl might be overwhelmed with BRIGHT RED eye shadow, and BRIGHT GREEN e/s. So... if you don&#x27;t want to worry about mixing your e/s colors to create a the color you want, I&#x27;d get this palette. FAVE!</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best CS palettes I have, no dissapointment whatsoever..very pigmented and easy to apply.Two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are generously pigmented without appearing chalky. The blushes are gorgeous, a few of the eye shadows and a few of the blushes have flex in them, which provides shimmer. However, the shimmer isn&#x27;t overbearing or over-the-top dramatic. The palette is a reasonable size and is easily transported during trips.</li>
            <li> I got the CS 26 palette and I love it! I also got the 88 palette but this one is a must have. the colors go on great. The reason I got this palette was due to the reviews, and yes they were right, this is a five star product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOOOOVE this palette! It&#x27;s so much fun to play with. I&#x27;m dark skinned and all these colors look amazing. Love it, love it, love it. And the price? WOW! That&#x27;s what I pay at the mall for one or two shades.</li>
            <li> This is a great pallet of colors. I have brown hair and green eyes and find these colors very complimentary.  They seem to be a fairly high quality of powders that last well without being too much. I feel it is an excellent value.</li>
            <li> Product smells horrible-like it is expired, I will be returning to amazon. The colors and pigmentation are great-but it smells HORRIBLE. I will probably repurchase directly from the company.</li>
            <li> i totally lovee this palett!! the colors are very pretty and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot for the blush or eyeshadows to show! i really recomended i loved it :)</li>
            <li> I really like this palette. It has a lot of great fall colors in it, but there are also a couple brights in there. I just wish there were some good lid or highlight shades in it. I find that I use most of the shades for the crease, outer-v, and liner. The blushes are really great, though. I&#x27;ve probably used the blushes in this palette more than anything.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. The colors are gorgeous! And the shipping was very fast. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This palette was my very first purchase in makeup. I was worried a bit but I am glad I bought this. Its awesome combination of both matte and shimmers. Very nice for formal everyday looks or occasional too. Planning to buy some more other palettes from coastal scents :))</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh- this palette is amazing. The colors are BEAUTIFUL. I typically only go for the more natural looking colors and all of these are perfect! They are a bit darker in person but not too far off from the picture. I would suggest using eye primer before applying. On some of the very light colors, I dipped my brush just slightly in a drop of water and then used the colors which actually worked out really well. I haven&#x27;t used the blushes yet (I didn&#x27;t buy this product based on the blushes) but on one of my days off, I might try one or two of them. This is my first Coastal Scents purchase and will not be my last.    When shipment arrived, it was bubble wrapped three times around the product. I was a bit worried that it wasn&#x27;t enough but I opened it up and nothing inside was damaged.     I would recommend this product to someone who likes natural looking colors and wants some shimmer, some matte.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!! I just received the product last night and the colors are beautiful.  The order was shipped in a very timely and prompt manner (which I appreciate).  The colors are very pigmented so use with a light hand.    The only thing I wished is that the case came with a mirror. I will be ordering this again in the future and also going to order the 88 palette as well.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well! and colors are awesome</li>
            <li> The good thing about this palette is the many color options. The eyeshadows are long lasting ( about 8-10 hours if worn on top of primer) and the blushes are actually really pretty as well. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the color falls off a lot. Even if you tap out the excess before you apply it on your eyelid, you&#x27;ll get eyeshadow under yours eyes and probably have to clean up your face afterwards, for a clean finish. For the same reason, the palette also gets dirty very quickly and it&#x27;s a mess to clean up. If you don&#x27;t have a lot of shadows at home, this is a good place to start. This has a few basic selections for a reasonable price, but don&#x27;t expect amazing quality.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite coastal scents palette thus far. I own the shimmer 88 palette and the warm palette as well and just added this one to my collection. I love this palette! It has the perfect combination of shimmer and matte colors. If you love neutral colors this palette is for you. It isn&#x27;t your typical neutrals where all you get is browns, it has some great shimmery fun and bright colors. The blushes are gorgeous too. I use some of the e/s for blushes or contouring and vice versa. Out of all my coastal scents palettes this one is by far my favorite. However I do find some of the e/s to be powdery when swiped with a brush but not when applied. Also the rose colored blush is the most powdery of them all it even cracked a bit upon delivery not too much though. I recommend this one the most out of all the palettes they have here on amazon :)</li>
            <li> Bought the palette for a reddish brown maybe a  mac saddle dupe buti love all the colors! Very pigmented! I used this palette for a wedding and with a base the colors stayed all day and the middle blush is very pretty!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this pallet and I love it. It&#x27;s very pigmented even without a little eye primer.. I highly recommend to anyone into makeup</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not surprising that I love these eyeshadows/blushes.  Great pigment and colors. Great price.  Thinking of buying some for christmas gifts in fact.  Lovely to have in your beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> Love this pallet. Very pigmented. The color lasts all day with a primer. Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> great for darker skin</li>
            <li> this pallette is wonderful eyes and blushes excellent quality and pigmentation is everything you could ask for in a single box love to travel</li>
            <li> Girlfriend likes it and she uses it all the time. So far no compaints. Great for the price. Will Recommend.</li>
            <li> GREAT colors in this palette. Many dupes and some hard to find colors as well. Easy to work with and the color last all day. GREAT gift!</li>
            <li> The product is nicely pigmented, the only down fall was that one of the eye shadows broke into a thousand pieces. Luckily, I have that color on another palette. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This palette includes all of the colors found in in shin tones. whether you are porcelin white or the darkest brow\n and anything in between.  I will be buying more of these</li>
            <li> Not cheap, lasts long, creating colors, love it and worth it</li>
            <li> I didnt try them on yet but I noticed a bit diffrence in the colors but its ok coz they still look beautiful !</li>
            <li> This is my favorite go to palette. The colors will look exactly like they look like on the picture. I thought maybe the eyeshadows would look a bit softer when applying but I was wrong. That&#x27;s what I love about this . If you want the dark brown smokey eye that&#x27;s what you will apply to your eye. I am often disappointed when I buy shadows and they look a lot lighter when applied this isn&#x27;t one of them. They also last all day. Blush also have beautiful colors . Fantastic palette.</li>
            <li> This blush set is great. I always get complements on my makeup and I love the variety. I am African American and was a little hesitant about the many choices but majority of them work great. I do recommend for women of color that you have to blend the light colors with the correct undertones for it to shine. Don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment and have fun if it&#x27;s not working for you all you have to do is take it off. Also, if you need tips on how to apply makeup go to YouTube and find a tutorial.</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time and as expected. I love the colors and they look great on my skin. Money well spent!</li>
            <li> Awesome quality for a cheap price. I gave one to my mom and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Love this palette. Delivery was super fast and colors are very Vibrant.</li>
            <li> Color last a all night, quality pigments. These colors show up very well.</li>
            <li> I had to write a review on my new Coastal Scents palette. I&#x27;m normally a high end kind of makeup gal and normally use brands like Urband Decay and Too Faced but I have seen so many good things about Coastal Scents that I wanted to try some out. As soon as I saw this palette, I loved the shades. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would be much better than a brand like ELF. I was wrong, this palette is not only beautiful in the shades but they applied beautifully. The eyeshadows and blushes weren&#x27;t chalky or powdery but applied like a dream and blended beautifully. I was surprised at how easily they applied. I didn&#x27;t have to build them up at all. They were very pigmented. I do use eyeshadow primer and I used a base eyeshadow (like Maybelline Color Tatoos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shades in the this palette are beautiful. They are all warmer, fall-like shades in pinks, burgandys and browns. The only thing bad I can say is that there is not a brow highlight color. I would have loved a couple lighter colors like a matte cream and a matte light tan. Other than that, the palette is really wonderful. I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered both the Revealed palettes and they are really great especially the Revealed 2 palette. Be sure and check those out too.</li>
            <li> These shadows/blushes are really pigmented. The do leave a bit of fallout , so apply in small amounts at a time. The nice thing about it is that these are neutral, perfect for wedding looks and they also suite a variety of skin tones. Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> This item was in excellent condition. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this palette.  The purple is my favorite. I wish it had one shade a little lighter, almost white but I&#x27;m using a different palette for the color. Color goes on true.</li>
            <li> This palette has amazing color payoff!! This is good for bronzey rosey looks, some colors are different on than what they look like, nonetheless very good product. Not good if your looking for nudes or dark browns as like I said they r bronzey rosey and plums.</li>
            <li> It is the 26 Shadow Blush (21+5) combo Palette. To sum it up, I am loving this palette!  It is a combination of shimmer and matte neutral colors for all types of skin tone including few gold, orange, peach and purple shades.&lt;br /&gt;For full review and Pictures and swatches please visit: [...](copy and paste this on your address bar) or visit [...]</li>
            <li> Loved it! Very nice pigmented colors that  are still subtle. Lots to play with.</li>
            <li> one of my shadows were broken!! the way they packed up this pallet was sad and I&#x27;m lucky it was only one. the pallet itself is fine and pigmented but the flimsy package and case itself left a bad taste in my mouth I guess.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in the palette but the pigmentation is awful. I have to pack it on and it&#x27;s messy and crumbly.</li>
            <li> High pigments&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> I love this product, the colors are mostly matte and the blushes as well, there are just a couple with a bit of glitter. You do have to apply an eye primer because without it the shadows don&#x27;t look as good. It is a little on the cheap side but overall it&#x27;s good product.</li>
            <li> Love love love. Some shadows aren&#x27;t as pigmented as you would expect them to be but the blushes are spot on! You can create a lot of different looks with this palette.</li>
            <li> I love all of the colors in this palette and was happy to add this to my collection. I need to start using this palette soon.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy, classic.</li>
            <li> Love this palette. Colors are muted and soft. Great quality.</li>
            <li> every day!!!  I love it and love the different shades of blushes that match the eyeshadows. Perfect palette for me</li>
