            <li>this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Works great on my curly hair.</li>
            <li>But this product makes my hair look and feel great, even after using it for weeks on end.</li>
            <li>My curls look great.</li>
            <li>Not so with this product - it does a great job cleansing and does not leave any buildup.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo that you don&#x27;t have to use conditioner with.</li>
            <li>and you will be happy with the results.</li>
            <li>how happy I was when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>what because there is no way anyone could say what I got smelled great.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I like this product, great for wavy curly course hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great afterwards.</li>
            <li>this product is great.</li>
            <li>I co-cleanse with this product and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It made my curl hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However I will keep buying this for sure!!</li>
            <li>To top it off, the product smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li>Like I said, my hair was curling very nicely, but what good is that</li>
            <li>my hair looks very good and is more manageable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to follow up with any sort of leave-in product of any kind in order for my hair to look great.  </li>
            <li>so I have to use a good amount to get all the oil off of my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>It is supposed that if you use a good amount of the product it will work, well no at all .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, this is a good cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This is the best sulfate free cleanser with conditioner for curly hair out there.</li>
            <li>This cleansing conditioner seems to be good for the job.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good as Wen, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I did like this product and the service was good.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverCurl Cleansing Conditioner is every bit as good as WEN.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning you hair without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner smells a bit chemically when in the bottle, but once it&#x27;s in your hair it smells soo good and the smell lasts for days.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use shampoo every time I wash my hair, so I loved that L&#x27;Oreal introduced a cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The price is good.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE this shampoo!!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love the manageability of my hair!</li>
            <li>The fact that I can use this one product and not still need a palm full of conditioner is incredible.  </li>
            <li>I now love having it in my hair!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>This is a much better buy!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this cleanser!  </li>
            <li>But the end of the hair is ok!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>and for that matter I will make sure I repurchase this again!</li>
            <li>This works great for my brittle, fine, curly hair that I wash about once a week.</li>
            <li>I use this in place of any \\&quot;normal\\&quot; conditioner and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten feedback from my wife that it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This product gives my hair amazing bounce and shine.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well</li>
            <li>Defeats the purpose kind of?</li>
            <li>and I really liked...</li>
            <li>Kind of like WEN.</li>
            <li>and i did see better results health wise</li>
            <li>My scalp felt clean and my hair smelled great afterwards.</li>
            <li>Smells great and hair feels clean but moist</li>
            <li>It smells great, gets my hair clean, and with every-other-day use, keeps the frizz to a minimum.  </li>
            <li>This product does a great job of detangling super curly hair.</li>
            <li>find that it does a pretty good job cleansing!  </li>
            <li>I get the best natural wavy hair I&#x27;ve ever had without having to use hairspray.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
            <li>I picked this up because I liked the way it smelled and have been in love ever since.</li>
            <li>, I honestly like wen so much better, but I cant afford wen thats why I had been looking for something cheaper and works like wen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use the loreal gel cream too which has a nice scent and helps give the curls more holding power.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and curly.</li>
            <li>(was finally \\&quot;worth it\\&quot;) and mostly have been happy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and has a very pleasant, milk smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and shipped fast!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very light sent</li>
            <li>The price is right and the smell is nice too!</li>
            <li>Did mention it smells lovely, lots of compliments</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>Works great as a cleansing conditioner, not so much for hydrating.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more moisturizing</li>
            <li>BUT it&#x27;s better than Wen</li>
            <li>also love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>Co-washing has been a big help in taming the frizz and creating beautiful curls!</li>
            <li>I like this better than the wen knockoff</li>
            <li>This made my hair so healthy and curly that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day anymore to keep the curl.</li>
            <li>So healthy.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Smell could be better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell and my hair still gets frizzy.</li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans better than the cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>This cleansing conditioner is OK on curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It is better than the L&#x27;Oreal Moisture System Cleansing Conditioner as it does not leave a greasy film in my hair like that one did.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you rinse well.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>most days it comes out</li>
            <li>frizzy, poofy, curly in some spots, wavy in others, but with this cleansing conditioner there&#x27;s more structure to my curls.</li>
            <li>If you like chemicals, you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li>and it was okay</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I would say I don&#x27;t use any more water than I did to thoroughly rinse shampoo</li>
            <li>The product worked ok</li>
            <li>I have curly hair (3b or 3c type), and this product is ok, but not my favorite cleansing conditioner, beacuase</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SOOOOO glad it&#x27;s not being discontinued.</li>
            <li>Sides which won&#x27;t cooperate fully, &amp; the back is perfect with curls that form on</li>
            <li>I love ever curl shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>my hair is softer and doesn&#x27;t  look bushy any more.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling great!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t say this is better than wen</li>
            <li>wish it made my scalp refreshing like wen does, if so it can become better than wen for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the cleansing conditioners are a great discovery and really good overall for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, make sure you rinse it all the way out</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It works great, but has a really displeasing odor.</li>
            <li>Works even better when you combine it with the ever curl leave in conditioner cream.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for my curly hair!</li>
            <li>I have to use more</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for something better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that you can wash your hair and not have to use products that have sulfates and soap up.  </li>
            <li>Better than some I have tried.</li>
            <li>It gets hair clean without removing good oils, my hair feels smooth and hydrated and manageable after use.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good first try, but L&#x27;Oreal could do better and eliminate some of the more drying (and silicone based) chemicals from their line for us Curly girls.</li>
            <li>Washed one time and my scalp didn&#x27;t feel clean and was kind of itchy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d leave it in for 5 minutes or so, rinse it out, and then do another 7-8 pumps to make sure my hair gets really clean!</li>
            <li>My girls with super curly hair love it!</li>
            <li>I rated this as just okay because it didn&#x27;t work for my fine, wavey-curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy that Amazon.com offers it.</li>
            <li>sure how they can advertise this as sulfate free.  ??</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone with naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is good because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it leaves build up and allows my curls to really shine.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair clean, soft and with beautiful curls</li>
            <li>yet easily can be straightened...</li>
            <li>It gets oily easily</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get the satisfying lather, but when you rinse it out you can tell it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see what it&#x27;s all about: it doesn&#x27;t feel silky like a conditioner, and it doesn&#x27;t cleanse easily like a shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am used to shampoos/conditioners being emollient and spreading easily through the hair.  </li>
            <li>You use a good number of pumps (starting at the ends of your hair and working up to your scalp), putting the cleanser on your hair and kind of massaging it into the strands.  </li>
            <li>It would earn five stars if it were not for the strong odor.</li>
            <li>hear people complaining that it smells strong but trust me</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>TOO STRONGLY SCENTED.</li>
            <li>When I first apply the cleanser, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing much, but after it&#x27;s soaked in there, all of the products come out, and my hair feels great.  </li>
            <li>Its fine.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy/curly and fine, but I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Smells fine to me.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair that shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great until the next day, when my hair is frizzy and brittle and I have to start all over.  </li>
            <li>Great for removing build up and overall freshening hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of almond essence on Amazon and add a couple of drops to the bottle, which makes it fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is great</li>
            <li>I great price just wish the bottle was bigger 😀</li>
            <li>Hope you have the same great results......</li>
            <li>I have curly hair, and nothing was getting it to unfrizz and stay calm plus look really healthy.  </li>
            <li>This stuff leaves my hair light</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think why it&#x27;s no longer available in drug stores.</li>
            <li>The best product to get the most curl and least frizz.</li>
            <li>The trick is to make sure your hair is good and wet and it&#x27;ll smooth through it easily.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t seem to have to use as much, so there is a pretty good savings.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite was to &#x27;wash&#x27; my curls!</li>
            <li>and it feels really rich.  </li>
            <li>I had been cowashing with the normal Tresemme conditioner meant for curly hair, and I think they were kind of competing or something.</li>
            <li>The first time my hair came out fantastic!  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought the smell was okay.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp felt clean and I WILL purchase again.</li>
            <li>The perfect inexpensive CoWash for natural ladies following the Curly Girl (CG) method.</li>
            <li>It takes a LOT of this conditioner to clean hair because it doesn&#x27;t lather - at all.  </li>
            <li>I think this stuff works well to clean my curly hair as I go the no shampoo route...</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t overwhelming but does smell nice and lasts thru the next day.  </li>
            <li>It does clean your hair but lots of hair loss with each use.  </li>
            <li>Whatever the formula is for this they&#x27;ve got it right!</li>
            <li>An amazing product - cleanses without striping and enhances my natural curls.</li>
            <li>because wasn&#x27;t good enough</li>
            <li>I will pay the extra money for Wen as it is a superior product for me.</li>
            <li>My hair fills so full and shiny after using this.</li>
            <li>The nice, soft hair only lasts for a day and if I want my hair to look good again, I HAVE to wash it every day.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>product is actually better than L&#x27;oreal evercreme cleansing conditioner, it smells nicer and less smell.&lt;br /&gt;Evercreme was also good product, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the way they smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great, but it does what it says,  it makes my hair feel really soft and CLEAN!  </li>
            <li>I have fine, very straight hair that&#x27;s oily at the roots and prone to split ends.</li>
            <li>I started out using the original L&#x27;oreal cleanser conditioner (it comes in a golden beige bottle)</li>
            <li>My curls are a little more lively, in a good way.</li>
            <li>I almost always like the scent of bath products, but this one doesn&#x27;t smell fresh or clean.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly like the smell either, and it did not get better during the day.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also mildly flyaway and staticky after the cleanser.</li>
            <li>a 60 year old male and have a beautiful full head of silver curly hair</li>
            <li>It smells strange in your hand, but somehow good on your hair.</li>
            <li>I have found my new favorite hair product.    </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love the scent at first, but really don&#x27;t notice it now</li>
            <li>and my hair still looks good and doesn&#x27;t get dry.  </li>
            <li>Then, when I rinse it out, my hair is clean and very very</li>
            <li>Similar product advertised on TV cost WAY more!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine, very wavy hair that tends to get frizzy and had been wanting to try a cleansing conditioner for a while.  </li>
            <li>only gripe is that the smell isn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li>better use it on my 18 month old as well</li>
            <li>It feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I think L&#x27;Oreal makes good hair products which I regularly buy, but I really dislike this product.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair naturally and love to wash my hair with condition.</li>
            <li>I was kinda hesitant to try this product, as manufacturers seem to be jumping on the &#x27;natural train&#x27; &amp; I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work on my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice to only have to use one product.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this product--her hair looks healthier and cleaner, and her curls look more natural</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on my natural hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it with any other hair products/finishing products yet, but it looks really good without anything else.</li>
            <li>Have to wash every other day, but hair looks good.</li>
            <li>Once I am done with a good scalp massage I comb thru with a wide tooth comb very gently.  </li>
            <li>and I was using it right after changing to a shampoo and conditioner for curls, by Tresemme.</li>
            <li>I am reviewing right now the shipping and the product itself.</li>
            <li>it actually does an decent job of cleansing and would be a great addition to someone with normal hair.  </li>
            <li>While it takes some time to get used to how it feels, it has an amazing effect on my dry, frizzy, curls.  </li>
            <li>It works so well to make my hair soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>it also has a very strong chemical smell that stays in your hair long after you wash it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean, soft and with just the right amount of body.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, in fact I think I am going to buy the entire line.  </li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T GIVE UP BASED ON THE FIRST TRY.</li>
            <li>Once I figured out that I needed extra rinsing when using this, it became one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>Smells funny like chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product a bazillion times, and it never fails me.  </li>
            <li>Really made my curls POP!</li>
            <li>This makes it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY cleanser that&#x27;s every been able to do that for me.</li>
            <li>I use 6-7 pumps on the top, sides, and middle of my head</li>
            <li>If I go too many days between washings I need to give it a second wash</li>
            <li>If I need more conditioner I use a rinse-out following this product and clarify with a sulfate shampoo once every two weeks.</li>
            <li>I do love the leave in cream from the same line.</li>
            <li>It has really improved my hair!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read reviews here first</li>
            <li>the regular EverCurl shampoo is much better</li>
            <li>I have medium length color treated naturally curly hair and my results with this are fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair looked all right, but not as good as usual.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not tear free but less</li>
            <li>It costs so much to buy the higher end conditioners as I go thru them so fast it just wasn&#x27;t economical for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair is clean and soft,  my curls are defined,  and my hair&#x27;s never been shinier.</li>
            <li>I have recently started experimenting with cleansing conditioners, after reading about how much more gentle they are on color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I learned about the whole no-poo method about a year ago, and I started off with some of the super expensive products, but I&#x27;ve since found that this one is VERY good and much much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>After all the positive reviews I saw for the Loreal conditioning cleansers I gave them a try.  </li>
            <li>I originally used 8 pumps (as the bottle says) but felt there was too much build-up too fast and now only use 4-5 pumps, which seems to be my sweet spot.  </li>
            <li>First I want to say that I am natural and it&#x27;s hard to find a decent priced product to work with my hair type and this stuff is really good, it cleans my hair with no residue or no problem, but as far as slip goes, it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>It smells like I washed my hair with a combination of slightly moldy rose petals and cigarette butts.  </li>
            <li>and I love how it has a low lathering so my hair feels extra clean without using a shampoo,</li>
            <li>It might work for type 2 a little better, but even 2c&#x27;s might find it super drying and frizz inducing.</li>
            <li>But even though my hair looked great, I could only leave it down for about two hours before the smell overwhelmed me.  </li>
            <li>but i tried it on my fine thin straight locks and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t usually clump well, but this helps with the clumping and if I keep my hair from rubbing my pillowcase too much, I&#x27;ll get up to three days of good curls with minimal frizz without touching up on</li>
            <li>I normally wash, apply my usual products, let it air dry and hope for the best..</li>
            <li>I have short /medium fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>Made my hair so soft and really brought out the curls!!  </li>
            <li>and I love the single step option!</li>
            <li>Weirdly I am not allergic to the highly fragranced Herbal Essences one.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it hydrating as much as I found it cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am using minimal product in my hair to begin with, I feel confident that this product itself was not the reason I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;To start with the biggest downside -- I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t mind it since it works well, but for those of you who enjoy the smell of Formaldehyde, this is the conditioner you&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I also use the leave-in cream that couples with the cleanser very well.  </li>
            <li>My curls look much nicer after my hair dries, but the frizz doesn&#x27;t always go away.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried Wen Cleansing Conditioner, But I really like this</li>
            <li>I really hope it is not discontinued since I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li>so I needed something that would keep it sleek straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I follow the directions on the bottle and my curly hair is left smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much healthier</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using for 3 weeks and my roots are too much oil...</li>
            <li>I divide my hair in sections and saturate each section while gently massaging my scalp with my finger pads.  </li>
            <li>I work it into each section of my scalp massaging gently each area.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped really fast and on time.</li>
            <li>I realized a few months into it that my hair would need some kind of cleanser maybe 1-2 times per month.</li>
            <li>My naturally curly hair does not dry out and is frizz free if I just let my hair dry without touching it after showering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the weirdest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen, but let me tell you, it conditions better than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>my daughter&#x27;s hair was more manageable with this conditioner, but she uses too much (big hair) to make purchasing this small bottle again worthwhile.</li>
            <li>(I clean it daily)</li>
            <li>I have long curly/wavy hair that is fine</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d known that this product will cause me to spend extra time trying to get my hair clean, I&#x27;d never have ordered it.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not wet enough you&#x27;ll end up using more.</li>
            <li>It is super thick, though, so make sure you wash it out VERY thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle - mild enough for children so their hair is easier to comb.</li>
            <li>I developed an itch after my first use, which was tolerable, but each time I use this product I just get dandruff for days.</li>
            <li>like I do, this product does a &#x27;decent&#x27; job as I stated of cleansing.  </li>
            <li>But I have noticed that with my hair I need to also use a tad of my regular gel too the next day as the gel cream has a light hold while my regular gel has a strong hold.  </li>
            <li>Now it is shiny and blows out well, so I would highly recommend giving this cleansing conditioner a try.</li>
            <li>This shampoo actually created more frizz and has some chemicals I worry about, and it suds for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li>If I did use the standard shampoo and conditioner it would look good for one day and the next day was dry and frizzy again.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris was a little bit better</li>
            <li>Overall, it does the job and leaves my hair clean, takes out any buildup and keeps it shiny without taking out all of the natural oils to make it frizzy.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the pump is neither big nor strong, but I love the shampoo!</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy/curly, on the dry side, particularly on top, where I&#x27;ve got silver mixed in (looks like blonde since my natural hair is light) and since the texture there changed in my early 30&#x27;s (surprise!</li>
            <li>It also feels unusually moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean, without being dry or frizzy.</li>
            <li>Even though it takes a lo of product per use, it&#x27;s worth it because you don&#x27;t have to buy a separate shampoo/conditioner, it saves time because it&#x27;s one step, and it actually works!</li>
            <li>I have never tried a co-wash before (I normally use the L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl shampoo and conditioner), so I was a bit hesitant.</li>
            <li>but once it dried it was lovely.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks better and it does save me a few minutes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and once I&#x27;ve scrubbed my scalp really well I smooth it down through the ends.</li>
            <li>but with the cleansing conditioner I am able to use less gel which is a plus!  </li>
            <li>Aquis towel, let it air dry and the curls are bigger, more spirally with almost no frizz.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but it is a learning curve to get the right cleansing method for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, natural curly, color treated hair, and have never found anything that&#x27;s worked better!  </li>
            <li>A terrific side benefit is that my scalp and hair stay oil free for several days after use</li>
            <li>I stocked up on this shampoo when I found it on clearance at my local grocery store, and I am not sorry I did.</li>
            <li>My daughter felt the same way, and refused to use it after her first try.</li>
            <li>you are at all sensitive to smells, avoid this product!</li>
            <li>I liked this one enough, but I am not sure that it&#x27;s my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my hair is very soft and not dried out at all</li>
            <li>this Loreal cleansing conditioner, I&#x27;ve tried less pumps, more pumps, only the roots of my hair, all over my hair, etc.,</li>
            <li>I did drop a star because I shed quite a bit more using Ever Curl than Wen, though still less than on regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Since this cleansing conditioner doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, it holds a cur right after showering.  </li>
            <li>The product is too heavy for fine hair, but I can see how this would work well for thicker curly hair.</li>
            <li>It left my hair with considerable slip when wet, which felt promising but as the day progressed, my hair felt more dry than it had in weeks</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>natural hair journey is intimidating, with all of the products to choose from.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>This cleanser works very well if you are looking to get away from traditional shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Makes my curls soft and manageable and keeps my hair&#x27;s moisture intact.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair,  </li>
            <li>I am not too wild about the smell of either product.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Cleans my hair without stripping it of its&#x27; natural moisture.</li>
            <li>, then conditioner with the old method.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this cleansing conditioner and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I was completely devastated.</li>
            <li>I was self conscious until I washed my hair again.</li>
            <li>Smells like old T-shirts</li>
            <li>It leaves it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and moisturizes it without making it greasy or gunky.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help the frizz, but it made my hair somewhat soft.</li>
            <li>But after using this a few times, I am pleased enough to subscribe to a couple of bottles delivered to my door each month.</li>
            <li>I had higher hopes when I got out of the shower because of the feel of the slip, but they faded fast when the scent became sour and my curly ran skyward to escape it.</li>
            <li>I have had a lot of success working it in with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>but without a contrasting photo to show how good my hair CAN look, I&#x27;m afraid there isn&#x27;t much point</li>
            <li>Love this product, just with my thick hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using the Loreal cleansing conditioner in the gold bottle for 6 months, and accidentally ordered this one about 2 months ago--I love cleansing conditioners in general, and have noted that even compared to the regular one (gold bottle), this one is even better--my hair is so soft and manageable, my ends have had significantly less splits (so I can grow it longer), but my hair is really soft.</li>
            <li>My curls are more defined and my hair feels much much healthier and less frizzy with significantly less breakage.  </li>
            <li>IF I add another product I can calm it down and get soft body, but this is a curl product!</li>
            <li>I think my hair feels nice and soft this time, but the last time, it felt a little squeaky and dry.</li>
            <li>My hair is less noticeable dry and has more shine.</li>
            <li>After using this, the top of my shoulder-length hair is total flat-head and then further down is wavy in spots.</li>
            <li>This stuff has changed my hair for the better drastically and it&#x27;s only been a few weeks!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing for my long, thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>With this cleansing conditioner, my hair seems to get greasy VERY fast and it feels extremely rough and pretty gross on the second day.</li>
            <li>But this product keeps my hair hydrated and my curls are bouncy and full of life, with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li>I have very thick curly and dry hair, this was my first time using just a conditioner and no shampoo, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have dry curly hair that gets very fizzy.  </li>
            <li>Such a reasonable cost, when you think that brand name Wen costs $29 and generic Wen (Hair One) costs $11.</li>
            <li>After spending a lot of money with several different shampoos that only dried my hair further, then switching to expensive cleansing conditioners that were gentle but just too costly (WEN, Deva Care, etc.), I finally found the best hair cleanser for the lowest price.</li>
            <li>Wen was super expensive and left my hair soft but kind of stiff looking.  </li>
            <li>too bad because I really liked it at first.   </li>
            <li>I recently stopped fighting my natural curls and started to embrace them.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair feeling so soft and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m stripping my hair of its essential oils when I wash with it.</li>
            <li>I spent years fighting my curly hair, but now, since there are products that enhance the curl, I&#x27;ve embraced my curls and stopped blowing my hair straight.</li>
            <li>and now I can enthusiastically recommend this specific cleansing conditioner for anyone with natural curl to their hair.</li>
            <li>Many cowashing conditioners are thin and running, meaning you go through a lot; this stuff is thicker</li>
            <li>This product was okay but not great.  </li>
            <li>My hair was lying flat even though I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various shampoos recommended for advertised to be for my type hair but with little success.  </li>
            <li>This is the first cleansing conditioner that actually cleans and conditions my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wish they sold this in a larger size, I go through a bottle quick!</li>
            <li>The only other cleansing conditioner I use is the L&#x27;Oreal EverCream Cleansing Conditioner, which I use when I want to blow my hair out straight.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it seemed like my hair felt more dry and stiff while wet</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I made the mistake of not rinsing it completely and my hair felt hard and filmy.</li>
            <li>It was not a good fit for me for several reasons I will list below.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much softer and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally then comb it out with a wide-toothed comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have dry, fine, thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I started using this product over a year ago when it was first released, but a few months later they stopped selling it in the stores nearby.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of L&#x27;Oreal in general but have tried the other L&#x27;oreal EverCurl items and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>

            <li> this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Works great on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> But this product makes my hair look and feel great, even after using it for weeks on end.</li>
            <li> My curls look great.</li>
            <li> Not so with this product - it does a great job cleansing and does not leave any buildup.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo that you don&#x27;t have to use conditioner with.</li>
            <li> and you will be happy with the results.</li>

            <li> I co-cleanse with this product and it works great.  </li>
            <li> It made my curl hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I will keep buying this for sure!!</li>
            <li> To top it off, the product smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Like I said, my hair was curling very nicely, but what good is that</li>
            <li> my hair looks very good and is more manageable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to follow up with any sort of leave-in product of any kind in order for my hair to look great.  </li>
            <li> so I have to use a good amount to get all the oil off of my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It smells good.</li>
            <li> It is supposed that if you use a good amount of the product it will work, well no at all .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, this is a good cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This is the best sulfate free cleanser with conditioner for curly hair out there.</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner seems to be good for the job.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good as Wen, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I did like this product and the service was good.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverCurl Cleansing Conditioner is every bit as good as WEN.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of cleaning you hair without drying it out.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner smells a bit chemically when in the bottle, but once it&#x27;s in your hair it smells soo good and the smell lasts for days.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use shampoo every time I wash my hair, so I loved that L&#x27;Oreal introduced a cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The price is good.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE this shampoo!!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love the manageability of my hair!</li>
            <li> The fact that I can use this one product and not still need a palm full of conditioner is incredible.  </li>
            <li> I now love having it in my hair!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> This is a much better buy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cleanser!  </li>
            <li> But the end of the hair is ok!</li>
            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> and for that matter I will make sure I repurchase this again!</li>
            <li> This works great for my brittle, fine, curly hair that I wash about once a week.</li>
            <li> I use this in place of any \\&quot;normal\\&quot; conditioner and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten feedback from my wife that it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair amazing bounce and shine.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly well</li>
            <li> Defeats the purpose kind of?</li>
            <li> and I really liked...</li>
            <li> Kind of like WEN.</li>
            <li> and i did see better results health wise</li>
            <li> My scalp felt clean and my hair smelled great afterwards.</li>
            <li> Smells great and hair feels clean but moist</li>
            <li> It smells great, gets my hair clean, and with every-other-day use, keeps the frizz to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> This product does a great job of detangling super curly hair.</li>
            <li> find that it does a pretty good job cleansing!  </li>
            <li> I get the best natural wavy hair I&#x27;ve ever had without having to use hairspray.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
            <li> I picked this up because I liked the way it smelled and have been in love ever since.</li>
            <li> , I honestly like wen so much better, but I cant afford wen thats why I had been looking for something cheaper and works like wen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use the loreal gel cream too which has a nice scent and helps give the curls more holding power.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and curly.</li>
            <li> (was finally \\&quot;worth it\\&quot;) and mostly have been happy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and has a very pleasant, milk smell.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and shipped fast!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very light sent</li>
            <li> The price is right and the smell is nice too!</li>
            <li> Did mention it smells lovely, lots of compliments</li>
            <li> This product is ok.</li>
            <li> Works great as a cleansing conditioner, not so much for hydrating.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more moisturizing</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s better than Wen</li>
            <li> also love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Co-washing has been a big help in taming the frizz and creating beautiful curls!</li>
            <li> I like this better than the wen knockoff</li>
            <li> This made my hair so healthy and curly that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day anymore to keep the curl.</li>
            <li> So healthy.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Smell could be better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell and my hair still gets frizzy.</li>
            <li> The shampoo cleans better than the cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner is OK on curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It is better than the L&#x27;Oreal Moisture System Cleansing Conditioner as it does not leave a greasy film in my hair like that one did.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you rinse well.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> most days it comes out</li>
            <li> frizzy, poofy, curly in some spots, wavy in others, but with this cleansing conditioner there&#x27;s more structure to my curls.</li>
            <li> If you like chemicals, you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li> and it was okay</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I would say I don&#x27;t use any more water than I did to thoroughly rinse shampoo</li>
            <li> The product worked ok</li>
            <li> I have curly hair (3b or 3c type), and this product is ok, but not my favorite cleansing conditioner, beacuase</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SOOOOO glad it&#x27;s not being discontinued.</li>
            <li> Sides which won&#x27;t cooperate fully, &amp; the back is perfect with curls that form on</li>
            <li> I love ever curl shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> my hair is softer and doesn&#x27;t  look bushy any more.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling great!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t say this is better than wen</li>
            <li> wish it made my scalp refreshing like wen does, if so it can become better than wen for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the cleansing conditioners are a great discovery and really good overall for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, make sure you rinse it all the way out</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It works great, but has a really displeasing odor.</li>
            <li> Works even better when you combine it with the ever curl leave in conditioner cream.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for my curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have to use more</li>
            <li> I will keep looking for something better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that you can wash your hair and not have to use products that have sulfates and soap up.  </li>
            <li> Better than some I have tried.</li>
            <li> It gets hair clean without removing good oils, my hair feels smooth and hydrated and manageable after use.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good first try, but L&#x27;Oreal could do better and eliminate some of the more drying (and silicone based) chemicals from their line for us Curly girls.</li>
            <li> Washed one time and my scalp didn&#x27;t feel clean and was kind of itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d leave it in for 5 minutes or so, rinse it out, and then do another 7-8 pumps to make sure my hair gets really clean!</li>
            <li> My girls with super curly hair love it!</li>
            <li> I rated this as just okay because it didn&#x27;t work for my fine, wavey-curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy that Amazon.com offers it.</li>
            <li> sure how they can advertise this as sulfate free.  ??</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is good because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it leaves build up and allows my curls to really shine.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair clean, soft and with beautiful curls</li>
            <li> yet easily can be straightened...</li>
            <li> It gets oily easily</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get the satisfying lather, but when you rinse it out you can tell it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what it&#x27;s all about: it doesn&#x27;t feel silky like a conditioner, and it doesn&#x27;t cleanse easily like a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am used to shampoos/conditioners being emollient and spreading easily through the hair.  </li>
            <li> You use a good number of pumps (starting at the ends of your hair and working up to your scalp), putting the cleanser on your hair and kind of massaging it into the strands.  </li>
            <li> It would earn five stars if it were not for the strong odor.</li>
            <li> hear people complaining that it smells strong but trust me</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> TOO STRONGLY SCENTED.</li>
            <li> When I first apply the cleanser, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing much, but after it&#x27;s soaked in there, all of the products come out, and my hair feels great.  </li>
            <li> Its fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy/curly and fine, but I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Smells fine to me.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair that shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great until the next day, when my hair is frizzy and brittle and I have to start all over.  </li>
            <li> Great for removing build up and overall freshening hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of almond essence on Amazon and add a couple of drops to the bottle, which makes it fantastic.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is great</li>
            <li> I great price just wish the bottle was bigger 😀</li>
            <li> Hope you have the same great results......</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and nothing was getting it to unfrizz and stay calm plus look really healthy.  </li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my hair light</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think why it&#x27;s no longer available in drug stores.</li>
            <li> The best product to get the most curl and least frizz.</li>
            <li> The trick is to make sure your hair is good and wet and it&#x27;ll smooth through it easily.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t seem to have to use as much, so there is a pretty good savings.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite was to &#x27;wash&#x27; my curls!</li>
            <li> and it feels really rich.  </li>
            <li> I had been cowashing with the normal Tresemme conditioner meant for curly hair, and I think they were kind of competing or something.</li>
            <li> The first time my hair came out fantastic!  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought the smell was okay.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp felt clean and I WILL purchase again.</li>
            <li> The perfect inexpensive CoWash for natural ladies following the Curly Girl (CG) method.</li>
            <li> It takes a LOT of this conditioner to clean hair because it doesn&#x27;t lather - at all.  </li>
            <li> I think this stuff works well to clean my curly hair as I go the no shampoo route...</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t overwhelming but does smell nice and lasts thru the next day.  </li>
            <li> It does clean your hair but lots of hair loss with each use.  </li>
            <li> Whatever the formula is for this they&#x27;ve got it right!</li>
            <li> An amazing product - cleanses without striping and enhances my natural curls.</li>
            <li> because wasn&#x27;t good enough</li>
            <li> I will pay the extra money for Wen as it is a superior product for me.</li>
            <li> My hair fills so full and shiny after using this.</li>
            <li> The nice, soft hair only lasts for a day and if I want my hair to look good again, I HAVE to wash it every day.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> product is actually better than L&#x27;oreal evercreme cleansing conditioner, it smells nicer and less smell.&lt;br /&gt;Evercreme was also good product, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the way they smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell great, but it does what it says,  it makes my hair feel really soft and CLEAN!  </li>
            <li> I have fine, very straight hair that&#x27;s oily at the roots and prone to split ends.</li>
            <li> I started out using the original L&#x27;oreal cleanser conditioner (it comes in a golden beige bottle)</li>
            <li> My curls are a little more lively, in a good way.</li>
            <li> I almost always like the scent of bath products, but this one doesn&#x27;t smell fresh or clean.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like the smell either, and it did not get better during the day.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also mildly flyaway and staticky after the cleanser.</li>
            <li> a 60 year old male and have a beautiful full head of silver curly hair</li>
            <li> It smells strange in your hand, but somehow good on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have found my new favorite hair product.    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the scent at first, but really don&#x27;t notice it now</li>
            <li> and my hair still looks good and doesn&#x27;t get dry.  </li>
            <li> Then, when I rinse it out, my hair is clean and very very</li>
            <li> Similar product advertised on TV cost WAY more!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, very wavy hair that tends to get frizzy and had been wanting to try a cleansing conditioner for a while.  </li>
            <li> only gripe is that the smell isn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
            <li> better use it on my 18 month old as well</li>
            <li> It feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I think L&#x27;Oreal makes good hair products which I regularly buy, but I really dislike this product.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair naturally and love to wash my hair with condition.</li>
            <li> I was kinda hesitant to try this product, as manufacturers seem to be jumping on the &#x27;natural train&#x27; &amp; I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work on my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice to only have to use one product.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product--her hair looks healthier and cleaner, and her curls look more natural</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on my natural hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it with any other hair products/finishing products yet, but it looks really good without anything else.</li>
            <li> Have to wash every other day, but hair looks good.</li>
            <li> Once I am done with a good scalp massage I comb thru with a wide tooth comb very gently.  </li>
            <li> and I was using it right after changing to a shampoo and conditioner for curls, by Tresemme.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing right now the shipping and the product itself.</li>
            <li> it actually does an decent job of cleansing and would be a great addition to someone with normal hair.  </li>
            <li> While it takes some time to get used to how it feels, it has an amazing effect on my dry, frizzy, curls.  </li>
            <li> It works so well to make my hair soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> it also has a very strong chemical smell that stays in your hair long after you wash it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean, soft and with just the right amount of body.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, in fact I think I am going to buy the entire line.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T GIVE UP BASED ON THE FIRST TRY.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out that I needed extra rinsing when using this, it became one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Smells funny like chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product a bazillion times, and it never fails me.  </li>
            <li> Really made my curls POP!</li>
            <li> This makes it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY cleanser that&#x27;s every been able to do that for me.</li>
            <li> I use 6-7 pumps on the top, sides, and middle of my head</li>
            <li> If I go too many days between washings I need to give it a second wash</li>
            <li> If I need more conditioner I use a rinse-out following this product and clarify with a sulfate shampoo once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I do love the leave in cream from the same line.</li>
            <li> It has really improved my hair!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read reviews here first</li>
            <li> the regular EverCurl shampoo is much better</li>
            <li> I have medium length color treated naturally curly hair and my results with this are fantastic.</li>
            <li> My hair looked all right, but not as good as usual.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not tear free but less</li>
            <li> It costs so much to buy the higher end conditioners as I go thru them so fast it just wasn&#x27;t economical for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair is clean and soft,  my curls are defined,  and my hair&#x27;s never been shinier.</li>
            <li> I have recently started experimenting with cleansing conditioners, after reading about how much more gentle they are on color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I learned about the whole no-poo method about a year ago, and I started off with some of the super expensive products, but I&#x27;ve since found that this one is VERY good and much much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> After all the positive reviews I saw for the Loreal conditioning cleansers I gave them a try.  </li>
            <li> I originally used 8 pumps (as the bottle says) but felt there was too much build-up too fast and now only use 4-5 pumps, which seems to be my sweet spot.  </li>
            <li> First I want to say that I am natural and it&#x27;s hard to find a decent priced product to work with my hair type and this stuff is really good, it cleans my hair with no residue or no problem, but as far as slip goes, it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> It smells like I washed my hair with a combination of slightly moldy rose petals and cigarette butts.  </li>
            <li> and I love how it has a low lathering so my hair feels extra clean without using a shampoo,</li>
            <li> It might work for type 2 a little better, but even 2c&#x27;s might find it super drying and frizz inducing.</li>
            <li> But even though my hair looked great, I could only leave it down for about two hours before the smell overwhelmed me.  </li>
            <li> but i tried it on my fine thin straight locks and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t usually clump well, but this helps with the clumping and if I keep my hair from rubbing my pillowcase too much, I&#x27;ll get up to three days of good curls with minimal frizz without touching up on</li>
            <li> I normally wash, apply my usual products, let it air dry and hope for the best..</li>
            <li> I have short /medium fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair so soft and really brought out the curls!!  </li>
            <li> and I love the single step option!</li>
            <li> Weirdly I am not allergic to the highly fragranced Herbal Essences one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it hydrating as much as I found it cleansing.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am using minimal product in my hair to begin with, I feel confident that this product itself was not the reason I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;To start with the biggest downside -- I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t mind it since it works well, but for those of you who enjoy the smell of Formaldehyde, this is the conditioner you&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I also use the leave-in cream that couples with the cleanser very well.  </li>
            <li> My curls look much nicer after my hair dries, but the frizz doesn&#x27;t always go away.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Wen Cleansing Conditioner, But I really like this</li>
            <li> I really hope it is not discontinued since I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> so I needed something that would keep it sleek straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I follow the directions on the bottle and my curly hair is left smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much healthier</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using for 3 weeks and my roots are too much oil...</li>
            <li> I divide my hair in sections and saturate each section while gently massaging my scalp with my finger pads.  </li>
            <li> I work it into each section of my scalp massaging gently each area.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped really fast and on time.</li>
            <li> I realized a few months into it that my hair would need some kind of cleanser maybe 1-2 times per month.</li>
            <li> My naturally curly hair does not dry out and is frizz free if I just let my hair dry without touching it after showering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the weirdest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen, but let me tell you, it conditions better than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> my daughter&#x27;s hair was more manageable with this conditioner, but she uses too much (big hair) to make purchasing this small bottle again worthwhile.</li>
            <li> (I clean it daily)</li>
            <li> I have long curly/wavy hair that is fine</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d known that this product will cause me to spend extra time trying to get my hair clean, I&#x27;d never have ordered it.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not wet enough you&#x27;ll end up using more.</li>
            <li> It is super thick, though, so make sure you wash it out VERY thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle - mild enough for children so their hair is easier to comb.</li>
            <li> I developed an itch after my first use, which was tolerable, but each time I use this product I just get dandruff for days.</li>
            <li> like I do, this product does a &#x27;decent&#x27; job as I stated of cleansing.  </li>
            <li> But I have noticed that with my hair I need to also use a tad of my regular gel too the next day as the gel cream has a light hold while my regular gel has a strong hold.  </li>
            <li> Now it is shiny and blows out well, so I would highly recommend giving this cleansing conditioner a try.</li>
            <li> This shampoo actually created more frizz and has some chemicals I worry about, and it suds for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> If I did use the standard shampoo and conditioner it would look good for one day and the next day was dry and frizzy again.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris was a little bit better</li>
            <li> Overall, it does the job and leaves my hair clean, takes out any buildup and keeps it shiny without taking out all of the natural oils to make it frizzy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the pump is neither big nor strong, but I love the shampoo!</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy/curly, on the dry side, particularly on top, where I&#x27;ve got silver mixed in (looks like blonde since my natural hair is light) and since the texture there changed in my early 30&#x27;s (surprise!</li>
            <li> It also feels unusually moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean, without being dry or frizzy.</li>
            <li> Even though it takes a lo of product per use, it&#x27;s worth it because you don&#x27;t have to buy a separate shampoo/conditioner, it saves time because it&#x27;s one step, and it actually works!</li>
            <li> I have never tried a co-wash before (I normally use the L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl shampoo and conditioner), so I was a bit hesitant.</li>
            <li> but once it dried it was lovely.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks better and it does save me a few minutes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and once I&#x27;ve scrubbed my scalp really well I smooth it down through the ends.</li>
            <li> but with the cleansing conditioner I am able to use less gel which is a plus!  </li>
            <li> Aquis towel, let it air dry and the curls are bigger, more spirally with almost no frizz.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but it is a learning curve to get the right cleansing method for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, natural curly, color treated hair, and have never found anything that&#x27;s worked better!  </li>
            <li> A terrific side benefit is that my scalp and hair stay oil free for several days after use</li>
            <li> I stocked up on this shampoo when I found it on clearance at my local grocery store, and I am not sorry I did.</li>
            <li> My daughter felt the same way, and refused to use it after her first try.</li>
            <li> you are at all sensitive to smells, avoid this product!</li>
            <li> I liked this one enough, but I am not sure that it&#x27;s my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hair is very soft and not dried out at all</li>
            <li> this Loreal cleansing conditioner, I&#x27;ve tried less pumps, more pumps, only the roots of my hair, all over my hair, etc.,</li>
            <li> I did drop a star because I shed quite a bit more using Ever Curl than Wen, though still less than on regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Since this cleansing conditioner doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, it holds a cur right after showering.  </li>
            <li> The product is too heavy for fine hair, but I can see how this would work well for thicker curly hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair with considerable slip when wet, which felt promising but as the day progressed, my hair felt more dry than it had in weeks</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> natural hair journey is intimidating, with all of the products to choose from.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works very well if you are looking to get away from traditional shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Makes my curls soft and manageable and keeps my hair&#x27;s moisture intact.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair,  </li>
            <li> I am not too wild about the smell of either product.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Cleans my hair without stripping it of its&#x27; natural moisture.</li>
            <li> , then conditioner with the old method.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this cleansing conditioner and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was completely devastated.</li>
            <li> I was self conscious until I washed my hair again.</li>
            <li> Smells like old T-shirts</li>
            <li> It leaves it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and moisturizes it without making it greasy or gunky.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help the frizz, but it made my hair somewhat soft.</li>
            <li> But after using this a few times, I am pleased enough to subscribe to a couple of bottles delivered to my door each month.</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes when I got out of the shower because of the feel of the slip, but they faded fast when the scent became sour and my curly ran skyward to escape it.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of success working it in with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> but without a contrasting photo to show how good my hair CAN look, I&#x27;m afraid there isn&#x27;t much point</li>
            <li> Love this product, just with my thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the Loreal cleansing conditioner in the gold bottle for 6 months, and accidentally ordered this one about 2 months ago--I love cleansing conditioners in general, and have noted that even compared to the regular one (gold bottle), this one is even better--my hair is so soft and manageable, my ends have had significantly less splits (so I can grow it longer), but my hair is really soft.</li>
            <li> My curls are more defined and my hair feels much much healthier and less frizzy with significantly less breakage.  </li>
            <li> IF I add another product I can calm it down and get soft body, but this is a curl product!</li>
            <li> I think my hair feels nice and soft this time, but the last time, it felt a little squeaky and dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is less noticeable dry and has more shine.</li>
            <li> After using this, the top of my shoulder-length hair is total flat-head and then further down is wavy in spots.</li>
            <li> This stuff has changed my hair for the better drastically and it&#x27;s only been a few weeks!  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing for my long, thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> With this cleansing conditioner, my hair seems to get greasy VERY fast and it feels extremely rough and pretty gross on the second day.</li>
            <li> But this product keeps my hair hydrated and my curls are bouncy and full of life, with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly and dry hair, this was my first time using just a conditioner and no shampoo, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair that gets very fizzy.  </li>
            <li> Such a reasonable cost, when you think that brand name Wen costs $29 and generic Wen (Hair One) costs $11.</li>
            <li> After spending a lot of money with several different shampoos that only dried my hair further, then switching to expensive cleansing conditioners that were gentle but just too costly (WEN, Deva Care, etc.), I finally found the best hair cleanser for the lowest price.</li>
            <li> Wen was super expensive and left my hair soft but kind of stiff looking.  </li>
            <li> too bad because I really liked it at first.   </li>
            <li> I recently stopped fighting my natural curls and started to embrace them.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair feeling so soft and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m stripping my hair of its essential oils when I wash with it.</li>
            <li> I spent years fighting my curly hair, but now, since there are products that enhance the curl, I&#x27;ve embraced my curls and stopped blowing my hair straight.</li>
            <li> and now I can enthusiastically recommend this specific cleansing conditioner for anyone with natural curl to their hair.</li>
            <li> Many cowashing conditioners are thin and running, meaning you go through a lot; this stuff is thicker</li>
            <li> This product was okay but not great.  </li>
            <li> My hair was lying flat even though I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various shampoos recommended for advertised to be for my type hair but with little success.  </li>
            <li> This is the first cleansing conditioner that actually cleans and conditions my hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish they sold this in a larger size, I go through a bottle quick!</li>
            <li> The only other cleansing conditioner I use is the L&#x27;Oreal EverCream Cleansing Conditioner, which I use when I want to blow my hair out straight.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it seemed like my hair felt more dry and stiff while wet</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I made the mistake of not rinsing it completely and my hair felt hard and filmy.</li>
            <li> It was not a good fit for me for several reasons I will list below.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much softer and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair dry naturally then comb it out with a wide-toothed comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry, fine, thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I started using this product over a year ago when it was first released, but a few months later they stopped selling it in the stores nearby.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of L&#x27;Oreal in general but have tried the other L&#x27;oreal EverCurl items and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> and I actually had to use a mist and more gel (something I never had to do in the past with other co-wash) just to keep down the Rosanna-Rosanna-Dana</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black, have EXTREMELY thick, dense, hair which is loose in the front &amp; top.</li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t last me long, but just means I need to get the bigger bottle next time!</li>
            <li> highly recommend using cleansing conditioners instead of harsh shampoos</li>
            <li> For anyone looking to eliminate regular shampoo because they have dry hair like me, this product is not moisturizing enough and it will need to be followed by a separate conditioner.  </li>
            <li> After a summer of excessive amounts of pool water, sea water, and coloring my hair was an absolute disaster.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish it came in a larger size and, as of late, I could find it on the shelves of my local stores.</li>
            <li> Remember the low-flow shower episode where everybody was walking around with the \\&quot;flat</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not familiar with this type of product, the main thing is that these cleansers don&#x27;t lather -- meaning that they don&#x27;t strip your hair dry.  </li>
            <li> I started using this based on a previous recommendation from natural hair vlogger @MahoganyCurls.</li>
            <li> The only complaint, it foams up, so you don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li> Found it left my hair dry and flyaway.</li>
            <li> Everything I tried left my hair too dry.  </li>
            <li> This is a little to heavy for everyday use with fine curly hair but I will use as a deep conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair felt dirty in less than 8 hours after the first time I used it, and didn&#x27;t feel clean again until I used shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, frizzy, wavy/curly hair that&#x27;s been dyed and highlighted several times.</li>
            <li> It was so soft and bouncy and the curls were so much less frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> Then I go to sleep and lay my hair flat to dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen, which smells fantastic but is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, they were inferior to this product which is why I order it from Amazon online and hope it&#x27;s always available.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> This is a GOD SEND for me when it comes to washing my daughter&#x27;s long spiral curls.</li>
            <li> I have long curly (3a) hair.  </li>
            <li> I stopped blow drying it a long time ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other cleansing conditioners since I&#x27;ve not been able to find this the last few months and it&#x27;s dreadful.</li>
            <li> I use a more expensive brand typically.  </li>
            <li> Long hair/ wavy-curly/ dry damaged (chemo)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other conditioning shampoos but after a short time my hair would end up feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Another thing is if you have an oily scalp and dry hair</li>
            <li> I have no frizz and stactic electricity problems (which I am prone to in the dry conditions of winter)</li>
            <li> I use the Loreal EverCurl creme and EverSleek humidity defying creme together and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair and scalp but doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it still doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> It also helps to add the leave in conditioner they have that goes with this cleansing conditioner if your hair feels a tad dry.  </li>
            <li> I towel dry my hair and apply the leave in conditioner and gel.  </li>
            <li> I rake thru both with my fingers and then let air dry.  </li>
            <li> If I just let it air dry, it would be frizzy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp or my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair never feels greasy, nor is it dry.  </li>
            <li> Although I keep it layered, it tends to dry on the ends and frizz.  </li>
            <li> and I had to use dry shampoo if I didn&#x27;t want to cleanse my hair each and every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy and leaves my hair (which is curly, coarse and usually dry) feeling soft but the stench of the product makes me gag.</li>
            <li> I have gone natural for the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> I have curly 3a hair that is difficult and full of frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have a nearly full bottle that I will be unable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was all frizzy and the curl was loose and deformed.</li>
            <li> but even after rinsing for several minutes, my hair would feel weighed down afterwards,</li>
            <li> I usually only shampoo once a week and condition in between washing, but I feel that weighs my hair down, though it does prevent frizz.</li>
            <li> literally wrote this review after getting out of the shower, and at this moment, my hair is still slightly damp towards the middle, but I can&#x27;t stop running my hands through it.</li>
            <li> have wavy and thick hair, this product makes my hair very soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Only&lt;br /&gt;Thing is that the pump only lets out a little conditioner at a time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find on store shelves</li>
            <li> It looked brown coming out of the bottle and smelled like a combo of pink oil and hair mayonnaise.</li>
            <li> Looking for a good no-poo shampoo that is similar to Wen, without having to deal with the horrible Wen customer service department/shipping department.  </li>
            <li> I have natural curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t last very long because the bottle is small</li>
            <li> But, considering how small these bottles seem, for a person who has long hair, I&#x27;m wondering if the other brand works for me out of a larger bottle, which IS offered.</li>
            <li> My new/gray hair is very coarse and curly, and this product helps to tame it.</li>
            <li> My scalp is also less dry and itchy since I have been using this.  </li>
            <li> I searched forever for a shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t dry my hair out so much that I&#x27;d look like a chia pet, which is weird for someone with zero curl to her hair.</li>
            <li> I hope to salvage this purchase by adding some other scent to the stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if people get these same results with Wen.</li>
            <li> Does anyone have any other tips for me?</li>
            <li> it is not pretty.</li>
            <li> Pretty scary</li>
            <li> but there is NO way I could use this cleanser alone without other products</li>
            <li> Then I rinse out my hair very well and the last rinse I use a cold blast of water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this product, even though  I had read some bad reviews, I really wanted to believe that I could be good.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s exclusively designed for people with thick, coarse curls?  </li>
            <li> Not pleased with the dull dry no shine look, the last time I looked like this I had used Wen.  </li>
            <li> I will never use anything else as long as they continue to make this!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a cleansing conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> All my hair then comes forward into my face since the cleanser seems to weigh it down.</li>
            <li> A less pricey alternative to Wen products.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d have to use half a bottle to detangle my hair</li>
            <li> And I take half the time in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do think this is better than regular shampoo, which strips hair terribly.</li>
            <li> an odd odor, and</li>
            <li> Ever Curl is about half the price</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizzy, curly hair that always gets dried out by traditional shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have mixed, curly hair and this cleansing conditioner was a bit thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, I use about half the amount specified in the directions.</li>
            <li> It has a heavily chemical scent to it and the hibiscus scent seems to sour a bit.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, being a die hard shampoo and conditioner user.</li>
            <li> I have thick dry wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Cleans curly hair, less harsh than shampoo, a one-step process.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s much cheaper at Wal-Mart, I was hoping to find a deal on Amazon in larger bottles, but no such luck:( please don&#x27;t hesitate to try if you have curly hair!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but it felt a little.....</li>
            <li> I just lathered once with the conditioner, let it sit a few minutes while I showered, and rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> It was so heavy on our hair</li>
            <li> and I tried using it both ways as in 8 10 pumps and waited a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Some have even referenced the wasted water with all the rinsing.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a heavy residue inspite of rinsing repeatedly.</li>
            <li> It controls frizz by leaving a heavy waxy coating that looks and feel crappy.</li>
            <li> I figured the winter weather dried it out.</li>
            <li> I never experienced this with regular shampoo even if I didn&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and go through about a bottle a month.</li>
            <li> Stop washing your curly hair everyday and give this a try.</li>
            <li> Bought this after getting tired of using either heavy products that weigh my hair down or others that leave it dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is also less oily that it usually was when using shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I swim a lot and my hair was stiff like straw at times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong lingering smell, but you&#x27;ll smell it when applying this to your hair.</li>
            <li> Again not sure that this is a bad product just not the right product for me.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, this conditioner has a pretty bad chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Second, it smells a little weird, I think its the botanicals but</li>
            <li> I tried the Deva No-Poo cleanser with their conditioner but my curls were still on the dry, thin side as was my wallet.</li>
            <li> Secret Weapon Touch Up Crème which goes on to dry hair.</li>
            <li> No more straw like hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Expensive and definitely doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I hate the idea of ever using sulfate shampoos on my golden wavy/curly locks.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think about this.</li>
            <li> but I just can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I have used wen in the past, but for some reason it made my hair fall out in chunks.  </li>
            <li> but sometimes I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It works just as we&#x27;ll if not better than my catwalk curl amplifier.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the Cleansing Conditioner to wash my hair, the Gel/Cream on lightly-towel dried hair before I plop for at least thirty minutes, then the Leave-in Cream after I plop.</li>
            <li> : if I did  L&#x27;oreal would surely not want my hair as their poster</li>
            <li> I always hate my hair right after I would shampoo it.  </li>
            <li> Also, one of the chemicals seemed to make my head break out in painful zits that took a few days to clear.</li>
            <li> &quot; work with short hair, but for my waist-length, natural corkscrews, it was awful and I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The chemical stink is atrocious -- both in the shower and afterwards, when my hair is wet and beginning to dry.</li>
            <li> I have been trying various cleansing conditioners, and this is the worst one so far.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s seems that everything I&#x27;ve been using lately has been drying out my hair and giving me split ends even just after 3 or 4 days after getting my haircut&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, salon-colored hair, curly hairy and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a crap shoot when trying new curly hair products.</li>
            <li> but I seriously can&#x27;t take the smell...</li>
            <li> Some of these co-washes are ridiculously over-priced.</li>
            <li> It had a weird heavy, chemical-perfume odor to it that stuck on our hair that we could smell on ourselves throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This product was not good for my hair.</li>
            <li> Like, so soft, I look like a moron playing with it all of the time.</li>
            <li> This gave me a very itchy scalp and the worst dandruff</li>
            <li> Seriously, smell it before buying it!</li>
            <li> I was sick of my hair always being dried out</li>
            <li> Guessing need to use the shampoo to not get the weird build up look when you hair dries and I did not.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I think it smells like someone tried, and failed, to make a pile of disintegrating tires smell like &amp;#34;flowers.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> but it is SO expensive.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re own.&lt;br /&gt;I failed to read the instructions &amp; used it as a leave in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My only qualm with this product is that it gives me INSANE dandruff.</li>
            <li> Also, as others mention, it IS difficult to rinse out; I suspect it accumulates in my hair, exacerbating the problem.</li>
            <li> I pulled it back into a bun to try to get away from that terrible odor.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair looking and feeling dirty, plus it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> I mean HATE.  </li>
            <li> Horrible smell not like the other Loreal products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use another cleansing condition in fear of it making my hair fall out again, but that did not happen with this.  </li>
            <li> I used to use another brand which seemed very expensive to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle or</li>
            <li> I got so frustrated I almost gave up.  </li>
            <li> Grr).</li>
            <li> I was so worried that by not forking over tons of money for some specialty-organic-free range-whatever cleansing conditioner, I would be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks!</li>
            <li> but I absolutely HATE the smell.  </li>
            <li> I hated the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> but this is worst</li>
            <li> , my hair is sticky and  greasy, horrible.</li>
            <li> it literally felt greasy, which was disgusting!</li>
            <li> I can truly say it was one of the worst hair products I have ever tried</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Had used the moisturizing formula before and I like the scent of this one better use it on my 18 month old as well does ent seem to bother her eyes. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not tear free but less chemicals has to be a littE gentler. Did mention it smells lovely, lots of compliments</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, in fact I think I am going to buy the entire line.  I use this in place of any \\&quot;normal\\&quot; conditioner and it is amazing.  I don&#x27;t have to follow up with any sort of leave-in product of any kind in order for my hair to look great.  A lot of the time I&#x27;ll try a product and it&#x27;s great until the next day, when my hair is frizzy and brittle and I have to start all over.  This conditioner is good because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it leaves build up and allows my curls to really shine.  I don&#x27;t get any excess frizzy fly-aways with this and it feels really rich.  It also makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> This product is ok. it actually does an decent job of cleansing and would be a great addition to someone with normal hair.  It was not a good fit for me for several reasons I will list below.  For anyone looking to eliminate regular shampoo because they have dry hair like me, this product is not moisturizing enough and it will need to be followed by a separate conditioner.  Defeats the purpose kind of? Second, it smells a little weird, I think its the botanicals but the scent can be off-putting so don&#x27;t expect scented wonder.  Another thing is if you have an oily scalp and dry hair like I do, this product does a &#x27;decent&#x27; job as I stated of cleansing.  It doesn&#x27;t lather so I have to use a good amount to get all the oil off of my scalp.  Again not sure that this is a bad product just not the right product for me.  Long hair/ wavy-curly/ dry damaged (chemo)</li>
            <li> Bottle lasted about 6 months. I have dry, fine, thick wavy hair. This product is used 2 x a week (or so).  Great for removing build up and overall freshening hair.  I didn&#x27;t find it hydrating as much as I found it cleansing.  Works great as a cleansing conditioner, not so much for hydrating.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, very wavy hair that tends to get frizzy and had been wanting to try a cleansing conditioner for a while.  After giving this a try for about two weeks, I decided that it&#x27;s not for me.  It made my hair greasy at the roots but frizzy and tangled at the ends and it always felt like there was a gross build-up on my scalp, no matter how thoroughly I rinsed it.  Also, the smell was way too perfume-y for me.  Perhaps it&#x27;s exclusively designed for people with thick, coarse curls?  All I know is that it definitely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I have gone natural for the past 2 years. I was scared to purchase this assuming that it wasn&#x27;t for my type of hair but the bottle indicated that it was for wavy or curly hair....I tried it and I really liked...I wish it was more moisturizing BUT it&#x27;s better than Wen AND it actually lathers - Wen doesn&#x27;t. My hair and scalp felt clean and I WILL purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have curly hair and it is perfect for me. I was sick of my hair always being dried out and this was the perfect cure for my hair!</li>
            <li> My new favorite was to &#x27;wash&#x27; my curls! It cleans away the oil without drying my hair out.</li>
            <li> I was so worried that by not forking over tons of money for some specialty-organic-free range-whatever cleansing conditioner, I would be disappointed. But after using this a few times, I am pleased enough to subscribe to a couple of bottles delivered to my door each month. I only use this once a week, and I have plenty left, but I never want to run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This natural hair journey is intimidating, with all of the products to choose from. I don&#x27;t want to have to find an alternative... What if they discontinue this stuff???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to stock up now!!! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the smell of it. It reminds me of shea or cocoa butter lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add that this is my third time using it. DON&#x27;T GIVE UP BASED ON THE FIRST TRY. I&#x27;d never used such a product before and I was using it right after changing to a shampoo and conditioner for curls, by Tresemme. I think my hair feels nice and soft this time, but the last time, it felt a little squeaky and dry. I had been cowashing with the normal Tresemme conditioner meant for curly hair, and I think they were kind of competing or something. Now that I am using minimal product in my hair to begin with, I feel confident that this product itself was not the reason I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally wrote this review after getting out of the shower, and at this moment, my hair is still slightly damp towards the middle, but I can&#x27;t stop running my hands through it. It feels soft and healthy. I have not put anything else in it. I just lathered once with the conditioner, let it sit a few minutes while I showered, and rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> I rated this as just okay because it didn&#x27;t work for my fine, wavey-curly hair.  The product is too heavy for fine hair, but I can see how this would work well for thicker curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use a more expensive brand typically.  I found that this did just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner. It smells good. It&#x27;s all natural. I love the manageability of my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this product, even though  I had read some bad reviews, I really wanted to believe that I could be good. But it IS not at all. I have curly hair greasy in the roots. I used deva curl and I was unsatisfied  because wasn&#x27;t good enough but this is worst, my hair is sticky and  greasy, horrible. It is supposed that if you use a good amount of the product it will work, well no at all . Never again</li>
            <li> An amazing product - cleanses without striping and enhances my natural curls. Similar product advertised on TV cost WAY more!</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly and dry hair, this was my first time using just a conditioner and no shampoo, and I love it. My scalp felt clean and my hair smelled great afterwards. My hair is less noticeable dry and has more shine.</li>
            <li> Allergic! Rash all over scalp! Had to visit dermatologist for a steroid. Weirdly I am not allergic to the highly fragranced Herbal Essences one.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the pump is neither big nor strong, but I love the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I recently stopped fighting my natural curls and started to embrace them. Co-washing has been a big help in taming the frizz and creating beautiful curls! I like this better than the wen knockoff i was using</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness!! LOVE, LOVE this shampoo!!  Made my hair so soft and really brought out the curls!!  Have been recommending to my friends with curls.</li>
            <li> I have recently started experimenting with cleansing conditioners, after reading about how much more gentle they are on color treated hair.  I actually heard about them through WEN, but I can&#x27;t afford to buy his products, so I&#x27;ve been trying out various drugstore brands.  I liked this one enough, but I am not sure that it&#x27;s my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with the biggest downside -- I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  I almost always like the scent of bath products, but this one doesn&#x27;t smell fresh or clean.  It smells a bit like chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is a good cleansing conditioner.  If you&#x27;re not familiar with this type of product, the main thing is that these cleansers don&#x27;t lather -- meaning that they don&#x27;t strip your hair dry.  You use a good number of pumps (starting at the ends of your hair and working up to your scalp), putting the cleanser on your hair and kind of massaging it into the strands.  I leave it on for about 5 minutes, while I do the rest of my stuff in the shower.  Then, when I rinse it out, my hair is clean and very very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it does a pretty good job cleansing!  It takes off my hairspray.  I also use Toppik hair fibers, and those come out.  When I first apply the cleanser, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing much, but after it&#x27;s soaked in there, all of the products come out, and my hair feels great.  That being said,  I find that I still need to use a regular shampoo about once a week, because my hair gets too greasy using only this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff exclusively for months. I&#x27;m a diehard fan! I have medium length curly hair.  I&#x27;ve used other conditioning shampoos but after a short time my hair would end up feeling greasy. I kept waiting for that to happen with this to no avail.  My hair is clean and soft,  my curls are defined,  and my hair&#x27;s never been shinier. My only complaint is that I wish they sold this in a larger size, I go through a bottle quick!</li>
            <li> This is the best sulfate free cleanser with conditioner for curly hair out there. I tried Wen and wanted something like it without the sulfate. This is it. It doesn&#x27;t lather because it doesn&#x27;t have the sulfate a that harm your hair and our water supply. My hair is very fine and curly. I swim a lot and my hair was stiff like straw at times. This made my hair so healthy and curly that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day anymore to keep the curl. No more straw like hair. So healthy. I love it. It&#x27;s getting harder to find on store shelves so I ordered it on Amazon to keep it coming.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works very well if you are looking to get away from traditional shampoo.  I have curly hair and I pair this with a leave in Loreal hair cream and my hair looks very good and is more manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering it online since I cant find it in the store anymore.. It&#x27;s great for my hair!! Curly..yet easily can be straightened...</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair shine and bounce, keeps my curls defined, and has a terrific texture. It would earn five stars if it were not for the strong odor. A less pricey alternative to Wen products.</li>
            <li> The perfect inexpensive CoWash for natural ladies following the Curly Girl (CG) method. I started using this based on a previous recommendation from natural hair vlogger @MahoganyCurls.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair happy. Smell could be better.</li>
            <li> Makes my curls soft and manageable and keeps my hair&#x27;s moisture intact. Solid, affordable cowash.</li>
            <li> This is a little to heavy for everyday use with fine curly hair but I will use as a deep conditioner</li>
            <li> Its fine. I don&#x27;t love the smell and my hair still gets frizzy. Not sure I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> finally, something that puts enough moisture in my hair! this is a great product. i have it on auto refill.</li>
            <li> The shampoo cleans better than the cleansing conditioner. I guess the cleansing conditioner saves time if you&#x27;re shampooing every day, but if you did, you&#x27;d still need to use the regular shampoo once in a while.</li>
            <li> This product is sold for curly hair but i tried it on my fine thin straight locks and absolutely love it!  I was looking for a cleansing conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.  This is it! I have no frizz and stactic electricity problems (which I am prone to in the dry conditions of winter) my hair has bounce and body as well. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Ew. This stuff stinks! It&#x27;s thick and creamy and leaves my hair (which is curly, coarse and usually dry) feeling soft but the stench of the product makes me gag. I&#x27;ve been using Wen, which smells fantastic but is way too expensive. I hope to salvage this purchase by adding some other scent to the stuff.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this conditioner has a pretty bad chemical smell. Personally, I don&#x27;t mind it since it works well, but for those of you who enjoy the smell of Formaldehyde, this is the conditioner you&#x27;ve been looking for. It&#x27;s not a strong lingering smell, but you&#x27;ll smell it when applying this to your hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair,  I need a lot of conditioner to detangle my hair before finishing my shower when using regular products.  Typically I only conditioner wash my hair.  Using this product I almost had to rid my hair out trying to detangle it and using just the cleansing conditioning to wash my hair and rinse out later that day my hair seem to have a ton of product build up.  Expensive and definitely doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Guessing need to use the shampoo to not get the weird build up look when you hair dries and I did not.  But I don&#x27;t like the smell and I&#x27;d have to use half a bottle to detangle my hair, it&#x27;s not the product for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian man with medium length hair, looking to try cowashing. This cleansing conditioner seems to be good for the job. It has a minute amount of lather, but still feels like a conditioner. I&#x27;ve gotten feedback from my wife that it smells amazing. Many cowashing conditioners are thin and running, meaning you go through a lot; this stuff is thicker and I imagine the bottle will last quite a while. Overall, it does the job and leaves my hair clean, takes out any buildup and keeps it shiny without taking out all of the natural oils to make it frizzy.</li>
            <li> Looking for a good no-poo shampoo that is similar to Wen, without having to deal with the horrible Wen customer service department/shipping department.  This one is not it.</li>
            <li> very good product for dry/damaged curly hair.  The fact that I can use this one product and not still need a palm full of conditioner is incredible.  It gets hair clean without removing good oils, my hair feels smooth and hydrated and manageable after use.</li>
            <li> The cleanser allows oil to build up on the hair.  My hair felt dirty in less than 8 hours after the first time I used it, and didn&#x27;t feel clean again until I used shampoo.  I gave it a week.  My hair looked all right, but not as good as usual.  It was very oily and heavy and made my scalp hurt.</li>
            <li> I no longer worry about how often I wash my hair. This product leaves my hair feeling so soft and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m stripping my hair of its essential oils when I wash with it. I have very dry, frizzy, wavy/curly hair that&#x27;s been dyed and highlighted several times. I use the Loreal EverCurl creme and EverSleek humidity defying creme together and let it air dry. I get the best natural wavy hair I&#x27;ve ever had without having to use hairspray. Loreal had awesome products.</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner is OK on curly hair.  It is better than the L&#x27;Oreal Moisture System Cleansing Conditioner as it does not leave a greasy film in my hair like that one did.  I am not too wild about the smell of either product.  I purchased both of these based on some product reviews I read, but I will not purchase them again.  I will pay the extra money for Wen as it is a superior product for me.</li>
            <li> Works great on my curly hair. Cuts the frizz! Just make sure you rinse well.</li>
            <li> I like it and find it to be a lot like the Wen cleansing conditioner, but wwaayy cheaper. Doesn&#x27;t smell quite as good as Wen, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I stocked up on this shampoo when I found it on clearance at my local grocery store, and I am not sorry I did. It does a wonderful job of cleaning my hair without stripping it. I still feel like I need to use a conditioner afterwards, but that is only because I prefer a slippery-soft feeling. Just a warning, it takes quite a while to rinse this out thoroughly. When I first used it, I made the mistake of not rinsing it completely and my hair felt hard and filmy. Once I figured out that I needed extra rinsing when using this, it became one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so I will be buying it online. The best product to get the most curl and least frizz. Even though it takes a lo of product per use, it&#x27;s worth it because you don&#x27;t have to buy a separate shampoo/conditioner, it saves time because it&#x27;s one step, and it actually works!</li>
            <li> Smells funny like chemicals. It makes my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product. At first I was skeptical, being a die hard shampoo and conditioner user. I am also the type of person who uses a deep conditioning hair mask daily. But this product makes my hair look and feel great, even after using it for weeks on end. And I take half the time in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the smell isn&#x27;t amazing. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it. It just doesn&#x27;t smell... &amp;#34;Ahhh&amp;#34;. I bought a bottle of almond essence on Amazon and add a couple of drops to the bottle, which makes it fantastic. I now love having it in my hair!</li>
            <li> I have never tried a co-wash before (I normally use the L&#x27;Oreal EverCurl shampoo and conditioner), so I was a bit hesitant. My hair is wavy/curly and fine, but I have a lot of it. It gets oily easily (I clean it daily) so I was scared this wouldn&#x27;t cleanse my hair, but it&#x27;s wonderful! You don&#x27;t get the satisfying lather, but when you rinse it out you can tell it&#x27;s clean. There&#x27;s a noticeable difference in my hair. I normally wash, apply my usual products, let it air dry and hope for the best.. most days it comes out frizzy, poofy, curly in some spots, wavy in others, but with this cleansing conditioner there&#x27;s more structure to my curls. Love it!</li>
            <li> I think L&#x27;Oreal makes good hair products which I regularly buy, but I really dislike this product. The chemical stink is atrocious -- both in the shower and afterwards, when my hair is wet and beginning to dry. I don&#x27;t see what it&#x27;s all about: it doesn&#x27;t feel silky like a conditioner, and it doesn&#x27;t cleanse easily like a shampoo. Back to the drawing board, guys!</li>
            <li> I really like this cleansing conditioner.  It cleans my hair and scalp but doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  I always hate my hair right after I would shampoo it.  It was all frizzy and the curl was loose and deformed. Since this cleansing conditioner doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, it holds a cur right after showering.  I also use the leave-in cream that couples with the cleanser very well.  I spent years fighting my curly hair, but now, since there are products that enhance the curl, I&#x27;ve embraced my curls and stopped blowing my hair straight. This is a great product and shipped fast!  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Walgreens on clearance in my town.  This conditioner foams up when you put it on your hair.  It&#x27;s the weirdest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen, but let me tell you, it conditions better than any other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and has a very pleasant, milk smell.  I was so happy that Amazon.com offers it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and I LOVE this product! It works so well to make my hair soft and easy to comb. The price is right and the smell is nice too!</li>
            <li> This conditioning cleanser is wonderful for my curls.  It leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  My curls look great.</li>
            <li> I have long hair. I hate the idea of ever using sulfate shampoos on my golden wavy/curly locks. I used to use another brand which seemed very expensive to me. But, considering how small these bottles seem, for a person who has long hair, I&#x27;m wondering if the other brand works for me out of a larger bottle, which IS offered.</li>
            <li> This is a GOD SEND for me when it comes to washing my daughter&#x27;s long spiral curls. Giving her a bath used to be a death sentence for both of us because of all the steps (shampoo, rinse, condition, rinse, detangle, comb)... THIS IS ALL I USE NOW!</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of L&#x27;Oreal in general but have tried the other L&#x27;oreal EverCurl items and was pleasantly surprised.  Since my teen daughter and I both have curly hair and are into the co-cleansing routine I thought we&#x27;d give this a try.  It was so heavy on our hair it literally felt greasy, which was disgusting! The 3rd time I used it, I actually used a sulfate containing shampoo afterwards to remove the gunk and didn&#x27;t touch it again.  And the smell?  If you like chemicals, you&#x27;ll love this.  It had a weird heavy, chemical-perfume odor to it that stuck on our hair that we could smell on ourselves throughout the day. My daughter felt the same way, and refused to use it after her first try. I can truly say it was one of the worst hair products I have ever tried and we actually returned it to the store.</li>
            <li> I joined the no-poo movement in 1/2014. I realized a few months into it that my hair would need some kind of cleanser maybe 1-2 times per month. I started out using the original L&#x27;oreal cleanser conditioner (it comes in a golden beige bottle) and it was okay but even after rinsing for several minutes, my hair would feel weighed down afterwards, like there was still product left on the strands. Not so with this product - it does a great job cleansing and does not leave any buildup. I will continue to purchase. Such a reasonable cost, when you think that brand name Wen costs $29 and generic Wen (Hair One) costs $11. This is a much better buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a crap shoot when trying new curly hair products. This product did not assist me in trying to tighten up my waves and lessen the frizz. I can relate to someone else&#x27;s review about having a Seinfeld flat-hair experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it reminds me of another Seinfeld, the smelly car....I can&#x27;t stand the smell. Thought it may have turned from warehouse/shipping heat....smelled it at the store, eeew! I think it smells like someone tried, and failed, to make a pile of disintegrating tires smell like &amp;#34;flowers.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just tried this last night and I&#x27;m very happy so far. I only wish it were in a bigger bottle. I have long curly/wavy hair that is fine but I have a lot of it. I usually only shampoo once a week and condition in between washing, but I feel that weighs my hair down, though it does prevent frizz. My hair fills so full and shiny after using this. My curls are a little more lively, in a good way. I read reviews about not liking the scent. Smells fine to me. Would definitely recommend. I haven&#x27;t tried it with any other hair products/finishing products yet, but it looks really good without anything else.</li>
            <li> I did like this product and the service was good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product a bazillion times, and it never fails me.  It is one of my go-to products for my curly hair.  I learned about the whole no-poo method about a year ago, and I started off with some of the super expensive products, but I&#x27;ve since found that this one is VERY good and much much cheaper.  I agree with posters who say you have to use a lot of product and spend time massaging your scalp.  Overall, this product is great and I use it all the time.  Leaves your hair feeling like heaven!</li>
            <li> Really made my curls POP! Does the job.  Cleans my hair without stripping it of its&#x27; natural moisture. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been trying various cleansing conditioners, and this is the worst one so far.  It takes a LOT of this conditioner to clean hair because it doesn&#x27;t lather - at all.  I am used to shampoos/conditioners being emollient and spreading easily through the hair.  This Hydracharge cleansing conditioner will not spread - at all.  If I&#x27;d known that this product will cause me to spend extra time trying to get my hair clean, I&#x27;d never have ordered it.  I would not recommend this cleansing conditioner if you value your time.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo that you don&#x27;t have to use conditioner with. Kind of like WEN.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I had tried the EverCreme product before and wanted to try this product. I wear my hair naturally and love to wash my hair with condition. This give me the best of both worlds with a conditioner and a cleanser in one. I great price just wish the bottle was bigger 😀</li>
            <li> I have used WEN for quite a while but it is expensive.  L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverCurl Cleansing Conditioner is every bit as good as WEN.  I can use it daily if I have to.  My naturally curly hair does not dry out and is frizz free if I just let my hair dry without touching it after showering.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of detangling super curly hair. It is gentle - mild enough for children so their hair is easier to comb.</li>
            <li> my daughter&#x27;s hair was more manageable with this conditioner, but she uses too much (big hair) to make purchasing this small bottle again worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Have to wash every other day, but hair looks good.</li>
            <li> I tried this after using Wen. It works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I do think this is better than regular shampoo, which strips hair terribly. BUT....&lt;br /&gt;Comparable to Wen? No way. The fact that this lathers should be a clue it isnt in the same ballpark. I do wish Wen was this price though!&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how they can advertise this as sulfate free.  ??&lt;br /&gt;Has an odd odor, and I feel as if it leaves a coating on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wont order again.</li>
            <li> I still have frizzy hair and I tried using it both ways as in 8 10 pumps and waited a few minutes. This product was not good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly 3a hair that is difficult and full of frizz.  This shampoo actually created more frizz and has some chemicals I worry about, and it suds for no apparent reason.  It left my hair with considerable slip when wet, which felt promising but as the day progressed, my hair felt more dry than it had in weeks and I actually had to use a mist and more gel (something I never had to do in the past with other co-wash) just to keep down the Rosanna-Rosanna-Dana look from stalking me.&lt;br /&gt;  I didn&#x27;t particularly like the smell either, and it did not get better during the day.  It has a heavily chemical scent to it and the hibiscus scent seems to sour a bit. My husband definitely didn&#x27;t sleep closer to me that night. I think it&#x27;s a good first try, but L&#x27;Oreal could do better and eliminate some of the more drying (and silicone based) chemicals from their line for us Curly girls. Also, one of the chemicals seemed to make my head break out in painful zits that took a few days to clear. I had higher hopes when I got out of the shower because of the feel of the slip, but they faded fast when the scent became sour and my curly ran skyward to escape it. It might work for type 2 a little better, but even 2c&#x27;s might find it super drying and frizz inducing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with naturally curly hair.  It does a good job of cleaning you hair without drying it out.  It leaves my hair clean, soft and with just the right amount of body.  Just follow the directions and you will be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly haired girls!</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think about this. My curls look much nicer after my hair dries, but the frizz doesn&#x27;t always go away. The nice, soft hair only lasts for a day and if I want my hair to look good again, I HAVE to wash it every day. With this cleansing conditioner, my hair seems to get greasy VERY fast and it feels extremely rough and pretty gross on the second day. I don&#x27;t want to go back to my habit of washing every day. I&#x27;m not sure if people get these same results with Wen. I am planning to try Wen next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this Loreal cleansing conditioner, I&#x27;ve tried less pumps, more pumps, only the roots of my hair, all over my hair, etc., but the results have been the same each time. Does anyone have any other tips for me? I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair looking and feeling dirty, plus it smells terrible. It has nothing to do with \\&quot;how\\&quot; I used it - I know how to wash my hair. It \\&quot;may\\&quot; work with short hair, but for my waist-length, natural corkscrews, it was awful and I wasted my money. I do NOT recommend it.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of you I wanted to try Wen but it is SO expensive.  I finally tried it and then tried this.  I used one bottle of Wen and am on my third of Ever Curl.  I find Ever Curl cleans as well and is easier to apply than Wen.  I didn&#x27;t love the scent at first, but really don&#x27;t notice it now and it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger in my hair.  I did drop a star because I shed quite a bit more using Ever Curl than Wen, though still less than on regular shampoo.  Ever Curl is about half the price and I don&#x27;t seem to have to use as much, so there is a pretty good savings.  I must say to those who have read reviews on cleansing conditioners that claim they leave build up, I have not found that to be the case, but I follow the directions with regard to rinsing well.  Some have even referenced the wasted water with all the rinsing.  I would say I don&#x27;t use any more water than I did to thoroughly rinse shampoo, then conditioner with the old method.  After a summer of excessive amounts of pool water, sea water, and coloring my hair was an absolute disaster. Now it is shiny and blows out well, so I would highly recommend giving this cleansing conditioner a try.</li>
            <li> The product worked ok but I just can&#x27;t get past the smell. It&#x27;s gross!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair (3b or 3c type), and this product is ok, but not my favorite cleansing conditioner, beacuase I have to apply an extra conditioner in order to detangle my hair. The LOreal Paris EverCream cleansing conditioner leaves my hair waaaay softer and easier to comb.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff works well to clean my curly hair as I go the no shampoo route...but I absolutely HATE the smell.  I mean HATE.  I tried continuing to use to since it does it&#x27;s job but I seriously can&#x27;t take the smell...it is not pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried Wen Cleansing Conditioner, But I really like this L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCurl Cleansing Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 60 year old male and have a beautiful full head of silver curly hair and it&#x27;s seems that everything I&#x27;ve been using lately has been drying out my hair and giving me split ends even just after 3 or 4 days after getting my haircut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I started using this and my hair is very soft and not dried out at all, in fact it feels silky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hear people complaining that it smells strong but trust me it&#x27;s a very light sent</li>
            <li> Hello!  Where has this been all my life?!&lt;br /&gt;I have never used cleansing conditioner before. While it takes some time to get used to how it feels, it has an amazing effect on my dry, frizzy, curls.  I&#x27;ve stopped using traditional shampoo altogether.  It&#x27;s also a very good price for those who just want to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; it to see if they like it or not.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> Love it.  I have dry curly hair that gets very fizzy.  This makes it soft and smooth.  I really hope it is not discontinued since I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the product I have been looking for forever. I tried the Deva No-Poo cleanser with their conditioner but my curls were still on the dry, thin side as was my wallet. With this, I massage it in, comb it thru with my fingers to detangle, pile it on my head, finish my shower, rinse it out, put some Deva Conditioner thru it , crunch it damp with and Aquis towel, let it air dry and the curls are bigger, more spirally with almost no frizz. For whatever frizz may develop I am liking the John Freida Frizz Ease Secret Weapon Touch Up Crème which goes on to dry hair. Hope you have the same great results......</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cleanser!  I have used wen in the past, but for some reason it made my hair fall out in chunks.  Pretty scary so I discontinued use immediately.  I was afraid to use another cleansing condition in fear of it making my hair fall out again, but that did not happen with this.  I have long curly (3a) hair.  I am Latina also.  This conditioner smells a bit chemically when in the bottle, but once it&#x27;s in your hair it smells soo good and the smell lasts for days.  I am big on smells so that&#x27;s a big deal to me.  Not only does it smell great, but it does what it says,  it makes my hair feel really soft and CLEAN!  I have found my new favorite hair product.    UPDATE Nov 4, 2104   I had to discontinue using this as it was making my hair fall out.   Each and every time I would use this, clumps of my hair was falling out.  when I would use something else another day, my hair would not fall out.  Tried it again and hair fell out again.   too bad because I really liked it at first.   Smells awesome though.</li>
            <li> This product was okay but not great.  It also didn&#x27;t last very long because the bottle is small and you have to use a lot of it to wash your hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  If you want this type of product, I would stick with Wen.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now. I have fine, very straight hair that&#x27;s oily at the roots and prone to split ends. I&#x27;ve also been lightening my hair for years so there is damage. I searched forever for a shampoo that wouldn&#x27;t dry my hair out so much that I&#x27;d look like a chia pet, which is weird for someone with zero curl to her hair. I stopped blow drying it a long time ago so I needed something that would keep it sleek straight out of the shower. This is the ONLY cleanser that&#x27;s every been able to do that for me. I even tried the Eversleek and it doesn&#x27;t have the same effect for whatever reason. I picked this up because I liked the way it smelled and have been in love ever since. I REALLY wish it came in a larger size and, as of late, I could find it on the shelves of my local stores. I thought it had been discontinued until I found it here! My hair is fine but it&#x27;s about to the middle of my back. I use 6-7 pumps on the top, sides, and middle of my head and then do another pump for underneath and once I&#x27;ve scrubbed my scalp really well I smooth it down through the ends. I still use conditioner (not that I need to with this, though) but sometimes I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t and it still looks great! If I go too many days between washings I need to give it a second wash but it still doesn&#x27;t dry it out. The trick is to make sure your hair is good and wet and it&#x27;ll smooth through it easily. If it&#x27;s not wet enough you&#x27;ll end up using more. I&#x27;m SOOOOO glad it&#x27;s not being discontinued. I&#x27;ve tried so many other cleansing conditioners since I&#x27;ve not been able to find this the last few months and it&#x27;s dreadful. Whatever the formula is for this they&#x27;ve got it right!</li>
            <li> This is the best &amp;#34;shampoo/conditioner&amp;#34; for my hair.  My new/gray hair is very coarse and curly, and this product helps to tame it.</li>
            <li> I follow the directions on the bottle and my curly hair is left smooth and hydrated. If I need more conditioner I use a rinse-out following this product and clarify with a sulfate shampoo once every two weeks. That is just to minimize build-up. Overall, I really like this cleansing conditioner and will buy it again. The only draw back is the smell but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! My hair feels so much healthier and I love the single step option!</li>
            <li> I started using this product over a year ago when it was first released, but a few months later they stopped selling it in the stores nearby. I was completely devastated. You have no idea how happy I was when I found it on Amazon. I have thick, frizzy, curly hair that always gets dried out by traditional shampoos and conditioners. But this product keeps my hair hydrated and my curls are bouncy and full of life, with little to no frizz. My hair is also less oily that it usually was when using shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that when using this in the shower, I would out about 7-8 pumps into my hair, dip my hair into the water for a second to help the product spread. I&#x27;d leave it in for 5 minutes or so, rinse it out, and then do another 7-8 pumps to make sure my hair gets really clean!</li>
            <li> I bought this locally, and returned it the next day. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle or what because there is no way anyone could say what I got smelled great. It looked brown coming out of the bottle and smelled like a combo of pink oil and hair mayonnaise. I was self conscious until I washed my hair again. I do love the leave in cream from the same line. It works just as we&#x27;ll if not better than my catwalk curl amplifier.</li>
            <li> I was kinda hesitant to try this product, as manufacturers seem to be jumping on the &#x27;natural train&#x27; &amp; I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work on my hair. I&#x27;m black, have EXTREMELY thick, dense, hair which is loose in the front &amp; top. Sides which won&#x27;t cooperate fully, &amp; the back is perfect with curls that form on they&#x27;re own.&lt;br /&gt;I failed to read the instructions &amp; used it as a leave in. *blank stare it works well. The only complaint, it foams up, so you don&#x27;t need to use too much. I finally used it the way it was intended, &amp; it works well when you wash your hair with it. Maybe it&#x27;s me, but it felt a little.....dare I say: greasy? I didn&#x27;t mind, as I&#x27;ma DAX fan!</li>
            <li> I have natural curly thick hair. I love ever curl shampoo and conditioner. my hair is softer and doesn&#x27;t  look bushy any more. Now as to the leave in cream, not the best I have used. I use mystic divine leave in curl cream. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling great!</li>
            <li> The smell of this gave me a migraine</li>
            <li> My hair waist-length and medium-to-coarse thickness with very low porosity. I think my curl form is 3A. This product gives my hair amazing bounce and shine. It also feels unusually moisturized and soft. My hair doesn&#x27;t usually clump well, but this helps with the clumping and if I keep my hair from rubbing my pillowcase too much, I&#x27;ll get up to three days of good curls with minimal frizz without touching up on product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the Cleansing Conditioner to wash my hair, the Gel/Cream on lightly-towel dried hair before I plop for at least thirty minutes, then the Leave-in Cream after I plop. Then I go to sleep and lay my hair flat to dry. It works amazingly well and I don&#x27;t get the same results from the Shampoo/Conditioner in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm with this product is that it gives me INSANE dandruff. I developed an itch after my first use, which was tolerable, but each time I use this product I just get dandruff for days. It&#x27;s the only product in the EverCurl line that gives me this reaction. Otherwise, this Cleansing Conditioner is the best thing my hair has ever known.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair clean, soft and with beautiful curls</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using for 3 weeks and my roots are too much oil... But the end of the hair is ok!</li>
            <li> This gave me a very itchy scalp and the worst dandruff</li>
            <li> I was a wen user so I had been looking for alternative wen.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Lisa Rachel,SG salon grafix and L&#x27;oreal evercreme(not this one, the another cleansing conditioner by L&#x27;oreal).&lt;br /&gt;This product is the best I have ever tried!!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t say this is better than wen, I honestly like wen so much better, but I cant afford wen thats why I had been looking for something cheaper and works like wen.&lt;br /&gt;This product is actually better than L&#x27;oreal evercreme cleansing conditioner, it smells nicer and less smell.&lt;br /&gt;Evercreme was also good product, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the way they smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy and thick hair, this product makes my hair very soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it made my scalp refreshing like wen does, if so it can become better than wen for me.&lt;br /&gt;However I will keep buying this for sure!!</li>
            <li> I just started using cleansing conditioners instead of the traditional shampoo and conditioners that I have used for years.  I have curly hair, and nothing was getting it to unfrizz and stay calm plus look really healthy.  If I did use the standard shampoo and conditioner it would look good for one day and the next day was dry and frizzy again.  My bathroom cabinet began to look like one of the shelves at the store with all the different brands of hair products.  I got so frustrated I almost gave up.  It costs so much to buy the higher end conditioners as I go thru them so fast it just wasn&#x27;t economical for me.  After all the positive reviews I saw for the Loreal conditioning cleansers I gave them a try.  The first time my hair came out fantastic!  It was so soft and bouncy and the curls were so much less frizzy and dry.  The second time I used it seemed like my hair felt more dry and stiff while wet but once it dried it was lovely.  I figured out your hair has an adjustment period to go thru.  It also helps to add the leave in conditioner they have that goes with this cleansing conditioner if your hair feels a tad dry.  I also use the loreal gel cream too which has a nice scent and helps give the curls more holding power.  But I have noticed that with my hair I need to also use a tad of my regular gel too the next day as the gel cream has a light hold while my regular gel has a strong hold.  but with the cleansing conditioner I am able to use less gel which is a plus!  My hairs overall condition has improved a lot using the cleansing conditioner.  the color seems brighter (I color my hair) and the color is lasting longer.  My hair is much softer and less frizzy.  I also like that instead of having two bottles in the shower I can have just one and the smell of the product in my hair isn&#x27;t overwhelming but does smell nice and lasts thru the next day.  I think the cleansing conditioners are a great discovery and really good overall for your hair.  My scalp is also less dry and itchy since I have been using this.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but it is a learning curve to get the right cleansing method for your hair.  I have to use about 10 pumps of the conditioner to work thru my hair.  I divide my hair in sections and saturate each section while gently massaging my scalp with my finger pads.  I work it into each section of my scalp massaging gently each area.  Once I am done with a good scalp massage I comb thru with a wide tooth comb very gently.  Then I put a shower cap on for the duration of my shower.  Then I rinse out my hair very well and the last rinse I use a cold blast of water.  I towel dry my hair and apply the leave in conditioner and gel.  I rake thru both with my fingers and then let air dry.  I use the cleansing conditioner every couple of days.  I noticed that I can go longer between washing as well and my hair still looks good and doesn&#x27;t get dry.  My recommendation is to give it a try and give it some time.  It has really improved my hair!</li>
            <li> This product was a miss for my curly African American 3c hair.  Not pleased with the dull dry no shine look, the last time I looked like this I had used Wen.  Washed one time and my scalp didn&#x27;t feel clean and was kind of itchy.</li>
            <li> After spending a lot of money with several different shampoos that only dried my hair further, then switching to expensive cleansing conditioners that were gentle but just too costly (WEN, Deva Care, etc.), I finally found the best hair cleanser for the lowest price. I tell everyone about it. I just love it! Both the  Evercurl and the Evercreme are awesome!</li>
            <li> It was shipped really fast and on time. I like this product because is 100% vegan, doesn&#x27;t have parabens, sulfates or silicones. I recommend to anyone who is starting no poo. I am reviewing right now the shipping and the product itself. I didn&#x27;t start to use yet, but as soon as I use I&#x27;ll post another review about the effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> Used this twice now. It leaves a heavy residue inspite of rinsing repeatedly. It controls frizz by leaving a heavy waxy coating that looks and feel crappy. I have thick dry wavy hair. Prefer Pantene cowash</li>
            <li> My girls with super curly hair love it!</li>
            <li> This works great for my brittle, fine, curly hair that I wash about once a week. Nice to only have to use one product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My hair was lying flat even though I have naturally curly hair. I figured the winter weather dried it out. But then I used this product and &amp;#34;welcome back curls.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using cleansing conditioners instead of harsh shampoos and now I can enthusiastically recommend this specific cleansing conditioner for anyone with natural curl to their hair. You won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My hair has never felt softer! I definitely recommend this. I also recommend Loreal evercurl hydracharge leave in conditiomer, because this conditioner tangles. I have had a lot of success working it in with a wide tooth comb. Also, make sure you rinse it all the way out</li>
            <li> I hated the smell of this product.  I threw it out after one use.  Seriously, smell it before buying it!</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer not on Amazon. I didn&#x27;t read reviews here first but maybe I should have. I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;oreal products just in recent years (was finally \\&quot;worth it\\&quot;) and mostly have been happy. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or not but there is NO way I could use this cleanser alone without other products: if I did  L&#x27;oreal would surely not want my hair as their poster child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You fellow Seinfeld fans may understand. Remember the low-flow shower episode where everybody was walking around with the \\&quot;flat head\\&quot; hair look? Well, that&#x27;s the L&#x27;oreal Ever Curl Cleansing Conditioner look on me! It&#x27;s just...odd. My hair is wavy/curly, on the dry side, particularly on top, where I&#x27;ve got silver mixed in (looks like blonde since my natural hair is light) and since the texture there changed in my early 30&#x27;s (surprise! Grr). After using this, the top of my shoulder-length hair is total flat-head and then further down is wavy in spots. Being that it&#x27;s winter it&#x27;s also mildly flyaway and staticky after the cleanser. IF I add another product I can calm it down and get soft body, but this is a curl product! I don&#x27;t want it to flatten my curls!  All my hair then comes forward into my face since the cleanser seems to weigh it down. Also, as others mention, it IS difficult to rinse out; I suspect it accumulates in my hair, exacerbating the problem. I&#x27;d bite my vanity and post a photo but without a contrasting photo to show how good my hair CAN look, I&#x27;m afraid there isn&#x27;t much point (I don&#x27;t think Amazon will post photos that aren&#x27;t specifically of the product at hand). It just didn&#x27;t work for me. Fooey.</li>
            <li> Smells like old T-shirts</li>
            <li> I like this product, great for wavy curly course hair. Smells great and hair feels clean but moist</li>
            <li> Horrible smell not like the other Loreal products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use shampoo every time I wash my hair, so I loved that L&#x27;Oreal introduced a cleansing conditioner.  Perfect.  My hair feels great afterwards.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product--her hair looks healthier and cleaner, and her curls look more natural (if that makes any sense!). To top it off, the product smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> TOO STRONGLY SCENTED.</li>
            <li> This stuff has changed my hair for the better drastically and it&#x27;s only been a few weeks!  My curls are more defined and my hair feels much much healthier and less frizzy with significantly less breakage.  It is super thick, though, so make sure you wash it out VERY thoroughly.  I use a clarifying shampoo every once in a while if I start to feel build-up.  I originally used 8 pumps (as the bottle says) but felt there was too much build-up too fast and now only use 4-5 pumps, which seems to be my sweet spot.  An employee at Ulta recommended this to me and swears by the stuff.  I can see why!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I didn&#x27;t have curly hair before giving birth to my twins, so I didn&#x27;t know how to manage it. If I just let it air dry, it would be frizzy. Then I started using this product. I have thick, salon-colored hair, curly hairy and this product is great. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp or my hair. It leaves it shiny and soft. It&#x27;s also time-saving, because it&#x27;s only one step, and I can skip a day if I want to. I still have to add styling products, but the health of my hair is wonderful. I have never used WEN, so I can&#x27;t compare the two. The only other cleansing conditioner I use is the L&#x27;Oreal EverCream Cleansing Conditioner, which I use when I want to blow my hair out straight.</li>
            <li> The item arrived with a cracked pump. I have mixed, curly hair and this cleansing conditioner was a bit thick and heavy. It&#x27;ll work as the cleanser after the gym, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day. The smell was also off-putting.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. Found it left my hair dry and flyaway. Also had to use a ton of it. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the Loreal cleansing conditioner in the gold bottle for 6 months, and accidentally ordered this one about 2 months ago--I love cleansing conditioners in general, and have noted that even compared to the regular one (gold bottle), this one is even better--my hair is so soft and manageable, my ends have had significantly less splits (so I can grow it longer), but my hair is really soft. Like, so soft, I look like a moron playing with it all of the time. I&#x27;m converting to this one and not switching back! Happy accidents!</li>
            <li> It works great, but has a really displeasing odor.</li>
            <li> I have short /medium fine curly hair. This is the first cleansing conditioner that actually cleans and conditions my hair without weighing it down.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Bought this after getting tired of using either heavy products that weigh my hair down or others that leave it dry and frizzy. This stuff leaves my hair light so my hair curls like it should, and is one simple step, no separate shampoo and conditioner. Works even better when you combine it with the ever curl leave in conditioner cream.</li>
            <li> it leaves residue in my hair and i didn&#x27;t see any improvement in the health of my hair. it also has a very strong chemical smell that stays in your hair long after you wash it. the regular EverCurl shampoo is much better and i did see better results health wise, it also doesn&#x27;t have the chemical smell or leave residue.</li>
            <li> I co-cleanse with this product and it works great.  My hair never feels greasy, nor is it dry.  It smells strange in your hand, but somehow good on your hair.</li>
            <li> I started out buying this for occasional use when I was short on time. I now use it every day. My hair feels and looks better and it does save me a few minutes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do  make another variety, so if this one over/under conditions for you try the EverCreme.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for my curly hair!</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price. It made my curl hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Love this product, just with my thick hair I have to use more so didn&#x27;t last me long, but just means I need to get the bigger bottle next time! ❤️&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never been softer and healthier!!!</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair that shoulder length.  Although I keep it layered, it tends to dry on the ends and frizz.  I&#x27;ve tried various shampoos recommended for advertised to be for my type hair but with little success.  Everything I tried left my hair too dry.  When I considered using a non-foaming, I ordered Wen shampoo and conditioner.  After one week I returned the products.  I was using Organics with coconut oil until I read about this line for curly hair by L&#x27;Oreal.  It smells great, gets my hair clean, and with every-other-day use, keeps the frizz to a minimum.  I let my hair dry naturally then comb it out with a wide-toothed comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I use about half the amount specified in the directions.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how odorous this product is!  At first, I thought the smell was okay. But even though my hair looked great, I could only leave it down for about two hours before the smell overwhelmed me.  I pulled it back into a bun to try to get away from that terrible odor. It smells like I washed my hair with a combination of slightly moldy rose petals and cigarette butts.  Like I said, my hair was curling very nicely, but what good is that if I just have to wreck the patten by pulling it in a bun to lessen the smell?  I have a nearly full bottle that I will be unable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are at all sensitive to smells, avoid this product!</li>
            <li> Cleans curly hair, less harsh than shampoo, a one-step process. Some of these co-washes are ridiculously over-priced. I can&#x27;t think why it&#x27;s no longer available in drug stores.</li>
            <li> I have thick, natural curly, color treated hair, and have never found anything that&#x27;s worked better!  This stuff is truly amazing.!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go back to using regular shampoo and conditioner again. Unfortunately it&#x27;s much cheaper at Wal-Mart, I was hoping to find a deal on Amazon in larger bottles, but no such luck:( please don&#x27;t hesitate to try if you have curly hair!</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner is AMAZING!!!!  I will never use anything else as long as they continue to make this!!!!!  I have medium length color treated naturally curly hair and my results with this are fantastic. A terrific side benefit is that my scalp and hair stay oil free for several days after use so I can go 2-3 days without having to shampoo again which is great for my hair!  I never experienced this with regular shampoo even if I didn&#x27;t use conditioner. My hair as always oily the next day at the scalp and I had to use dry shampoo if I didn&#x27;t want to cleanse my hair each and every day. This is truly an INCREDIBLE product!!!!</li>
            <li> I had heard that the low lather shampoos would not strip the hair of oils or fade out your color.  So I bought three such products.  Wen was super expensive and left my hair soft but kind of stiff looking.  L&#x27;Oreal Paris was a little bit better but I don&#x27;t think I would order this again.  It does clean your hair but lots of hair loss with each use.  I will keep looking for something better.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for my long, thick, curly hair. My hair feels clean, without being dry or frizzy. I use this everyday and go through about a bottle a month. I recommend this to everyone I meet with curly hair. Stop washing your curly hair everyday and give this a try.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes your hair nice and soft. I love it. It smells wonderful. The price is good. Only&lt;br /&gt;Thing is that the pump only lets out a little conditioner at a time so I end up having to pump like 25 times! I guess I should just take the pump off....</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell this in any local store where I&#x27;ve looked for it anymore, so I started using substitute products.  Needless to say, they were inferior to this product which is why I order it from Amazon online and hope it&#x27;s always available.  It makes my hair soft and moisturizes it without making it greasy or gunky.  I get more compliments on my natural hair in the several years I&#x27;ve used this product because it is healthier, thicker, fuller, and looks &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> Love the fact that you can wash your hair and not have to use products that have sulfates and soap up.  This product leaves your hair conditioned.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that I am natural and it&#x27;s hard to find a decent priced product to work with my hair type and this stuff is really good, it cleans my hair with no residue or no problem, but as far as slip goes, it&#x27;s ok and I love how it has a low lathering so my hair feels extra clean without using a shampoo, and for that matter I will make sure I repurchase this again!</li>
            <li> Better than some I have tried. My hair is curly and frizzy.. Didn&#x27;t help the frizz, but it made my hair somewhat soft.</li>
