            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Pro-Health for over a week and haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reactions.  </li>
            <li>of that out of the way, the benefits of this mouthwash for your teeth and gums are great and it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol so avoids a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is pleasant to use, without the burning sensation that some mouthwashes have.</li>
            <li>Indeed, I like it not having alcohol which can sometimes produce a burning sensation and it tastes good when rinsing without leaving an aftertaste.</li>
            <li>This is a bit sharper in taste than the wintergreen but does not burn like Listerine and seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>The good thing is you get a lot of product.  </li>
            <li>Loved the design and grip of the bottle-coloring is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay...no more fooling around for me!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking, for whatever reason, for a mouthwash without alcohol, this is the first one we tried and the best one we&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>The mint flavoring is pleasant and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of fresheniong the breath, something that, as someone who is in sales, is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels like this product is effective immediately after use, but using this every night for about 5 days in a row, my tongue starts to feel like it&#x27;s burnt when I wake up the morning.</li>
            <li>This mouth rinse has a nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li>This one has a nice one.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find an alcohol-free mouthwash with fluoride....until my teeth turned brown.</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-Health Rinse has a nice minty taste that seems to stick with me until morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice minty taste with almost no burn</li>
            <li>Crest mouthwash is highly recommended in the excellent book [[ASIN:1929774672 Kiss Your Dentist</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 4 star (I like it) for a mouthwash product that&#x27;s as good as any and better than most.</li>
            <li>I find it works just like Scope, with a strong burning flavor that results in a very potent fresh-breath effect.</li>
            <li>We always have one of Crest&#x27;s pro-health, alcohol free mouthwashes on our sink and manage to stay healthy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll preface by saying that I&#x27;m in my 20s, don&#x27;t drink more than a couple cups of coffee/tea a week</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m at a healthy weight that I maintain mostly by food choices, and I&#x27;ve always been a bit lax in the flossing department, but I brush every day.</li>
            <li>not all Crest Mouthwash is alcohol free!  </li>
            <li>I am supposed to use this twice a day, but I will not use one more drop.</li>
            <li>but I believe it can also be found in lemonade, most ice cream flavors and club soda).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Most mouthwash product and most toothpaste products have it</li>
            <li>Between the two of these, I haven&#x27;t had any dental problems for many years.</li>
            <li>and while that was more of what I needed, the taste was not to my liking.  </li>
            <li>cuz I gave Crest ONE MORE TRY and tried THIS VARIETY, the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>cuz I gave Crest ONE MORE TRY and tried THIS VARIETY, the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I did not know what was causing the staining on my teeth until I did more research into this product.</li>
            <li>There are many complaints about it causing the stains.</li>
            <li>and I prefer a mouthwash with a more stimulating flavor and the tingling effect given by alcohol.  </li>
            <li>If used only once, it is best to use it in the evening before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>If used only once, it is best to use it in the evening before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>love rinsing before</li>
            <li>or perhaps I just got more used to it.  </li>
            <li>No cavities and healthy gums</li>
            <li>Try as I might, I haven&#x27;t been able to get brown spots on my teeth from this mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Strong but not to strong-has a light mint taste which is nice.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth really feeling clean with a great taste as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give this two stars since it does offer some benefits, but 1.5 stars is a more accurate rating.</li>
            <li>The most important thing about mouthwash for me is the aftertaste.</li>
            <li>Fresh Mint is a nice flavor.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my mouth nice and fresh for extended time</li>
            <li>My teeth and tongue are notably cleaner and minty fresh!  </li>

            <li>Also, its cap is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>and after I brush and The Crest Pro-Health rinse gives my mouth the clean feeling that I love.</li>
            <li>It come sealed with a plastic covering which comes off easily</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
            <li>Otherwise though, the product works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was recommended by my dentist to use alcohol free mouthwash during my pregnancy, and it worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>When there are plenty of fluoride rinses available that don&#x27;t cause staining and don&#x27;t burn like fire, why would I choose this one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The crest mouthwashes have the highest available amount of fluoride, which is what you want in a mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it alcohol free and has fluoride.</li>
            <li>but it sure makes my mouth feel fresh for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been impressed with the Crest Pro-Health line and have been using their toothpaste from that line for a few months now.</li>
            <li>So, if you are using an alcohol free mouthwash, you are using an antimicrobial.</li>
            <li>I am not a big mouth wash person but this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good that the Complete has it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love, right?</li>
            <li>First of all, the Act tastes MUCH better.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Clean check-ups have kept on coming after we switched, and we&#x27;ve grown so used to the lack of what we thought of as a \\&quot;medicine-y aftertaste\\</li>

            <li>Also, my toothpaste leans towards the peppermint side of things so the Clean Mint clashed with the taste of my</li>
            <li>It has a bright blue color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No burning sensation and obviously contains ingredients that are good for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>, this is a good big bottle</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is true or</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a bad mouthwash.</li>
            <li>The dentist has recommended a rinse like this following flossing and brushing, and this particular product has a good taste (important when you have to rinse for a minute with it) and a comfortable clean feeling afterward.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Tastes better, more concentrated, and doesn&#x27;t have the potential to stain teeth.</li>
            <li>but it does have a tremendous amount of peroxide that is reputed to whiten one&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li>taste is mild but minty and</li>
            <li>This year, II made it my New Year&#x27;s resolution to get on top of my dental routine, and a couple months ago I added Crest Pro-Health mouthwash to my routine.</li>
            <li>it tasted a little too sweet and more like Spearmint AND had Alcohol in it to boot, which was a surprise since most of the Pro-Health line is Alcohol Free.  </li>
            <li>my breath feeling fresh</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, minty taste.</li>
            <li>The taste is fresh and minty and since it has no alcohol there&#x27;s no irritant associated with that.  </li>
            <li>but her dad, a retired cop, swears on a stack of Bibles that you can blow a positive breathylizer test for \\&quot;being under the influence\\&quot; if you get stopped within 20 minutes of a good, long rinse and spit.  </li>
            <li>and it is jusssssssst right taste-wise</li>
            <li>and it is jusssssssst right taste-wise</li>
            <li>This is a healthy and complete mouthwash that the entire family can use and will love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad no one had a video of me trying to open this for the first time!</li>
            <li>This particular flavor, fresh mint, is both minty and fresh.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Complete has fluoride and is alcohol free.</li>
            <li>Be aware though that not all Crest mouthwashes contain fluoride, but this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it - most mouthwashes have the same ingredients unless you want whitening agents added.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was already self-conscious about teeth that are not white and decided to step up her dental care with more brushing, flossing, and mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and use it daily now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t verify any positive results from using the Rinse</li>
            <li>I rubbed straight hot sauce on my tongue and thought that I had found relief, but now that the spice has dissipated, I still taste Crest Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete Fresh Mint mouthwash is a nice rinse that doesn&#x27;t give that stinging feeling as do other mouthwashes that contain alcohol.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I didn&#x27;t have any teeth staining issues when I used this Crest Complete Pro-Health mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Complete has a mild minty flavor and contains fluoride.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works very well...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been very helpful in improving my oral health.</li>
            <li>My dentist wants me to use a fluoride rinse before going to bed</li>
            <li>I also wonder if these people are tea drinker or coffee drinkers as well since the triple flouride exposure combined with stains from Tea, Cofeee nd even wine can really be a problem.  </li>

            <li>I use this product as much as three times a day: once in the morning, once in the afternoon when I get home from work and plan to leave again, and once in the evening.  </li>

            <li>I have tried this also compared to other alcohol free offerings and there is no comparison!</li>
            <li>There is some speculation that using mouthwash with alcohol may contribute to gum cancer but several dentists whom I have spoken with said this isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li>This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental</li>
            <li>The main difference I find with this Crest Pro-Health version is the after taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The back label states that in some cases rinses may cause staining of teeth and that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist.</li>

            <li>This is not permanent or harmful and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental</li>
            <li>Prior to using Crest Pro Health Complete, I had been using Crest Pro Health Multi-Protection and I could not taste or notice any difference between the two with the exception they have two different caps where Complete has the kind of child lock that you have to push in to twist.  </li>
            <li>I usually brush with baking soda a couple of times a week in between cleaning visits to keep my teeth as bright as possible and can&#x27;t say that I have noticed drastically darker teeth with this rinse versus any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this Pro-Health version leaves a slightly different more sweet/artificial taste instead, which lasts a long time, even when you&#x27;re eating and drinking.</li>
            <li>Glamorous White - Fresh Mint 473 Ml (Pack of 12)]]].  </li>
            <li>I do tend to like the green version better for its taste</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing as long as it leaves the mouth feeling \\&quot;fresh,\\&quot; which it does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as a person with a health condition that can mess with teeth and two parents whose parents couldn&#x27;t afford routine dental care for their children during the 50s, 60s, and early 70s, I&#x27;m just tickled to have all of my teeth at the ripe old age of 27 and don&#x27;t obsess over bleaching or having unnaturally white and bright teeth.</li>
            <li>I believe the main reason I bought the Crest 3D was because the mouthwash is clear and wouldn&#x27;t stain my vanity&#x27;s countertop like other mouthwashes have, especially the bright blue ones.  </li>
            <li>This is the new trend in mouthwash.</li>
            <li>The Amazon Vine Program was gracious enough to mail me a 1 liter bottle of Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete, Fresh Mint.  </li>
            <li>My advice is to buy a mouthwash that you will enjoy USING because, in order for it to work properly, you will need to actually USE it.  </li>
            <li>My advice is to buy a mouthwash that you will enjoy USING because, in order for it to work properly, you will need to actually USE it.  </li>
            <li>It offers fresh breath without that burning sensation you are used to from traditional brands like Listerine.</li>
            <li>Mostly giving it a low review due to the burning sensation and inability to taste things normally for up to 24 hours after use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t EVER use this product, unless you want stained, sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s astringent and will aggravate any small nicks or cuts you have in your mouth but that sensation dissipates the more you use it</li>
            <li>and I tend to like the alcoholic versions better for the taste and lack of parabens.  </li>
            <li>Crest looked appealing in that it also is alcohol-free, and contains the same active ingredient (sodium fluoride).</li>
            <li>People who prefer a less assertive mouthwash will enjoy using this.</li>
            <li>Some light tingling, but not the &amp;#34;fire&amp;#34; of previous alcohol based rinses.</li>
            <li>Initial light minty taste is fine, but aftertaste lingers forever and is not pleasant.</li>
            <li>I filled the little threaded cup inside the lid and did a thorough one-minute rinse as directed.</li>
            <li>The Complete is promoted as Crest&#x27;s &#x27;all-purpose&#x27; mouthwash.</li>
            <li>flouride needs have been met, there are several natural brands that can give you the same fresh breath and none of the stains.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m also seeing the staining issue, mainly in crevices between my bottom front teeth, but as a consistent coffee drinker, have found that it helps with coffee stains even though it creates other stains in the process.  </li>
            <li>Several years ago, I began using Crest 3D White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse Glamorous White, Fresh Mint [[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>A short while after the rinse as I was getting ready for bed, I decided to get up and do a thorough water rinse to get the flavor out of my mouth, and I brushed my tongue and interior cheeks off as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So generally I use this mouthwash after brushing my teeth at night, before going to bed.</li>
            <li>but I do wonder if they are rinsing too long or possibly seeing staining from too much flouride.  </li>

            <li>I really like that there is no burning sensation that you can get with other brands of mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>six alleged benefits such as &#x27;rebuilds enamel&#x27; (really?</li>
            <li>I wonder if it&#x27;s like those pink pills the dentist would bring to us in Elementary school that would temporarily turn all your plaque pink so that you knew where to brush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Burns a little on first use .Leaves</li>
            <li>The biggest difference is in the labeling, sure they both promise to freshen breath, have no burn of alcohol (which they do), but where Multi-Protection also claims to kill germs, reduce plaque, help prevent gingivitis, and keep teeth cleaner longer, despite being labeled \\&quot;complete\\&quot; the Complete version does none other these but does claims ton rebuild enamel, help prevent cavities, clean teeth and gums, and kill bad breath germs.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using the Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete, Fresh Mint, to anyone who wants to prevent cavities, chancre sores, gum disease, and bad breath.  </li>

            <li>After a few weeks of using the product, I don&#x27;t have any, but I&#x27;m certainly concerned that I would have some with prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>

            <li> I find it works just like Scope, with a strong burning flavor that results in a very potent fresh-breath effect.</li>
            <li> We always have one of Crest&#x27;s pro-health, alcohol free mouthwashes on our sink and manage to stay healthy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface by saying that I&#x27;m in my 20s, don&#x27;t drink more than a couple cups of coffee/tea a week</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m at a healthy weight that I maintain mostly by food choices, and I&#x27;ve always been a bit lax in the flossing department, but I brush every day.</li>
            <li> not all Crest Mouthwash is alcohol free!  </li>
            <li> I am supposed to use this twice a day, but I will not use one more drop.</li>
            <li> but I believe it can also be found in lemonade, most ice cream flavors and club soda).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Most mouthwash product and most toothpaste products have it</li>
            <li> Between the two of these, I haven&#x27;t had any dental problems for many years.</li>
            <li> and while that was more of what I needed, the taste was not to my liking.  </li>

            <li> I did not know what was causing the staining on my teeth until I did more research into this product.</li>
            <li> There are many complaints about it causing the stains.</li>
            <li> and I prefer a mouthwash with a more stimulating flavor and the tingling effect given by alcohol.  </li>
            <li> If used only once, it is best to use it in the evening before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> If used only once, it is best to use it in the evening before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> love rinsing before</li>
            <li> or perhaps I just got more used to it.  </li>
            <li> No cavities and healthy gums</li>
            <li> Try as I might, I haven&#x27;t been able to get brown spots on my teeth from this mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> Strong but not to strong-has a light mint taste which is nice.</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth really feeling clean with a great taste as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this two stars since it does offer some benefits, but 1.5 stars is a more accurate rating.</li>
            <li> The most important thing about mouthwash for me is the aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Fresh Mint is a nice flavor.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my mouth nice and fresh for extended time</li>
            <li> My teeth and tongue are notably cleaner and minty fresh!  </li>

            <li> Also, its cap is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> and after I brush and The Crest Pro-Health rinse gives my mouth the clean feeling that I love.</li>
            <li> It come sealed with a plastic covering which comes off easily</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
            <li> Otherwise though, the product works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was recommended by my dentist to use alcohol free mouthwash during my pregnancy, and it worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> When there are plenty of fluoride rinses available that don&#x27;t cause staining and don&#x27;t burn like fire, why would I choose this one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The crest mouthwashes have the highest available amount of fluoride, which is what you want in a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it alcohol free and has fluoride.</li>
            <li> but it sure makes my mouth feel fresh for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed with the Crest Pro-Health line and have been using their toothpaste from that line for a few months now.</li>
            <li> So, if you are using an alcohol free mouthwash, you are using an antimicrobial.</li>
            <li> I am not a big mouth wash person but this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s good that the Complete has it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love, right?</li>
            <li> First of all, the Act tastes MUCH better.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Clean check-ups have kept on coming after we switched, and we&#x27;ve grown so used to the lack of what we thought of as a \\&quot;medicine-y aftertaste\\</li>

            <li> No burning sensation and obviously contains ingredients that are good for oral hygiene.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is true or</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a bad mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The dentist has recommended a rinse like this following flossing and brushing, and this particular product has a good taste (important when you have to rinse for a minute with it) and a comfortable clean feeling afterward.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Tastes better, more concentrated, and doesn&#x27;t have the potential to stain teeth.</li>
            <li> but it does have a tremendous amount of peroxide that is reputed to whiten one&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li> taste is mild but minty and</li>
            <li> This year, II made it my New Year&#x27;s resolution to get on top of my dental routine, and a couple months ago I added Crest Pro-Health mouthwash to my routine.</li>
            <li> it tasted a little too sweet and more like Spearmint AND had Alcohol in it to boot, which was a surprise since most of the Pro-Health line is Alcohol Free.  </li>
            <li> my breath feeling fresh</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, minty taste.</li>
            <li> The taste is fresh and minty and since it has no alcohol there&#x27;s no irritant associated with that.  </li>
            <li> but her dad, a retired cop, swears on a stack of Bibles that you can blow a positive breathylizer test for \\&quot;being under the influence\\&quot; if you get stopped within 20 minutes of a good, long rinse and spit.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad no one had a video of me trying to open this for the first time!</li>
            <li> This particular flavor, fresh mint, is both minty and fresh.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Complete has fluoride and is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> Be aware though that not all Crest mouthwashes contain fluoride, but this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it - most mouthwashes have the same ingredients unless you want whitening agents added.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was already self-conscious about teeth that are not white and decided to step up her dental care with more brushing, flossing, and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and use it daily now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t verify any positive results from using the Rinse</li>
            <li> I rubbed straight hot sauce on my tongue and thought that I had found relief, but now that the spice has dissipated, I still taste Crest Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete Fresh Mint mouthwash is a nice rinse that doesn&#x27;t give that stinging feeling as do other mouthwashes that contain alcohol.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I didn&#x27;t have any teeth staining issues when I used this Crest Complete Pro-Health mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Complete has a mild minty flavor and contains fluoride.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works very well...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been very helpful in improving my oral health.</li>
            <li> My dentist wants me to use a fluoride rinse before going to bed</li>

            <li> I have tried this also compared to other alcohol free offerings and there is no comparison!</li>
            <li> There is some speculation that using mouthwash with alcohol may contribute to gum cancer but several dentists whom I have spoken with said this isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li> This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental</li>
            <li> The main difference I find with this Crest Pro-Health version is the after taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The back label states that in some cases rinses may cause staining of teeth and that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist.</li>

            <li> Prior to using Crest Pro Health Complete, I had been using Crest Pro Health Multi-Protection and I could not taste or notice any difference between the two with the exception they have two different caps where Complete has the kind of child lock that you have to push in to twist.  </li>
            <li> I usually brush with baking soda a couple of times a week in between cleaning visits to keep my teeth as bright as possible and can&#x27;t say that I have noticed drastically darker teeth with this rinse versus any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this Pro-Health version leaves a slightly different more sweet/artificial taste instead, which lasts a long time, even when you&#x27;re eating and drinking.</li>
            <li> Glamorous White - Fresh Mint 473 Ml (Pack of 12)]]].  </li>
            <li> I do tend to like the green version better for its taste</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing as long as it leaves the mouth feeling \\&quot;fresh,\\&quot; which it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as a person with a health condition that can mess with teeth and two parents whose parents couldn&#x27;t afford routine dental care for their children during the 50s, 60s, and early 70s, I&#x27;m just tickled to have all of my teeth at the ripe old age of 27 and don&#x27;t obsess over bleaching or having unnaturally white and bright teeth.</li>
            <li> I believe the main reason I bought the Crest 3D was because the mouthwash is clear and wouldn&#x27;t stain my vanity&#x27;s countertop like other mouthwashes have, especially the bright blue ones.  </li>
            <li> This is the new trend in mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The Amazon Vine Program was gracious enough to mail me a 1 liter bottle of Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete, Fresh Mint.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to buy a mouthwash that you will enjoy USING because, in order for it to work properly, you will need to actually USE it.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to buy a mouthwash that you will enjoy USING because, in order for it to work properly, you will need to actually USE it.  </li>
            <li> It offers fresh breath without that burning sensation you are used to from traditional brands like Listerine.</li>
            <li> Mostly giving it a low review due to the burning sensation and inability to taste things normally for up to 24 hours after use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t EVER use this product, unless you want stained, sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s astringent and will aggravate any small nicks or cuts you have in your mouth but that sensation dissipates the more you use it</li>
            <li> and I tend to like the alcoholic versions better for the taste and lack of parabens.  </li>
            <li> Crest looked appealing in that it also is alcohol-free, and contains the same active ingredient (sodium fluoride).</li>
            <li> People who prefer a less assertive mouthwash will enjoy using this.</li>
            <li> Some light tingling, but not the &amp;#34;fire&amp;#34; of previous alcohol based rinses.</li>
            <li> Initial light minty taste is fine, but aftertaste lingers forever and is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I filled the little threaded cup inside the lid and did a thorough one-minute rinse as directed.</li>
            <li> The Complete is promoted as Crest&#x27;s &#x27;all-purpose&#x27; mouthwash.</li>
            <li> flouride needs have been met, there are several natural brands that can give you the same fresh breath and none of the stains.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m also seeing the staining issue, mainly in crevices between my bottom front teeth, but as a consistent coffee drinker, have found that it helps with coffee stains even though it creates other stains in the process.  </li>
            <li> Several years ago, I began using Crest 3D White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse Glamorous White, Fresh Mint [[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> A short while after the rinse as I was getting ready for bed, I decided to get up and do a thorough water rinse to get the flavor out of my mouth, and I brushed my tongue and interior cheeks off as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So generally I use this mouthwash after brushing my teeth at night, before going to bed.</li>
            <li> but I do wonder if they are rinsing too long or possibly seeing staining from too much flouride.  </li>
            <li> but I do wonder if they are rinsing too long or possibly seeing staining from too much flouride.  </li>

            <li> I really like that there is no burning sensation that you can get with other brands of mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> six alleged benefits such as &#x27;rebuilds enamel&#x27; (really?</li>
            <li> I wonder if it&#x27;s like those pink pills the dentist would bring to us in Elementary school that would temporarily turn all your plaque pink so that you knew where to brush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Burns a little on first use .Leaves</li>
            <li> The biggest difference is in the labeling, sure they both promise to freshen breath, have no burn of alcohol (which they do), but where Multi-Protection also claims to kill germs, reduce plaque, help prevent gingivitis, and keep teeth cleaner longer, despite being labeled \\&quot;complete\\&quot; the Complete version does none other these but does claims ton rebuild enamel, help prevent cavities, clean teeth and gums, and kill bad breath germs.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using the Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete, Fresh Mint, to anyone who wants to prevent cavities, chancre sores, gum disease, and bad breath.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using the Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete, Fresh Mint, to anyone who wants to prevent cavities, chancre sores, gum disease, and bad breath.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using the product, I don&#x27;t have any, but I&#x27;m certainly concerned that I would have some with prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li> I have not even used a third of the bottle and have already developed dark brown stains between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, my dentist was able to clean up the mess with my normal checkup cleaning, but I feel incredibly sorry for the people who are looking for healthy teeth and end up with terrible stains.</li>
            <li> This should last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective against bad breath</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed an aftertaste long after.</li>
            <li> The most difficult thing for me was to not drink anything within a half hour of using it.  </li>
            <li> Crest toothpastes that contain stannous fluoride have the same warning as do products other that contain this type of fluoride.  </li>
            <li> I guess if you want a truly \\&quot;complete\\&quot; mouthwash, you will have to buy both products and alternate them every other day.</li>
            <li> Despite not having alcohol, my mouth still gets dry afterward.</li>
            <li> Within a month of morning and evening use (the bottle recommends 2x daily for &amp;#34;Better Dental Check-ups&amp;#34;) and flossing, I had HORRIBLE brownish stains along the edges and gums of my lower front teeth, and flossing those teeth was more painful and sensitive than when I first started the dreaded flossing routine!</li>
            <li> I religiously followed the directions to wait before eating, so morning coffee was not the culprit, and I was so desperate to find a solution that I went online and found HUNDREDS of other people with the exact same problem!!</li>
            <li> The Act has no such warning and, after a few years of daily use, I can firmly attest to the fact that Act does not stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He says he never wants to use this mouthwash</li>
            <li> tried the [[ASIN:B007JUIBMI Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Mouthwash 473 Ml]] but that had Hydrogen Peroxide in it, tasted like crap and required an extra step of rinsing your mouth with water afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that this does not have the usual tingle of my regular mouthwash</li>
            <li> My usual brand is Act Total Care since that comes in a non-alcohol formulation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Crest warns that tooth staining may occur, a situation cited by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Scope or some other versions of Crest mouthwash, it usually leaves your mouth with the same feeling you get when you have eat a breath mint.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my fingers and have had difficulty removing the child-proof caps from the bottles of other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> I have not lost my sense of taste like some have reported when using other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyosf caps from the bottles of other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> I have not lost my sense of taste like some have reported when using other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> I would say its comparable in results to other leading brands at maintaining berth freshness.</li>
            <li> listed active ingredient is, of course, sodium fluoride aka fluoride which does seem to provide an anti-cavity benefit.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have noticed with it is that it left a weird, dry feeling on my tongue.</li>
            <li> I really should have looked up some of the scary stuff online, but who has time for that at the grocery store?</li>
            <li> An internet search shows that complaints like this go back to at least 2008 - yet the product has not been changed.</li>
            <li> Then I would write down  or go over with ymy dentist, all the foods and drinks that can cause stains.  </li>
            <li> Then I would write down  or go over with ymy dentist, all the foods and drinks that can cause stains.  </li>
            <li> The concentration in the Crest Pro-Health is less than the once-a-day version of Act (0.0219% for the Crest; 0.05% for Act).</li>
            <li> It leaves an odd aftertaste though</li>
            <li> This mouth wash made me oddly thirsty.  </li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;m a little uit like Goldilocks</li>
            <li> but I worry a little since I see some reviewers are reporting that they are seeing stains on the plaque that has built up in-between their dental cleanings.  </li>
            <li> but I worry a little since I see some reviewers are reporting that they are seeing stains on the plaque that has built up in-between their dental cleanings.  </li>
            <li> There was a little tingling but no burn because this is an alcohol-free formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ever since I began using mouthwash on a daily basis nearly five years ago, I stopped getting painful chancre sores on the insides of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> book deals rather harshly with the dental profession, even though it&#x27;s written by a dentist.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any staining in the short time I have been using it, so maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be worried.</li>
            <li> Again nothing difficult here however if you get some on around your mouth or on your hands you&#x27;ll want to rinse completely since it leaves a sticky film.  </li>
            <li> If I want to rinse with Hydrogen Peroxide, I&#x27;ll follow my Dentist&#x27;s advice and do it once a week as a separate rinse and then finish up by rinsing with plain water to prevent the H2O2 from hanging around.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m shoving my face full of crap and then complaining about the sugar-rot like it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> Again, I have been looking for an anti-plaque rinse that does not feel like raw whiskey.</li>
            <li> but I was still shocked by how large it is.  </li>
            <li> And in the past when I&#x27;ve bought bottles of it, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever noticed it causing any discoloration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up with THAT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up with THAT</li>
            <li> For the past week I used Multiprotection after breakfast because I would like the benefits for my gums.</li>
            <li> I swish the mouthwash around my mouth for no more than thirty seconds to a minute before spitting out.  </li>
            <li> The bottle stated that there is a possibility of teeth being stained from long periods of usage but none of us have had that unfortunate</li>
            <li> Not sure why since there is no alcohol, but it burns so badly my 10 year old immediately began trying to rinse his mouth with water.</li>

            <li> Ever since I began using a mouthwash on a regular basis, I seldom catch a cold or flu.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the Crest Pro-Health rinses since I&#x27;m looking for one with a taste I can stand and one that doesn&#x27;t have alcohol as the base since that dries out my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I do not understand why Crest would sell a dental product that makes teeth look WORSE!</li>
            <li> so I am unable to give it 4 or 5 stars at this time.</li>
            <li> but if you are averse or unable to use one with that ingredient then this is your product.</li>
            <li> The Crest, however, tastes like a stale mint, and has an unpleasant aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the peroxide taste is very annoying to say the least.  </li>
            <li> The bad thing is it takes up counter space.  </li>
            <li> It is awful.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this stuff; it is awful!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t EVER use this product, unless you want stained, sensitive teeth! I&#x27;ll preface by saying that I&#x27;m in my 20s, don&#x27;t drink more than a couple cups of coffee/tea a week, I&#x27;m at a healthy weight that I maintain mostly by food choices, and I&#x27;ve always been a bit lax in the flossing department, but I brush every day. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m shoving my face full of crap and then complaining about the sugar-rot like it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s fault. This year, II made it my New Year&#x27;s resolution to get on top of my dental routine, and a couple months ago I added Crest Pro-Health mouthwash to my routine. I really should have looked up some of the scary stuff online, but who has time for that at the grocery store? Within a month of morning and evening use (the bottle recommends 2x daily for &amp;#34;Better Dental Check-ups&amp;#34;) and flossing, I had HORRIBLE brownish stains along the edges and gums of my lower front teeth, and flossing those teeth was more painful and sensitive than when I first started the dreaded flossing routine! I religiously followed the directions to wait before eating, so morning coffee was not the culprit, and I was so desperate to find a solution that I went online and found HUNDREDS of other people with the exact same problem!! How Crest can continue to market this product is beyond me, and their PR response is a patronizing joke. &amp;#34;Dirty teeth means it&#x27;s working!&amp;#34;, indeed! Thankfully, my dentist was able to clean up the mess with my normal checkup cleaning, but I feel incredibly sorry for the people who are looking for healthy teeth and end up with terrible stains. Shame on you, Crest/P&amp;G!</li>
            <li> Burns a little on first use .Leaves my breath feeling fresh</li>
            <li> Okay...no more fooling around for me!  This stuff works very well...does what it says at least for the parts I can see!  My teeth and tongue are notably cleaner and minty fresh!  Do watch out though...not all Crest Mouthwash is alcohol free!  I have tried both and the one with alcohol does not work as well as the ones without.  I have tried this also compared to other alcohol free offerings and there is no comparison!</li>
            <li> I usually use an alcohol based mouthwash but heard that alcohol dries your mouth out which is counterproductive to getting rid of bad breath. So I gave this a try. I&#x27;ve noticed that this does not have the usual tingle of my regular mouthwash but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing as long as it leaves the mouth feeling \\&quot;fresh,\\&quot; which it does. It&#x27;s effective against bad breath but I&#x27;ve noticed an aftertaste long after. In fact, I&#x27;ll use it at night and wake up in the morning with the taste still in my mouth which is a little unappealing. Despite not having alcohol, my mouth still gets dry afterward. Otherwise though, the product works fine.</li>
            <li> I tried this last night. I filled the little threaded cup inside the lid and did a thorough one-minute rinse as directed. A short while after the rinse as I was getting ready for bed, I decided to get up and do a thorough water rinse to get the flavor out of my mouth, and I brushed my tongue and interior cheeks off as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff absorbs and lingers. I woke up this morning and my mouth still tastes like Crest rinse. I did a water rinse and it remains. I had my coffee that tastes like Crest. It is awful. I rubbed straight hot sauce on my tongue and thought that I had found relief, but now that the spice has dissipated, I still taste Crest Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is seriously wrong here. I am supposed to use this twice a day, but I will not use one more drop. I do not want to taste Crest Pro-Health Rinse all the time. This is beyond disgusting, and I totally regret even trying this stuff. My advice to you is to stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get past the label, which says that the product may cause discoloration. After a few weeks of using the product, I don&#x27;t have any, but I&#x27;m certainly concerned that I would have some with prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Initial light minty taste is fine, but aftertaste lingers forever and is not pleasant. Licking my lips even 20 minutes later leaves me feeling like I&#x27;ve licked off the coating on rubber bands: you want to scrape if off your tongue.&lt;br /&gt;- Warning on label about discoloration of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No burning sensation and obviously contains ingredients that are good for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a fluoride rinse for a couple of years on the advice of my dentist. It&#x27;s been very helpful in improving my oral health. My usual brand is Act Total Care since that comes in a non-alcohol formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest looked appealing in that it also is alcohol-free, and contains the same active ingredient (sodium fluoride). The concentration in the Crest Pro-Health is less than the once-a-day version of Act (0.0219% for the Crest; 0.05% for Act). Both are used in the same manner: you swish 10 ml of the rinse for one minute, then avoid eating/drinking for 30 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after trying the Crest I&#x27;m sticking with Act. First of all, the Act tastes MUCH better. It has a fresh, minty taste. The Crest, however, tastes like a stale mint, and has an unpleasant aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More concerning is the possibility of tooth staining. The Crest warns that tooth staining may occur, a situation cited by other reviewers. The Act has no such warning and, after a few years of daily use, I can firmly attest to the fact that Act does not stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they offer the same benefits, I&#x27;ll stick with Act. Tastes better, more concentrated, and doesn&#x27;t have the potential to stain teeth. I&#x27;ll give this two stars since it does offer some benefits, but 1.5 stars is a more accurate rating. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> The Complete is promoted as Crest&#x27;s &#x27;all-purpose&#x27; mouthwash. While not counting them (unlike some competitors&#x27; products that claim \\&quot;six benefits in one\\&quot;) the label does list... six alleged benefits such as &#x27;rebuilds enamel&#x27; (really? how?) or &#x27;no burn of alcohol&#x27; (indeed a benefit but I believe it can also be found in lemonade, most ice cream flavors and club soda).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The listed active ingredient is, of course, sodium fluoride aka fluoride which does seem to provide an anti-cavity benefit. Most mouthwash product and most toothpaste products have it so it&#x27;s good that the Complete has it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a bad mouthwash. Indeed, I like it not having alcohol which can sometimes produce a burning sensation and it tastes good when rinsing without leaving an aftertaste. It&#x27;s a 4 star (I like it) for a mouthwash product that&#x27;s as good as any and better than most.</li>
            <li> It feels like this product is effective immediately after use, but using this every night for about 5 days in a row, my tongue starts to feel like it&#x27;s burnt when I wake up the morning. It has quite a noticeable negative effect on taste quality as well- food/drink can taste of for at least a day after this stuff.  I&#x27;m also seeing the staining issue, mainly in crevices between my bottom front teeth, but as a consistent coffee drinker, have found that it helps with coffee stains even though it creates other stains in the process.  Mostly giving it a low review due to the burning sensation and inability to taste things normally for up to 24 hours after use.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Complete has fluoride and is alcohol free. What&#x27;s not to love, right? Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it burns when you use it. Not sure why since there is no alcohol, but it burns so badly my 10 year old immediately began trying to rinse his mouth with water. He has been using a fluoride mouthwash twice a day since he was 6 so he is used to mouthwash taste. He says he never wants to use this mouthwash again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of his reaction, I began reading the label for a cause. Imagine my surprise when I read on the label:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;In some cases, rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What? When there are plenty of fluoride rinses available that don&#x27;t cause staining and don&#x27;t burn like fire, why would I choose this one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I didn&#x27;t have any teeth staining issues when I used this Crest Complete Pro-Health mouthwash. And in the past when I&#x27;ve bought bottles of it, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever noticed it causing any discoloration. I find it works just like Scope, with a strong burning flavor that results in a very potent fresh-breath effect. The main difference I find with this Crest Pro-Health version is the after taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Scope or some other versions of Crest mouthwash, it usually leaves your mouth with the same feeling you get when you have eat a breath mint. I&#x27;ve found this Pro-Health version leaves a slightly different more sweet/artificial taste instead, which lasts a long time, even when you&#x27;re eating and drinking. So generally I use this mouthwash after brushing my teeth at night, before going to bed. It helps prevent morning breath the next morning, and I instead use a different mouthwash as my daytime version. So this does work, but I prefer it as a nighttime mouthwash over a daytime one.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking, for whatever reason, for a mouthwash without alcohol, this is the first one we tried and the best one we&#x27;ve found.  Clean check-ups have kept on coming after we switched, and we&#x27;ve grown so used to the lack of what we thought of as a \\&quot;medicine-y aftertaste\\&quot; that I don&#x27;t think we could go back if we had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little expensive, but so&#x27;s everything.  And who wants fake teeth or bad breath?</li>
            <li> Crest mouthwash is highly recommended in the excellent book [[ASIN:1929774672 Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye: A Do-It-Yourself Mouth Care System for Healthy, Clean Gums and Teeth]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That book deals rather harshly with the dental profession, even though it&#x27;s written by a dentist. The crest mouthwashes have the highest available amount of fluoride, which is what you want in a mouthwash. Be aware though that not all Crest mouthwashes contain fluoride, but this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pleasant to use, without the burning sensation that some mouthwashes have. It does a great job of fresheniong the breath, something that, as someone who is in sales, is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this is a good big bottle and it&#x27;s a great price. This should last a long time. I alternate this one with [[ASIN:B001ET7L8K Closys Alcohol-Free Mouthwash, With Flavor Control, 32 Fluid Ounce (946 ml) (Pack of 2)]]That one doesn&#x27;t have fluoride, but it does have a nuclear blast of a chemical ingredient that kills any living organism in the mouth. Between the two of these, I haven&#x27;t had any dental problems for many years.</li>
            <li> I like the taste of this mouth rinse and how it makes my mouth feel after rinsing. I also like the fact that it alcohol free and has fluoride. My dentist wants me to use a fluoride rinse before going to bed so I was excited to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am troubled by a warning that it may stain teeth because of the fluoride in it. The back label states that in some cases rinses may cause staining of teeth and that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist. Crest toothpastes that contain stannous fluoride have the same warning as do products other that contain this type of fluoride.  I think people need to check with their dentists if they are concerned, as will I, when I my dentist is a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product I like the taste and the way it makes my mouth feel. Fresh Mint is a nice flavor.  I gave this five stars because of that and because in the week I have been using this I have not noticed any stains.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it - most mouthwashes have the same ingredients unless you want whitening agents added.  I&#x27;ve tried a few of the Crest Pro-Health rinses since I&#x27;m looking for one with a taste I can stand and one that doesn&#x27;t have alcohol as the base since that dries out my mouth.  My wife also worries about me rinsing with an Alcohol-based mouthwash, stepping out the door and driving to work with the smell of alcohol on my breath.  I don&#x27;t know if this is true or just something cops tell you but her dad, a retired cop, swears on a stack of Bibles that you can blow a positive breathylizer test for \\&quot;being under the influence\\&quot; if you get stopped within 20 minutes of a good, long rinse and spit.  That could be garbage science but it worries her so we&#x27;ve been checking out the Crest Pro-Health line which has advertised itself as being alcohol-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the [[ASIN:B007JUIBMI Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Mouthwash 473 Ml]] but that had Hydrogen Peroxide in it, tasted like crap and required an extra step of rinsing your mouth with water afterwards.  There are some reviews on that page that explain why that is necessary so I won&#x27;t go into them here. It was Alcohol-free but I don&#x27;t need all those ingredients.  If I want to rinse with Hydrogen Peroxide, I&#x27;ll follow my Dentist&#x27;s advice and do it once a week as a separate rinse and then finish up by rinsing with plain water to prevent the H2O2 from hanging around.  I moved on to[[ASIN:B004NMZR9A Crest Pro-Health Invigorating Clean Mint Mouthwash 500 Ml (Pack of 2)]] and while that was more of what I needed, the taste was not to my liking.  it tasted a little too sweet and more like Spearmint AND had Alcohol in it to boot, which was a surprise since most of the Pro-Health line is Alcohol Free.  I wound up giving that bottle to my wife to use on weekends. Also, my toothpaste leans towards the peppermint side of things so the Clean Mint clashed with the taste of my toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;m a little uit like Goldilocks cuz I gave Crest ONE MORE TRY and tried THIS VARIETY, the [[ASIN:B004XI77OW Crest Pro-Health Complete-Fresh Mint-16.9 oz]] and it is jusssssssst right taste-wise and it&#x27;s an Alcohol-free formula.  It meets my needs perfectly but I worry a little since I see some reviewers are reporting that they are seeing stains on the plaque that has built up in-between their dental cleanings.  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up with THAT but I do wonder if they are rinsing too long or possibly seeing staining from too much flouride.  If you drink unfiltered tap water, use flouridated toothpaste AND flouridated mouthwash - it is certainly possible that you will start to stain your teeth.  I also wonder if these people are tea drinker or coffee drinkers as well since the triple flouride exposure combined with stains from Tea, Cofeee nd even wine can really be a problem.  if you are getting brown stains, Obviously I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using the product.  My water has a filter that removes everything, including the flouride so I have not seen any problems...yet.  If I do, I&#x27;ll report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to talk this all over with your dentist and to examine all the sources of Flouride you use or are exposed to since that, in and of itself, can cause staining.  Then I would write down  or go over with ymy dentist, all the foods and drinks that can cause stains.  You may be one of those people that has to use a non-flouride mouth rinse.  If all you are looking for is freshness and you&#x27;re flouride needs have been met, there are several natural brands that can give you the same fresh breath and none of the stains.  Best wishes!it like Goldilocks cuz I gave Crest ONE MORE TRY and tried THIS VARIETY, the [[ASIN:B004XI77OW Crest Pro-Health Complete-Fresh Mint-16.9 oz]] and it is jusssssssst right taste-wise and it&#x27;s an Alcohol-free formula.

Best wishes!</li>
            <li> This mouth rinse has a nice minty flavor. The only problem I have noticed with it is that it left a weird, dry feeling on my tongue. There was a little tingling but no burn because this is an alcohol-free formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after reading that there is a risk of staining I am concerned about continuing to use this product. I have not experienced any staining in the short time I have been using it, so maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be worried. If I develop any staining I will change my rating to one star, but since I have not had a problem with this it will remain at 3 stars.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;In some cases, rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\\&quot; This warning appears on the bottle in very small print (and in the Amazon listing). I do not understand why Crest would sell a dental product that makes teeth look WORSE! My daughter was already self-conscious about teeth that are not white and decided to step up her dental care with more brushing, flossing, and mouthwash. I trusted the Crest name and did not read this tiny warning when I bought the rinse. After 2 weeks of use, she figured out that the brown color on her teeth coincided with the time she started using this product. We threw it out and have made an appointment for an extra cleaning at her dentist.  An internet search shows that complaints like this go back to at least 2008 - yet the product has not been changed. DON&#x27;T USE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I have not even used a third of the bottle and have already developed dark brown stains between my teeth. I cannot get the stains to go away with any amount of brushing or flossing. Do not buy this stuff; it is awful! I did not know what was causing the staining on my teeth until I did more research into this product. There are many complaints about it causing the stains.</li>
            <li> The most important thing about mouthwash for me is the aftertaste. This one has a nice one. Strong but not to strong-has a light mint taste which is nice. Loved the design and grip of the bottle-coloring is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I have used Crest mouthwash for years. I like the way it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean. It is less expensive than in the store.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and use it daily now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smooth&lt;br /&gt;Not Too Strong&lt;br /&gt;Tingling Sensation (Tells you something is working? :P)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None!</li>
            <li> I am using the Pro-Health Rinse on alternate weeks. For the past week I used Multiprotection after breakfast because I would like the benefits for my gums. I then used the Crest 3D White Rinse at bedtime to whiten and if need be counteract any staining by Multiprotection. After a week my teeth are whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now i&#x27;ll give my mouth a rest from those chemicals and use the Rinse as an added benefit to my teeth and gums. If this product begins to stain my teeth I&#x27;ll go back to using the Crest 3D White Rinse at bedtime. I have not experienced any of the ill effects other reviewers reported. I can&#x27;t verify any positive results from using the Rinse so I am unable to give it 4 or 5 stars at this time.</li>
            <li> Again, I have been looking for an anti-plaque rinse that does not feel like raw whiskey. This is a bit sharper in taste than the wintergreen but does not burn like Listerine and seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Complete has a mild minty flavor and contains fluoride.  It leaves an odd aftertaste though and I prefer a mouthwash with a more stimulating flavor and the tingling effect given by alcohol.  People who prefer a less assertive mouthwash will enjoy using this.</li>
            <li> Ever since I began using mouthwash on a daily basis nearly five years ago, I stopped getting painful chancre sores on the insides of my mouth.  I would have to rinse with hydrogen peroxide until they healed and disappeared.  I have used a variety of mouthwashes.  The ones with alcohol burn my mouth.  There is some speculation that using mouthwash with alcohol may contribute to gum cancer but several dentists whom I have spoken with said this isn&#x27;t true.  Nevertheless, the mouthwashes with alcohol do burn and irritate my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Several years ago, I began using Crest 3D White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse Glamorous White, Fresh Mint [[[ASIN:B001FWXS2O Crest 3d White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse Glamorous White - Fresh Mint 473 Ml (Pack of 12)]]].  It doesn&#x27;t have alcohol but it does have a tremendous amount of peroxide that is reputed to whiten one&#x27;s teeth.  I do think using the Crest 3D, along with my Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush ([[ASIN:B0041NFNPE Philips Sonicare Essence HX5350/02 Power Toothbrush]]), helped decrease the number of cavities I&#x27;ve been having.  However, the peroxide taste is very annoying to say the least.  I believe the main reason I bought the Crest 3D was because the mouthwash is clear and wouldn&#x27;t stain my vanity&#x27;s countertop like other mouthwashes have, especially the bright blue ones.  That is why I was always hesitant about buying the Crest Pro-Health Rinse.  It has a bright blue color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Amazon Vine Program was gracious enough to mail me a 1 liter bottle of Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete, Fresh Mint.  It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol or peroxide.  The mint flavoring is pleasant and refreshing.  I swish the mouthwash around my mouth for no more than thirty seconds to a minute before spitting out.  The Crest Pro-Health doesn&#x27;t stain my teeth like some mouthwashes have been reported to have done to customers.  Also, its cap is easy to remove.  I have arthritis in my fingers and have had difficulty removing the child-proof caps from the bottles of other mouthwashes.  Also, I keep the Crest Pro-Health inside the bathroom&#x27;s vanity.  I won&#x27;t let it sit on the marble countertop for fear that the deep blue mouthwash will permanently stain it like others have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Pro-Health for over a week and haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reactions.  I have not lost my sense of taste like some have reported when using other mouthwashes.  Neither has there been any tingling or numbness around my mouth or jaw.  I use this product as much as three times a day: once in the morning, once in the afternoon when I get home from work and plan to leave again, and once in the evening.  If used only once, it is best to use it in the evening before going to bed.  Because of its fluoride content, one shouldn&#x27;t eat or drink within thirty minutes after using this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommend using the Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete, Fresh Mint, to anyone who wants to prevent cavities, chancre sores, gum disease, and bad breath.  Using mouth wash also kills harmful germs and decreases one&#x27;s chance of catching a cold or flu.  Ever since I began using a mouthwash on a regular basis, I seldom catch a cold or flu.  My advice is to buy a mouthwash that you will enjoy USING because, in order for it to work properly, you will need to actually USE it.  Make it a part of you daily regiment.  I always floss and rinse after brushing.  In this way, I never forget.  As busy as I am, I don&#x27;t have time to ask myself if I have already flossed or brushed that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyosf caps from the bottles of other mouthwashes.  Also, I keep the Crest Pro-Health inside the bathroom&#x27;s vanity.  I won&#x27;t let it sit on the marble countertop for fear that the deep blue mouthwash will permanently stain it like others have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Pro-Health for over a week and haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reactions.  I have not lost my sense of taste like some have reported when using other mouthwashes.  Neither has there been any tingling or numbness around my mouth or jaw.

            <li> Prior to using Crest Pro Health Complete, I had been using Crest Pro Health Multi-Protection and I could not taste or notice any difference between the two with the exception they have two different caps where Complete has the kind of child lock that you have to push in to twist.  The biggest difference is in the labeling, sure they both promise to freshen breath, have no burn of alcohol (which they do), but where Multi-Protection also claims to kill germs, reduce plaque, help prevent gingivitis, and keep teeth cleaner longer, despite being labeled \\&quot;complete\\&quot; the Complete version does none other these but does claims ton rebuild enamel, help prevent cavities, clean teeth and gums, and kill bad breath germs.  I guess if you want a truly \\&quot;complete\\&quot; mouthwash, you will have to buy both products and alternate them every other day.</li>
            <li> This Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete Fresh Mint mouthwash is a nice rinse that doesn&#x27;t give that stinging feeling as do other mouthwashes that contain alcohol. I am losing some of the enamel on my front teeth and I wanted to prevent any further damage, so the Crest Pro-Health Rinse is helping me maintain my enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste is mild but minty and I like it because the children and I can both use the same mouthwash and that&#x27;s a plus for our household budget. The bottle stated that there is a possibility of teeth being stained from long periods of usage but none of us have had that unfortunate experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love rinsing before and after I brush and The Crest Pro-Health rinse gives my mouth the clean feeling that I love. This is a healthy and complete mouthwash that the entire family can use and will love.</li>
            <li> This is a big bottle.  Of course I know what a liter is but I was still shocked by how large it is.  The good thing is you get a lot of product.  The bad thing is it takes up counter space.  Also, using the recommended dose of 2 teaspoons you won&#x27;t be running out anytime soon.  Crest advises twice a day usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to how it works and tastes.  It&#x27;s astringent and will aggravate any small nicks or cuts you have in your mouth but that sensation dissipates the more you use it or perhaps I just got more used to it.  The taste is fresh and minty and since it has no alcohol there&#x27;s no irritant associated with that.  The directions say to swish it around in your mouth for at least a minute and then spit it out thoroughly.  Again nothing difficult here however if you get some on around your mouth or on your hands you&#x27;ll want to rinse completely since it leaves a sticky film.  The most difficult thing for me was to not drink anything within a half hour of using it.  This mouth wash made me oddly thirsty.  It&#x27;s too soon to judge if it helps with enamel depletion and cavity prevention but it sure makes my mouth feel fresh for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging note:  It come sealed with a plastic covering which comes off easily HOWEVER things get more complicated after that.  To open the bottle it&#x27;s not a simple twist and lift.  There are notched sections at the base of the cuplike, white covering.  After you twist this lid you need to press inward on the notches and lift up to open.  I&#x27;m glad no one had a video of me trying to open this for the first time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed with the Crest Pro-Health line and have been using their toothpaste from that line for a few months now. No cavities and healthy gums so I can&#x27;t complain. The dentist has recommended a rinse like this following flossing and brushing, and this particular product has a good taste (important when you have to rinse for a minute with it) and a comfortable clean feeling afterward. I can&#x27;t say whether it will lead to beneficial effects long-term, but I&#x27;m following my dentist&#x27;s recommendations.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find an alcohol-free mouthwash with fluoride....until my teeth turned brown. I had been using watered-down Crest Pro-Health in my waterpik toothbrush, and then rinsing with full-strength afterwards.  One month later, and my teeth look like I&#x27;ve been chewing tobacco.</li>
            <li> There are two basic types of mouthwash. Antiseptic and antimicrobial (aka antibacterial). Antiseptic uses alcohol to kill germs. So, if you are using an alcohol free mouthwash, you are using an antimicrobial. This is the new trend in mouthwash. It offers fresh breath without that burning sensation you are used to from traditional brands like Listerine. Like any mouthwash of this type, this comes with a warning, \\&quot;In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by my dentist to use alcohol free mouthwash during my pregnancy, and it worked fine for me. I didn&#x27;t have any discoloration issues. This particular flavor, fresh mint, is both minty and fresh.</li>
            <li> I am not a big mouth wash person but this stuff is great.  I really like that there is no burning sensation that you can get with other brands of mouthwash.  Leaves your mouth really feeling clean with a great taste as well.  I found that it also reduced the morning yuck that you feel in your mouth when you wake up in the morning.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been a Listerine user for years... in the mornings I use the Listerine Whitening treatment (with peroxide) and at night I use the 6-in-1 purple stuff (that is my name for it). The Crest Pro-Health Rinse can&#x27;t replace my Listerine Whitening treatment, but it can (and has) replaced my 6-in-1 purple rinse. The Crest Pro-Health Rinse has a nice minty taste that seems to stick with me until morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nice minty taste with almost no burn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Keeps my mouth nice and fresh for extended time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict- If you like minty mouthwashes the Crest Pro-Health might be the one for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars</li>
            <li> Every Crest Pro-Health rinse I have in my house has the warning that cautions users that mouthwashes that target microbes can temporarily discolor teeth. I usually brush with baking soda a couple of times a week in between cleaning visits to keep my teeth as bright as possible and can&#x27;t say that I have noticed drastically darker teeth with this rinse versus any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as a person with a health condition that can mess with teeth and two parents whose parents couldn&#x27;t afford routine dental care for their children during the 50s, 60s, and early 70s, I&#x27;m just tickled to have all of my teeth at the ripe old age of 27 and don&#x27;t obsess over bleaching or having unnaturally white and bright teeth. If you obsess over such things, then you should probably avoid this mouthwash as you will likely notice changes even if there aren&#x27;t any because you are looking for them continuously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that out of the way, the benefits of this mouthwash for your teeth and gums are great and it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol so avoids a burning sensation. We always have one of Crest&#x27;s pro-health, alcohol free mouthwashes on our sink and manage to stay healthy!</li>
            <li> Try as I might, I haven&#x27;t been able to get brown spots on my teeth from this mouthwash.  I wonder if it&#x27;s like those pink pills the dentist would bring to us in Elementary school that would temporarily turn all your plaque pink so that you knew where to brush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the Crest mouthwashes carry this disclaimer, by the way, although I don&#x27;t think any others that I know of have received complaints.  I do tend to like the green version better for its taste and I tend to like the alcoholic versions better for the taste and lack of parabens.  But this is still a solid mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The lack of alcohol makes it easier to rinse with. Some light tingling, but not the &amp;#34;fire&amp;#34; of previous alcohol based rinses. I would say its comparable in results to other leading brands at maintaining berth freshness.</li>
            <li> Non-alcoholic mouth rinse that&#x27;s pretty effective. I actually prefer one with alcohol (I don&#x27;t find it too stinging) but if you are averse or unable to use one with that ingredient then this is your product.</li>
