            <li>and I do not think you can get a great product like this at a lower price)&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>This dispenser does the job and looks pretty attractive.</li>
            <li>It worked fine!</li>
            <li>/&gt;What kept me from giving them five stars is that even on the lowest setting, they dispense more soap than we need.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift and we are so pleased.  </li>
            <li>Thought this was going to be nicer than the \\&quot;other\\&quot; popular hands free soap dispenser.</li>
            <li>like this dispenser, it&#x27;s sleek and stylish.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my wife, for the kitchen, and&lt;br /&gt;we love it.</li>
            <li>to get two more for our bathrooms, because we get the soap by the&lt;br /&gt;Gallon at Sam&#x27;s Club.</li>
            <li>Pressing the top of a soap dispenser causes an area of skin that has to be washed again.</li>
            <li>If you are into \\&quot;workarounds\\&quot; then this is an OK</li>
            <li>Love these things -</li>
            <li>I bought one to try and had to get a couple more - way better than the Lysol ones....</li>
            <li>A bit on the noisy side, but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>to date i am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The dispenser works OK.  </li>
            <li>you can turn the water on w/o touching anything but never could get soap to get on them,</li>
            <li>I love the ease of use.</li>
            <li>I really love the fact that you can adjust the amount of soap you want.</li>
            <li>And I love that when my hands are greasy</li>
            <li>Stylish and convenient with drip tray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an okay product.</li>
            <li>I had another brand of automatic soap dispenser that cost $40 and had many problems.</li>
            <li>and this works much better.  </li>
            <li>The soap fill-hole is on top</li>
            <li>I bought this to use in our kitchen - love clean hands!  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This is the best value and holds more soap than any other I have used.  </li>
            <li>but ideally I&#x27;d prefer the smaller one.</li>
            <li>It is wider than I thought it would be so I would recommend that you check out the dimensions before you buy to make sure it will fit in the area you want to place it.</li>
            <li>The refilling is easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s aesthetically pleasing, clean and very useful!</li>
            <li>The three we kept have been working fine for a year or so.</li>
            <li>I read that alot of these had problems, but mine has been fine.</li>
            <li>But its working fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to come here to Amazon and pay more than twice what I paid at TM for a couple more.</li>
            <li>No motor sound.  </li>
            <li>BTW the soffit light over the sink has been off during all these issues.</li>
            <li>It has a great drip tray which isn&#x27;t necessary bc</li>
            <li>We have one in the kitchen filled with dawn and another in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>But it was WAY cheap, so I figured, what the heck?  </li>
            <li>IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>I have had three of these dispensers for about 3 months and they are problem free.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, however it dispenses too much (I put hand sanitizer in it).</li>
            <li>: Since my original review, the price has doubled.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to endure the lights off dispensing issue be sure to either use the drip try or put the spout over the sink.</li>
            <li>First, it was working OK.  </li>
            <li>Also made the mistake of pressing the clean button</li>
            <li>The device is perfect, I love it except that it is sensitive and sometimes soap will squirt out via a slight movement of light or shadow.</li>
            <li>Clean Feature&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it has worked flawlessly which leads me to wonder if those having problems with it are using it properly.</li>
            <li>For $35 I&#x27;d be looking for stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine are still working fine, though!</li>
            <li>I have other products of this nature and find this one works great and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a touch free soap dispenser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After purchasing the first one, and finding out how useful and clean it was, we bought 4 more for the remaining bathrooms in the office - and again, have had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for a winning product.</li>
            <li>Aside from not being able to adjust how much soap it dispenses at one time, we have no problems with it.</li>
            <li>I love this thing so much</li>
            <li>Fair Valued Price (Mine was at $17.75 total with shipping and tax included</li>
            <li>I love the magnetic drip tray and the modern design.</li>
            <li>but this one was so much cheaper (and had better reviews)</li>
            <li>We had a good run and who knows how old it was when I first got it.</li>
            <li>Maybe you will be lucky and not get a lemon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea to be touch less</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that when I am cooking I can just be hands free and not contaminate the pump dispenser I was using...</li>
            <li>For the price it is worth it for this midrange soap dispenser.</li>
            <li>especially when I am handling meats of any kind.      </li>
            <li>recently bought a couple of these and they are working out great so far.  </li>
            <li>This dispenser gives out just the right amount of soap each time and makes hand washing fun.</li>
            <li>(tried the higher settings, and it dispenses way too much soap; however, these settings would be fine if you are using for body lotion).  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m using for soap and getting just the right amount at the lowest #1 setting</li>
            <li>In the meantime (I know, I should write Stephen King novels, right?), since the soap-catching cup was still in the bathroom, I forgot the one in the kitchen didn&#x27;t work and went to use it.</li>
            <li>They are great little things!</li>
            <li>So far it is easy to use and quite reliable.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering another one to replace the pretty one in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It worked for a year pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Plus be willing to refill the soap reservoir and replace the batteries frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thought the first was just lemon</li>
            <li>That advice would be appreciated!</li>
            <li>I have had my first one for over two years</li>
            <li>I think it would be better if it was in the back</li>
            <li>At low it gives you a healthy dose of soap.</li>
            <li>First, I made the mistake of choosing \\&quot;warranty service\\&quot; from their voice menu.  </li>
            <li>We had another one of these and wanted one which would work as well as the first one.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy another dispenser when my first one broke.  </li>
            <li>so I finally turned it off (which would be the logical thing to do except that soap is pouring out the top and the button is under a door on the bottom).</li>
            <li>The interesting thing about the warranty is that it only covers the first 30 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They sucked anyway, when I first bought them they gave WAY too much soap, even set on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>They sucked anyway, when I first bought them they gave WAY too much soap, even set on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>This is good because all my small electronics use AAs, and I am packed with AAs.</li>
            <li>only problem with this unit, for me anyway, is that it&#x27;s huge.  </li>
            <li>Probably my fault for not double-checking the size before ordering and it was too much of a bother to return it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>a real piece of junk that manufactuer should be made to issue a recall.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>Bizarrely did so at almost same date, controlled, no doubt, by the growing washing machine</li>
            <li>It dispenses way too much soap, even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was offered in stainless steel finish.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but it takes up much needed space on my small-ish vanity.  </li>
            <li>Modern Look</li>
            <li>The dispensing of soap/sanitizer could be a bit more than expected per setting -</li>
            <li>When purchasing dispensers such as this always ensure that they can be filled with any brand of liquid soap.(as this one can)</li>
            <li>You can adjust the amount, but I have it on the lowest setting and find that it still gives me a bit much sanitizer.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s much easier to refill.  </li>
            <li>The battery cover is much tighter.  </li>
            <li>size is just fine, not too big or too small, and is a great conversation starter (oddly enough).</li>
            <li>However the battery low light keeps blinking every time you use it even with brand new duracell batteries.</li>
            <li>I have purchase this dispenser many time and the average price was</li>
            <li>They even work in very low light - we have no incidents of undesired dispensing due to motion or light changes.</li>
            <li>Soap doesn&#x27;t flow in a steady stream.</li>
            <li>The main thing it works well.  </li>
            <li>First thing I&#x27;d say is never put this on higher than the low setting.</li>
            <li>One magical day I decided the danger was over and poured some of the soap back into each dispenser but left the soap-catching cup in the kitchen.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>3 Settings of amount to dispense (From High to Low)&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>It helps with keeping the sink are dry &amp; clean, and comes with a \\&quot;drip tray\\&quot; to catch the soap in case the sensor goes off and you missed getting the dispensed soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great machine you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li>When it DID work, it occasionally gave you some soap, never the right amount.</li>
            <li>It is Ok for low traffic sinks but not as your main soap dispenser.</li>
            <li>if you can live with that go ahead and order it.</li>
            <li>This little guy happily dispenses soap when the light is turned on, the cat walks by, or it hears random voices instructing it to do so.  </li>
            <li>Works as promised with 1 small problem, it&#x27;s sensative to light and movement changes, even across the room!  </li>
            <li>**) Can break easily as in a short time period (mine lasted about 2 months before the malfunctions occurred)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Making a huge mess.  </li>
            <li>The light flashes red as expected.  </li>
            <li>Over a year now on the same batteries that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;Works really well.</li>
            <li>Sensor is not overly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>And the drip tray is essential, given how much this thing drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud and I have to wave my hand under it four times to get it to work.</li>
            <li>Sensitive Detector&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 84 yr old mother concerned about germs in the bathroom when guests were visiting.</li>
            <li>Since I have so much Dial soap, I haven&#x27;t tried anything different in this dispenser.</li>
            <li>I use this in my nursery, after each changing with so many big and little hands around this has helped sanitation concerns!</li>
            <li>The NEXT day the one in the bathroom did the exact same thing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used a Simple Human soap dispenser prior to this and comparatively, this one is a bit louder with an electronic grinding sound as it dispenses soap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a huge waste!</li>
            <li>but no other thought about it.  </li>
            <li>bad, really great while they worked.</li>
            <li>Generally we have to trigger the sensor twice before it dispenses anything.</li>
            <li>It does come with a drip tray which magnetically locks to the body, but it looks sloppy if there are drips of sanitizer sitting on it, and it&#x27;s too much of a hassle for me to constantly clean the tray</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s apparently been doing this all day.  </li>
            <li>Since I have it in the kitchen  (not in direct sunlight), so my mechanic husband and children can use it, I have to keep a bowl next to it for \\&quot;unecessary\\&quot; dispensing, otherwise even on the lowest setting</li>
            <li>Stick to a regular old pump.</li>
            <li>For me, the only way to make it dispense is to put my hand right down the sensor.</li>
            <li>LOVE the drip tray, though I have less trouble with this thing dripping than I did with a regular pump-type dispenser.  </li>
            <li>The colors and design are modern, only complaint is the lowest setting gives ALOT of sanitizer...too much.</li>
            <li>And no strange act-up of dispensing soap.</li>
            <li>I have no problems with the dispenser, no high sensitivity to light or people walking past or leaks.</li>
            <li>No fear, over the span of three months the flow got smaller and smaller (again, despite settings) until we had to use at least two squirts to even get the illusion of clean hands.plus</li>
            <li>No fear, over the span of three months the flow got smaller and smaller (again, despite settings) until we had to use at least two squirts to even get the illusion of clean hands.</li>
            <li>I was not happy the price had gone up so much from when i first bought it at Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>But not long after reinserting batteries, it will start acting up again.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m willing to come here to Amazon and pay more than twice what I paid at TM for a couple more.</li>
            <li> No motor sound.  </li>
            <li> BTW the soffit light over the sink has been off during all these issues.</li>
            <li> It has a great drip tray which isn&#x27;t necessary bc</li>
            <li> We have one in the kitchen filled with dawn and another in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> But it was WAY cheap, so I figured, what the heck?  </li>
            <li> IMPORTANT</li>
            <li> I have had three of these dispensers for about 3 months and they are problem free.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, however it dispenses too much (I put hand sanitizer in it).</li>
            <li> : Since my original review, the price has doubled.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to endure the lights off dispensing issue be sure to either use the drip try or put the spout over the sink.</li>
            <li> First, it was working OK.  </li>
            <li> Also made the mistake of pressing the clean button</li>
            <li> The device is perfect, I love it except that it is sensitive and sometimes soap will squirt out via a slight movement of light or shadow.</li>
            <li> Clean Feature&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it has worked flawlessly which leads me to wonder if those having problems with it are using it properly.</li>
            <li> For $35 I&#x27;d be looking for stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine are still working fine, though!</li>
            <li> I have other products of this nature and find this one works great and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a touch free soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After purchasing the first one, and finding out how useful and clean it was, we bought 4 more for the remaining bathrooms in the office - and again, have had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Thanks again for a winning product.</li>
            <li> Aside from not being able to adjust how much soap it dispenses at one time, we have no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much</li>
            <li> Fair Valued Price (Mine was at $17.75 total with shipping and tax included</li>
            <li> I love the magnetic drip tray and the modern design.</li>
            <li> but this one was so much cheaper (and had better reviews)</li>
            <li> We had a good run and who knows how old it was when I first got it.</li>
            <li> Maybe you will be lucky and not get a lemon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea to be touch less</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that when I am cooking I can just be hands free and not contaminate the pump dispenser I was using...</li>
            <li> For the price it is worth it for this midrange soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> especially when I am handling meats of any kind.      </li>
            <li> recently bought a couple of these and they are working out great so far.  </li>
            <li> This dispenser gives out just the right amount of soap each time and makes hand washing fun.</li>
            <li> (tried the higher settings, and it dispenses way too much soap; however, these settings would be fine if you are using for body lotion).  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m using for soap and getting just the right amount at the lowest #1 setting</li>
            <li> In the meantime (I know, I should write Stephen King novels, right?), since the soap-catching cup was still in the bathroom, I forgot the one in the kitchen didn&#x27;t work and went to use it.</li>
            <li> They are great little things!</li>
            <li> So far it is easy to use and quite reliable.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering another one to replace the pretty one in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It worked for a year pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Plus be willing to refill the soap reservoir and replace the batteries frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thought the first was just lemon</li>
            <li> That advice would be appreciated!</li>
            <li> I have had my first one for over two years</li>
            <li> I think it would be better if it was in the back</li>
            <li> At low it gives you a healthy dose of soap.</li>
            <li> First, I made the mistake of choosing \\&quot;warranty service\\&quot; from their voice menu.  </li>
            <li> We had another one of these and wanted one which would work as well as the first one.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy another dispenser when my first one broke.  </li>
            <li> so I finally turned it off (which would be the logical thing to do except that soap is pouring out the top and the button is under a door on the bottom).</li>
            <li> The interesting thing about the warranty is that it only covers the first 30 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They sucked anyway, when I first bought them they gave WAY too much soap, even set on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> They sucked anyway, when I first bought them they gave WAY too much soap, even set on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> This is good because all my small electronics use AAs, and I am packed with AAs.</li>
            <li> only problem with this unit, for me anyway, is that it&#x27;s huge.  </li>
            <li> Probably my fault for not double-checking the size before ordering and it was too much of a bother to return it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> a real piece of junk that manufactuer should be made to issue a recall.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Bizarrely did so at almost same date, controlled, no doubt, by the growing washing machine</li>
            <li> It dispenses way too much soap, even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was offered in stainless steel finish.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but it takes up much needed space on my small-ish vanity.  </li>
            <li> Modern Look</li>
            <li> The dispensing of soap/sanitizer could be a bit more than expected per setting -</li>
            <li> When purchasing dispensers such as this always ensure that they can be filled with any brand of liquid soap.(as this one can)</li>
            <li> You can adjust the amount, but I have it on the lowest setting and find that it still gives me a bit much sanitizer.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s much easier to refill.  </li>
            <li> The battery cover is much tighter.  </li>
            <li> size is just fine, not too big or too small, and is a great conversation starter (oddly enough).</li>
            <li> However the battery low light keeps blinking every time you use it even with brand new duracell batteries.</li>
            <li> I have purchase this dispenser many time and the average price was</li>
            <li> They even work in very low light - we have no incidents of undesired dispensing due to motion or light changes.</li>
            <li> Soap doesn&#x27;t flow in a steady stream.</li>
            <li> The main thing it works well.  </li>
            <li> First thing I&#x27;d say is never put this on higher than the low setting.</li>
            <li> One magical day I decided the danger was over and poured some of the soap back into each dispenser but left the soap-catching cup in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> 3 Settings of amount to dispense (From High to Low)&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> It helps with keeping the sink are dry &amp; clean, and comes with a \\&quot;drip tray\\&quot; to catch the soap in case the sensor goes off and you missed getting the dispensed soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great machine you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> When it DID work, it occasionally gave you some soap, never the right amount.</li>
            <li> It is Ok for low traffic sinks but not as your main soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> if you can live with that go ahead and order it.</li>
            <li> This little guy happily dispenses soap when the light is turned on, the cat walks by, or it hears random voices instructing it to do so.  </li>
            <li> Works as promised with 1 small problem, it&#x27;s sensative to light and movement changes, even across the room!  </li>
            <li> **) Can break easily as in a short time period (mine lasted about 2 months before the malfunctions occurred)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Making a huge mess.  </li>
            <li> The light flashes red as expected.  </li>
            <li> Over a year now on the same batteries that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;Works really well.</li>
            <li> Sensor is not overly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> And the drip tray is essential, given how much this thing drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud and I have to wave my hand under it four times to get it to work.</li>
            <li> Sensitive Detector&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 84 yr old mother concerned about germs in the bathroom when guests were visiting.</li>
            <li> Since I have so much Dial soap, I haven&#x27;t tried anything different in this dispenser.</li>
            <li> I use this in my nursery, after each changing with so many big and little hands around this has helped sanitation concerns!</li>
            <li> The NEXT day the one in the bathroom did the exact same thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a Simple Human soap dispenser prior to this and comparatively, this one is a bit louder with an electronic grinding sound as it dispenses soap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a huge waste!</li>
            <li> but no other thought about it.  </li>
            <li> bad, really great while they worked.</li>
            <li> Generally we have to trigger the sensor twice before it dispenses anything.</li>
            <li> It does come with a drip tray which magnetically locks to the body, but it looks sloppy if there are drips of sanitizer sitting on it, and it&#x27;s too much of a hassle for me to constantly clean the tray</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s apparently been doing this all day.  </li>
            <li> Since I have it in the kitchen  (not in direct sunlight), so my mechanic husband and children can use it, I have to keep a bowl next to it for \\&quot;unecessary\\&quot; dispensing, otherwise even on the lowest setting</li>
            <li> Stick to a regular old pump.</li>
            <li> For me, the only way to make it dispense is to put my hand right down the sensor.</li>
            <li> LOVE the drip tray, though I have less trouble with this thing dripping than I did with a regular pump-type dispenser.  </li>
            <li> The colors and design are modern, only complaint is the lowest setting gives ALOT of sanitizer...too much.</li>
            <li> And no strange act-up of dispensing soap.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with the dispenser, no high sensitivity to light or people walking past or leaks.</li>
            <li> No fear, over the span of three months the flow got smaller and smaller (again, despite settings) until we had to use at least two squirts to even get the illusion of clean hands.plus</li>
            <li> No fear, over the span of three months the flow got smaller and smaller (again, despite settings) until we had to use at least two squirts to even get the illusion of clean hands.</li>
            <li> I was not happy the price had gone up so much from when i first bought it at Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> But not long after reinserting batteries, it will start acting up again.</li>
            <li> i read the other reviews, but so far i don&#x27;t get any drips or accidental</li>
            <li> The first one did last a long time although I am not sure what happened to it.  </li>
            <li> Under direct sunlight (in kitchen window) it heats up and suddenly starts non-stop dispensing soap, making a mess of counter.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much because things usually end up at stores like that for a reason.  </li>
            <li> The AA batteries last a long time in these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No sunlight, not near anything, no reason at all, the SAME thing!</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that it is larger than I expected or need.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought other (more expensive) units which functioned get</li>
            <li> I would recommend this one over other more expensive dispensers.  </li>
            <li> The footprint was a bit larger than expected as the middle part where the gray meets the white section is wide, something to keep in mind if you have limited countertop space.</li>
            <li> Requires high maintenance as in if the bottom of dispenser (where you insert the batteries) were slightly wet, the machine can die or malfunction altogether in a few days.</li>
            <li> But it was not very good looking, it was hard to clean and only lasted a year.  </li>
            <li> I have spent up to $79 on multiple automatic soap dispensers and each one died within a year of purchasing.</li>
            <li> Good thing nobody was around since I looked like an idiot.</li>
            <li> The batteries weren&#x27;t dead, the soap was not empty, nothing!</li>
            <li> [I ordered two, which had somewhat the same issue - one died because it was slightly wet and started leaking battery acid, and the other died because it was slightly wet and started dispensing soap nonstop out]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I leave a small cup underneath the spout (a collection plate comes with the machine but is not deep enough).</li>
            <li> but the second also stopped working in less than a year.</li>
            <li> The sensor is funky at times, one time it just starts to dispensing all the soap for no particular reason.  </li>
            <li> Had to keep base more or less dry, but nbd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Them encountered exactly same problem as others; both units, in totally different environments, repeatedly triggered themselves.</li>
            <li> : Over the last three months I would have spent less buying disposable soap dispensers than I did paying $30 (for two) plus the cost of bulk liquid soap.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why other reviewers said it is way too sensitive to lights and movement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how it works in the next few months and give another update.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, it works when you want it to.  </li>
            <li> I observed this before anyone was injured by the wet floor.</li>
            <li> , I thought it was empty.</li>
            <li> I tried to switched the light on and off frequently, move my hands around the base of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> When I called back in and navigated the generic information route through their voice menus, their system kept me on hold about 20 minutes and then after torturing me with a message every 15 seconds encouraging me to leave a message, it finally forced me into a voice mailbox which had no identifying information on it.  </li>
            <li> for example: my soap tends to foam a lot with a little drop of it so, there you have it for why I would I prefer much less soap dispensed on a low setting.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not a problem for the other brands in my bathrooms?</li>
            <li> In other respects (as in during daylight) it seems to function well.</li>
            <li> : I moved the dispenser to the other side of the sink.</li>
            <li> The negative, as a few others have said, is that it is sensitive and often shoots out soap as I move my hands out from under it.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed with the purchase since Homedics is usually a good name to deal with.</li>
            <li> Also, it costs half the price of other devices.</li>
            <li> Come home tonight to a dark house and a motor running and dispensing.  </li>
            <li> This was happening in the dark, not a hand in sight.  </li>
            <li> Waving hands up, down and all around ..</li>
            <li> We had to water down the soap.    </li>
            <li> The other one I&#x27;m having trouble with the sensor.  </li>
            <li> My wife found these half price in Tuesday Morning, so she bought six of them - three for us and three for family.</li>
            <li> less well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the design and the price and reviews from previous costumers.</li>
            <li> I thought that was weird, maybe the batteries were low, etc, no big deal.</li>
            <li> when it does work will go off by itself making a mess.</li>
            <li> Once battery starts leaking it&#x27;s no good for future recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife found these half price in Tuesday Morning, so she bought six of them - three for us and three for family. The three we kept have been working fine for a year or so. They even work in very low light - we have no incidents of undesired dispensing due to motion or light changes. The AA batteries last a long time in these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kept me from giving them five stars is that even on the lowest setting, they dispense more soap than we need. Except for my daughter, of course - she still requires two \\&quot;hits.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Since my original review, the price has doubled. I&#x27;m not sure I would pay $35 for this. For $35 I&#x27;d be looking for stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine are still working fine, though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a Simple Human soap dispenser prior to this and comparatively, this one is a bit louder with an electronic grinding sound as it dispenses soap. The footprint was a bit larger than expected as the middle part where the gray meets the white section is wide, something to keep in mind if you have limited countertop space. I have no problems with the dispenser, no high sensitivity to light or people walking past or leaks. Do not use soaps with exfoliating or moisturizing beads because it will get stuck. For the price it is worth it for this midrange soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> Soap doesn&#x27;t flow in a steady stream. It is Ok for low traffic sinks but not as your main soap dispenser.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of them and unfortunately one didn&#x27;t pump the soap at all.  The other one I&#x27;m having trouble with the sensor.  It takes a while to react.  Over all, I&#x27;m happy with the products that work.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and we are so pleased.  I like the fact that we can use any kind of soap for this dispenser. We have used it for 10 days now with out any problem. This dispenser gives out just the right amount of soap each time and makes hand washing fun. I really like the fact that when I am cooking I can just be hands free and not contaminate the pump dispenser I was using...especially when I am handling meats of any kind.      I&#x27;ll see how it works in the next few months and give another update.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s what I wanted.  My only criticism is that it is larger than I expected or need.  Probably my fault for not double-checking the size before ordering and it was too much of a bother to return it.  In fact, it&#x27;s in use but ideally I&#x27;d prefer the smaller one.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for 6 months and loved it! After accidentally dropping &amp; breaking it, I wanted the same model. When I got this one, no soap would come out when I tried to use it. Then when I wasn&#x27;t around, it would shoot soap out. Every time I came back in the room there would be another pool of soap on the counter. Had to send it back.</li>
            <li> I use this Hand Sanitizer for liguid soap. I have purchased others that are more expensive but were not the quality of this one. I will be ordering another one to replace the pretty one in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these recently.  Put the batteries in, put the soap in.  The light flashes red as expected.  Then nothing.  No motor sound.  No amount of putting my hand underneath in any position works.  This has been the case for the last week and I&#x27;ve wondered what I should do about the wasted soap in it but no other thought about it.  Come home tonight to a dark house and a motor running and dispensing.  It&#x27;s apparently been doing this all day.  There is a pile of soap underneath and has gotten into the battery container on the bottom where the off switch is so conveniently located.  There is soap puddled all over the counter.  This was happening in the dark, not a hand in sight.  I contemplated making a video review just to show how bad this is.</li>
            <li> Thought this was going to be nicer than the \\&quot;other\\&quot; popular hands free soap dispenser. It does look great but unfortunately it does not work. Well maybe I should say it works but only when I am not around! Waving hands up, down and all around .. nothing. Good thing nobody was around since I looked like an idiot. I would leave the room and come back later and there was soap all over the counter and sink. Changing batteries didn&#x27;t work and changing the settings only worked one time. Also made the mistake of pressing the clean button and then it worked while still holding it. I couldn&#x27;t get it to stop dispensing until I took out the batteries. Yelling at it to stop doesn&#x27;t work either. Maybe you will be lucky and not get a lemon. Too bad because I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> Pros:stylish,pearl white matching any bathroom,cheaper than simplehuman,on and off control, a switch adjusting amount of soap to dispense&lt;br /&gt;cons:low capacity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this dispenser, it&#x27;s sleek and stylish. It matches my bathroom perfectly. I am not sure why other reviewers said it is way too sensitive to lights and movement. For me, the only way to make it dispense is to put my hand right down the sensor. I tried to switched the light on and off frequently, move my hands around the base of the dispenser. It just did not react at all. It has a switch adjusting the amount of soap to dispense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description says it needs 3AAAs. As a matter of fact it goes with 3AAs. This is good because all my small electronics use AAs, and I am packed with AAs.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife, for the kitchen, and&lt;br /&gt;we love it. We like the fact you can use any kind&lt;br /&gt;of soap you want, and you can adjust the amount of soap&lt;br /&gt;with the 3 way switch by the battery compartment. We are&lt;br /&gt;going to get two more for our bathrooms, because we get the soap by the&lt;br /&gt;Gallon at Sam&#x27;s Club. Thanks Homedics!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Stll using this in one of my bathrooms. Over a year now on the same batteries that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;Works really well. Thanks again for a winning product.</li>
            <li> I read that alot of these had problems, but mine has been fine. I got it for my mom who is a freak about hand sanitizer and she loved it! I would definitly buy again.</li>
            <li> a real piece of junk that manufactuer should be made to issue a recall. everyone i know that bought this says the same thing&lt;br /&gt;stops working and when it does work will go off by itself making a mess. Buyer Beware</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think it would last longer; changed batteries, added soap - nada. When it DID work, it occasionally gave you some soap, never the right amount. It was really frustrating. I have written the company and hope to hear back.</li>
            <li> I received the Homedics Touch-free Hand Sanitizer as a Christmas gift.  I use it in the kitchen and will be buying additional dispensers to use in the bathrooms.  You can adjust the amount of soap or sanitizer that you want dispensed.</li>
            <li> Works as promised with 1 small problem, it&#x27;s sensative to light and movement changes, even across the room!  Since I have it in the kitchen  (not in direct sunlight), so my mechanic husband and children can use it, I have to keep a bowl next to it for \\&quot;unecessary\\&quot; dispensing, otherwise even on the lowest setting it&#x27;s a huge waste! This is not a problem for the other brands in my bathrooms?</li>
            <li> This dispenser does the job and looks pretty attractive. The negative, as a few others have said, is that it is sensitive and often shoots out soap as I move my hands out from under it. It must be thinking that I am trying again!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in our kitchen - love clean hands!  But, it stopped working after a few days.  I cleaned the unit and the spout, don&#x27;t know what happened!</li>
            <li> Both units worked perfectly for around a year. Very convenient. 5 star. Had to keep base more or less dry, but nbd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Them encountered exactly same problem as others; both units, in totally different environments, repeatedly triggered themselves. Bizarrely did so at almost same date, controlled, no doubt, by the growing washing machine missing sock brigade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought other (more expensive) units which functioned get less well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, really great while they worked.</li>
            <li> I use catheters so having an antibacterial arrangement is necessary. Pressing the top of a soap dispenser causes an area of skin that has to be washed again. This device takes care of that problem -- you just put your hand or catheter under it and soap comes out. No touching of parts that could carry bacteria. My mother just had eye surgery and her aides have to sanitize their hands prior holding open her eyelids for placing drops. The device is perfect, I love it except that it is sensitive and sometimes soap will squirt out via a slight movement of light or shadow. So I leave a small cup underneath the spout (a collection plate comes with the machine but is not deep enough). Recommend highly. Also, it costs half the price of other devices.</li>
            <li> We purchased this dispenser for of the bathrooms in our office, and it&#x27;s EXCELLENT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried it out for about two weeks, and had none of the problems that were listed on the lower rated reviews. It helps with keeping the sink are dry &amp; clean, and comes with a \\&quot;drip tray\\&quot; to catch the soap in case the sensor goes off and you missed getting the dispensed soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing the first one, and finding out how useful and clean it was, we bought 4 more for the remaining bathrooms in the office - and again, have had no problems whatsoever. Even with them being used multiple times a day, by multiple people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY reccomend this product. It&#x27;s aesthetically pleasing, clean and very useful!</li>
            <li> Two problems:  1. It dispenses way too much soap, even on the lowest setting. We had to water down the soap.    2. Under direct sunlight (in kitchen window) it heats up and suddenly starts non-stop dispensing soap, making a mess of counter.  Of course, this happened after our return window passed.  :-/</li>
            <li> We had purchased a clunky soap dispenser at B,B &amp; Beyond.  It worked for a year pretty well.  But it was not very good looking, it was hard to clean and only lasted a year.  This unit works well, easy to clean and has a very nice design.</li>
            <li> This device dispenses on its own when I turn my kitchen lights off! It is totally reproducible 100 % of the time. I have soffit lighting. The nearest bulb is 5 feet horizontally and 4 feet vertically separated from this dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you can live with that go ahead and order it. In other respects (as in during daylight) it seems to function well. I put a towel over this device before I say goodnight and turn the lights off. If you are into \\&quot;workarounds\\&quot; then this is an OK device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thought. If you are willing to endure the lights off dispensing issue be sure to either use the drip try or put the spout over the sink. Plus be willing to refill the soap reservoir and replace the batteries frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 days later update: I moved the dispenser to the other side of the sink. Same issue. BTW the soffit light over the sink has been off during all these issues.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 in two years. Thought the first was just lemon but the second also stopped working in less than a year.</li>
            <li> Sorry but after one year this product got all gummed up and does not work!  It&#x27;s a great idea to be touch less but it does NOT work!  We tried cleaning it out with no luck.  Perhaps, someone has a suggestion of how to get it UNSTUCK?  That advice would be appreciated!</li>
            <li> The bottem, where the batteries are located needs to stay dry(kind of hard with a typical sink setup), needless to say I&#x27;ve been through 3 of them and they all died after about a year. The awesome when they work.</li>
            <li> I have purchase this dispenser many time and the average price was $19.&lt;br /&gt;Currently, the price is increased and become  very expensive which stop me for having extra of this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever. They are designed for hand sanitizer but I use it hand soap. This is the second one I have purchased. I have had my first one for over two years and it&#x27;s still working like a jewel. I have spent up to $79 on multiple automatic soap dispensers and each one died within a year of purchasing. This is a great machine you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Love these things - I bought one to try and had to get a couple more - way better than the Lysol ones....</li>
            <li> This sanitizer is good.  It works very well.  A bit on the noisy side, but that&#x27;s okay.  The main thing it works well.  Would buy another.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the design and the price and reviews from previous costumers. to date i am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, it works when you want it to.  Not fancy looking, but not junky looking either.  Wish it was offered in stainless steel finish.</li>
            <li> We use it for hand soap in the kitchen.  We have had it a few months and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.  Sensor is not overly sensitive.  Works with all liquid soaps so far.&lt;br /&gt;The fluid control and battery compartment is on the bottom.  I think it would be better if it was in the back&lt;br /&gt;because, if I forget to keep away from sensor, and I try to adjust settings or change battery, soap would dispense.</li>
            <li> Bought it in February, 2013.  It stopped working in November, 2013.  We ( 4 people) used it a lot, probably 20-40 times a day.  We liked it, but the old-fashioned pump is reliable. We will likely go with the pump.</li>
            <li> I use this in my nursery, after each changing with so many big and little hands around this has helped sanitation concerns! The colors and design are modern, only complaint is the lowest setting gives ALOT of sanitizer...too much. It has a great drip tray which isn&#x27;t necessary bc the product performs so well! I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> First thing I&#x27;d say is never put this on higher than the low setting. At low it gives you a healthy dose of soap. Generally we have to trigger the sensor twice before it dispenses anything.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed with the purchase since Homedics is usually a good name to deal with. x x x x x</li>
            <li> The dispenser works OK.  We have it in a well-lit bathroom and I&#x27;ve never experienced any false triggering like the other reviewer mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It drips with each use with standard Dial or Walgreen&#x27;s liquid soap.  Drip tray attaches with a magnet, but it&#x27;s only covered over by a plastic sticker.  Ours started rusting after about 6 months, swelled up under the sticker, and now it won&#x27;t even sit properly under the dispenser.  And the drip tray is essential, given how much this thing drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called up Homedics customer service today to try to buy a replacement.  First, I made the mistake of choosing \\&quot;warranty service\\&quot; from their voice menu.  This took me to another menu where they determined that my product was out of warranty, and then their system hung up on me without giving me an option for an operator or a representative.  When I called back in and navigated the generic information route through their voice menus, their system kept me on hold about 20 minutes and then after torturing me with a message every 15 seconds encouraging me to leave a message, it finally forced me into a voice mailbox which had no identifying information on it.  I left a critical message about my phone mistreatment and then came here to publicize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they ever actually call me back I&#x27;ll edit this review.</li>
            <li> We bought two based on the sale price and ideas we had for them, and I&#x27;m so glad we did! We have one in the kitchen filled with dawn and another in the bathroom. They are great little things! When your hands are gunked up you can turn the water on w/o touching anything but never could get soap to get on them, well now that&#x27;s no longer an issue. Very pleased</li>
            <li> After two weeks the product started running constantly. Only way to make it stop is to remove battery and let it sort of reset. But not long after reinserting batteries, it will start acting up again. I wish I hadn&#x27;t threw away the box or I&#x27;d return it.</li>
            <li> Aside from not being able to adjust how much soap it dispenses at one time, we have no problems with it. Has not clogged yet, which was the problem we had with another brand.</li>
            <li> I love the ease of use. I really love the fact that you can adjust the amount of soap you want. It is wider than I thought it would be so I would recommend that you check out the dimensions before you buy to make sure it will fit in the area you want to place it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 5 of the Homedics Touch-free Sanitizers -- 2 from Walgreens and 3 from Amazon.  I use 2 at home, one in our church kitchen and 2 were for friends.  Wish I had enough for all the bathrooms in our church.</li>
            <li> the title says it all.....  wife put hand soap in it.  it works, but I don&#x27;t know why anyone would bother.  maybe if you cant touch anything, but then you need automatic water too....</li>
            <li> The unit works are described. However the battery low light keeps blinking every time you use it even with brand new duracell batteries. But its working fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud and I have to wave my hand under it four times to get it to work. Stick to a regular old pump.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at Tuesday Morning.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting much because things usually end up at stores like that for a reason.  But it was WAY cheap, so I figured, what the heck?  I have to say I LOVE THIS THING!!!!  We have owned it for at least six months, and I&#x27;ve never had any of the problems other reviewers mention.  It dispenses soap when I want it, doesn&#x27;t when I don&#x27;t.  I keep it in the kitchen windwow above the sink, so I don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;light-sensitive\\&quot; thing at all.  LOVE the drip tray, though I have less trouble with this thing dripping than I did with a regular pump-type dispenser.  And I love that when my hands are greasy/dirty/contaminated (like from cutting raw chicken) I don&#x27;t have to touch it to get soap.  I love this thing so much I&#x27;m willing to come here to Amazon and pay more than twice what I paid at TM for a couple more.</li>
            <li> recently bought a couple of these and they are working out great so far.  i&#x27;m using for soap and getting just the right amount at the lowest #1 setting (tried the higher settings, and it dispenses way too much soap; however, these settings would be fine if you are using for body lotion).  i read the other reviews, but so far i don&#x27;t get any drips or accidental spurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only problem with this unit, for me anyway, is that it&#x27;s huge.  it holds a lot of soap (i poured in around 10-12 oz. with a little room to spare), but it takes up much needed space on my small-ish vanity.  if you have a counter vanity though, it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> I hated it bough 5 of these and theynever worked properly ...some never worked at all...the thing is it was difficult to return because I live out of the US .....</li>
            <li> This is the best value and holds more soap than any other I have used.  Stylish and convenient with drip tray.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ 3 Settings of amount to dispense (From High to Low)&lt;br /&gt;+ Off Button&lt;br /&gt;+ Soap/Sanitizer Fill Limiter&lt;br /&gt;+ Clean Feature&lt;br /&gt;+ Delay timer of dispensing when resetting product settings or when inserting batteries&lt;br /&gt;+ Can be used as a soap dispenser&lt;br /&gt;+ Durable Hard Plastic Material&lt;br /&gt;+ Sleek&lt;br /&gt;+ Modern Look&lt;br /&gt;+ Has a small dish that is used for capturing unwanted dispenses to help save soap/sanitizer&lt;br /&gt;+ Low battery indicator&lt;br /&gt;+ Sensitive Detector&lt;br /&gt;+ Fair Valued Price (Mine was at $17.75 total with shipping and tax included and I do not think you can get a great product like this at a lower price)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- (***IMPORTANT***) Can break easily as in a short time period (mine lasted about 2 months before the malfunctions occurred)&lt;br /&gt;- Requires high maintenance as in if the bottom of dispenser (where you insert the batteries) were slightly wet, the machine can die or malfunction altogether in a few days. [I ordered two, which had somewhat the same issue - one died because it was slightly wet and started leaking battery acid, and the other died because it was slightly wet and started dispensing soap nonstop out]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;+/- The dispensing of soap/sanitizer could be a bit more than expected per setting - (It could be because this product was ONLY designed for hand sanitizers for the reason of why the amount dispensed or it could be your soap quality - for example: my soap tends to foam a lot with a little drop of it so, there you have it for why I would I prefer much less soap dispensed on a low setting.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Notes: The dispenser&#x27;s detector is not located at the body of the product.  It is at the nozzle of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;It is an okay product.</li>
            <li> This dispenser didn&#x27;t work from the moment we purchased it. I bought this for my 84 yr old mother concerned about germs in the bathroom when guests were visiting. The entire bottle was dispensed onto her countertop and flowed onto the floor causing a very serious slip hazard. I observed this before anyone was injured by the wet floor. It took about an hour of cleaning to remove all the solution. Simplehuman is the best dispenser that I have owned and tested.</li>
            <li> I have had three of these dispensers for about 3 months and they are problem free. You can set the quantity of soap you want dispensed. I love the magnetic drip tray and the modern design. This is such a great product for  a very fair price. I had another brand of automatic soap dispenser that cost $40 and had many problems. The manufacturer finally let me know that only Dial liquid soap had the correct viscosity to work in that pump!  That wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the directions (and it still didn&#x27;t help).  Since I have so much Dial soap, I haven&#x27;t tried anything different in this dispenser. It has worked flawlessly. I love it!</li>
            <li> We had another one of these and wanted one which would work as well as the first one.  So far it is easy to use and quite reliable.</li>
            <li> I had to buy another dispenser when my first one broke.  I was not happy the price had gone up so much from when i first bought it at Walgreens.  The first one did last a long time although I am not sure what happened to it.  I would recommend this one over other more expensive dispensers.  The refilling is easy.</li>
            <li> This product was a Christmas present to myself. So far it has worked flawlessly which leads me to wonder if those having problems with it are using it properly. Having an adjustment for amount of product dispensed is a nice feature. Also has a non-clogging feature if it becomes necessary. All pros and no cons here!</li>
            <li> This little guy happily dispenses soap when the light is turned on, the cat walks by, or it hears random voices instructing it to do so.  Spend the extra money to buy this exorcised model instead.  [[ASIN:B001JDHN6Q Touchless Soap &amp; Hand Sanitizer Dispenser]]</li>
            <li> I had an automatic soap dispenser for years that I got used from the Goodwill Store ($3) that finally pooped out on me. We had a good run and who knows how old it was when I first got it. I can&#x27;t find them now but this one was so much cheaper (and had better reviews) I decided to get two. About three months later one went crazy and wouldn&#x27;t stop flowing. I grabbed a cup and caught what I could of the remaining soap until it finally stopped, about 10 minutes later. I thought that was weird, maybe the batteries were low, etc, no big deal. The NEXT day the one in the bathroom did the exact same thing! No sunlight, not near anything, no reason at all, the SAME thing! I ran to the kitchen to get the cup of soap to catch the overflow from the bathroom dispenser. It ran and ran until once again, I thought it was empty. In the meantime (I know, I should write Stephen King novels, right?), since the soap-catching cup was still in the bathroom, I forgot the one in the kitchen didn&#x27;t work and went to use it. It worked fine! The batteries weren&#x27;t dead, the soap was not empty, nothing! I continued to use them both as if nothing had ever happened. One magical day I decided the danger was over and poured some of the soap back into each dispenser but left the soap-catching cup in the kitchen. Who can guess what happened next? THE NEXT DAY the bathroom one did it again! It ran for a good 20 minutes so I finally turned it off (which would be the logical thing to do except that soap is pouring out the top and the button is under a door on the bottom). Well, now that these demonic things know that the soap-catching cup is now back in the bathroom, the kitchen one went off THE SAME DAY! That&#x27;s it! I&#x27;m done! I got what soap I could salvage out and took out the batteries. The interesting thing about the warranty is that it only covers the first 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERVIEW: Over the last three months I would have spent less buying disposable soap dispensers than I did paying $30 (for two) plus the cost of bulk liquid soap. They sucked anyway, when I first bought them they gave WAY too much soap, even set on the lowest setting. (By the way, those settings are only there to make you crazy, they don&#x27;t actually do anything.) No fear, over the span of three months the flow got smaller and smaller (again, despite settings) until we had to use at least two squirts to even get the illusion of clean hands.plus the cost of bulk liquid soap.

            <li> I have other products of this nature and find this one works great and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a touch free soap dispenser. When purchasing dispensers such as this always ensure that they can be filled with any brand of liquid soap.(as this one can)</li>
            <li> I ordered this to keep at my desk, and I use it quite often during the day. It is very easy to use, however it dispenses too much (I put hand sanitizer in it). You can adjust the amount, but I have it on the lowest setting and find that it still gives me a bit much sanitizer. It does drip, so I often scoop the excess off with my finger after it dispenses. It does come with a drip tray which magnetically locks to the body, but it looks sloppy if there are drips of sanitizer sitting on it, and it&#x27;s too much of a hassle for me to constantly clean the tray off.&lt;br /&gt;The size is just fine, not too big or too small, and is a great conversation starter (oddly enough).</li>
            <li> First, it was working OK.  But, as time goes by problems start to creep up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The opening on the back is contour vertically so it&#x27;s nearly impossible to refill it without tilting it.  But, once you try to tilt it you will inadvertently touch the sensor in the front and it will dispense a lot of soap making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The battery cover is not water proof.  Overtime, soap water starts to leak into the battery compartment and acid starts to leak.  Batteries get rusted which is bad since I use rechargables.  Once battery starts leaking it&#x27;s no good for future recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The sensor is funky at times, one time it just starts to dispensing all the soap for no particular reason.  Making a huge mess.  No one was at the sink washing or anything.  Then all of a sudden it starts to dispensing all of the soap it has.  I had to take out the batteries and reset it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one, simplehuman Sensor Pump for Soap or Sanitizer, Brushed Nickel, 13-Ounce, and this works much better.  The soap fill-hole is on top so it&#x27;s much easier to refill.  The battery cover is much tighter.  And no strange act-up of dispensing soap.</li>
