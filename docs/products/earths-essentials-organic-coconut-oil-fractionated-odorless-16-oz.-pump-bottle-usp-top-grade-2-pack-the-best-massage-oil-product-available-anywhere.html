            <li>Works great as a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li>The quality of oil is very nice.  </li>
            <li>The handy pump is helpful in filling the roller bottles without spilling and waisting any oil!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product with convenient pump.</li>
            <li>great price &amp; love the product</li>
            <li>Great carrier oil,,,no slip, Easy glide.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This has many benefits in the bedroom.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my massage business.</li>
            <li>Love the pumps.  </li>
            <li>I also love it for use in my recipe for foaming hand soap.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the shape of the bottle, but I wish they are tinted.  </li>
            <li>Love the pump top insertion piece.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a pump included.</li>
            <li>I use this by itself on my hands as lotion and it feels lovely.</li>
            <li>I also mix with essential oils for medicinal use and find it to be just the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>I love this carrier oil.</li>
            <li>The packaging makes mixing and using so easy.</li>
            <li>The pump made it easy to use</li>
            <li>It soaks in well and is light and odorless.</li>
            <li>this item can be used as a carrier oil for massage &amp; since it&#x27;s good for the skin, can be used on face, scalp &amp; with continuous usage, can actually see improvement in skin tone, smoother, more hydrated.</li>
            <li>Even with the plastic seal &amp; original packing intact, both bottles I ordered leaked about one-third as I packed in my suitcase &amp; sandwiched with clothes to protect the bottle from damage as suitcases get thrown about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product itself is very good but packaging need to be redesigned as one third in both bottles is very high wastage.</li>
            <li>Amazing and all natural.</li>
            <li>and I have read is sperm friend for those wishing to become pregnant.</li>
            <li>Put the right labeling and ingredients.</li>
            <li>Super silky, absorbs really fast and has no fragrance.</li>
            <li>cant live without this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Brought this twice, love it as a carrier oil for essential oils!</li>
            <li>Will be back for more.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>This blend is really working for being ready and ready for anytime that you want to use it.</li>
            <li>I will stick to my doTERRA odorless, stainless Fractionated Coconut Oil from now on.</li>
            <li>and i really like</li>
            <li>Even Dr. Adorable coconut oil not real.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ll buy it again along with all my other favorite oils.</li>
            <li>It goes a long way, is smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li>This is the first massage oil I used that was completely odorless.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone interested in using natural products as opposed to store bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this oil alone but mostly for mixing with my more expensive oils as a carrier.</li>
            <li>Normal coconut oil changes with the season or temperature.  </li>
            <li>The pump bottle makes it easy to use and less wastful.  </li>
            <li>Also, it goes quickly into the skin due to the short chain nature of it.</li>

            <li> Also, it goes quickly into the skin due to the short chain nature of it.</li>
            <li> i typically use fractionated coconut oil to dilute essential oils and extra virgin coconut oil for making body products and cooking.  </li>
            <li> The long chain fatty acids are filtered out and what you are left with is Fractionated coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I typically use solid coconut oil and thought I would try this one.  </li>
            <li> I use them everyday with my essential oils for massaging for my family.  </li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t have ingredients listed , I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s organic fractionated coconut oil, even  the label of this product , it&#x27;s a homemade product not real for me.</li>
            <li> Been buying carrier oil this one seems to me not real...</li>
            <li> but it is just a matter of pushing down while you twist it on.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why, but every time I use this oil my skin gets rough and itchy.  </li>
            <li> The pump is a bit hard to get on</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, packaging i.e. design of bottle cap is very poor.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product. it mixes well with liquids.</li>
            <li> Brought this twice, love it as a carrier oil for essential oils!</li>
            <li> Use it as a personal lubricant and all body moisturizer. Amazing and all natural. The long chain fatty acids are filtered out and what you are left with is Fractionated coconut oil. It is short chain and so it will NOT STAIN. This has many benefits in the bedroom. Also, it goes quickly into the skin due to the short chain nature of it. Thus, it is an ideal body oil. Finally, if that wasn&#x27;t enough, it has probiotic effects. Thus, it will not upset women&#x27;s vaginal flora and I have read is sperm friend for those wishing to become pregnant. So, as you can see this is all around a versatile product.</li>
            <li> Great price. Good product. I will definitely be ordering again!! I use as a carrier oil with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my massage business. Great carrier oil,,,no slip, Easy glide. Thank you</li>

            <li> i&#x27;m liking this.  i typically use fractionated coconut oil to dilute essential oils and extra virgin coconut oil for making body products and cooking.  however, i have been using this fractionated coconut oil as a body moisturizer all by itself and i really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll buy it again along with all my other favorite oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist, great oil.  Love the pumps.  😊😊😊</li>

            <li> Good product with convenient pump.</li>
            <li> Fractional Coconut is the way to go!  Normal coconut oil changes with the season or temperature.  This blend is really working for being ready and ready for anytime that you want to use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Love the pump top insertion piece. Greta value. The pump is a bit hard to get on but it is just a matter of pushing down while you twist it on.</li>

            <li> Best fractioned coconut oil for the best price</li>
            <li> I love this carrier oil. I use this oil to make roller bottles with my essential oils. The handy pump is helpful in filling the roller bottles without spilling and waisting any oil!</li>
            <li> The pump made it easy to use</li>
