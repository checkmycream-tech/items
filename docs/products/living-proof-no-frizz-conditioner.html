    <ol>
            <li>Works incredibly well on frizz!!</li>
            <li>it worked awesome!  </li>
            <li>even when it&#x27;s raining, lol!  </li>
            <li>Instead, I switched to the Perfect Hair Day formula</li>
            <li>The best part is that I can&#x27;t feel any product in my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>In trying the \\&quot;Full\\&quot; line, I have to say that the conditioner is the best product the line has to offer.     </li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner for frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful- have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>I have incredibly curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>All the products work great.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t flinch when shelling out for LP because Ihave a great hair day every day now.  </li>
            <li>I then use the No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray, which gives me great hold when used with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>With the PHD s/c and these two styling products, I have a great hair day every day.  </li>
            <li>With the PHD s/c and these two styling products, I have a great hair day every day.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>BUT...this is some great stuff.</li>
            <li>Greatly exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and loved the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>Very impressive given how many products claim this and don&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li>I will comment however on how pleasant it smelled and how well it removed odors from my hair after finishing a shift at my coffee shop and from camping.</li>
            <li>PHD was the perfect fit for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>the first two uses that it is the perfect formula for my needs.  </li>
            <li>It honestly took about two teaspoons of this conditioner for my below shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>The products do have a nice scent and is the reason why I gave it a two star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product smells good and feels good on the hair, but it really didn&#x27;t work on frizz for me.</li>
            <li>I love LP products and they have become my holy grail products now.  </li>
            <li>This protects my precious hair color.  </li>
            <li>I love it but do not know if I will buy it again when this runs out.</li>
            <li>Love it and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>and I now have healthy, shiny looking hair-</li>
            <li>mine more than hers</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Bought the sample of No Frizz by Living Proof and after one use am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Made my hair slightly more manageable.</li>
            <li>It hydrates the perfect amount for my dry, somewhat wavy, color treated hair that&#x27;s prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li>It may be my hair type (I have a lot of hair, but i&#x27;s fine in texture, &amp; wavy, that HATES humidity-</li>
            <li>Excellent product I had used it before a little pricey</li>
            <li>but I like the fact that LP shampoos are sulfate free</li>
            <li>PHD hydrated my hair, leaving it silky and shiny and of course, frizz free.  </li>
            <li>Makes the great cut I got finally gets its break without the frizz and fluffiness muddling it up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light, which would be a godsend for those with fine or baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been able to grow it out which I haven&#x27;t been able to do since I was in high school.</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey, but it most definitely cuts the frizz to almost nil.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner as I think it really works against frizz (my perennial struggle.)</li>
            <li>i ordered this as i had seen it 2 years ago on the drs programme on tv, it had such good reviews</li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re using the right LP s/c for your hair type, you will get great results.  </li>
            <li>Been looking for the trifecta of Living Proof shampoo / conditioner / styling creme for years and years, spent so much money on so many products that don&#x27;t work or kind of work but never been satisfied.</li>
            <li>Conditioner on fine hair is very, very tricky.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super unruly, but is always poofy after I wash it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m letting it dry on its own as usual, and it feels great!</li>
            <li>this stuff is AMAZING, especially in the humid weather.</li>
            <li>The Living Proof Conditioner is light and very conditioning.</li>
            <li>LP Perfect Hair Day is for normal to dry hair and eliminates frizz completely also.  </li>
            <li>The No Frizz conditioner (and shampoo) are well suited to normal to oily hair or fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The No Frizz conditioner (and shampoo) are well suited to normal to oily hair or fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The PHD formula also volumizes, however, if you are looking for a very volumzing formula, the Full formula is the one for you.  </li>
            <li>You barely have to use any of it and the bottle is shape in a way that make sure you get all of the product.</li>
            <li>Works really well on my full bodied-wavy-color treated hair.</li>
            <li>The less I have to wash my hair, the longer my color will stay bright.</li>
            <li>LP invented a new molecule that&#x27;s in all their s/c which repels dirt and oil, thereby keeping hair clean for several more days.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, but would have returned it if I wasn&#x27;t out because bottle wasn&#x27;t properly sealed &amp; had leaked.</li>
            <li>I have used the whole bottle and there was no change to frizz at all!  </li>
            <li>I have no problem paying more for products that actually do what they claim.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally shiny and has a smooth feel.</li>
            <li>Keeps my frizzy hair straight in humid weather!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s almost completely wave free.</li>
            <li>Since I have tried so many different products I&#x27;d like a &amp;#34;guarantee&amp;#34; so when it doesn&#x27;t work as advertised I can return it.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Got a compliment on my hair for the first time in forever.</li>
            <li>noticeable frizz difference after first use.</li>
            <li>I think No Frizz is more suited to normal to oily hair with no dryness, only an issue with frizz.  </li>
            <li>Whatever ingredients account for the frizz control, certainly work.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something without certain chemicals, but I&#x27;m also allergic to some of the things that companies put into shampoo/conditioner instead of SLS.</li>
            <li>Whatever discoveries LP made, they are certainly working for me.</li>
            <li>It really works, and works well.</li>
            <li>It really works, and works well.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>I brought this product straight from the living proof website along with the shampoo, leave in conditional, serum and repair mask.</li>
            <li>And it takes very little shampoo and conditioner (about the size of a quarter for my below shoulder length hair) to get the job done, making these products much more economical than it seems.  </li>
            <li>If you have oily hair, the No Frizz formula will not only cleanse well, it will keep your hair clean longer, as will all LP shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but not worth spending that much for.</li>
            <li>Hair was less frizzy and more manageable, but not as much as in the claims.</li>
            <li>which is the main reason I tried this product)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Just wish the scent was a little bit better, but I will take the no frizz affect any day any scent.</li>
            <li>A little expensive but really worth it and smells great too!</li>
            <li>I also tried the Restore formula but it was way too heavy, more suited to severely dry/damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I know that a new molecule was created and it is the bedrock of the shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to see how well this product worked.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and no harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li>that I decided to buy the whole line so that there will be no excuse for not working.</li>
            <li>Using this condition significantly decreases the fro factor, especially during the dry winters in new england.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only found one product by another brand that REALLY works</li>
            <li>Stay far far away from this product and the others in the no frizz line.  </li>
            <li>I have to preface this review with the admission that my hair is not super frizzy or curly, but has just enough wave in it to be unruly and very full.</li>
            <li>And, I know that a lot of women such as myself have forgone (or skimped) on conditioner because it weighs down our fine hair.    </li>
            <li>and now I can finally wear my hair down without having to straighten it first with little or no frizz. :-)</li>
            <li>the product worked OK, but it doesn&#x27;t stand out from other OTC products, that cost way less.</li>
            <li>This was no help for my fine but thick head of hair.</li>
            <li>And LP shampoos and conditioners are very gentle and contain no silicone to weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hydrate my hair enough but it did keep my hair clean for an extra two days, cutting down on shampooing, which is a good thing because my hair is color treated.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is rich and it only takes a small amount to work up a foamy lather.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount and works better than any other salon products I have tried.</li>
            <li>It really helped tame my naturally curly hair.</li>

            <li> It only takes a small amount and works better than any other salon products I have tried.</li>
            <li> It really helped tame my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair needs moisture because not only do I color regularly, I also use heated styling tools several times a week, both of which dry out my hair.</li>

            <li> I have long hair that tends to frizz and curl during the warmer humid months.</li>

            <li> With this my hair is sleek and shiny as soon as my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> This is the beast conditioner for dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work - just mAkes hair dry</li>
            <li> When I received the products I followed the instruction as indicated and when my hair was dry.....</li>
            <li> My experience with this product is that it does not live up to its name or advertising.</li>
            <li> I have found other, less expensive products, that do much better.</li>
            <li> hair is very wavy, corse, dry and very thick.</li>
            <li> After washing several times with clarifying shampoo the symptoms subsided, but now my scalp is flaking and still a little sore and itchy.</li>
            <li> and I get absolutely no frizz even when the humidity climbs to 90%,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the expensive side, but well worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Due to the cost and not having the results I&#x27;d hoped for as a regular conditioner I&#x27;m using this as al leave in conditioner just to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a profound difference in my hair, and it&#x27;s a very small bottle for $20</li>
            <li> so I decided to test out other formulas.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair every other day but with LP I can go an extra day, sometimes two, without shampooing.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read my other reviews of Living Proof hair-care products, you know I&#x27;ve tried and want to be a fan, but am not.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would do exactly what it promised; get rid of my dry frizzy hair, unfortunately for me this product held no relief for my messy mop, it still remains as unmanageable as before.</li>
            <li> I have thick and wavy/curly hair that I could only wear down if I straightened it with a flat iron and even then on a humid summer day would frizz up after a half an hour outdoors.</li>
            <li> Works &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, but there are other products that work just as well for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> The Restore formula is for very dry, damaged hair and was a little too heavy for me.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner, when used with the No Frizz shampoo, left my hair frizz free (even in Florida where the humidity is atrocious)!  </li>
            <li> I guess other than a Keratin treatment there is no magic shampoo or conditioner that will prevent frizz.</li>
            <li> This small accomplishment however does not outweigh the 24$ price tag nor does it ignore the small size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small size, which did not allow me to use long-term, but for what I did use, I recommend.</li>
            <li> It worked no better than another product I used.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that 8 oz is too small or rather that it is too expensive for something you will rinse out in the end.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where the humidity does ugly things to hair</li>
            <li> any where near what is advertised, truly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It was very expensive (and for only 8 oz or shampoo/conditioner!!)</li>
            <li> I always rinse in cold water to seal, as my hair is damaged and dry.</li>
            <li> I have always had frizzy and very unhealthy looking hair.  </li>
            <li> I wanted it to work sooooo bad</li>
            <li> it would work to some extent, but it didnt for both of us so very disappointed, will not be ordering again</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It may be my hair type (I have a lot of hair, but i&#x27;s fine in texture, &amp; wavy, that HATES humidity- which is the main reason I tried this product) the product worked OK, but it doesn&#x27;t stand out from other OTC products, that cost way less. I&#x27;ve only found one product by another brand that REALLY works but it&#x27;s been discontinued, so I&#x27;ll keep trying to find a replacement. Due to the cost and not having the results I&#x27;d hoped for as a regular conditioner I&#x27;m using this as al leave in conditioner just to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and loved the way it makes my hair feel.  I also purchased the shampoo and the leave-in conditioner. All the products work great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would do exactly what it promised; get rid of my dry frizzy hair, unfortunately for me this product held no relief for my messy mop, it still remains as unmanageable as before. Only now, after purchasing the shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner, I&#x27;m out 74$. I will comment however on how pleasant it smelled and how well it removed odors from my hair after finishing a shift at my coffee shop and from camping. This small accomplishment however does not outweigh the 24$ price tag nor does it ignore the small size of the bottle. I hope this review was helpful but I must acknowledge that I have tried several expensive brands and none have made any difference either, at least this one smells nice.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I hope they NEVER Stop making it!</li>
            <li> Love the product, but would have returned it if I wasn&#x27;t out because bottle wasn&#x27;t properly sealed &amp; had leaked.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see how well this product worked. I have long hair that tends to frizz and curl during the warmer humid months. Using this product along with the no frizz shampoo definitely helped. I give it a thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well on frizz!!</li>
            <li> This was no help for my fine but thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner from this retailer is not the same as when you get from a salon.  It doesnt work at all.  I have used the whole bottle and there was no change to frizz at all!  I have bought the same bottle from ULTA snd it worked awesome!  I wish I hadn&#x27;t waisted my money!</li>
            <li> This formula is for oily hair.  LP Perfect Hair Day is for normal to dry hair and eliminates frizz completely also.  It hydrates the perfect amount for my dry, somewhat wavy, color treated hair that&#x27;s prone to frizz.  I didn&#x27;t get enough moisture from the No Frizz formula but I like the fact that LP shampoos are sulfate free so I decided to test out other formulas.  The Restore formula is for very dry, damaged hair and was a little too heavy for me.  PHD was the perfect fit for me.  All LP shampoos and conditioners totally eliminate frizz.  The PHD formula also volumizes, however, if you are looking for a very volumzing formula, the Full formula is the one for you.  I love LP products and they have become my holy grail products now.  If you have oily hair, the No Frizz formula will not only cleanse well, it will keep your hair clean longer, as will all LP shampoos and conditioners.  LP invented a new molecule that&#x27;s in all their s/c which repels dirt and oil, thereby keeping hair clean for several more days.  I usually wash my hair every other day but with LP I can go an extra day, sometimes two, without shampooing.  This protects my precious hair color.  And LP shampoos and conditioners are very gentle and contain no silicone to weigh hair down.  Whatever ingredients account for the frizz control, certainly work.  I live in Florida where the humidity does ugly things to hair and I get absolutely no frizz even when the humidity climbs to 90%, even when it&#x27;s raining, lol!  As long as you&#x27;re using the right LP s/c for your hair type, you will get great results.  And it takes very little shampoo and conditioner (about the size of a quarter for my below shoulder length hair) to get the job done, making these products much more economical than it seems.  I have no problem paying more for products that actually do what they claim.  I have a hall closet full of hair product FAILS that I have spent countless dollars on.  So I don&#x27;t flinch when shelling out for LP because Ihave a great hair day every day now.  Finally!! something that works!!  Thank heavens!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Lightweight and no harsh chemicals! A little expensive but really worth it and smells great too!</li>
            <li> it truly is no frizz. this stuff is AMAZING, especially in the humid weather. i have unruly curls, and this tames them well.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly curly and frizzy hair. Using this condition significantly decreases the fro factor, especially during the dry winters in new england.</li>
            <li> I wanted something without certain chemicals, but I&#x27;m also allergic to some of the things that companies put into shampoo/conditioner instead of SLS. I&#x27;ve had no reaction with this. My hair isn&#x27;t super unruly, but is always poofy after I wash it. With this my hair is sleek and shiny as soon as my hair is dry. You barely have to use any of it and the bottle is shape in a way that make sure you get all of the product. It&#x27;s on the expensive side, but well worth it for me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner, when used with the No Frizz shampoo, left my hair frizz free (even in Florida where the humidity is atrocious)!  It was raining today and it showed no signs of fuzziness.  The shampoo is rich and it only takes a small amount to work up a foamy lather.  It honestly took about two teaspoons of this conditioner for my below shoulder length hair.  Much to my astonishment, when my hair dried, there was zero frizz.  Some reviewers have stated that this conditioner was drying, and I think this is the case with me. It didn&#x27;t hydrate my hair enough but it did keep my hair clean for an extra two days, cutting down on shampooing, which is a good thing because my hair is color treated.  Instead, I switched to the Perfect Hair Day formula and I could tell with the first two uses that it is the perfect formula for my needs.  I think No Frizz is more suited to normal to oily hair with no dryness, only an issue with frizz.  My hair needs moisture because not only do I color regularly, I also use heated styling tools several times a week, both of which dry out my hair. I also tried the Restore formula but it was way too heavy, more suited to severely dry/damaged hair. PHD hydrated my hair, leaving it silky and shiny and of course, frizz free.  I know that a new molecule was created and it is the bedrock of the shampoos and conditioners. Whatever discoveries LP made, they are certainly working for me. These products are certainly different from anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  The less I have to wash my hair, the longer my color will stay bright. I also use the Prime Style Extender cream, which increases the effectiveness of styling products, hydrates and extends my style into the 2nd day (and sometimes beyond that).  I then use the No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray, which gives me great hold when used with a curling iron.  The best part is that I can&#x27;t feel any product in my hair at all.  It&#x27;s super light, which would be a godsend for those with fine or baby fine hair.  With the PHD s/c and these two styling products, I have a great hair day every day.  I&#x27;m definitely a LP convert.  The No Frizz conditioner (and shampoo) are well suited to normal to oily hair or fine hair.  But they simply didn&#x27;t have enough hydration for me.  But no matter, they definitely control frizz, which is why I&#x27;m giving this conditioner four stars.  It really works, and works well.With the PHD s/c and these two styling products, I have a great hair day every day.  I&#x27;m definitely a LP convert.

            <li> This is the beast conditioner for dry, frizzy hair. A little bit goes a long way. The smell isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read my other reviews of Living Proof hair-care products, you know I&#x27;ve tried and want to be a fan, but am not. In trying the \\&quot;Full\\&quot; line, I have to say that the conditioner is the best product the line has to offer.     Conditioner on fine hair is very, very tricky. And, I know that a lot of women such as myself have forgone (or skimped) on conditioner because it weighs down our fine hair.    The Living Proof Conditioner is light and very conditioning. I purchased a small size, which did not allow me to use long-term, but for what I did use, I recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner as I think it really works against frizz (my perennial struggle.) The aroma is divine. My only complaint is that 8 oz is too small or rather that it is too expensive for something you will rinse out in the end. I love it but do not know if I will buy it again when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner for frizzy hair!  My hair is fine and it works beautifully. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product is that it does not live up to its name or advertising. It did not help reduce the frizz in my hair. I have found other, less expensive products, that do much better.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my full bodied-wavy-color treated hair. It&#x27;s naturally shiny and has a smooth feel.</li>
            <li> Excellent product I had used it before a little pricey</li>
            <li> Wonderful- have been using it for years. Keeps my frizzy hair straight in humid weather!</li>
            <li> I have to preface this review with the admission that my hair is not super frizzy or curly, but has just enough wave in it to be unruly and very full. Kind of pricey, but it most definitely cuts the frizz to almost nil. Very impressive given how many products claim this and don&#x27;t deliver. If I use the shampoo and conditioner together, I don&#x27;t even have to blow my hair out to get it lie flat and it&#x27;s almost completely wave free. I&#x27;m impressed and I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> The product smells good and feels good on the hair, but it really didn&#x27;t work on frizz for me.</li>
            <li> This product, as all hair products describe that it will keep your hair from getting frizzy and not allow your hair folicles to soak up humidity leaving your hair the way it was just after you styled it..........Haven&#x27;t found this product to work any where near what is advertised, truly disappointed.  Since I have tried so many different products I&#x27;d like a &amp;#34;guarantee&amp;#34; so when it doesn&#x27;t work as advertised I can return it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work - just mAkes hair dry</li>
            <li> Love it and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I have always had frizzy and very unhealthy looking hair.  I have tried EVERYTHING!!  I have NEVER seen a product change the condition of my hair as drastically as these products have done.  This line is a miracle and I now have healthy, shiny looking hair- I&#x27;ve even been able to grow it out which I haven&#x27;t been able to do since I was in high school. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It really helped tame my naturally curly hair. It only takes a small amount and works better than any other salon products I have tried.</li>
            <li> i ordered this as i had seen it 2 years ago on the drs programme on tv, it had such good reviews so i was so possitive it would work. My daughter and i both used it as both of us have hair that is frizzy , mine more than hers but both of our hair puffs out from humidity.so i was possitive it would work to some extent, but it didnt for both of us so very disappointed, will not be ordering again</li>
            <li> I give it 4 out of 5 because I don&#x27;t go for anything that promises to repair hair, that&#x27;s not possible. BUT...this is some great stuff. I bought both the no frizz shampoo and conditioner, and used it after I put in some highlights, which is bleach...bad for your hair. I washed and conditioned with this, along with a sample they sent me of a deeper conditioner, and my hair felt like silk as I rinsed it. I always rinse in cold water to seal, as my hair is damaged and dry. I&#x27;m letting it dry on its own as usual, and it feels great! I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Stay far far away from this product and the others in the no frizz line.  The smell is horrendous and after using it for 3 days it began burning my scalp and eyes while giving me a massive headache. After washing several times with clarifying shampoo the symptoms subsided, but now my scalp is flaking and still a little sore and itchy. I emailed the company asking for a refund, and I have never heard back from them. I have used probably hundreds of products in my hair and I have never had an experience like this.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says. Great!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am blown away. Been looking for the trifecta of Living Proof shampoo / conditioner / styling creme for years and years, spent so much money on so many products that don&#x27;t work or kind of work but never been satisfied. Bought the sample of No Frizz by Living Proof and after one use am so glad I did. Got a compliment on my hair for the first time in forever. Makes the great cut I got finally gets its break without the frizz and fluffiness muddling it up. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but not worth spending that much for. I didn&#x27;t notice a profound difference in my hair, and it&#x27;s a very small bottle for $20+.  Personally, I will not buy again but instead stick to lower-priced options that work just as well.</li>
            <li> noticeable frizz difference after first use. love it. Just wish the scent was a little bit better, but I will take the no frizz affect any day any scent.</li>
            <li> I have thick and wavy/curly hair that I could only wear down if I straightened it with a flat iron and even then on a humid summer day would frizz up after a half an hour outdoors. I tried this with the shampoo and styling cream a couple of years ago at Sephora hoping that it would work. It was very expensive (and for only 8 oz or shampoo/conditioner!!) did not work at all!! Only recently I found a product that works for me, which is Nexxus Frizz Defy (I use the shampoo, conditioner and styling cream) and now I can finally wear my hair down without having to straighten it first with little or no frizz. :-)</li>
            <li> The only hair product line that has eliminated my frizz and added brilliance to my hair!  Greatly exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Works &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, but there are other products that work just as well for a lot less money.  Hair was less frizzy and more manageable, but not as much as in the claims.</li>
            <li> Made my hair slightly more manageable. It will not prevent your hair from frizzing on a humid day but I will say it makes your hair easier to work with. I guess other than a Keratin treatment there is no magic shampoo or conditioner that will prevent frizz.</li>
            <li> I brought this product straight from the living proof website along with the shampoo, leave in conditional, serum and repair mask. I wanted it to work sooooo bad that I decided to buy the whole line so that there will be no excuse for not working. When I received the products I followed the instruction as indicated and when my hair was dry..... Well Frizz was there. It worked no better than another product I used.  I used it three times and each time the same result.  The products do have a nice scent and is the reason why I gave it a two star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very wavy, corse, dry and very thick. So I am always looking for a solution to manage my hair without breaking the bank. I guess I will continue to do what I have been doing.......chemically straighten it and flat iron!</li>
