            <li>Great hair product!!!!!</li>

            <li>This is the best hair wax ever.</li>
            <li>Very good item arrived on time</li>
            <li>Happy husband, happy...</li>
            <li>so I am happy too.</li>
            <li>This is a great wax, works just how I needed it to.</li>
            <li>Hair stays in perfect place and product washes out easily.</li>
            <li>I am in the service industry so I am running around and moving often and this product always does a good job of holding my hair the way I like it.</li>
            <li>love the tea tree line and they are at a great price here.</li>
            <li>Love this wax!  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li>The minty, tea tree oil scent is nice.</li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews online and here on Amazon, and thought this would be a better alternative than DFI wax.</li>
            <li>salon price 2-3 times more.....</li>
            <li>so I was glad to find it here.  </li>
            <li>Smells better than either of those, though.</li>
            <li>The merchant who sells this was extremely quick and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a crusty residue and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>then i prefer but it is not to shiny nor does it have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>The wax is, according to him, FAR superior.</li>
            <li>Looks very fashionable, feel is also very good, wearing also comfortable, is the feeling when you walk is not very good, overall very good</li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve experienced is that after I began using it, the stores I shop at stopped carrying this particular product.  </li>
            <li>I tried to sculpt my hair and the wax, no matter how many times I would apply, would NOT STICK AND HOLD, and the hair keeps falling back to its original position.</li>
            <li>I used a little bit on my fingers and start at the roots, and then work it gently out through the ends, and my hair is styled with a very nice shine.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my second favorite that i have found</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t make the night-hobbits happy, but at least nobody is accusing me of insanity anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good control.</li>
            <li>I bought a tube and tried it, but the reviews were very misleading.</li>
            <li>This wax really gives your hair body and shine.</li>
            <li>styled the way you want it, and it doesn&#x27;t really have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, a big plus for me is that the company (Paul Mitchell) does not conduct/endorse animal testing (unlike MANY major hair product brands).</li>
            <li>Older bottle of the product.  </li>
            <li>Older label.  </li>
            <li>They should provide the product as advertised, not an older tube of it.</li>
            <li>this wax is a little more pasty</li>
            <li>Better than American Crew gel if you&#x27;re after a long-lasting messy look, but not as good as American Crew fiber or Redken Rough Paste.</li>
            <li>Purposefully ordered the wax, because I could not find it where I live.</li>
            <li>two at a time, and usually get a better price even if I have to pay shipping.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t harden and works well for a busy life.  </li>
            <li>Product itself was old and watery.  </li>
            <li>Rub a little in to a clean head of hair and you&#x27;re set.</li>
            <li>I would take the tea tree wax over the same version of the normal Paul Mitchell wax of this style.</li>
            <li>I like this product because after your hair is completely dry it feels like there&#x27;s nothing in your hair, however, it holds the style very well.  </li>
            <li>if it gets bumped or knocked out of place, I can put it back the way I want it without having to use any more, which is what I never liked about gels.  </li>
            <li>Also, customers should be aware that when &#x27;sculpting&#x27; with this wax, they should be very careful, because while I was doing so, I lost TONS of hair and had caused irritation on my scalp.</li>

            <li> Lasts  all day and you only need a little</li>
            <li> But would I recommend it to make the hair look wet and shiny?</li>
            <li> Of course the wax is much harder to find in our area</li>
            <li> It also softens your hair so it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like with hair spray or other spiking products.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this product everyday to hold my hair in place during the workday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely frustrating, knowing that you are very LIMITED on how you can style your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used for years but is sometimes hard to find.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t look greasy and works for both my thick hair and her finer hair.</li>
            <li> very negative and said he doesn&#x27;t touch the stuff because his customers complained that it failed to hold.</li>
            <li> but sometimes I get tired of salon prices.</li>
            <li> Tired of buying this at the place I get my hair cut; sometimes they have, sometimes not.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Paul Mitchell products</li>
            <li> Difficult to find,</li>
            <li> Disappointed, because it feels like the Paul Mitchelle Styling Gel, that I already have.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read all the reviews online and here on Amazon, and thought this would be a better alternative than DFI wax. I bought a tube and tried it, but the reviews were very misleading. I tried to sculpt my hair and the wax, no matter how many times I would apply, would NOT STICK AND HOLD, and the hair keeps falling back to its original position. It&#x27;s absolutely frustrating, knowing that you are very LIMITED on how you can style your hair. Also, customers should be aware that when &#x27;sculpting&#x27; with this wax, they should be very careful, because while I was doing so, I lost TONS of hair and had caused irritation on my scalp. Also, to add to my experience, a friend of mine is a hair stylist himself and had worked with hundreds of different kinds of wax; his reception of the wax? very negative and said he doesn&#x27;t touch the stuff because his customers complained that it failed to hold. Would I recommend the product? No. But would I recommend it to make the hair look wet and shiny? Yes.</li>
            <li> love the tea tree line and they are at a great price here. this wax is a little more pasty then i prefer but it is not to shiny nor does it have a strong smell. it&#x27;s my second favorite that i have found and so i still say 5 stars</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday to hold my hair in place during the workday. I am in the service industry so I am running around and moving often and this product always does a good job of holding my hair the way I like it. Another plus is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a crusty residue and washes out easily. Also, what I like about this product is that its scent is not too \\&quot;perfumy\\&quot;; meaning it doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a girl. Lastly, a big plus for me is that the company (Paul Mitchell) does not conduct/endorse animal testing (unlike MANY major hair product brands).</li>
            <li> Used it for years, best styling product for a light/medium hold out there</li>
            <li> cant beat the price or the shipping time...w/buy again.....salon price 2-3 times more.....gives you the shine that you are desiring</li>
            <li> The styling wax is not the same thing as the styling gel, my husband informed me.  The wax is, according to him, FAR superior. Of course the wax is much harder to find in our area so I was glad to find it here.  Happy husband, happy...well. I bought shoes so I am happy too.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for all kinds of hair.  I have very coarse and thick hair.  I used a little bit on my fingers and start at the roots, and then work it gently out through the ends, and my hair is styled with a very nice shine.  It gives the hair volume and definition so that you look like you have been to the salon.  Great hair product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used for years but is sometimes hard to find. I was glad to find it on Amazon at a good price. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Paul Mitchell products but sometimes I get tired of salon prices. This wax really gives your hair body and shine. It is not a matte finish. It almost makes my hair look darker when I use it and that&#x27;s what I like. It also softens your hair so it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; like with hair spray or other spiking products.</li>
            <li> Tired of buying this at the place I get my hair cut; sometimes they have, sometimes not.  I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t harden and works well for a busy life.  My wife like the scent of it.  The merchant who sells this was extremely quick and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> what can I say............. This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased from this vendor.  I know the product, well.  It arrived on time and is not a knock off</li>
            <li> This is a great wax, works just how I needed it to. I would take the tea tree wax over the same version of the normal Paul Mitchell wax of this style.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hairdresser recommended it and we both use it.  Pricey but doesn&#x27;t look greasy and works for both my thick hair and her finer hair.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it works.  I keeps hair styled the way you want it, and it doesn&#x27;t really have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look.  I also like that if it gets bumped or knocked out of place, I can put it back the way I want it without having to use any more, which is what I never liked about gels.  The only downfall is that it is more expensive than I would ultimately like, though it is cheaper here online then in store.</li>
            <li> Looks very fashionable, feel is also very good, wearing also comfortable, is the feeling when you walk is not very good, overall very good</li>
            <li> Purposefully ordered the wax, because I could not find it where I live. The consistency is a gel, not wax. Disappointed, because it feels like the Paul Mitchelle Styling Gel, that I already have. I cannot tell the difference between the gel and wax.</li>
            <li> The minty, tea tree oil scent is nice. It&#x27;s also anti-fungal, so it took care of the morels I had growing up there. That didn&#x27;t make the night-hobbits happy, but at least nobody is accusing me of insanity anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good control. Better than American Crew gel if you&#x27;re after a long-lasting messy look, but not as good as American Crew fiber or Redken Rough Paste. Smells better than either of those, though.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my style. It doesn&#x27;t leaving your hair greasy looking like gel or moose.</li>
            <li> Older bottle of the product.  Older label.  Product itself was old and watery.  Should&#x27;ve returned it but such a hassle.  They should provide the product as advertised, not an older tube of it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my boyhood cowlick in place !  Lasts  all day and you only need a little, I wish it keep the rest of me in place as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair wax ever. Hair stays in perfect place and product washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Love this wax!  Difficult to find, tho.  Now I can get it anytime!</li>
            <li> I like this product because after your hair is completely dry it feels like there&#x27;s nothing in your hair, however, it holds the style very well.  It has a light pleasant fragrance.  The only problem I&#x27;ve experienced is that after I began using it, the stores I shop at stopped carrying this particular product.  They&lt;br /&gt;still carry some of the Tea Tree line just not the Styling Wax.  (((?)))  So I order it online, two at a time, and usually get a better price even if I have to pay shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with short hair. Rub a little in to a clean head of hair and you&#x27;re set. That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Very good item arrived on time</li>
