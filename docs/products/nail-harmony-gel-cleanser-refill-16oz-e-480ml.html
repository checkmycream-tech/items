            <li>I am looking forward to getting more as I need it.  </li>
            <li>and this product works MUCH better...</li>
            <li>The formulation works perfectly with this brand and, when used with the other Gelish products, helps polish stay on - without chipping - for up to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>it is fine, but I like to store it in the bin with all my colors</li>
            <li>Great product , I use this with cotton because many people say only work&lt;br /&gt;on special paper or some like that</li>

            <li>Great price and large quantity that you can&#x27;t find in local stores.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but a surprise non the less. :P</li>
            <li>Was surprised it hadn&#x27;t leaked - as liquid in a twist top bottle laying on its side</li>

            <li>It was packaged really well too!</li>
            <li>I love the gel nail polish and this cleanser is essential to working with them.</li>
            <li>I purchased this but instead received 4 smaller bottles which is actually better for storage.  </li>

            <li>Packaged very well and received very fast.</li>
            <li>In spite of the picture, it really is the large bottle of Gellish nail cleanser.</li>
            <li>Gel polish really gives an upscale look for very litte effort.</li>
            <li>Much better price than you&#x27;ll pay at Sally&#x27;s or other stores.</li>
            <li>I order my Gelish cleanser from amazon because it is cleaper and always in new condition!</li>
            <li>My 480 ml actually came in two smaller bottles, which is actually better for me.  </li>

            <li>You&#x27;ll be fine with a smaller bottle if you&#x27;re the single user.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is a vital part of the process.</li>
            <li>does the same and much cheaper..</li>
            <li>AND A NAIL PROFESSIONAL TOLD ME</li>
            <li>Gel nails (with the small LED light)</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really last quite 2 weeks for me, but the process is easy, takes less time than traditional nail polish does to dry.</li>
            <li>but I wet a small piece of cotton on this and clean</li>

            <li> I was under the impression I was going to be receiving one bottle, but when I opened the package there were two 8oz. bottles. Not bad, but a surprise non the less. :P I&#x27;m pleased with it. No spills. No leaks. Happy Camper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nails done at a salon for years. But recently, I had a cut back on my hours at work, and I sought a home system I could use as an alternative.  I found that I LOVE the Gelish product line.  Carefully applied (do NOT allow the polishes to ooze onto cuticles or skin along side the nail), it truly does last for weeks.  I like it so well, that even if my hours go back up, I doubt if I&#x27;ll go back to a salon.  What a wonderful find!</li>
            <li> I do my own nails with gel polish. The cleanser is a vital part of the process. I use all Harmony Gel products on my nails and they always turn out great. This is also a great value vs. buying product in the stores.</li>
            <li> Nice product to use with Gelish nails--but you can use alcohol in its place.  This is slightly less drying than using alcohol alone.</li>
            <li> Does what&#x27;s its suppose to but next time I think I&#x27;ll just use Alcohol does the same and much cheaper..I bought cause ppl keep telling me it keeps the gel shiner to end with this step. I seen no difference if using this or Alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have read that regular alcohol works - some say 99% alcohol and others say even regular drugstore rubbing alcohol, but I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances, and this stuff works, so I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
            <li> Works as good as the brand name at one fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well and received very fast.</li>
            <li> I order my Gelish cleanser from amazon because it is cleaper and always in new condition! Works great to cleanse the nail before the gel application as well as cleansing the tacky layer after the top coat.</li>
            <li> Great product for great price.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and a must-have if you&#x27;re using the Gelish nail system. I only gave it five stars because I use Gelish just for myself and I&#x27;m not sure why I ever thought I would need this much cleanser. You&#x27;ll be fine with a smaller bottle if you&#x27;re the single user. I love all Relish products.</li>
            <li> You MUST have this for gel cured polish.  This stuff is the best on the market as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> This is an item that you use a lot when doing gel nails.  I recommend purchasing this size because you can always refill the smaller bottle and you get more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Allows me to do my nails at home with salon quality products.</li>
            <li> This gel cleanser is ideally suited for use with Gelish nail polish.  The formulation works perfectly with this brand and, when used with the other Gelish products, helps polish stay on - without chipping - for up to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Much better price than you&#x27;ll pay at Sally&#x27;s or other stores. This is a huge bottle and should last a long time. It was packaged really well too!</li>
            <li> HI,EVERYBODY I&#x27;M MRS.CRUZ AND I&#x27;M A BIG FAN OF GEL POLISH I LOVE IT.F.Y.I.RUBBING ALCOHOL DOES THE SAME AS THIS AND ALL CLEANSERS FOR GEL NAIL POLISH..GEL CLEANSER IS RUBBING ALCOHOL IN THE BEGINNING I PAYED LOTS OF MONEY FOR THE CLEANSER AND A NAIL PROFESSIONAL TOLD ME USE RUBBING ALCOHOL IT&#x27;S THE SAME THING SO I JUST DONE MY GEL NAIL POLISH IT&#x27;S NAVY BLUE BY O.P.I.I PURCHASED IT FROM AMAZON AND I USED RUBBING ALCOHOL FOR CLEANSER I WAS NERVOUS AND IT TURNED OUT BEAUTIFULLY I&#x27;M SO EXCITED ABOUT THE ADVICE I&#x27;M ON HERE PASSING IT TO YOU.HEY SAVE SOME MONEY....</li>
            <li> In spite of the picture, it really is the large bottle of Gellish nail cleanser. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Great value and shipping, wife loved it, nuff said!</li>
            <li> This is great as a refill for my gel nail kit. Gel nails (with the small LED light) don&#x27;t really last quite 2 weeks for me, but the process is easy, takes less time than traditional nail polish does to dry. I do not use traditional polish since it lasts for only a day or two before looking ratty. Gel polish really gives an upscale look for very litte effort.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the picture does not at all match the item I bought. It was a rebuy for me, so I trusted it would be what I purchased before - it was - whew.  Arrived safely.  Was surprised it hadn&#x27;t leaked - as liquid in a twist top bottle laying on its side isn&#x27;t the best idea (it was plastic baggied though - which would possibly have saved the box and not my product IF it had leaked).</li>
            <li> Great price and large quantity that you can&#x27;t find in local stores. I love the gel nail polish and this cleanser is essential to working with them.</li>
            <li> Great Transaction, Harmony Gelish Gel Polish Cleaner is a great Product. I am looking forward to getting more as I need it.  Thank You</li>
            <li> I like to do my own gel nails and I use this a lot. You can use other stuff, but I find this one smells the least offensive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this but instead received 4 smaller bottles which is actually better for storage.  I&#x27;ve tried using alcohol (90%+) and this product works MUCH better...worth the cost!</li>
            <li> My 480 ml actually came in two smaller bottles, which is actually better for me.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry quite as much about it all evaporating while I&#x27;m working!</li>
            <li> I suppose it you store it upright it is fine, but I like to store it in the bin with all my colors and I had to put a piece of saran wrap under the cap.  That did work though, so just a little leak.</li>
            <li> I like having a sizeable quantity in reserve.  I pour from this bottle into the little bottle that came with my Nail Gel Polishing Kit.</li>
            <li> This comes in two separate bottles but still at the advertised amount. It works perfectly and seems to be a swell price!</li>
            <li> Alcohol works just as well as this product, however does not have the nice scent that Nail Harmony cleanser has.</li>
            <li> Great product , I use this with cotton because many people say only work&lt;br /&gt;on special paper or some like that but I wet a small piece of cotton on this and clean&lt;br /&gt;my gel nail work perfect</li>
            <li> The product Rocks - the only thing is that when shipping it may leak a bit. The seller was wonderful and sent me a refill for what had leaked. Great product just the mfg of the bottle should have designed it better (with a seal of some kind - at least when brand new). :-)</li>
