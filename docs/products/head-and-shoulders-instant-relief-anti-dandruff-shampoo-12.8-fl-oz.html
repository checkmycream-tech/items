    <ol>
            <li>I still find Head &amp; Shoulders as the best dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>I recommend instead is the H&amp;S almond and coconut oil scent, which is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s one of the best versions of Head &amp; Shoulder&#x27;s</li>

            <li>Its still a great head and shoulders product nonetheless</li>
            <li>So this is a great improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a cooling menthol feel to it, which is great for an irritated scalp.  </li>
            <li>The odor is pleasant  but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Still, in the interests of a fair review, I went with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And not in a good way, I am sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>A good shampoo not just for dandruff but for anyone.</li>
            <li>And not in a good way, I am sure.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo has a nice body and lathers well.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo, soothing on the scalp and gets hair clean.</li>
            <li>But the scalp stimulation sure seems really effective as dandruff control.  </li>
            <li>my hair has always been very fine all my life</li>
            <li>but it also smells pretty great too.</li>
            <li>I guess things are safe for those of us who need no help from our shampoo to keep our hair &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>this one has a distinctive peppermint &amp; tea tree fragrance which is distinctive &amp; refreshing.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got the opportunity to try it.</li>
            <li>For this price, it seems like H&amp;S could include a better dispensing mechanism.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the &amp;#34;instant relief&amp;#34; is more marketing than substance, so I&#x27;m docking it a star for that.</li>
            <li>yesterday it was 90) tend to make me itchy on top.  </li>
            <li>This is used in many anti-dandruff products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite brand of shampoo to control dandruff.</li>
            <li>I first put on the shampoo, I detected the bit of mint scent, which was pleasant, but wasn&#x27;t getting the cooling feeling I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be really good to use this in the summer when everything in Baltimore is hot and humid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s just because I have a more severe case than others, but this feels more like a marketing ploy to me than a genuine benefit.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something more herbal (something more like peppermint or tea tree oil, which are advertised to be in this), but it&#x27;s a clean, balanced scent that&#x27;s not going to overpower</li>
            <li>It leaves my hiar feeling soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>It is infused with peppermint and Tea Tree Oil which leaves your hair smelling great and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I like the way this shampoo both smells and how feels on the scalp better than the original Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lathered up in millions of smoothing bubbles and rinsed clean leaving my scalp feeling healthy and my hair looking bouncy and shiny.</li>
            <li>It rinses out easily.</li>
            <li>Same great cleaning I&#x27;ve come to love from Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li>All of them work fairly well, so why a new one?</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered up fine.</li>
            <li>So you have to do a little sleuthing to figure out which are best for oily scalps/hair.</li>
            <li>bottle was huge; 22.5 fl oz.</li>
            <li>Weâ€™ve come to expect great dandruff control from Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, and this Instant Relief variety is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it do a great job controlling dandruff</li>
            <li>Works good so far.</li>
            <li>B00FIZGLRI Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Conditioner]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>Just clean my hair</li>
            <li>After using it, my scalp does feel clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great on the hair itself (some other dandruff shampoos can leave it feeling like straw) and I personally find the scent to be quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>This plastic bottle has convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really did feel cool and refreshing on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief has a much more pleasant scent than classic Head &amp; Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>Neither one, it is more of gentle minty fragrance.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, it does feel cool upon application</li>
            <li>I have fairly severe dandruff, and I had run out of my regular dandruff shampoo about a week before getting this.</li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampoo is a great shampoo that is effective against the dry scalp/dandruff battle.</li>
            <li>We will have to work our way through the product line over the next 5 years - lol.. Gentle and have used it every day until gone.</li>
            <li>It has the same reliable results but the peppermint and tea tree essence gives it a very refreshing and not medicinal smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless, my male thinning hair still feels clean and the shampoo lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a nice, subtle fragrance, and a good texture -- lathers generously.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope this new shampoo does better.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the kind of deep menthol type of relief you get from something like pine tar extract, only with a nice H&amp;S smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about instant cooling, but I love the way it feels, that the scent is so light, and the way my hair feels and looks after blow drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about it.  </li>
            <li>This version offers something ostensibly better, which I take to be a combination of ingredients to soothe the scalp.</li>
            <li>It has a nice but subtle scent, and my hair feels nicely conditioned after using it.  </li>
            <li>I really like most of them, this one in particular.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent, foams up really well, washes out easily and left my hair soft, full, clean and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>(You can look carefully, too, as Amazon has kindly provided a nice big image).</li>
            <li>(You can look carefully, too, as Amazon has kindly provided a nice big image).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why some people experienced greasy or coated feeling hair.</li>
            <li>this is a great alternative that still gives that tingle feel, it also does a good job cleaning your hair and washes out with no left behind residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering whether the manufacturer thinks they&#x27;ll sucker you in by avoiding that kind of language on the front of the bottle, and that once you use it, you&#x27;ll just have to love it.</li>

            <li>It smells crisp and clean and rinses easily with no residue left on my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You may have tried many different dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>This is a review specifically of the Instant Relief variant of Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Head &amp; Shoulders dandruff shampoos for many decades.</li>
            <li>It seemed like the latest rebranding of a H&amp;S product to compete with the Selenium based Selsun Blue lines.</li>
            <li>But I have to give Head &amp; Shoulders credit for a product that does exactly what it states it will do.</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo today and here are my first impressions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with the Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Tee tree oil and peppermint make this product a soothing pleasure to use as it not only controls dandruff but feels refreshing on my scalp.</li>
            <li>After use, hair feels soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>I have used Head and Shoulders, or one of its generic equivalents (of which there are many), all my life, and have not had any dandruff since junior high school.</li>
            <li>which is what I normally buy, but I think I prefer that because I can solve my dandruff problem and then use a better conditioner on my hair at the same time.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a really strong cooling feeling given that it&#x27;s tea tree oil, peppermint, and instant relief shampoo, however, I didn&#x27;t feel that coldness on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Or better yet, why should you try a new one?&lt;br /&gt;Simple, this Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief dandruff shampoo has something the others do not have.</li>
            <li>also appreciate a bottle with a good solid flat top so that I can keep it upside down in the shower and have the shampoo come right out without shaking or squeezing and there is no waste.</li>
            <li>I absolutely did not find that to be the case.</li>
            <li>but it is very itchy.</li>
            <li>I really</li>
            <li>The fragrance does not last after the shampoo rinses out which is preferable but the shampoo keeps the dandruff away and that is the primary purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nothing really different from standard H&amp;S, to be honest.</li>
            <li>I continued to forget buying my regular brand, so after a week of shampooing with some very non-dandruff shampoo products, my scalp was in a fairly horrendous state: loads of dandruff, itching everywhere, not a pretty picture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now whether this &amp;#34;Instant Relief&amp;#34; really has any lasting positive benefits for my hair / scalp other than feeling cool and refreshing</li>
            <li>A creamy lightly tinted mint green shampoo that lathers well and leaves a tingly clean feeling on your scalp.  </li>
            <li>Not sure that&#x27;s what most people are looking for!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair with something else to actually get my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>The product certainly fits the bill for those with mild to moderate dandruff issues.</li>
            <li>It has the soothing sensation of peppermint, instantly bring a cool relief to your itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>But after a minute or two I was surprised to notice a tingling coolness in my scalp - the product really was working as advertized!  </li>
            <li>really like this new Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>but when I got older, my hair changed.</li>
            <li>Sadly, the tea tree/peppermint formula is more of a gimmick more than anything else.  </li>
            <li>If you apply and shampoo a second time, it&#x27;s definitely more noticeable then, but most of the time, on the first application, it&#x27;s pretty faint.</li>
            <li>Not finding that my scalp is particularly irritated and in need of soothing, I don&#x27;t feel any particular effect on the scalp.</li>
            <li>The aroma could be a little more appealing as it still has a slight medicinal content in the aroma.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I know I can trust the Head &amp; Shoulders brand of dandruff shampoo and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>this is my new shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders have been updating there line &amp; i like their new shampoos.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by the &amp;#34;instant relief&amp;#34; shampoo since I do live in Arizona and hotter days (</li>
            <li>Apart from that, it contains the same active ingredient as regular Head &amp; Shoulders so it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it out for your own benefit.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used Head &amp; Shoulders for my dandruff in a long time (and been spending more money for other products in that time), but this really works.</li>
            <li>However, this conditioner seems to flatten my curls, but does leave my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I have navigated the H&amp;S terrain in the past, mostly avoiding ANYTHING that contains conditioners (for oily hair</li>
            <li>first impression: Where is the instant relief?</li>
            <li>Not sure that&#x27;s what most people are looking for!a day or two.</li>
            <li>Minor issue, but worth noting.</li>
            <li>This scent seems more like the classic H&amp;S I remember from years past.... slightly medicinal, with the peppermint and tea tree oil added to give more of a menthol / minty smell but it comes across to me as a bit medicinal mixed with bubble</li>
            <li>only instant relief this variant provided was relief from clean looking hair.</li>
            <li>The only instant relief this variant provided was relief from clean looking hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long straight hair and this left it easy to style and manage with no residue and did not look oily and flat at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Back when I was young, H&amp;S would actually put the words &#x27;for oily hair&#x27; boldly on the bottle.</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point to make is that the bottle says that this &amp;#34;cools on contact,&amp;#34; largely providing that sense of instant relief.</li>
            <li>As I have naturally oily hair (a charter member of the need-to-wash-hair-every-day-no-exceptions club), I have always veered towards the H&amp;S variants for oily hair.</li>
            <li>In the old days, I was prescribed tar shampoo by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>all I really wanted was to get rid of the itch and add body at the same time.</li>
            <li>It worked wonders for my husband who has short thin hair, and i loved it even though i don&#x27;t have dandruff</li>
            <li>Although it works for me (makes my hair soft ), it fails to deliver any good result for my husband.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this type of lid break easily in the past.</li>
            <li>While this might technically be the case, the cooling sensation isn&#x27;t as &#x27;cool&#x27; as expected.</li>
            <li>recommend the Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff shampoo highly to anyone seeking relief from dandruff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the high dollar tee tree shampoo before and while they are very much different</li>
            <li>The Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampoo is new and it offers a cooling feeling when I shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li>But, I was pleasantly surprised when the second wash and rinse of my hair left the hair with a fuller feeling and not too much of the &amp;#34;squeak&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Such is the PC world we live in.</li>
            <li>I have used H&amp;S on and off for decades and it appears they are relaunching their products with new scents / features and a different style bottle, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li>and I really wasn&#x27;t looking for that when I bought it, but if you are, this likely won&#x27;t meet your expectations in its current formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a major ugh), or anything that suggests it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first rinse left my hair feeling &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; and I was concerned that my hair might have moisture removed and become too dry.</li>
            <li>particular variant of H&amp;S for &amp;#34;instant relief&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t indicate anything about either conditioners or dry hair on the front label.</li>
            <li>OK, when I was given a bottle of Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampoo for review, I was a bit confused.  </li>
            <li>No dry scalp (I use with a conditioner)</li>
            <li>This pale green creamy shampoo has a refreshing peppermint and menthol scent.  </li>
            <li>Dry Scalp Care with Almond Oil, Not Green Apple, Not Ocean Lift).</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely; not like the usual heavy medicinal smell of dandruff shampoos youâ€™ve used before.</li>
            <li>The main active ingredient is still 1% pyrithione zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; Shoulders for decades, though sometimes I will use a competing brand with the same anti-dandruff active ingredient if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s on sale when I need to buy a new bottle of shampoo.  </li>

            <li> So you have to do a little sleuthing to figure out which are best for oily scalps/hair.</li>
            <li> bottle was huge; 22.5 fl oz.</li>
            <li> Weâ€™ve come to expect great dandruff control from Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, and this Instant Relief variety is no exception.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it do a great job controlling dandruff</li>
            <li> Works good so far.</li>
            <li> B00FIZGLRI Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Conditioner]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> Just clean my hair</li>
            <li> After using it, my scalp does feel clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great on the hair itself (some other dandruff shampoos can leave it feeling like straw) and I personally find the scent to be quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> This plastic bottle has convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really did feel cool and refreshing on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief has a much more pleasant scent than classic Head &amp; Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Neither one, it is more of gentle minty fragrance.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, it does feel cool upon application</li>
            <li> I have fairly severe dandruff, and I had run out of my regular dandruff shampoo about a week before getting this.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampoo is a great shampoo that is effective against the dry scalp/dandruff battle.</li>
            <li> We will have to work our way through the product line over the next 5 years - lol.. Gentle and have used it every day until gone.</li>
            <li> It has the same reliable results but the peppermint and tea tree essence gives it a very refreshing and not medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nonetheless, my male thinning hair still feels clean and the shampoo lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a nice, subtle fragrance, and a good texture -- lathers generously.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hope this new shampoo does better.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the kind of deep menthol type of relief you get from something like pine tar extract, only with a nice H&amp;S smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about instant cooling, but I love the way it feels, that the scent is so light, and the way my hair feels and looks after blow drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about it.  </li>
            <li> This version offers something ostensibly better, which I take to be a combination of ingredients to soothe the scalp.</li>
            <li> It has a nice but subtle scent, and my hair feels nicely conditioned after using it.  </li>
            <li> I really like most of them, this one in particular.</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent, foams up really well, washes out easily and left my hair soft, full, clean and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> (You can look carefully, too, as Amazon has kindly provided a nice big image).</li>
            <li> (You can look carefully, too, as Amazon has kindly provided a nice big image).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some people experienced greasy or coated feeling hair.</li>
            <li> this is a great alternative that still gives that tingle feel, it also does a good job cleaning your hair and washes out with no left behind residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering whether the manufacturer thinks they&#x27;ll sucker you in by avoiding that kind of language on the front of the bottle, and that once you use it, you&#x27;ll just have to love it.</li>

            <li> It smells crisp and clean and rinses easily with no residue left on my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You may have tried many different dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> This is a review specifically of the Instant Relief variant of Head and Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Head &amp; Shoulders dandruff shampoos for many decades.</li>
            <li> It seemed like the latest rebranding of a H&amp;S product to compete with the Selenium based Selsun Blue lines.</li>
            <li> But I have to give Head &amp; Shoulders credit for a product that does exactly what it states it will do.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo today and here are my first impressions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with the Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Tee tree oil and peppermint make this product a soothing pleasure to use as it not only controls dandruff but feels refreshing on my scalp.</li>
            <li> After use, hair feels soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> I have used Head and Shoulders, or one of its generic equivalents (of which there are many), all my life, and have not had any dandruff since junior high school.</li>
            <li> which is what I normally buy, but I think I prefer that because I can solve my dandruff problem and then use a better conditioner on my hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a really strong cooling feeling given that it&#x27;s tea tree oil, peppermint, and instant relief shampoo, however, I didn&#x27;t feel that coldness on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Or better yet, why should you try a new one?&lt;br /&gt;Simple, this Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief dandruff shampoo has something the others do not have.</li>
            <li> also appreciate a bottle with a good solid flat top so that I can keep it upside down in the shower and have the shampoo come right out without shaking or squeezing and there is no waste.</li>
            <li> I absolutely did not find that to be the case.</li>
            <li> but it is very itchy.</li>
            <li> I really</li>
            <li> The fragrance does not last after the shampoo rinses out which is preferable but the shampoo keeps the dandruff away and that is the primary purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nothing really different from standard H&amp;S, to be honest.</li>
            <li> I continued to forget buying my regular brand, so after a week of shampooing with some very non-dandruff shampoo products, my scalp was in a fairly horrendous state: loads of dandruff, itching everywhere, not a pretty picture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now whether this &amp;#34;Instant Relief&amp;#34; really has any lasting positive benefits for my hair / scalp other than feeling cool and refreshing</li>
            <li> A creamy lightly tinted mint green shampoo that lathers well and leaves a tingly clean feeling on your scalp.  </li>
            <li> Not sure that&#x27;s what most people are looking for!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair with something else to actually get my hair clean.  </li>
            <li> The product certainly fits the bill for those with mild to moderate dandruff issues.</li>
            <li> It has the soothing sensation of peppermint, instantly bring a cool relief to your itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> But after a minute or two I was surprised to notice a tingling coolness in my scalp - the product really was working as advertized!  </li>
            <li> really like this new Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> but when I got older, my hair changed.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the tea tree/peppermint formula is more of a gimmick more than anything else.  </li>
            <li> If you apply and shampoo a second time, it&#x27;s definitely more noticeable then, but most of the time, on the first application, it&#x27;s pretty faint.</li>
            <li> Not finding that my scalp is particularly irritated and in need of soothing, I don&#x27;t feel any particular effect on the scalp.</li>
            <li> The aroma could be a little more appealing as it still has a slight medicinal content in the aroma.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I know I can trust the Head &amp; Shoulders brand of dandruff shampoo and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is my new shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders have been updating there line &amp; i like their new shampoos.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by the &amp;#34;instant relief&amp;#34; shampoo since I do live in Arizona and hotter days (</li>
            <li> Apart from that, it contains the same active ingredient as regular Head &amp; Shoulders so it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it out for your own benefit.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Head &amp; Shoulders for my dandruff in a long time (and been spending more money for other products in that time), but this really works.</li>
            <li> However, this conditioner seems to flatten my curls, but does leave my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I have navigated the H&amp;S terrain in the past, mostly avoiding ANYTHING that contains conditioners (for oily hair</li>
            <li> first impression: Where is the instant relief?</li>
            <li> Not sure that&#x27;s what most people are looking for!a day or two.</li>
            <li> Minor issue, but worth noting.</li>
            <li> This scent seems more like the classic H&amp;S I remember from years past.... slightly medicinal, with the peppermint and tea tree oil added to give more of a menthol / minty smell but it comes across to me as a bit medicinal mixed with bubble</li>
            <li> only instant relief this variant provided was relief from clean looking hair.</li>
            <li> The only instant relief this variant provided was relief from clean looking hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long straight hair and this left it easy to style and manage with no residue and did not look oily and flat at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Back when I was young, H&amp;S would actually put the words &#x27;for oily hair&#x27; boldly on the bottle.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point to make is that the bottle says that this &amp;#34;cools on contact,&amp;#34; largely providing that sense of instant relief.</li>
            <li> As I have naturally oily hair (a charter member of the need-to-wash-hair-every-day-no-exceptions club), I have always veered towards the H&amp;S variants for oily hair.</li>
            <li> In the old days, I was prescribed tar shampoo by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> all I really wanted was to get rid of the itch and add body at the same time.</li>
            <li> It worked wonders for my husband who has short thin hair, and i loved it even though i don&#x27;t have dandruff</li>
            <li> Although it works for me (makes my hair soft ), it fails to deliver any good result for my husband.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this type of lid break easily in the past.</li>
            <li> While this might technically be the case, the cooling sensation isn&#x27;t as &#x27;cool&#x27; as expected.</li>
            <li> recommend the Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff shampoo highly to anyone seeking relief from dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the high dollar tee tree shampoo before and while they are very much different</li>
            <li> The Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampoo is new and it offers a cooling feeling when I shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li> But, I was pleasantly surprised when the second wash and rinse of my hair left the hair with a fuller feeling and not too much of the &amp;#34;squeak&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Such is the PC world we live in.</li>
            <li> I have used H&amp;S on and off for decades and it appears they are relaunching their products with new scents / features and a different style bottle, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li> and I really wasn&#x27;t looking for that when I bought it, but if you are, this likely won&#x27;t meet your expectations in its current formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a major ugh), or anything that suggests it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first rinse left my hair feeling &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; and I was concerned that my hair might have moisture removed and become too dry.</li>
            <li> particular variant of H&amp;S for &amp;#34;instant relief&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t indicate anything about either conditioners or dry hair on the front label.</li>
            <li> OK, when I was given a bottle of Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampoo for review, I was a bit confused.  </li>
            <li> No dry scalp (I use with a conditioner)</li>
            <li> This pale green creamy shampoo has a refreshing peppermint and menthol scent.  </li>
            <li> Dry Scalp Care with Almond Oil, Not Green Apple, Not Ocean Lift).</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely; not like the usual heavy medicinal smell of dandruff shampoos youâ€™ve used before.</li>
            <li> The main active ingredient is still 1% pyrithione zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; Shoulders for decades, though sometimes I will use a competing brand with the same anti-dandruff active ingredient if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s on sale when I need to buy a new bottle of shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Instant Relief with peppermint complex and tea tree essence (Not Citrus Breeze, Not Classic Clean, Not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other varieties of Head &amp; Shoulders (H&amp;S) in the past few years and don&#x27;t find this any different.</li>
            <li> , so it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other shampoos with the same claims, and they where actually cooling, like mint and tea oil should be.&lt;br /&gt;This was no different then regular</li>
            <li> lather lasts when applied to the hair and does not go flat.</li>
            <li> H&amp;S is still a somewhat premium priced shampoo; there are other generic products with the same active ingredient, so it really just comes down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> I wondered about Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampooâ€™s scent would really be like because the label has â€œwith peppermint complex and tea tree essence.</li>
            <li> What I do notice is that my hair, which gets washed every day, is a bit more manageable, less fly-away and subject to static cling, but without the unpleasant residue which you usually get with conditioners.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampoo are similar to those of other Head and Shoulders Shampoos.</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from dandruff, I have tried many products to solve the issue.</li>
            <li> In particular I can barely smell the mint, and don&#x27;t like the other smells, though they&#x27;re hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> no itch (as long as I use every 3 days)</li>
            <li> shampoo itself is a thick milky blue/green cream which emerges readily from the container.</li>
            <li> The new Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief dandruff shampoo cools the scalp on contact with a peppermint complex and tea tree essence.  </li>
            <li> Previous shampoos worked well for day one, but by end of second day, my head was getting itchy and by third day&#x27;s end, I began to have some flaking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about five days in a row, and my hair feels the same as any other dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Had I somehow missed the part where this is for people whose hair is dry as shredded wheat without milk?</li>

            <li> so bad, in fact, that the only way that I can keep it away is to cycle through T-Gel, Selsun Blue, and Head &amp; Shoulders in alternating days since one product doesn&#x27;t keep up with</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s no dandruff and very little in the way of itching.</li>
            <li> Whatever, at least I&#x27;m still getting the dandruff control of Head &amp; Shoulders that I have depended on for years.  </li>
            <li> My family suffers from periodic dandruff, so we have the regular routine of using a dandruff shampoo at least once a week to either cure the problem or keep the dandruff</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s subtle and doesn&#x27;t linger, so</li>
            <li> It cleans like a normal shampoo and doesn&#x27;t do anything terrible to  my hair, and the little scalp irritation that I was trying to treat has cleared up</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have bad dandruff, I&#x27;m not really feeling any &amp;#34;instant relief&amp;#34; with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does not seem to be irritating if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t worry, the peppermint scent is very subtle, so you won&#x27;t smell like a tube of toothpaste post shower...</li>
            <li> I was also a bit skeptical of the cooling claims made for the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is OK--a wisp fruity, nothing bad.</li>
            <li> But when I tried to wash it out, I could feel a slimy residue that told me that this stuff was going to be bad news for me.</li>
            <li> I wonâ€™t go into how bad it was</li>
            <li> I suffer from a bad case of dandruff...</li>
            <li> This Head and Shoulders immediately cools the annoying and agonizing itch that drives you nuts.</li>

            <li> Feels great during the wash.  Packaging was poor - the flip-up top was completely broken off, which is inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, soothing on the scalp and gets hair clean. I like the scent, it&#x27;s subtle and doesn&#x27;t linger, so no one is going to think, &amp;#34;Mm, smells like someone uses Head &amp; Shoulders.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This Head and Shoulders immediately cools the annoying and agonizing itch that drives you nuts. The scent is lovely; not like the usual heavy medicinal smell of dandruff shampoos youâ€™ve used before. This doesnâ€™t smell like a dandruff shampoo. The scent reminded me of the nose-tingling briskness after a snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathered up in millions of smoothing bubbles and rinsed clean leaving my scalp feeling healthy and my hair looking bouncy and shiny. Flakes have disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottle was huge; 22.5 fl oz., so it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have tried many different dandruff shampoos. I urge you to try this. It may be the last one you ever use.</li>

Just clean my hair and I&#x27;m good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is where the ship ran totally aground. The shampoo lathered up fine. But when I tried to wash it out, I could feel a slimy residue that told me that this stuff was going to be bad news for me. Still, in the interests of a fair review, I went with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got out of the shower, dried off and and let my hair fully dry. An hour later I looked in the mirror and...my hair looked like total cr*p--like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in a day or two. Stringy and heavy. Hideous. No time to do anything about it, I went to work. And two different people mentioned that my hair looked &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;. And not in a good way, I am sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hideous. By the end of the day, I had that hideous greasy feeling that those of us with oily scalp/hair know well. I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair with something else to actually get my hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked again at the bottle. Had I somehow missed the part where this is for people whose hair is dry as shredded wheat without milk? I looked carefully. (You can look carefully, too, as Amazon has kindly provided a nice big image). Nope. Not. A. Single. Word. I&#x27;m wondering whether the manufacturer thinks they&#x27;ll sucker you in by avoiding that kind of language on the front of the bottle, and that once you use it, you&#x27;ll just have to love it. Nope. I hate it. And if you have oily hair, I guarantee you will too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again with this H&amp;S variant for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only instant relief this variant provided was relief from clean looking hair. Not sure that&#x27;s what most people are looking for!a day or two. Stringy and heavy. Hideous. No time to do anything about it, I went to work.

            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner it works great for me it cools/soothes my head while leaving my hair beautiful it even helps with my frizz this is my new shampoo and conditioner please never stop making this</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders have been updating there line &amp; i like their new shampoos.  this one has a distinctive peppermint &amp; tea tree fragrance which is distinctive &amp; refreshing.  i have been using H &amp; S for years &amp; i like the change from their original boring formula.  for the dry winter heat, H &amp; S is needed to get rid of flakes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had dandruff but I&#x27;ve used head and shoulders for decades and I really like most of them, this one in particular. It has a very light scent, foams up really well, washes out easily and left my hair soft, full, clean and not frizzy. I&#x27;m not sure why some people experienced greasy or coated feeling hair. I absolutely did not find that to be the case. My hair didn&#x27;t feel dry or weighted at all. I don&#x27;t know about instant cooling, but I love the way it feels, that the scent is so light, and the way my hair feels and looks after blow drying. I will continue to use it and I&#x27;m glad I got the opportunity to try it.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have bad dandruff, I&#x27;m not really feeling any &amp;#34;instant relief&amp;#34; with this shampoo. I&#x27;ve used many other varieties of Head &amp; Shoulders (H&amp;S) in the past few years and don&#x27;t find this any different. I&#x27;ve used it for about five days in a row, and my hair feels the same as any other dandruff shampoo. The main active ingredient is still 1% pyrithione zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, my male thinning hair still feels clean and the shampoo lathers nicely. The scent is a relatively subtle peppermint and tea tree essence (no idea how to describe that last scent though.) Unlike Costco size bottles, there&#x27;s no pump, so you do have to pop the lid open. I&#x27;ve had this type of lid break easily in the past. Minor issue, but worth noting. For this price, it seems like H&amp;S could include a better dispensing mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the &amp;#34;instant relief&amp;#34; is more marketing than substance, so I&#x27;m docking it a star for that. H&amp;S is still a somewhat premium priced shampoo; there are other generic products with the same active ingredient, so it really just comes down to personal preference. The product certainly fits the bill for those with mild to moderate dandruff issues.</li>
            <li> Not what i was expecting. I have used other shampoos with the same claims, and they where actually cooling, like mint and tea oil should be.&lt;br /&gt;This was no different then regular H&amp;S. Very disappointed.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; Shoulders for decades, though sometimes I will use a competing brand with the same anti-dandruff active ingredient if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s on sale when I need to buy a new bottle of shampoo.  I have to say that this formula exceeded my expectation.  It has a nice but subtle scent, and my hair feels nicely conditioned after using it.  Some other brands leave my hair a bit dry/straw-like.</li>
            <li> This is specifically about the Peppermint and Tea tree formulation. I&#x27;m not crazy about it.  In particular I can barely smell the mint, and don&#x27;t like the other smells, though they&#x27;re hard to describe.  Harshly chemical maybe and it seems to penetrate the skin so you taste it as well.&lt;br /&gt;The label says tea tree essence rather than tea tree oil, and it is not listed as an active ingredient so I don&#x27;t know if there is enough for a medicinal effect.  It cleans like a normal shampoo and doesn&#x27;t do anything terrible to  my hair, and the little scalp irritation that I was trying to treat has cleared up so it is up to expected H&amp;S standards</li>
            <li> It leaves my hiar feeling soft and smells great. Flakes be gone with Head &amp; Shoulders! I still find Head &amp; Shoulders as the best dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works good so far. Smells good. I was expecting a really strong cooling feeling given that it&#x27;s tea tree oil, peppermint, and instant relief shampoo, however, I didn&#x27;t feel that coldness on my scalp. Its still a great head and shoulders product nonetheless</li>
            <li> I have used H&amp;S on and off for decades and it appears they are relaunching their products with new scents / features and a different style bottle, which I like a lot.  This scent seems more like the classic H&amp;S I remember from years past.... slightly medicinal, with the peppermint and tea tree oil added to give more of a menthol / minty smell but it comes across to me as a bit medicinal mixed with bubble gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I recommend instead is the H&amp;S almond and coconut oil scent, which is absolutely wonderful.  They all have the same active ingredients so depends if you want to smell like peppermint or coconut... I&#x27;ll take coconut/almond any day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, it controls my dandruff and itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders have brought out a lot of dandruff control products. All of them work fairly well, so why a new one? Or better yet, why should you try a new one?&lt;br /&gt;Simple, this Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief dandruff shampoo has something the others do not have. It has the soothing sensation of peppermint, instantly bring a cool relief to your itchy scalp. I think it would be really good to use this in the summer when everything in Baltimore is hot and humid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff shampoo highly to anyone seeking relief from dandruff.</li>
            <li> The new Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief dandruff shampoo cools the scalp on contact with a peppermint complex and tea tree essence.  This pale green creamy shampoo has a refreshing peppermint and menthol scent.  It works at both clearing flakes and relieving itching in just one use.  Product packaging suggest using at least twice a week to keep dandruff at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient  of 1% pyrithione zinc works well at eliminating dandruff.  I like the way this shampoo both smells and how feels on the scalp better than the original Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo.</li>
            <li> OK, when I was given a bottle of Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampoo for review, I was a bit confused.  &amp;#34;Instant Relief&amp;#34; of what?  I was also a bit skeptical of the cooling claims made for the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put on the shampoo, I detected the bit of mint scent, which was pleasant, but wasn&#x27;t getting the cooling feeling I was expecting.  Whatever, at least I&#x27;m still getting the dandruff control of Head &amp; Shoulders that I have depended on for years.  But after a minute or two I was surprised to notice a tingling coolness in my scalp - the product really was working as advertized!  This shampoo really did feel cool and refreshing on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now whether this &amp;#34;Instant Relief&amp;#34; really has any lasting positive benefits for my hair / scalp other than feeling cool and refreshing I cannot say.  But I have to give Head &amp; Shoulders credit for a product that does exactly what it states it will do.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo today and here are my first impressions.  The mint content makes the shampoo provide a cooling effect as it is applied. The shampoo has a nice body and lathers well.  The aroma could be a little more appealing as it still has a slight medicinal content in the aroma.&lt;br /&gt;The lather lasts when applied to the hair and does not go flat. It rinses out easily. The first rinse left my hair feeling &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; and I was concerned that my hair might have moisture removed and become too dry. But, I was pleasantly surprised when the second wash and rinse of my hair left the hair with a fuller feeling and not too much of the &amp;#34;squeak&amp;#34;.  I will revisit this review after I use this shampoo for a month and see how my hair stands up to the Texas heat.  Previous shampoos worked well for day one, but by end of second day, my head was getting itchy and by third day&#x27;s end, I began to have some flaking.  Let&#x27;s hope this new shampoo does better.</li>
            <li> Same great cleaning I&#x27;ve come to love from Head &amp; Shoulders. And don&#x27;t worry, the peppermint scent is very subtle, so you won&#x27;t smell like a tube of toothpaste post shower...</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampoo is a great shampoo that is effective against the dry scalp/dandruff battle. It is infused with peppermint and Tea Tree Oil which leaves your hair smelling great and feeling soft. It worked wonders for my husband who has short thin hair, and i loved it even though i don&#x27;t have dandruff it added extra moisture to my thick curly hair which tends to dry easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of the best versions of Head &amp; Shoulder&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried and my husband saw relief for his dry scalp in days. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Although it works for me (makes my hair soft ), it fails to deliver any good result for my husband.</li>
            <li> I wondered about Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampooâ€™s scent would really be like because the label has â€œwith peppermint complex and tea tree essence. Would it smell like toothpaste or peppermint chewing gum? Neither one, it is more of gentle minty fragrance. In the old days, I was prescribed tar shampoo by my dermatologist. During the shampoo and even after my hair dried, it smelled like tar. So this is a great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have oily hair and lots of dandruff. I wonâ€™t go into how bad it was but when I got older, my hair changed. Now I have dry hair and a very dry scalp and no dandruff but it is very itchy. So I use Head &amp; Shoulders to fight the itchiness. It works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my hair has always been very fine all my life but this shampoo adds body to it. I have now tried three different Head &amp; Shoulders shampoos and each one adds body to my hair when I really love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnâ€™t notice a cooling sensation but all I really wanted was to get rid of the itch and add body at the same time. Success!</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from dandruff, I have tried many products to solve the issue. To date, nothing compares to Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoo. This one is not a 2-in-1 which is what I normally buy, but I think I prefer that because I can solve my dandruff problem and then use a better conditioner on my hair at the same time. Great product!</li>
            <li> I suffer from a bad case of dandruff...so bad, in fact, that the only way that I can keep it away is to cycle through T-Gel, Selsun Blue, and Head &amp; Shoulders in alternating days since one product doesn&#x27;t keep up with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by the &amp;#34;instant relief&amp;#34; shampoo since I do live in Arizona and hotter days (yesterday it was 90) tend to make me itchy on top.  Sadly, the tea tree/peppermint formula is more of a gimmick more than anything else.  Admittedly, it does feel cool upon application but I didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;instant relief&amp;#34;.  Apart from the cooling contact of the formula, my skin still felt irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s just because I have a more severe case than others, but this feels more like a marketing ploy to me than a genuine benefit.  Apart from that, it contains the same active ingredient as regular Head &amp; Shoulders so it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it out for your own benefit.</li>
            <li> The Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff shampoo is actually doing the job for me. I have fairly severe dandruff, and I had run out of my regular dandruff shampoo about a week before getting this. I continued to forget buying my regular brand, so after a week of shampooing with some very non-dandruff shampoo products, my scalp was in a fairly horrendous state: loads of dandruff, itching everywhere, not a pretty picture. After using the Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief for four days, it&#x27;s got things back in order for me. There&#x27;s no dandruff and very little in the way of itching. It&#x27;s also great on the hair itself (some other dandruff shampoos can leave it feeling like straw) and I personally find the scent to be quite pleasant. I was expecting something more herbal (something more like peppermint or tea tree oil, which are advertised to be in this), but it&#x27;s a clean, balanced scent that&#x27;s not going to overpower you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point to make is that the bottle says that this &amp;#34;cools on contact,&amp;#34; largely providing that sense of instant relief. While this might technically be the case, the cooling sensation isn&#x27;t as &#x27;cool&#x27; as expected. If you apply and shampoo a second time, it&#x27;s definitely more noticeable then, but most of the time, on the first application, it&#x27;s pretty faint. This isn&#x27;t a dealbreaker for me, as the shampoo works to get rid of my dandruff and I really wasn&#x27;t looking for that when I bought it, but if you are, this likely won&#x27;t meet your expectations in its current formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with the Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Shampoo. I haven&#x27;t used Head &amp; Shoulders for my dandruff in a long time (and been spending more money for other products in that time), but this really works.</li>
            <li> I have always used Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo for my dandruff problem. The Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampoo is new and it offers a cooling feeling when I shampoo my hair. It is made to revitalize and refresh your hair as well as take of dandruff flakes and scalp, while you shampoo. It has a peppermint complex that gives it the slight peppermint scent. This is a 22.5 oz bottle of shampoo. I know I can trust the Head &amp; Shoulders brand of dandruff shampoo and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief Dandruff Shampoo are similar to those of other Head and Shoulders Shampoos. The active ingredient is pyrithione zinc. This is used in many anti-dandruff products. This plastic bottle has convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily. I have been using it with [[ASIN:B00FIZGLRI Head and Shoulders Full &amp; Strong Dandruff Conditioner]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is a thick milky blue/green cream which emerges readily from the container. It is not oily or greasy and appears not to leave residues. The shampoo does not seem to be irritating if you get it in your eyes. The odor is pleasant  but not overpowering. After using it, my scalp does feel clean. My hair tends to curl. However, this conditioner seems to flatten my curls, but does leave my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> My family suffers from periodic dandruff, so we have the regular routine of using a dandruff shampoo at least once a week to either cure the problem or keep the dandruff away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really like this new Head and Shoulders. It has the same reliable results but the peppermint and tea tree essence gives it a very refreshing and not medicinal smell. The fragrance does not last after the shampoo rinses out which is preferable but the shampoo keeps the dandruff away and that is the primary purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate a bottle with a good solid flat top so that I can keep it upside down in the shower and have the shampoo come right out without shaking or squeezing and there is no waste. This is still a reliable product, but improved.</li>
            <li> I have used Head and Shoulders, or one of its generic equivalents (of which there are many), all my life, and have not had any dandruff since junior high school. This version offers something ostensibly better, which I take to be a combination of ingredients to soothe the scalp. Not finding that my scalp is particularly irritated and in need of soothing, I don&#x27;t feel any particular effect on the scalp. The shampoo has a nice, subtle fragrance, and a good texture -- lathers generously. What I do notice is that my hair, which gets washed every day, is a bit more manageable, less fly-away and subject to static cling, but without the unpleasant residue which you usually get with conditioners. Good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the high dollar tee tree shampoo before and while they are very much different this is a great alternative that still gives that tingle feel, it also does a good job cleaning your hair and washes out with no left behind residue. Overall I like this stuff and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Tee tree oil and peppermint make this product a soothing pleasure to use as it not only controls dandruff but feels refreshing on my scalp. It smells crisp and clean and rinses easily with no residue left on my hair. It&#x27;s my favorite brand of shampoo to control dandruff.</li>
            <li> My husbandâ€™s preferred shampoo is Head &amp; Shoulders, but I donâ€™t typically care for the scent.  Head &amp; Shoulders Instant Relief has a much more pleasant scent than classic Head &amp; Shoulders.  It also has a cooling menthol feel to it, which is great for an irritated scalp.  After use, hair feels soft and clean.  Weâ€™ve come to expect great dandruff control from Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, and this Instant Relief variety is no exception.  Not only does it do a great job controlling dandruff but it also smells pretty great too.</li>
            <li> The scent of peppermint hits you whenever you open the bottle, but thankfully doesn&#x27;t stay with you as the day progresses. But the scalp stimulation sure seems really effective as dandruff control.  Not all that different from other products in the head and shoulders line, which means it is a reliable product!</li>
            <li> Instant Relief with peppermint complex and tea tree essence (Not Citrus Breeze, Not Classic Clean, Not Dry Scalp Care with Almond Oil, Not Green Apple, Not Ocean Lift). We will have to work our way through the product line over the next 5 years - lol.. Gentle and have used it every day until gone. No impact to my Color and Chemically treated hair. No dry scalp (I use with a conditioner) no itch (as long as I use every 3 days) No flakes (but that was never my issue). I am not a big peppermint person so this would be my last choice in scents.</li>
            <li> A creamy lightly tinted mint green shampoo that lathers well and leaves a tingly clean feeling on your scalp.  My daughter has long straight hair and this left it easy to style and manage with no residue and did not look oily and flat at the end of the day.  A good shampoo not just for dandruff but for anyone.</li>
