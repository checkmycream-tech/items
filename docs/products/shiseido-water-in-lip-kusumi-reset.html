    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li>Came in perfect shape and works fine.</li>
            <li>I have no clue why or how there are good reviews for this item.</li>
            <li>this lip balm is good, but since i had Shiseido oil bar and Ferzea lip cream also,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>I love Shiseido, and this is a winner!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>this lip balm is just amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than Dior Creme de Rose.</li>
            <li>Great deep moisturizer for the lips, a nice compromise to $30 &amp;#34; lip treatment&amp;#34; and Chapstick, doesn&#x27;t have a waxy feel!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>My favorite chapstick.</li>
            <li>Cute product.</li>
            <li>I love the sakura color on my lips.</li>
            <li>This chapstick is a million times better than I could have ever hoped for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really in love with this.</li>
            <li>Very useful!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and amazing product!</li>
            <li>one is not as impressive as the other two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is not greasy and absorbs very quickly into my lips.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel waxy like cheap chapsticks, either.</li>
            <li>it is not readily available to buy in stores, so i am very happy to see it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>The cherry blossom is fantastic, the flavor is barely noticeable but very lovely.  </li>
            <li>If you want soft, silky, smooth lips without the fragrance and sticky coating this is a nice lip balm.</li>
            <li>your lips are not very dry, then this one may be good for you.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing effect is also good enough.</li>
            <li>About $9 in the store, the flavor/aroma is very light and the nice thing is it goes on velvety, not sticky or wet feeling.  </li>
            <li>but it dries up so quickly</li>
            <li>It also was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>it is cheap and the high quaity!</li>
            <li>Not sticky or thick but incredibly moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Nice product, does not go on thick like some, moisturizes nicely after just a couple of applications</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s not much except for a light pink sheen and that itself is already very nice!</li>
            <li>I expected better from Shiseido and shipping took forever!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I cannot get enough of it.  </li>
            <li>I will come back for more.</li>
            <li>i expected it to be better.</li>
            <li>Fantastic slight minty, cool tingle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help much with moisturizing your lips unless you use an exfoliant or something similar, because it&#x27;s quite basic, but the soft pink-toned sheen it adds is really nice.</li>
            <li>My lips are prone to peeling and being very chapped and in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve had it, my lips are so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I go through tons of very expensive lip treatments trying to find something that will work... when someone turned me on to a Japanese brand, Shiseido, and their wonderful chap sticks.  </li>
            <li>it is worst to buy and a really good lip top!</li>
            <li>In the end, the product came quickly even though sent from Japan and I was expecting it to have a little bit of color,</li>
            <li>Not only does it leave a pearly shimmer (not TOO much, but just enough)</li>

            <li> I go through tons of very expensive lip treatments trying to find something that will work... when someone turned me on to a Japanese brand, Shiseido, and their wonderful chap sticks.  About $9 in the store, the flavor/aroma is very light and the nice thing is it goes on velvety, not sticky or wet feeling.  It absorbs leaving your lips softer, plumper, fuller, and healed.  I love this stuff, I cannot get enough of it.  The cherry blossom is fantastic, the flavor is barely noticeable but very lovely.  I love Shiseido, and this is a winner!</li>
            <li> Love it! Very useful! Recommend to use it before you go to sleep, and you can find a pair of moisture lips in the next morning.</li>
            <li> i expected it to be better. but it dries up so quickly so i have to use it like every 20 min. it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> My favorite chapstick.</li>
            <li> Great deep moisturizer for the lips, a nice compromise to $30 &amp;#34; lip treatment&amp;#34; and Chapstick, doesn&#x27;t have a waxy feel!</li>
            <li> Fantastic slight minty, cool tingle. A tiny bit of peachy-pink micro glitter. Not sticky or thick but incredibly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Came in perfect shape and works fine. It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Cute product. It doesn&#x27;t help much with moisturizing your lips unless you use an exfoliant or something similar, because it&#x27;s quite basic, but the soft pink-toned sheen it adds is really nice. It doesn&#x27;t feel waxy like cheap chapsticks, either.</li>

            <li> Its just like chapstick but does not stay on for a long time. I do not know why this makes my lips feel so dry. I expected better from Shiseido and shipping took forever!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and totally moisturizes. Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> this lip balm is just amazing. It&#x27;s even better than Dior Creme de Rose. But it did not have the pink tint that I expected.</li>

In the end, the product came quickly even though sent from Japan and I was expecting it to have a little bit of color, but there&#x27;s not much except for a light pink sheen and that itself is already very nice! I use this almost daily and I can already see the difference in how it brightens up my face!</li>
            <li> it took a long time but finally i got it.Good</li>
