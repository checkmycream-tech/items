            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>

            <li>The body butter smells just as wonderful as the body wash, and the scent lasts much longer.  </li>

            <li>and all of them smell really good, but I think this one is my favorite because it&#x27;s a sweeter, more girly scent.  </li>
            <li>Its very strong</li>
            <li>By far the best body butter!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best body cream out there, even for me living in North Carolina, the winters are still drying to your skin.</li>
            <li>My first experience with it was a 3-pack of assorted butters and all were great.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews I was worried that it was too good to be true</li>
            <li>Hawaiian Kukui is my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this stuff, smells great, very moisturizing without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not too overwhelming</li>
            <li>I used to be able to find this at the grocery, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and buying the 3 pack ended up being a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>scent more than the others.  </li>

            <li>Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>I had to pay more  </li>
            <li>I would I love</li>
            <li>what it does for me, love it.  </li>
            <li>Better than AmLactin which I have used for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice in the skin and has a gentle refreshing scent!</li>
            <li>It replenishes my skin so it doesn&#x27;t feel so dry, and the fragrance is wonderful!!</li>
            <li>My hands get so dry in the Winter, and this cream is wonderful smelling and luxuriant!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that I was able to get this product from Amazon, and for a very reasonable price (3 seven ounce jars for under $21).  </li>
            <li>It works especially good for after tanning to keep your skin from drying out or feeling rough.</li>
            <li>This is the best kukui products II have found that&#x27;s not straight kukui oil.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and moisturizers very well.</li>
            <li>this product.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is very uplifting and puts you in a good mood,&lt;br /&gt;this</li>
            <li>My wife loved it, and the smell, absolutely fantastice.</li>
            <li>This is a very pleasant body moisturizer for someone who has dry skin or psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>Nice mild fragrance and rich texture.</li>
            <li>I originally found the Kukui Nut body wash at Wal-Mart and loved the scent so much I wanted to try the body butter.  </li>
            <li>The one downside is that while it advertises it contains organic shea butter, the product itself isn&#x27;t organic and, like most beauty products, is full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>The scents are not to strong or to light..</li>
            <li>I used this body better on my belly while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and definitely great for very dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>I love body butters, they always leave my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the lotion is as nice as any real butter.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and not oily</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I suffer with both, the scent is nice and not overpowering, the Shea butter is very soothing.</li>
            <li>It provides the skin a silky smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>Lightly fragranced so it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband&#x27;s COPD.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin silky smooth</li>
            <li>It smells so good and the scent lasts pretty much all day since body butter lasts longer than perfumes and sprays.</li>
            <li>My first jar was given to me as a gift, and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product from Costco.  </li>
            <li>, I get this product every Christmas for her and is always excited to get it and never can wait to slather it on her skin</li>
            <li>And the \\&quot;butter\\&quot; is not greasy but soaks in to give a richly moisturized feel.  </li>
            <li>The smell is so wonderful and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I got this for dry skin and it is great.  </li>
            <li>I am giving this as gifts to all my special friends this year.  </li>
            <li>I am a woman of color, and many products I come across don&#x27;t do a good job of keeping my dark skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>I love this product too, the scent is nice and soft, it really keeps my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several &#x27;flavors&#x27; and loved them all.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much as it is very rich and softens very well</li>
            <li>Great for healing especially dry scaley skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>Hope this works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly, well packaged.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not available in Australia, so was delighted to be able to purchase online</li>
            <li>My wife is 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li>It is sweet but not over whelming and still allows me to have that fresh \\&quot;girlie\\&quot; scent out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Smells great and really helps relieve my child&#x27;s dry skin</li>
            <li>I am surprised that when I received this for Xmas from a coworker, I would fall in love with this product/smell.  </li>
            <li>For me it is worth every cent even to looking on line for this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve rarely been out of it since.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it for my whole body, but mainly on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>The body butter has a good consistency and does not separate like other ones.  </li>
            <li>I will try other Tree Hut body butters because I heard really good things about it.</li>
            <li>just right for me.</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>I love the deep moisturizing effects of this lotion, and you absolutely cannot beat the fragrance!!  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, very rich and leaves skin soft but is a little bit &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; even long after it has been put on.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how much moisture these kukui products put back into your skin.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it locally, but Amazaon definitely has a great price.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I came back to Amazon and got the 3-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ideally, I&#x27;d love to be able to find just plain Kukui Nut oil</li>
            <li>Putting it on after a shower really helps!  </li>
            <li>The Tree Hut Hawaiian Kukui Shea Butter is so smooth on your skin and makes your skin feel so supple and soft.</li>
            <li>ok, haven&#x27;t ACTUALLY tested it on zombies, but you CAN say \\&quot;goodbye scaly flakes!</li>
            <li>Two of my grandchildren have pretty severe eczema, so I bought this, along with the wash, to see how it worked on them.</li>
            <li>Received this as a gift last Christmas and had to buy more.</li>
            <li>one really works!</li>
            <li>I love this body butter; only one that stays on all day and leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li>I was soo pleased to see Amazon not only had it, but had a 3 pk.</li>
            <li>Be aware, once you start using this, it will become habit forming.</li>
            <li>I bought this item at the local supermarket and fell in love.</li>
            <li>hello soft, healthy skin\\&quot;!Finally a skin product that really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>my skin has never felt so smooth and not dry at all</li>
            <li>Not just those who are tanning but to anyone who wants super soft skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other lotions for my dry skin in Colorado, and this one always comes out on top.</li>
            <li>haha..</li>
            <li>So, I went with this one in part because it was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brand of body butter.</li>
            <li>Have tried all brands in Whole Foods</li>
            <li>- hopefully it smells the same and would be totally natural :)  </li>
            <li>I love this shea body butter, it makes your skin soft and it leaves a nice scent behind.  </li>
            <li>Nice size body butter last you a long time..</li>
            <li>If you would like one more subtle, go for the original.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product - within 2 days it has really helped get my dry skin under control.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and does a great job keeping my skin soft and hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li>A local grocery store recently started stocking this product but Amazon has a better price.</li>
            <li>The body butter is super hydrating (especially on the feet, elbows and knees!)</li>
            <li>This creamy balm is the only thing that keeps my fingertips and heels soft and smooth out here on the edge of the desert.</li>
            <li>However, if you are like me and like that all-day suppleness for your skin, I highly recommend mixing the butter with an oil of your choice.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>she says, but the real plus here is how soft it makes her skin feel</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m ready to get dressed it has completely soaked into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I normally purchase butters from Body Works when I can buy them in bulk on holiday sales.</li>
            <li>I love this line of inexpensive pampering products so much that I plan to give the scrubs and butters away as small, but luxurious gifts for Christmas.</li>
            <li>my skin is very soft and looks vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Skin types will react differently so results could vary, it&#x27;s a matter of trial and error until you find the right product.</li>
            <li>used to live in Hawaii as a child and the fragrance reminds me of those times....lovely.</li>
            <li>The butter is really thick and does a great job of moisturizing my (old) and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I reccomend the entire line to anyone who wants a product of excellence!</li>
            <li>We are very pleased- Been using this daily for two months now, still have about half a jar left.</li>
            <li>If you are not a huge fan of strong, sweet-smelling products, give this one a try.</li>
            <li>your tan will last so much longer because your skin is soft as can be.</li>
            <li>This cream keeps the hands moisterized and really soft.</li>
            <li>My skin and nose are extremely sensitive so I cannot use a lot of products.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>My daughter; loves this product as it makes her skin soooooo soft.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and how soft it leaves my skin</li>
            <li>Feels so buttery and silky soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am a Caucasian male with normal skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is never dry looking and is soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance on this is pretty strong too, so I&#x27;ll just stick to raw shea butter or raw cocoa butter since literally everything else has Fragrance in its ingredients list.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and oily and provides a layer of protection that I love.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a lotion or body butter works and that is lightly scented.  </li>
            <li>I use it every morning following my shower, and my skin stays soft throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema and live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>live in a very dry climate, above 6000&#x27;</li>

            <li> Good price also.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my Mother and she loves this body butter, she claims it smells so good and could eat it if it was food</li>
            <li> in actuality this Tree Hut brand is a good buy it</li>
            <li> As a gift and was loved by the person taken for.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as my friend loved how I smelled whenever I had it on.</li>
            <li> Smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Light fragrance and wonderful texture.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is wonderful and it moisturizes my skin better than most lotions.  </li>
            <li> I love Tree Hut Shea body butter because it provides great moisturizing softness to the skin on my body</li>
            <li> It has refreshing fragrance, softens the after shower skin without leaving residue, great moisturizer, also softens the feet without leaving greasy residue on the skin surface.</li>
            <li> My very favorite, ever.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin buttery, smooth, silky and shinny!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> amazing smell not too over powering.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product.</li>
            <li> This body cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> Lupita Nyong&#x27;os skin looked amazing and she said she used Hawaiian Kukui</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love tree huts products but this one doesnt smell good at all.</li>
            <li> The body butter smells just as wonderful as the body wash, and the scent lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and happy to be able to order it as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> This product gives me what I wanted -- a nice, glowing skin.  </li>
            <li> Great scent, terrific moisturizer perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> It settles into my skin very well, and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> Excellent body lotion, particularly after tanning.</li>
            <li> My son has tried different lotions but this product renders the best results and has a pleasant smell, too.</li>
            <li> and all of them smell really good, but I think this one is my favorite because it&#x27;s a sweeter, more girly scent.  </li>
            <li> Its very strong</li>
            <li> By far the best body butter!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best body cream out there, even for me living in North Carolina, the winters are still drying to your skin.</li>
            <li> My first experience with it was a 3-pack of assorted butters and all were great.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was worried that it was too good to be true</li>
            <li> Hawaiian Kukui is my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Its ok I guess ..</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments</li>
            <li> I really Love kukui oil products.</li>
            <li> Both children&#x27;s skin is now smooth!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> always the same and always awesome!</li>
            <li> i love that you get 3 at one time.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, and i will continue buying it when i run out :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, smells great, very moisturizing without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too overwhelming</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find this at the grocery, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and buying the 3 pack ended up being a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> scent more than the others.  </li>
            <li> My favorite Tree Hut product.  </li>
            <li> Have reordered many times.  </li>
            <li> I totally love this Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Be it a man or a woman, people will fall in love with you while you wear this.  </li>
            <li> I love Tree Hut&#x27;s Shea Body Butters.  </li>
            <li> Great smell and not oily......make me feel ready for the day.</li>
            <li> Love the packgage this item comes in and</li>
            <li> My kids also love this.</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I had to pay more  </li>
            <li> I would I love</li>
            <li> what it does for me, love it.  </li>
            <li> Better than AmLactin which I have used for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice in the skin and has a gentle refreshing scent!</li>
            <li> It replenishes my skin so it doesn&#x27;t feel so dry, and the fragrance is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> My hands get so dry in the Winter, and this cream is wonderful smelling and luxuriant!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that I was able to get this product from Amazon, and for a very reasonable price (3 seven ounce jars for under $21).  </li>
            <li> It works especially good for after tanning to keep your skin from drying out or feeling rough.</li>
            <li> This is the best kukui products II have found that&#x27;s not straight kukui oil.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and moisturizers very well.</li>
            <li> this product.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is very uplifting and puts you in a good mood,&lt;br /&gt;this</li>
            <li> My wife loved it, and the smell, absolutely fantastice.</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasant body moisturizer for someone who has dry skin or psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> Nice mild fragrance and rich texture.</li>
            <li> I originally found the Kukui Nut body wash at Wal-Mart and loved the scent so much I wanted to try the body butter.  </li>
            <li> The one downside is that while it advertises it contains organic shea butter, the product itself isn&#x27;t organic and, like most beauty products, is full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> The scents are not to strong or to light..</li>
            <li> I used this body better on my belly while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and definitely great for very dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> I love body butters, they always leave my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the lotion is as nice as any real butter.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and not oily</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I suffer with both, the scent is nice and not overpowering, the Shea butter is very soothing.</li>
            <li> It provides the skin a silky smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> Lightly fragranced so it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband&#x27;s COPD.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> It smells so good and the scent lasts pretty much all day since body butter lasts longer than perfumes and sprays.</li>
            <li> My first jar was given to me as a gift, and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product from Costco.  </li>
            <li> , I get this product every Christmas for her and is always excited to get it and never can wait to slather it on her skin</li>
            <li> And the \\&quot;butter\\&quot; is not greasy but soaks in to give a richly moisturized feel.  </li>
            <li> The smell is so wonderful and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I got this for dry skin and it is great.  </li>
            <li> I am giving this as gifts to all my special friends this year.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman of color, and many products I come across don&#x27;t do a good job of keeping my dark skin moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I love this product too, the scent is nice and soft, it really keeps my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several &#x27;flavors&#x27; and loved them all.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need much as it is very rich and softens very well</li>
            <li> Great for healing especially dry scaley skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> Hope this works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly, well packaged.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not available in Australia, so was delighted to be able to purchase online</li>
            <li> My wife is 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li> It is sweet but not over whelming and still allows me to have that fresh \\&quot;girlie\\&quot; scent out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Smells great and really helps relieve my child&#x27;s dry skin</li>
            <li> I am surprised that when I received this for Xmas from a coworker, I would fall in love with this product/smell.  </li>
            <li> For me it is worth every cent even to looking on line for this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve rarely been out of it since.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love it for my whole body, but mainly on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> The body butter has a good consistency and does not separate like other ones.  </li>
            <li> I will try other Tree Hut body butters because I heard really good things about it.</li>
            <li> just right for me.</li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> I love the deep moisturizing effects of this lotion, and you absolutely cannot beat the fragrance!!  </li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, very rich and leaves skin soft but is a little bit &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; even long after it has been put on.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how much moisture these kukui products put back into your skin.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it locally, but Amazaon definitely has a great price.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I came back to Amazon and got the 3-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ideally, I&#x27;d love to be able to find just plain Kukui Nut oil</li>
            <li> Putting it on after a shower really helps!  </li>
            <li> The Tree Hut Hawaiian Kukui Shea Butter is so smooth on your skin and makes your skin feel so supple and soft.</li>
            <li> ok, haven&#x27;t ACTUALLY tested it on zombies, but you CAN say \\&quot;goodbye scaly flakes!</li>
            <li> Two of my grandchildren have pretty severe eczema, so I bought this, along with the wash, to see how it worked on them.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift last Christmas and had to buy more.</li>
            <li> one really works!</li>
            <li> I love this body butter; only one that stays on all day and leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li> I was soo pleased to see Amazon not only had it, but had a 3 pk.</li>
            <li> Be aware, once you start using this, it will become habit forming.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at the local supermarket and fell in love.</li>
            <li> hello soft, healthy skin\\&quot;!Finally a skin product that really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> my skin has never felt so smooth and not dry at all</li>
            <li> Not just those who are tanning but to anyone who wants super soft skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other lotions for my dry skin in Colorado, and this one always comes out on top.</li>
            <li> haha..</li>
            <li> So, I went with this one in part because it was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brand of body butter.</li>
            <li> Have tried all brands in Whole Foods</li>
            <li> - hopefully it smells the same and would be totally natural :)  </li>
            <li> I love this shea body butter, it makes your skin soft and it leaves a nice scent behind.  </li>
            <li> Nice size body butter last you a long time..</li>
            <li> If you would like one more subtle, go for the original.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product - within 2 days it has really helped get my dry skin under control.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and does a great job keeping my skin soft and hydrated all day.  </li>
            <li> A local grocery store recently started stocking this product but Amazon has a better price.</li>
            <li> The body butter is super hydrating (especially on the feet, elbows and knees!)</li>
            <li> This creamy balm is the only thing that keeps my fingertips and heels soft and smooth out here on the edge of the desert.</li>
            <li> However, if you are like me and like that all-day suppleness for your skin, I highly recommend mixing the butter with an oil of your choice.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> she says, but the real plus here is how soft it makes her skin feel</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m ready to get dressed it has completely soaked into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I normally purchase butters from Body Works when I can buy them in bulk on holiday sales.</li>
            <li> I love this line of inexpensive pampering products so much that I plan to give the scrubs and butters away as small, but luxurious gifts for Christmas.</li>
            <li> my skin is very soft and looks vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Skin types will react differently so results could vary, it&#x27;s a matter of trial and error until you find the right product.</li>
            <li> used to live in Hawaii as a child and the fragrance reminds me of those times....lovely.</li>
            <li> The butter is really thick and does a great job of moisturizing my (old) and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I reccomend the entire line to anyone who wants a product of excellence!</li>
            <li> We are very pleased- Been using this daily for two months now, still have about half a jar left.</li>
            <li> If you are not a huge fan of strong, sweet-smelling products, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> your tan will last so much longer because your skin is soft as can be.</li>
            <li> This cream keeps the hands moisterized and really soft.</li>
            <li> My skin and nose are extremely sensitive so I cannot use a lot of products.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling so incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> My daughter; loves this product as it makes her skin soooooo soft.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and how soft it leaves my skin</li>
            <li> Feels so buttery and silky soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian male with normal skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is never dry looking and is soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance on this is pretty strong too, so I&#x27;ll just stick to raw shea butter or raw cocoa butter since literally everything else has Fragrance in its ingredients list.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and oily and provides a layer of protection that I love.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a lotion or body butter works and that is lightly scented.  </li>
            <li> I use it every morning following my shower, and my skin stays soft throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema and live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> live in a very dry climate, above 6000&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands and they were all thin and less effective.</li>
            <li> and I do recommend it, especially if you keep really dry hands.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way so you won&#x27;t have to purchase very frequently.  </li>
            <li> This one is much more subtle than the mango and doesn&#x27;t seem as thick, but it still glides on like silk.  </li>
            <li> main concern is Fragrance, since they&#x27;re not required to say what chemicals they use to make a fragrance it could contain a lot of irritants like parabens, just because they say it&#x27;s paraben-free doesn&#x27;t mean they have to prove it, they can just hide the parabens under \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; since technically it does affect the smell.</li>
            <li> , this is how long it take to go through three jars of this product,</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week but am already planning to buy again and actually just placed an order for my little sister who has skin problems.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> The skin on my belly never felt dry or itchy as it expanded.</li>
            <li> My skin gets incredibly dry and irritated from being in the pool for 3-4hours/day and this body butter relieves my skin for hours and makes it look and feel soft/moisturized.</li>
            <li> but no, after searching and trying everything out there for my dry itchy skin I have found the answer.</li>
            <li> and I NEVER have to worry about my skin getting dry.</li>
            <li> my skin was very dry and cracking and flaking.  </li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s too heavy to use daily.</li>
            <li> I have very dry feet due to Type II Diabetis.  </li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and sweetly natural, not perfumey or cloying.  </li>
            <li> However it is a little to thick for facial use, I found.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and winters are especially irritating.  </li>
            <li> And, as one who usually has a negative physical reaction to perfumes, this product&#x27;s fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me.  </li>
            <li> so it takes some time to rub in and it can feel a little heavy immediately after putting it on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tacky though, and takes a few minutes to soak in before you can touch stuff.  </li>
            <li> i am addicted to it so much so that i have it automatically send to my house every few months through amazons subscribe and save deal!!!</li>
            <li> i tried this a few years ago and I&#x27;ve been looking for it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for the Shea Body for a while now, and the Hawaiian  Kukui was never available.</li>
            <li> Every thing else is pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> Use a small amount, because a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> This body butter gives a little glow and softens for the day!</li>
            <li> Since my normal lotion wasn&#x27;t quite cutting it during our unusually harsh winter, I wanted an emollient lotion that wouldn&#x27;t  leave me feeling like I&#x27;d just slathered on a thick layer of Crisco.  </li>
            <li> i use it year round!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s my go-to moisturizer year round!</li>
            <li> I mix this body butter with oil, usually almond, jojoba, or olive oil, and use it as an all-over body cream.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the one negative thing for me is that it&#x27;s a bit sticky to the touch long after application.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really thick (as body butters are supposed to be)</li>

            <li> My son has tried different lotions but this product renders the best results and has a pleasant smell, too. Skin types will react differently so results could vary, it&#x27;s a matter of trial and error until you find the right product. Hope this works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly, well packaged.</li>
            <li> Bought this while holiday in the States this year - the best body butter I have used for my &amp;#34;very dry&amp;#34; skin. Unfortunately not available in Australia, so was delighted to be able to purchase online</li>
            <li> ive been using this product for over a year. i am addicted to it so much so that i have it automatically send to my house every few months through amazons subscribe and save deal!!! amazing smell not too over powering. i bought this product at a salon to help extend my spray tan and ever since ive been hooked. i use it year round! AMAZING product. my skin has never felt so smooth and not dry at all</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this.</li>
            <li> I love Tree Hut Shea body butter because it provides great moisturizing softness to the skin on my body (I haven&#x27;t used it on my face)and helps it look years younger.  Hawaiian Kukui is my favorite scent.  I use it every morning following my shower, and my skin stays soft throughout the day.  My first jar was given to me as a gift, and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> As a woman with severe eczema it is very difficult to find creams that won&#x27;t burn, sting and that have lasting moisture...  This product has it all!!  I use both scents and stock up on them!  The scents are not to strong or to light..just right for me.</li>
            <li> I got this for dry skin and it is great.  Putting it on after a shower really helps!  I recommend it for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best body butter I have ever used. I love it. Will continue to order. Good price also. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients, nicely scented and a wonderfully creamy product.  I will be ordering it again and again as I like to pair it with a scrub and give it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Excellent body lotion, particularly after tanning. I find it&#x27;s too heavy to use daily. I am a Caucasian male with normal skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice in the skin and has a gentle refreshing scent!</li>
            <li> Nice size body butter last you a long time.. I would suggest using the Tree Hut Shea Body Butter in the summer time because the scent it has reminds me of when I was a kid and I used to lay out in the sun and try to get a tan.. It has like a butter / oily trying to get a suntan smell..haha.. I can&#x27;t quite explain it.. Lets just say it isn&#x27;t fruity or smell like flowers.. Its ok I guess .. Would I purchase it again.. no probably not..  ♥.∙*OK♥.•:*¨¨*:•.♥AMAZON♥.•:*¨¨*:•.♥THANK♥.•:*¨¨*:•.♥YOU*∙.♥!</li>
            <li> I am surprised that when I received this for Xmas from a coworker, I would fall in love with this product/smell.  I get so many compliments and I have been using it now for 4 years</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the weight of this cream!!  And you can not beat the price.  I will never purchase another overpriced body lotion, cream, or butter again after using Tree Hut.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product from Costco.  My skin is never dry looking and is soft and supple.  For me it is worth every cent even to looking on line for this product.  I do not regret this purchase and will purchase again and again and again.</li>
            <li> I love tree huts products but this one doesnt smell good at all. Its very strong and i dont think its very good at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is the best scent ever.</li>
            <li> I use body butters religiously and have for years. I normally purchase butters from Body Works when I can buy them in bulk on holiday sales. I didn&#x27;t have the luxury and was not a big fan of spending $15 dollars on a jar of lotion that will last me 3 weeks. So, I went with this one in part because it was reasonably priced.  The consistency of the lotion is as nice as any real butter. It is smooth and not oily so it soaks into your skin well. The scent is quite pleasant.  It is sweet but not over whelming and still allows me to have that fresh \\&quot;girlie\\&quot; scent out of the shower. This one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Great job. Great price.</li>
            <li> The Tree Hut Hawaiian Kukui Shea Butter is so smooth on your skin and makes your skin feel so supple and soft. It works especially good for after tanning to keep your skin from drying out or feeling rough. your tan will last so much longer because your skin is soft as can be. I would recomend this product to anyone. Not just those who are tanning but to anyone who wants super soft skin. However it is a little to thick for facial use, I found. Also my wife likes the Coconut Lime Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I have very dry feet due to Type II Diabetis.  This has helped a great deal with the problem</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of body butter. My first experience with it was a 3-pack of assorted butters and all were great.  The butter is really thick and does a great job of moisturizing my (old) and dry skin.  I have tried several other brands and they were all thin and less effective.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my Mother and she loves this body butter, she claims it smells so good and could eat it if it was food she says, but the real plus here is how soft it makes her skin feel and she says it last until her next shower, I get this product every Christmas for her and is always excited to get it and never can wait to slather it on her skin, this is how long it take to go through three jars of this product, in actuality this Tree Hut brand is a good buy it last along time and you don&#x27;t need much as it is very rich and softens very well plus you have triple the product to make it last longer and the price is affordable</li>
            <li> This smells great. I hate body lotions and since I started bying this on amazon, I nevef stopped yet..we are kn our fifth jar.</li>
            <li> I used this body better on my belly while I was pregnant. My baby was born in April, so the majority of my pregnancy took place during the winter months. The skin on my belly never felt dry or itchy as it expanded. I know genetics and diet play a part, but I like to think this body butter also had a role to play in the fact that I had NO STRETCH MARKS!!!</li>
            <li> The best moisturizing cream out there. Every thing else is pale in comparison. After using tree hut I have not turned back to any thing else!</li>
            <li> The Tree Hut Shea Body Butter is absolutely a marvelous product.  Before I started using Tree Hut Shea Body Butter my skin was very dry and cracking and flaking.  Now, by using Tree Hut Shea Body Butter my skin is very soft and looks vibrant.  This is a remarkable product.</li>
            <li> One of the best body butters I have ever used. It replenishes my skin so it doesn&#x27;t feel so dry, and the fragrance is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> ok, haven&#x27;t ACTUALLY tested it on zombies, but you CAN say \\&quot;goodbye scaly flakes! hello soft, healthy skin\\&quot;!Finally a skin product that really makes a difference! We are very pleased- Been using this daily for two months now, still have about half a jar left. Hubby and I are using this in combination with Tree Hut&#x27;s shea/kukui body wash. It is amazing how much moisture these kukui products put back into your skin. Thought I was going to flake away this winter, until I found these great products.&lt;br /&gt;For those with eczema - read about adding a zinc supplement to your daily routine.</li>
            <li> I really Love kukui oil products. This is the best kukui products II have found that&#x27;s not straight kukui oil.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other lotions for my dry skin in Colorado, and this one always comes out on top.</li>
            <li> I love Shea Body Butter, its perfect for your hands. This cream keeps the hands moisterized and really soft. I love it for my whole body, but mainly on my hands and feet. Its a great Item and I do recommend it, especially if you keep really dry hands. Great Product! I purchased this product from amazon and had no problem getting it on time. Love it!</li>
            <li> Two of my grandchildren have pretty severe eczema, so I bought this, along with the wash, to see how it worked on them. Both children&#x27;s skin is now smooth! No scratchy, itchy eczema at all. They&#x27;re thrilled, and so am I!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great for healing especially dry scaley skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> i tried this a few years ago and I&#x27;ve been looking for it ever since.  then I found it on Amazon.  I love it</li>
            <li> I use this after swimming and it immediately relieves the itch from the chlorine. It is very thick and oily and provides a layer of protection that I love. My skin gets incredibly dry and irritated from being in the pool for 3-4hours/day and this body butter relieves my skin for hours and makes it look and feel soft/moisturized.</li>
            <li> I just started using the Tree Hut line of products, beginning with their sugar scrubs, which I like to match to their body butter scent.  This one is much more subtle than the mango and doesn&#x27;t seem as thick, but it still glides on like silk.  If you are not a huge fan of strong, sweet-smelling products, give this one a try. The moisturizing feeling lasts all day for me.  I love this line of inexpensive pampering products so much that I plan to give the scrubs and butters away as small, but luxurious gifts for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I am giving this as gifts to all my special friends this year.  The fragrance is wonderful and it moisturizes my skin better than most lotions.  For the price it is a wonderful treat.</li>
            <li> This body butter is amazing!  My skin and nose are extremely sensitive so I cannot use a lot of products.  I received this shea body butter as a gift and put it aside until my regular cream ran out - I have been using it ever since!  It leaves my skin feeling so incredibly soft.  It smells great too!</li>
            <li> always the same and always awesome! i will continue to order from Tree Hut! i love that you get 3 at one time.</li>
            <li> questionable ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;Cyclomethicone&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Fruit&lt;br /&gt;Glyceryl Stearate&lt;br /&gt;Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil&lt;br /&gt;Cetearyl Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;PEG-100 Stearate&lt;br /&gt;Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter&lt;br /&gt;PEG-8 Beeswax&lt;br /&gt;Lanolin Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate 80&lt;br /&gt;Laureth-4&lt;br /&gt;**Fragrance: coerns are Ecotoxicology, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), Miscellaneous, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive)&lt;br /&gt;Xanthan Gum&lt;br /&gt;Phenoxyethanol&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Benzoate&lt;br /&gt;Potassium Sorbate&lt;br /&gt;*Diazolidinyl Urea: conerns are Cancer, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Contamination concerns (FORMALDEHYDE), Use restrictions&lt;br /&gt;Disodium EDTA:&lt;br /&gt;*BHT: concerns are Cancer, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main concern is Fragrance, since they&#x27;re not required to say what chemicals they use to make a fragrance it could contain a lot of irritants like parabens, just because they say it&#x27;s paraben-free doesn&#x27;t mean they have to prove it, they can just hide the parabens under \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; since technically it does affect the smell. The fragrance on this is pretty strong too, so I&#x27;ll just stick to raw shea butter or raw cocoa butter since literally everything else has Fragrance in its ingredients list.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so silky and smooth. The smell of Hawaiian Kuikui brings me back to my roots. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin buttery, smooth, silky and shinny!! I absolutely love this product, and i will continue buying it when i run out :)</li>
            <li> My girlfriend orders it through me.... and she loves it. She once had it as a present from my daughter who purchased it in NY USA</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, smells great, very moisturizing without a greasy feel. I will continue to purchase this through Amazon.</li>
            <li> As a gift and was loved by the person taken for.</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasant body moisturizer for someone who has dry skin or psoriasis.  I suffer with both, the scent is nice and not overpowering, the Shea butter is very soothing.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It smells so good and moisturizers very well. I wish I could find this flavor in a store around here.</li>
            <li> This body cream is amazing. It moisturizes and keeps my skin glowing. The scent is amazing, too! I always get compliments. The scent fades throughout the day so it&#x27;s not too overwhelming but you can still smell it up close.</li>
            <li> It has refreshing fragrance, softens the after shower skin without leaving residue, great moisturizer, also softens the feet without leaving greasy residue on the skin surface. Just rub in and go!</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find this at the grocery, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  I love the way it smells and buying the 3 pack ended up being a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have used the regular and Brazilian nut butter products. It provides the skin a silky smooth feeling. I reccomend the entire line to anyone who wants a product of excellence!</li>
            <li> I purchased these as my friend loved how I smelled whenever I had it on. She loves the smell and  has no problems with allergies to a perfumey smell.</li>
            <li> Great shea body butter--used mine on surgical scarring.  Smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Perfect moisturizer and frangrance all in one</li>
            <li> I like this body butter.  I have eczema and live in a dry climate. It is hard to find a lotion or body butter works and that is lightly scented.  I like the Hawaiian Kukui scent more than the others.  The body butter has a good consistency and does not separate like other ones.  A local grocery store recently started stocking this product but Amazon has a better price.</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy. Smells like summer to me. Received this as a gift last Christmas and had to buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tree Hut Body Butter for almost 10 years.  I was so upset when local stores stopped carrying it!  I&#x27;m thrilled that I was able to get this product from Amazon, and for a very reasonable price (3 seven ounce jars for under $21).  My hands get so dry in the Winter, and this cream is wonderful smelling and luxuriant!  I get compliments on the fragrance all the time, it&#x27;s just DELICIOUS!!</li>
            <li> My very favorite, ever.  A neighbor gave me one jar years ago and I&#x27;ve rarely been out of it since.&lt;br /&gt;I used to live in Hawaii as a child and the fragrance reminds me of those times....lovely.</li>
            <li> I originally found the Kukui Nut body wash at Wal-Mart and loved the scent so much I wanted to try the body butter.  Couldn&#x27;t find it locally, but Amazaon definitely has a great price.  The body butter smells just as wonderful as the body wash, and the scent lasts much longer.  It is very thick and does a great job keeping my skin soft and hydrated all day.  Definitely don&#x27;t need to reapply, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of it so the container lasts awhile.  The one downside is that while it advertises it contains organic shea butter, the product itself isn&#x27;t organic and, like most beauty products, is full of chemicals.  So if you&#x27;re looking for something \\&quot;green\\&quot; or \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or chemical-free, this isn&#x27;t it.  Ideally, I&#x27;d love to be able to find just plain Kukui Nut oil - hopefully it smells the same and would be totally natural :)  In the meantime, this works.</li>
            <li> My favorite Tree Hut product.  Have reordered many times.  Light fragrance and wonderful texture.  Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This is one of the very best lotions I have ever used.  Even my husband loves it.&lt;br /&gt;We live in a very dry climate, above 6000&#x27; so keeping skin lubricated is a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;This one really works!</li>
            <li> Excellent, awesome moisturizer! Great scent</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, very rich and leaves skin soft but is a little bit &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; even long after it has been put on.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal. Three body creams for one price. I will use this shipper again. Item was packaged great and received on time.</li>
            <li> My daughter; loves this product as it makes her skin soooooo soft. Recommends it for women of all ages and men.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and is a great moisturizer for my winter skin.  Not too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very nice and gives you a lot of moisture on your skin.  Love the fragrance and happy to be able to order it as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Smells great and really helps relieve my child&#x27;s dry skin issue;really like that in comes in a group of 3&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week but am already planning to buy again and actually just placed an order for my little sister who has skin problems. After reading all the reviews I was worried that it was too good to be true but no, after searching and trying everything out there for my dry itchy skin I have found the answer.</li>
            <li> By far the best body butter! Leaves your skin hydrated and the scent is to die for. LOVE MY TREE HUT!!</li>
            <li> I love the deep moisturizing effects of this lotion, and you absolutely cannot beat the fragrance!!  Also, a little goes a long way so you won&#x27;t have to purchase very frequently.  Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> The fragrance alone makes this body butter wonderful.  The scent is subtle and sweetly natural, not perfumey or cloying.  Smells like Hawaii!!  And the \\&quot;butter\\&quot; is not greasy but soaks in to give a richly moisturized feel.  I cannot be without it and I give it as gifts!</li>
            <li> I totally love this Shea butter. Have tried all brands in Whole Foods but this one surpasses all. Nice mild fragrance and rich texture. Adds glow and keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this shea body butter, it makes your skin soft and it leaves a nice scent behind.  I heard about Hawaiian Kukui from the Oscars. Lupita Nyong&#x27;os skin looked amazing and she said she used Hawaiian Kukui, so I had to try it.</li>
            <li> This product gives me what I wanted -- a nice, glowing skin.  And, as one who usually has a negative physical reaction to perfumes, this product&#x27;s fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me.  Unfortunately, the one negative thing for me is that it&#x27;s a bit sticky to the touch long after application.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter; only one that stays on all day and leaves no oily residue. Lightly fragranced so it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband&#x27;s COPD.</li>
            <li> Nice and creamy texture, smells wonderful and does my skin great! Will repurchase!</li>
            <li> This body butter gives a little glow and softens for the day! The Hawaiian Kukui is the best flavor in my opinion. If you would like one more subtle, go for the original. Use a small amount, because a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> Be it a man or a woman, people will fall in love with you while you wear this.  It smells so good and the scent lasts pretty much all day since body butter lasts longer than perfumes and sprays.</li>
            <li> I use this body butter after every shower and it keeps my skin silky and moisturized.  I&#x27;ve tried three of the Tree Hut Body Butters (Almond Honey and Coconut Lime) and all of them smell really good, but I think this one is my favorite because it&#x27;s a sweeter, more girly scent.  This body butter is comparable to higher-end body butters, but the price is unbeatable for 3!  It&#x27;s really thick (as body butters are supposed to be) so it takes some time to rub in and it can feel a little heavy immediately after putting it on.  This works for me because I shower and immediately put it on, then I put on my robe while I fix my hair and makeup.  By the time I&#x27;m ready to get dressed it has completely soaked into my skin.  However if you can&#x27;t stand the feel of thicker lotions, you may want to skip this one.  I don&#x27;t mind how it feels, so it so it&#x27;s my go-to moisturizer year round!</li>
            <li> I love body butters, they always leave my skin feeling nice and soft. However, this body butter leaves a sticky feeling after. I like the smell and how soft it leaves my skin but I can&#x27;t deal with feeling sticky. :( I will try other Tree Hut body butters because I heard really good things about it.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and winters are especially irritating.  Since my normal lotion wasn&#x27;t quite cutting it during our unusually harsh winter, I wanted an emollient lotion that wouldn&#x27;t  leave me feeling like I&#x27;d just slathered on a thick layer of Crisco.  I stumbled upon this at Wal Mart and gave it a try.  I liked it so much that I came back to Amazon and got the 3-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is tropical but not overpowering.  The body butter is super hydrating (especially on the feet, elbows and knees!) without being overly greasy.  I&#x27;ve not yet tried this in the heat of summer, but when the temps begin to rise, I&#x27;ll come back with an update.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and definitely great for very dry winter skin.  Anything Kukui is great.  It&#x27;s a little tacky though, and takes a few minutes to soak in before you can touch stuff.  I also wish it came in a pump or squeeze bottle -  butter tubs are not convenient for work or your purse.</li>
            <li> Great scent, terrific moisturizer perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the Shea Body for a while now, and the Hawaiian  Kukui was never available. The stores were either out of stock or didn&#x27;t carry it. I was soo pleased to see Amazon not only had it, but had a 3 pk. The feel is not too greasy, and it will glide over your skin. The smell is so wonderful and not overwhelming. This is by far the best body cream out there, even for me living in North Carolina, the winters are still drying to your skin. It will not leave a film or go on like water like some creams. Be aware, once you start using this, it will become habit forming.</li>
            <li> I love Tree Hut&#x27;s Shea Body Butters.  I&#x27;ve tried several &#x27;flavors&#x27; and loved them all.  Have given them as gifts as well...always gratefully received.</li>
            <li> Great smell and not oily......make me feel ready for the day. Love the packgage this item comes in and the price is right.</li>
            <li> This my second order of this product.  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This creamy balm is the only thing that keeps my fingertips and heels soft and smooth out here on the edge of the desert. My kids also love this. We just keep buying it!</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came in at least a 10 oz. jar but still in a pack of 3.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to pay more  I would I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is very uplifting and puts you in a good mood,&lt;br /&gt;this what it does for me, love it.  I was hoping to find a body mist.</li>
            <li> My wife is 7 months pregnant and she says this body butter is one of the only things that relieves her itchy belly.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at the local supermarket and fell in love. After finding it cheaper on Amazon, I ordered 3 containers. I get about a month of use out of one jar. I apply it after showering in the morning and it lasts all day. My skin actually glows when I wear it! The scents are all delicious smelling. I use the scrub and lotion for pedicures at my salon!</li>
            <li> I mix this body butter with oil, usually almond, jojoba, or olive oil, and use it as an all-over body cream. I am a woman of color, and many products I come across don&#x27;t do a good job of keeping my dark skin moisturized all day. This mixture does the trick! It leaves my skin silky smooth and I NEVER have to worry about my skin getting dry. It settles into my skin very well, and it smells great too! I don&#x27;t recommend this mixture for everyone; some might find that the body butter alone is sufficient. However, if you are like me and like that all-day suppleness for your skin, I highly recommend mixing the butter with an oil of your choice.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it, and the smell, absolutely fantastice. We purchased before and wil continue buying in the future. These work great for gifts too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Feels so buttery and silky soft on my skin. Absorbs well.  Will buy again! Quite a bargain as I was only expecting one jar,  got 3!</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect antidote to winter&#x27;s drying effect on skin.  My skin feels great after use! Highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product too, the scent is nice and soft, it really keeps my skin moisturized.  Once again I just wish I could buy it locally.  So when I do find it, I order several jars.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product - within 2 days it has really helped get my dry skin under control. Better than AmLactin which I have used for years.</li>
    </ol>
