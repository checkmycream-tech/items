            <li>Great seller, fast delivery, the seller is always connected, low price and good quality.</li>

            <li>This is very useful for me.</li>
            <li>This is very useful for me.</li>
            <li>And it is very useful for me bust.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be a bit sticky at first, make sure the skin absorbs it well.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ok with using this consistently since it keeps me moisturized.</li>
            <li>Once I ran out of it I really noticed how it helped and rushed to target for more.</li>
            <li>The taste is very fragrant, is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how it feels, but after it dries it feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This is really good stuff, especially if you&#x27;re breastfeeding.  </li>
            <li>I believe strongly that keeping things well moisturized is the first step in avoiding those kinds of marks.  </li>
            <li>Loyal to its people.</li>
            <li>I used the cocoa butter for stretch marks while pregnant</li>
            <li>Works far better than I imagined.  </li>
            <li>Its too early to tell if it&#x27;ll work out as well as the stretch mark lotion, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product I use it for other part to not</li>
            <li>no major allergies or any kind of reaction.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it works, but I have heard great things about it.</li>
            <li>Really like this product as it does make the bust feel firmer and has such a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a dramatic difference, but worth trying if your on a budget.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cream first from target.</li>
            <li>Saw results the after the first week</li>
            <li>skin does look more toned, and chest lines not so deep.</li>
            <li>It leaves the texture of my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since my first child was born.</li>
            <li>My face was the first place I tried it, and the skin  has firmed up plus all discolorations are gone.</li>
            <li>and I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>Good smell, everyday use as a breast lotion, no matter it doesn&#x27;t firms or something.</li>
            <li>I have tried this product on other parts of my body and it has been amazing.  </li>
            <li>, just use this one my check and eye skin,also feel good instant improvement and skin become being filled &amp;tight.</li>
            <li>Its feels sticky and not so easy to smooth on this time round</li>
            <li>This cream works really well on any part of your body.</li>
            <li>Would highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li>I started to use the product and really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I apply it with a massaging upward/circular movement maybe once to twice a day, and I really try to work in the cream</li>
            <li>and then it dries much quicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell can&#x27;t be a bit much in the beginning, but it dissipates after a while.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do anything.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, very moisturizing, breast is elastic, I use every dayÔºÅ</li>
            <li>Seems to be working really well.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective and afforadable lotion ever, I have tried other well-known name brand and it didnt show much of a difference compare to Palmer&#x27;s, while the name brand usually cost $40~up .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product mainly on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Product gets used fairly quickly so wish it were in a larger size.  </li>
            <li>feel the first time I used, but just as the other reviews have said, it rubs on and absorbs very well and quickly at that.</li>
            <li>anyway, you should not have too high expectations.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t hoping for a miracle, just a little more firmness.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>I tried this because  I&#x27;ve used other Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter formulas and liked them, but this leaves my skin feeling and looking dry.</li>
            <li>However, leaves you very soft.</li>
            <li>It make your skin feel very soft</li>
            <li>After using this consistently twice per day, I can definitely see the difference.</li>
            <li>Breast look firmer and soft to the touch!</li>
            <li>I am a natural DD</li>
            <li>I also have been trying it under my chin because others seem to see results, so far none for me.</li>
            <li>i have only used it a week, don&#x27;t know if it really work.</li>
            <li>When I use it twice a day (morning and night) and sleep with a sleeping bra or a soft sports bra</li>
            <li>So far I havent seen no improvement.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have called the results perky but there was improvement in firmness and the girls just generally looked prettier.  </li>
            <li>Through the years, they are barely visible now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one bottle so far</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Through the years, they are barely visible now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one bottle so far</li>
            <li> If nothing happens, at least it makes your skin very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and im surprised at how firm my breast are</li>
            <li> I use it everyday but haven&#x27;t seen any change so far.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen very little result.</li>
            <li> but I usually stand somewhere near the a/c vent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve used it long enough to see all the results promised, but I like it enough to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I am not here to bash the product because I did have minimal results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no change in my breast.</li>
            <li> Its fine once it dries and it does not smell bad wet or smell at all once once dry.</li>
            <li> So before buy those expensive facial products for firm skin try this one first..</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way....</li>
            <li> Quite simply, after using three tubes, THIS STUFF DID NOTHING!!!!!!!Didn&#x27;t firm, didn&#x27;t remove stretch marks...nothing!</li>
            <li> I like to use it on the tiny lines around my eyes (I&#x27;m 33)with small improvement.</li>

            <li> I am usually allergic to any face creams so this is a big deal for me!</li>
            <li> I even stopped for a bit to see if I could notice a difference like all the other commenters did, but nothing had changed at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted to avoid stretch marks and other issues with my breasts while feeding</li>
            <li> cream is quite sticky so it takes a few minutes to dry in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap And nothing bad with a chocolate smell</li>
            <li> Has been in use, there is no significant effect</li>
            <li> i used it few times, I feel a little bit help now, it smells good,and it&#x27;s creamy.</li>
            <li> A sticky waste of money.</li>
            <li> I do not apply everyday.</li>
            <li> so I had started getting the tired eye bags stick around even with a nights proper rest.</li>
            <li> This product sculpt my breast, but it doesn&#x27;t really firm it.</li>
            <li> Not oilly,feel instant moisture after absorbtion.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, I am tired of 3 layers of eye skincare and another 3 layers facecare</li>

            <li> It is affordable, thick but non-greasy</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have used this semi-religiously for about a week now and have already seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li> it is helpful but you need to be patient because it is not a magic, it needs a period of time to show the effects!!!!</li>
            <li> The purchase was a random one as I was searching for the body firming cocoa butter and stumbled upon this.</li>
            <li> and I do notice a subtle difference in firmness!!!</li>

            <li> It was working in 20days.</li>
            <li> Great price, good stuff.</li>
            <li> I loved the product. This is very useful for me. I loved the product. This is very useful for me. I liked the product. I recommend to all, because the product and quality.</li>
            <li> This cream works really well on any part of your body. It instantly made my skin feel tighter. The 3 pack is a great value as well and it smells great and dries quickly. Would highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> Absorption is very good, soft and comfortable</li>
            <li> Very good, have no effect, but I will insist to use, want to get good results, I will continue to pay attention to, thank you very much</li>
            <li> Feels kind of goopy at first when applied but as soon as its rubbed into the skin it disappears leaving no stickiness or greasiness. Smells like chocolate. I love to eat chocolate but don&#x27;t like my skin to smell like it. Haven&#x27;t really seen that it firms the skin, but it is a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Quite simply, after using three tubes, THIS STUFF DID NOTHING!!!!!!!Didn&#x27;t firm, didn&#x27;t remove stretch marks...nothing! A sticky waste of money. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream first from target. I wasn&#x27;t hoping for a miracle, just a little more firmness. I started to use the product and really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference. My breast started to lift but I knew it was from the exercising and not the cream. And then, I ran out. Once I ran out of it I really noticed how it helped and rushed to target for more. They were out so I looked online to order it, glad I did. I&#x27;d say, go for it. If you&#x27;re looking to get some firmness this definitely helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 02/27/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer use this product. I exercise and have better results from light weight lifting. I am not here to bash the product because I did have minimal results. I am here to recommend light weight lifting for better results.</li>
            <li> Could never find something better than this.</li>
            <li> My friends say good, I also try to buy. The taste is very fragrant, is my favorite. Hope to use after effect.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month now and havn&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> Really works. Love the smell, feel. Great product. Saw results the after the first week</li>
            <li> Really like this product as it does make the bust feel firmer and has such a nice smell to it. Will  purchase again.</li>
            <li> About a year ago I purchased Palmers skin Firming cream (didn&#x27;t work), but attached to it was a sample of the Bust Firming. Within 3 days I could see a difference. I am a natural DD so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything. I wouldn&#x27;t have called the results perky but there was improvement in firmness and the girls just generally looked prettier.  I ordered 3 tubes about a month ago. So far I have seen very little result. No improved firmness but skin does look more toned, and chest lines not so deep. I like to use it on the tiny lines around my eyes (I&#x27;m 33)with small improvement. I also have been trying it under my chin because others seem to see results, so far none for me. Its feels sticky and not so easy to smooth on this time round and I don&#x27;t remember the sample being that way. Its fine once it dries and it does not smell bad wet or smell at all once once dry. Maybe I got a bad lot?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product mainly on my face and neck. It does make your skin feel firmer and look firmer. It&#x27;s not a dramatic difference, but worth trying if your on a budget. It leaves the texture of my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> After using this consistently twice per day, I can definitely see the difference. it is no miracle cr√®me, but it does make a difference. it has become part of my daily regimen</li>
            <li> I tried this because  I&#x27;ve used other Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter formulas and liked them, but this leaves my skin feeling and looking dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently begun to use this product even though I ordered it sometime ago. I apply it with a massaging upward/circular movement maybe once to twice a day, and I really try to work in the cream so I use both hands on each side, hopefully I&#x27;m stimulating circulation too ..... (And no, not like that!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;After the first week I&#x27;ve noticed that it has started to lift the bust, so I am impressed and foresee long term benefits.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is quite sticky so it takes a few minutes to dry in but I usually stand somewhere near the a/c vent and then it dries much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best and most affordable option in bust firming creams.</li>
            <li> No difference noted here.  Better results with jergens or target brand. Functions as a regular cocoa butter cream.</li>
            <li> I hope it brings me a miracle</li>
            <li> i have only used it a week, don&#x27;t know if it really work. but it smells good and easily absorbed, i like it.</li>
            <li> Good smell, everyday use as a breast lotion, no matter it doesn&#x27;t firms or something. I want to purchase palmers body lotion anti stretches next time. It&#x27;s cheap And nothing bad with a chocolate smell</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since my first child was born. it is helpful but you need to be patient because it is not a magic, it needs a period of time to show the effects!!!!</li>
            <li> I like it. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve used it long enough to see all the results promised, but I like it enough to keep using it.</li>
            <li> i used it few times, I feel a little bit help now, it smells good,and it&#x27;s creamy. very good stuff you can try.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about a year now and im surprised at how firm my breast are...being a D cup lady I was afraid I&#x27;d head south once I hit 50 but to my surprise they still feel plump and full...</li>
            <li> To address the situation after breast sagging breasts , yet did not use , do not know how effective , the price is very reasonable</li>
            <li> Although don&#x27;t like smell, they are still nice and helpful.</li>
            <li> I love, love this cream. I used to have stretch marks when I stopped breastfeeding... Through the years, they are barely visible now. I have been using it for about 5 years though... I do not apply everyday. If nothing happens, at least it makes your skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be a bit sticky at first, make sure the skin absorbs it well. I don&#x27;t care anymore, I wear my bra on it and forget about it, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell can&#x27;t be a bit much in the beginning, but it dissipates after a while.</li>
            <li> Well, this brand is very famous. Both my wife and my female friends use it. The only problem is I can&#x27;t find the expiration date on it. Hope it can be improved.</li>
            <li> Works ok on breast, but I also use all over.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for two weeks have notice a difference already! Breast look firmer and soft to the touch!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product on other parts of my body and it has been amazing.  My face was the first place I tried it, and the skin  has firmed up plus all discolorations are gone. So before buy those expensive facial products for firm skin try this one first.. IT WORKS...&lt;br /&gt;Plus a little bit goes a long way....</li>
            <li> Works far better than I imagined.  I definitely recommend this and have been using for about 6 months.  Great chocolate smell from the cocoa butter, and the texture is thick and sort of cooling.  Kind of a gel-like lotion.  Product gets used fairly quickly so wish it were in a larger size.  But for effectiveness it earns 5 stars (for price/value its more like 4).</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Unfortunately, the product did not give any obvious result. Using it since August 2014.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days and I can tell a difference. Will be ordering more once I&#x27;m done with it. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really help firm anything. but smelled great.</li>
            <li> I wrote my review ahead of time because I have been using palmers products to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy and since I was a child. The products do what they say they will. So I am giving it a 5, because I know for a fact it will work. Loyal to its people.</li>
            <li> Definitely tightens skin immediately, helps reduce stretch marks. I&#x27;ve only used one bottle so far but I will continue to buy</li>
            <li> I bought.&lt;br /&gt;I never remembered to use.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, and the texture of this product. I just don&#x27;t understand how, and when it should start working. Will I NOTICE a change?? I have no idea..I haven&#x27;t seen anything different, as of yet. However, leaves you very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice oil ,his cream works really well on any part of your body. It instantly made my skin feel tighter.  it smells great and dries quickly..</li>
            <li> Another item for my wife. She&#x27;ll use it when breast-feeding ends.</li>
            <li> no change until 8 tubes....</li>
            <li> This is so creamy!!! It make your skin feel very soft and I do notice a subtle difference in firmness!!!</li>
            <li> I am in love. I have used this semi-religiously for about a week now and have already seen dramatic results. The purchase was a random one as I was searching for the body firming cocoa butter and stumbled upon this. I was dubious of the gel-like feel the first time I used, but just as the other reviews have said, it rubs on and absorbs very well and quickly at that. The feel is luxurious. I started using it on my face and neck as well- I have 2 children 5 and under so I had started getting the tired eye bags stick around even with a nights proper rest. This cream has helped immensely when nothing else would. I am usually allergic to any face creams so this is a big deal for me! I can&#x27;t wait to see what long-term use does ^.^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(for clarity I order from my husbands account)</li>
            <li> it is okay.  It doesn&#x27;t really do anything.  I even stopped for a bit to see if I could notice a difference like all the other commenters did, but nothing had changed at all.</li>
            <li> i like it , i hope it will be worked.  And it is so cheap, i thinke it could be used for several months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product I use it for other part to not just what it say on the box &#x27;</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 2 weeks and I see changes in the tone of my skin. I am encourage to continue. I am not expecting a miracle, just some improvement...LOL!</li>
            <li> Great seller, fast delivery, the seller is always connected, low price and good quality. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Is being used, expect results</li>
            <li> HAVE YET TO SEE A DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend,hope it works</li>
            <li> still in the process of trying.still  not so sure about its effectiveness. anyway, you should not have too high expectations.</li>
            <li> Use it for years,always  like its smell. And it is very useful for me bust. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it feels, but after it dries it feel nice and soft. This product sculpt my breast, but it doesn&#x27;t really firm it. It&#x27;s still a great product I would recommend it and I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> really good product. Not oilly,feel instant moisture after absorbtion.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, I am tired of 3 layers of eye skincare and another 3 layers facecare, just use this one my check and eye skin,also feel good instant improvement and skin become being filled &amp;tight. I guess collagen works for everywhere!</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no change in my breast.</li>
            <li> good hydrating properties good cream consistancy no major allergies or any kind of reaction. i would recommend this for a friend.</li>
            <li> Ultra moisturizing, great size, good packaging, good quantity for the price paid, a very good convenient size for travel or home.</li>
            <li> like coco nutIT looks good. I am waiting to see how it works .good absorption and good smell.every mom will love it</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. It does what it says. When I use it twice a day (morning and night) and sleep with a sleeping bra or a soft sports bra it provides better results. I get the feeling that results mainly last while you use the cream but I&#x27;m ok with using this consistently since it keeps me moisturized.</li>
            <li> Has been in use, there is no significant effect</li>
            <li> very nice, i really like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and not sure if it&#x27;s working. I also started doing some chest exercises to help enhance my breast, but haven&#x27;t noticed the change I&#x27;m hoping for. And it has kind of a funky smell:/</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, very moisturizing, breast is elastic, I use every dayÔºÅ</li>
            <li> for my friends i think she will happy.she just have a baby, a lovely boy  i come from jiangsu china</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff, especially if you&#x27;re breastfeeding.  I used the cocoa butter for stretch marks while pregnant and I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks.  I wanted to avoid stretch marks and other issues with my breasts while feeding so I&#x27;m using this to try and keep everything firm.  I believe strongly that keeping things well moisturized is the first step in avoiding those kinds of marks.  Its too early to tell if it&#x27;ll work out as well as the stretch mark lotion, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far I havent seen no improvement.  I will keep using the three tubes and see if anything changes afterward.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday but haven&#x27;t seen any change so far.</li>
            <li> Just received it today. Not sure if it works, but I have heard great things about it. I was also told that it can be used on legs, arms, stomach, etc for cellulite</li>
            <li> This is the most effective and afforadable lotion ever, I have tried other well-known name brand and it didnt show much of a difference compare to Palmer&#x27;s, while the name brand usually cost $40~up .</li>
            <li> Been using the bust cream for a while now. I am very satisfied with the product. It is affordable, thick but non-greasy and I think has helped keep my boobs in A+ condition.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working really well. I&#x27;ve purchased another 3 pack already.</li>
