            <li>i bought this machine for my boyfriend for Christmas and he completely loved my gift.</li>
            <li>This product seems like it would be good if I didn&#x27;t receive it used.</li>
            <li>This works good, but not as goog as the improved master.</li>

            <li>Clippers cut and sound great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t thing they should advertise \\&quot;Perfect for All-Around Styling\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This was great, did a quick test of plugging it in and it works.</li>
            <li>and it made fading my hair very easy.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m impressed!  </li>
            <li>Best clipper by far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for even quick cuts for kids or adults.</li>
            <li>The top of my hair</li>
            <li>This is more for just #1A to #2 like the box says.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>I think the cut is a lot better with just the cut from the blade as opposed to using guards.</li>
            <li>There is a lot of misinformation in these reviews even some rated the most helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These clippers and more specifically the Phat master blade was designed to pick up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>best possible cut.</li>
            <li>There is no need to use combs for most haircuts.</li>
            <li>I am glad I brought this clipper</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Im not a barber but good enough to give a nice haircut.</li>
            <li>There are NO COMBS that fit the Phat Master.</li>
            <li>I thought the recommended combs will fit the Phat Master.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it a 5 stars if it had COMBs that fit.</li>
            <li>your original or improved master blade leaves off.</li>
            <li>It eliminates the need to use guards on your original master and gives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good clipper, it feels like I have to go over the head several times before I feel its cut all the hair.</li>
            <li>I love these things, at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would cut my hair low enough, but it does the trick if I cut my hair against the grain.</li>
            <li>clipper and blade are five stars and outstanding but do a very specific job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be returning for 1 more attempt before asking for my money back.</li>
            <li>It fills in well higher on the head without needing guides that can move or smash.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The improved master gets most hair cut on first swipe and only go over my hair 2-3 times.</li>
            <li>returned this product twice already and the latest replacement when turned on the 2nd time buzzes loudly like a lawnmower.</li>
            <li>Im glad i bought this because now i can cut my hair on a consistent basis now that it takes twice as less time to do a fade with these clippers.  </li>
            <li>Note: The smaller top blades are the exact same.   </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If Andis ever fixed the guard (made it flat, like the other two)these things would be great, but until they do, they will always be a back up for me.</li>
            <li>smooth clipper adjusts from a #2 down to a #1A. Saves time of switching guards during the haircut.</li>
            <li>I have a 5 yr old son and i cut his hair every week.</li>
            <li>Take a long time before they get hot \\&quot;over</li>
            <li>I am the wife, this item never worked for me blades not oiled never worked and it was scratched and bent from the start i am a professional hairdresser my daughter bought these for me</li>
            <li>Especially for those who like to keep a smooth dark cut.</li>
            <li>pretty solid clippers, only issue is that the head of the clipper tends to change setting, if your cutting your own hair, and you put downward pressure on the head of clipper.</li>
            <li>Other then that cut very well, well built and doesnt over heat.</li>
            <li>I still have them as a back up, but find that it&#x27;s much faster to just use the four blades on my Oster 76 than to even mess with the phatmaster.  </li>

            <li> I love these things, at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would cut my hair low enough, but it does the trick if I cut my hair against the grain. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Ive been a self-cutter for a while and it made fading my hair very easy.  Im glad i bought this because now i can cut my hair on a consistent basis now that it takes twice as less time to do a fade with these clippers.  The only gripe is the cut doesn&#x27;t start at 0. but if you have another clippers all you have to do is use that for 0.</li>
            <li> Great clipper easy to use.</li>
            <li> The only difference in the Phat Master Clipper and the Improved Master Clipper is the bottom blade. The appearance is different too of course. There are NO COMBS that fit the Phat Master. I purchased this because I fade my hair starting at #1 and fade it up to 2. The top of my hair I use 3 and 4. I thought the recommended combs will fit the Phat Master. NO COMBS FIT!!!. You can buy an Improved Master Blade Set for $25 and change the bottom Phat Blade. You only have to remove 2 screws. Only install the bottom Improved Master blade. Continue the hair cut using combs. Note: The smaller top blades are the exact same.   Or just buy the Improved Master which goes from 000-1 then use combs. I like the look of the Phat Master and would rather just start my fade out with the Phat blade then switch the out to the bottom Improved Master blade, and use combs.     Noticed the clipper began to get very warm after a 20mins. I adjusted the side screw to what is recommended, It was to tight. Not sure if that has anything with the warmth.     Great cut great appearance. Great blade adjust lever. Easy fading from #1A to #2!!   I&#x27;d give it a 5 stars if it had COMBs that fit. I don&#x27;t thing they should advertise \\&quot;Perfect for All-Around Styling\\&quot;. This is more for just #1A to #2 like the box says. NO COMBS FIT!!!</li>
            <li> Our granddaughter loved them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers with the intention of saving time on fades, and as a backup in case one of the blades in between (sizes 1, 1a, 1 1/2 , 2) crapped out.  I already have the Andis Fademaster and Master clippers, and am very happy with them both, and was expecting to be happy with the phatmaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have with the phatmaster is the guard on the bottom.  The fade master and regular master both have flat guards that adjust back and forth to make the cut longer or shorter.  The guard on the phat master has a round bump on the bottom that has a tendency to roll the clipper forward and dig the front edge of the guard into the clients head occasionally, not a good thing.  I find myself going so slowing when using them (trying to avoid the digging effect), that it negates any time saving features I thought the clipper might have. I still have them as a back up, but find that it&#x27;s much faster to just use the four blades on my Oster 76 than to even mess with the phatmaster.  If Andis ever fixed the guard (made it flat, like the other two)these things would be great, but until they do, they will always be a back up for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a stylist this is to heavy for on the job all day.</li>
            <li> very good quality and design. slightly quieter than the other brands i owned.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers. Cut from a #1 to #2 and I keep my hair dark and have waves so they are perfect for me. Cuts my time in half from switching guards to get the lenght that I want. I think the cut is a lot better with just the cut from the blade as opposed to using guards. I have no complaints about these clippers!</li>
            <li> Im not a barber but good enough to give a nice haircut. I have a 5 yr old son and i cut his hair every week. Before this product i used clippers that didn&#x27;t give a even steven. These are heavy but error proof as they want cut a patch of hair out trying to give a even haircut.. Take a long time before they get hot \\&quot;over 30 minutes\\&quot; No guards are need for 1-2 inch haircuts. I would recommend these to anyone who cuts hair from home. I dont no about professionally as they are very heavy.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of misinformation in these reviews even some rated the most helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Phat master blade cuts from 1A to 2...NOT 1 to 2. These clippers and more specifically the Phat master blade was designed to pick up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where your original or improved master blade leaves off. It works in conjunction with your improved master. Improved master blade cuts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from 000-1 the phat master cuts from the next size up which is 1A-2. It eliminates the need to use guards on your original master and gives&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the best possible cut. Once again master blade cuts 000-1 phat master 1A-2. The phat master blade can be put on any master clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper and blade are five stars and outstanding but do a very specific job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is now discontinued, but the phat master blade is still being produced.</li>
            <li> These are some great clippers</li>
            <li> This is an awesome machine just make sure you read what it&#x27;s for before you purchase this item. Clippers cut and sound great.</li>
            <li> Great clippers love them!</li>
            <li> i bought this machine for my boyfriend for Christmas and he completely loved my gift. Hes happy with it, and says all his customers loves it too.</li>
            <li> returned this product twice already and the latest replacement when turned on the 2nd time buzzes loudly like a lawnmower. I will be returning for 1 more attempt before asking for my money back. I would give 0 star if possible.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying, this clipper is heavy. But don&#x27;t get fool by that, it gets the job done. I like the fact that it can adjust from 0 to 2 . There is no need to use combs for most haircuts. It feels that is well built. Time will tell if it is durable. I am glad I brought this clipper and I think people that are looking for a quality clipper should consider this one.</li>
            <li> smooth clipper adjusts from a #2 down to a #1A. Saves time of switching guards during the haircut. You will  still need another clipper to take the haircut shorter in the fade,  I reccomend an Improved Andis Master.  Also, the Phat Master does not accept guard attachments, the Master does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for even quick cuts for kids or adults.</li>
            <li> This product seems like it would be good if I didn&#x27;t receive it used. I bought this new and when I opened the package the box for the clippers was opened and tapped up badly. The clippers looked used and I was really disappointed. Don&#x27;t buy from the seller &amp;#34;Need Stuff&amp;#34;... :-(</li>
            <li> Well made and they cut so well.  Got a great deal on them.  So far I&#x27;m impressed!  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to adjust the blade setting for cleaning</li>
            <li> I added this clipper to my set.  It fills in well higher on the head without needing guides that can move or smash.  Great tool in your set for a fade with no lines.</li>
            <li> Great Service! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was great, did a quick test of plugging it in and it works. Getting prepared to start cutting hair and can&#x27;t wait to start using it more often. Till than I will wait a bit and do a update on this.</li>
            <li> Best clippers in the world. Especially for those who like to keep a smooth dark cut. Best clipper by far</li>

            <li> it is what it is.. thats all i can say about this.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has longer hair settings than my andis improved master. This works good, but not as goog as the improved master. This one seems to miss spots a lot and I find I have to go over my hair 4-5 times to get it all. . The improved master gets most hair cut on first swipe and only go over my hair 2-3 times. Since I need the longer settings I&#x27;ll have to make do. If you don&#x27;t then go with the improved master</li>
            <li> One word excellent! These give you an all around experience for all hair types. I have never used anything like them.</li>
            <li> Sent this one back and repurchased the Adis Master.  Guards do not fit on this one.  They should tell you in the description.</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers n very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE these perfect for fades tapers,ect no net for guards or comb. Wish I had two.</li>
            <li> Good clipper, it feels like I have to go over the head several times before I feel its cut all the hair.</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I own. Thank you.</li>
