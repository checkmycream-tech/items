    <ol>
            <li> I bought two one for me and one for my.dad and I&#x27;m gonna buy some more it smell good and ppl notice me when I walk into the room</li>
            <li> My son kept stealing cologne from me and his favorite was this fragrance.  I ordered this for his birthday and it arrived well packaged and quickly.  Now he has his own bottle so I&#x27;m happy and he is ecstatic.  At least he has good taste (like his old man)!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim years ago to help out a friend and her Mary Kay business. From the moment I caught the scent, I was entranced. Bar none - my favorite scent on a man. This is premium.     It isn&#x27;t too strong when first applied and settles in for a nice all day (or evening) scent. I love this stuff. Makes me follow my man around just for another hug.</li>
            <li> This product is great I love it ,he loves it.  the smell is amazing!!!!!! **********</li>
            <li> 6 out of 5    I don&#x27;t know anything about Cologne!!  So I got this in my birthday!!!    Everyplace I go, people tell me I really smell good, Girls, oldmen, taxi drivers, salesperson, everybody!!!    I even give away a little to someone cause he was asking me for it!!!    Really good for a gift!    Im getting another bottle right now!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, what can I say, I don&#x27;t usually like cologne, but I&#x27;m a domain admin!  All kidding aside, I haven&#x27;t come across many colognes that I like and happened upon this one.  To each there own, but this one does it for me.  For the first time in my life I&#x27;m wearing cologne on a daily basis.  (I&#x27;m 41).</li>
            <li> I had this cologne about 8 years ago and loved it and so did the ladies. I got compliments on the scent all the time. I just purchased my first bottle in 8 years because I didn&#x27;t think it existed anymore. Boy, am I relieved it&#x27;s still around. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm smells sooooooooooooooo good!!!</li>
            <li> DOMAIN IS SO LUSCIOUS, YOU CAN \\&quot;GET LOST IN IT!!!\\&quot; IT DOESNT FADE OR CHANGE SCENT, AND WILL LAST A FULL TWO (OR MORE) DAYS.IT&#x27;S SO MYSTICAL, ITS EASY TO SWIRL IN THIS ENCHANTED SENT!!!!!!! BUY IT-YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPONTED!</li>
            <li> Have always liked this scent. But finding a local MK rep not the easiest thing. So this was way more convenient to find &amp; obtain. Recommend this.</li>
            <li> My mother bought me this cologne a few years ago and it has become my go to scent because women love it! Everywhere I go I get compliments on how I smell and I&#x27;ve noticed hugs from women seem to last longer than usual.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne, I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances. When they ask what I&#x27;m wearing and I tell them it&#x27;s Domain from Mary Kay they are blown away. It&#x27;s works equally well as a day or night scent. It is a light musk scent with some wood tones. It last all day long.</li>
            <li> very disappointed in this purchase........very weak in smell ......I dont understand how it was so strong smelling in sample and weak in the bottle .....you have to spray quite a bit to smell............save your $$$$......</li>
            <li> I live in MA and did bill to/ship to for my father in PA.  No problems!  Done perfectly and he received it when promised.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I GAVE DOMAIN TO MY BOYFRIEND AS A VALENTINES GIFT.  HE LOVE IT!  HE RECEIVES LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS EVERYWHERE HE GOES.  NOT SURE IF THIS WAS A GOOD OR BAD THING FOR ME.  JUST KIDDING!  I RECOMMEND THIS COLOGNE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THAT MANLY SEXY SMELL.</li>
            <li> my wife and I both love the fragerance.  My daughter gave me a bottle for father&#x27;s day years ago</li>
            <li> Domain by Mary Kay is the best cologne for men there is !  My husband gets many compliments when wearing this fragrance!</li>
            <li> Smells good and it was a very quick delivery</li>
            <li> I love it. It smells great and I got it right on time I give it two thumbs up a good buy</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne, had been looking for it for a while and other sites sell it for much more... I will be a return customer for this product.</li>
            <li> You can spray this on everyday and has an awesome clean scent. 2 pump is more than enough. I recommend this product. Spray for any occasion. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent. I have received many compliments from the ladies. Ladies, if you looking to update your man&#x27;s cologne look no further and try Domain.</li>
            <li> I bought this to woo a special lady, weeks later we were dating, and three years later we are married. 10/5 stars</li>
            <li> My sister was a Mary Kay dealer, &amp; gifted me this product one Christmas long ago. I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Makes me smell soo good! My favorite fragrance and my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> I generally get compliments with this cologne.  The only thing I would say is to apply is conservatively.  I prefer a cologne that people can only smell in close proximity.  For the first 20 minutes after I spray it on myself, people can pick up the scent 10 feet away, so I usually apply it 30 minutes before I arrive somewhere.</li>
            <li> ive been using this cologne since the first time i used it back in 1998.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a mild manly smell, not sweet like candy.</li>
            <li> The only Cologne my husband will wear~Love the Scent!!&lt;br /&gt;Great Price on Amazon, MK is a lot higher in price.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product, arrived quickly -</li>
            <li> The best men cologne out there besides Issey Miyake. The musk smell draws too many people attention. Not to be dirty but I spray just a lil tad on my private parts, lol, for better satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Since using this for about two years I have received many compliments,and inquiries as to what I was&lt;br /&gt;using for cologne! It has a very clean and mildly fragrant aroma!</li>
            <li> I have used this before.  It&#x27;s good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> It my husband&#x27;s favorite.  Came on tIme and was priced right</li>
            <li> A subtle but yet distinct fragrance makes this cologne one that men will be happy to have acquired.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my husband. This cologne is comparable to high end expensive colognes, a couple sprays lasts all day and keeps him smelling yummy! I always love when he&#x27;s wearing it, I can&#x27;t stop sniffing him! It&#x27;s unique and very sexy, I hope I can keep finding this scent because it&#x27;s my favorite one on him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It smells like I just chopped down a thousand trees and then wrestled a bear and rode it to your doorstep, while wearing a tuxedo woven of pure lust.&amp;#34;-His review, I think that means it smells masculine and sexy. ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got this for my hubby for years and he loves it and I could just eat him it smells so good when he wears it!</li>
            <li> Dragons Fear Me Women Want Me!!</li>
            <li> Cologne is great, my favorite scent for my husband. However, shipping was very slow.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and came on time.</li>
            <li> Still a great fragrance and my husband likes it better than any of the new men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few colognes that makes me literally find a man more attractive than if he were not wearing it. Something about it is completely delightful, and I recently purchased it as a gift for my fiance. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Husband really enjoys it.  I bought it upon a recommendation of a friend while looking for a new fragrance for my husband.  We both enjoy it now.  :)</li>
