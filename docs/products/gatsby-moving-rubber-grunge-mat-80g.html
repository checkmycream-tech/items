            <li>Good price, its matte and</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s that good</li>
            <li>I loved it temporary, but it started to break me a out on my forehead.</li>
            <li>in a good way.</li>
            <li>stuff is GREAT in the heat, I&#x27;d put it in the top 1-2 waxes/puttys I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for over 4 years, and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This is great for holding up fine hair.</li>
            <li>This Grunge Mat is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Great Wax for short to medium hair, if not the BEST!</li>
            <li>Very easy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used bedhead matte texture before, which is better on its own without hairspray</li>
            <li>I like how as more wax is used, the more matted the hair becomes.</li>
            <li>I do tend to use the tigi matte more</li>
            <li>(Used american crew before and thought that was perfect until I found this)</li>
            <li>Tons of hold, love the matte finish.</li>
            <li>This leave more of a sticky grit to the hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the product..</li>
            <li>And i really love the matte look aswell.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>do not combine with a hairspray if you plan on not showering, yet adding more in the morning.</li>
            <li>The grey has the best feeling hold in my opinion.</li>
            <li>easy is it to work into the hair?  </li>
            <li>it wash out easily?  </li>
            <li>Strong, but moveable and bouncy (if blowdried).</li>
            <li>If you can accept the challenges associated with washing this product out and a slightly sandy texture, you may find this to be the best option out there.  </li>
            <li>If you can accept the challenges associated with washing this product out and a slightly sandy texture, you may find this to be the best option out there.  </li>
            <li>I, however, like the grit because I have fine hair that I spike in a faux haw.  </li>
            <li>I am a lady with have fine wavy hair, but I have lots of it.</li>
            <li>Once it dries, however, it looks very natural, and really good.</li>
            <li>It stays soft, adds body and holds fairly well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, you can easily do whatever style on your hair, not hard.</li>
            <li>but each have a unique set of pros and cons.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; look, with a little more hold, and manipulation.</li>
            <li>Yes it will create and hold the general form of your styling but it wont be able to hold the more detailed stylings</li>
            <li>and if you style yourself right, you will get compliments about what type of hair wax you use!</li>
            <li>Holds great without making your hair look soaking wet</li>
            <li>This product definitely gives you the biggest bang-for-your-buck regarding the amount you need to use to achieve a good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love works really well, i can mold my hair any way i want to, and it holds without the greasy look.</li>
            <li>But this stuff holds my hair super well</li>
            <li>styling it works well in either dry or damp hair, and the hold is good</li>
            <li>The texture is very creamy and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Very good product, definitely would recommend it for short hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as natural as Fiber but better than some of the cheaper options, like TIGI.  </li>
            <li>It was worth my time and money.  </li>
            <li>However if you don&#x27;t care about detailing so much but still want to have a simple short matte hair style then go for it, it wont be perfect but it will be really good even compared to other waxes.</li>
            <li>This hair wax targets individual hairs and has a very strong hold.</li>
            <li>its perfect, once you get the styling down you wont ever want to swap to a different wax, also the wax turns transparent once you start thinning it out on you fingers or on your hair</li>
            <li>Amazing wax, I have the long hair to the side and this Gatsby hair wax does the job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really prefer the smell but, on the other hand, it&#x27;s strong and very easy to work with.  </li>

            <li>I will start of by saying its the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used although its not perfect for everyone.</li>
            <li>The hold is also extremely consistent throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>the hold consistent?</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a top contender.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a top contender.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Story Time: I&#x27;ve used many types of hair wax and hair gels (American Crew, TIGI, Suave, Loreal, Redken, etc.)</li>
            <li>At first the product may make your hair look like you just put gell in it.</li>
            <li>just good , use comfortable,smell like green apple ,like it</li>
            <li>The smell is slightly strong and definitely not preferable to many of the other options, like Dirt, Sticky Rice and Spiky Edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is slightly strong and definitely not preferable to many of the other options, like Dirt, Sticky Rice and Spiky Edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves a light residue that lets my hair pile messily on top without having too much of a sticky or hard residue.</li>
            <li>this didnt do much noticeable anything for me.</li>
            <li>Just dont put too much on, cos youll have to wash with a bunch of shampoo to get it all out</li>
            <li>Finishes matte but it doesn&#x27;t really hold all day...</li>
            <li>sometimes you feel like no matter how much you wash</li>
            <li>The pink holds stronger, but also clumps more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more matte finish than the pink version</li>
            <li>: If you put too much, you might have to shampoo twice.</li>
            <li>(i use it for a quiff/pompadour) and it is very pliable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to be able to style individual hairs while still maintaining that natural look.</li>
            <li>The hold is strong, but it still retains a very matte and dry look.</li>
            <li>much do you need to get a decent hold?  </li>
            <li>While I was ready to settle on this particular product (for my needs), I decided to keep experimenting because of this particular con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to a more traditional hair product.</li>
            <li>I have been using hair gels/waxes for almost 15 years of my life and have used almost any type of wax, pomenade, hair powder, gel you can think of; short sexy hair, ice spiker, american crew, big sexy hair, all the axe products, the dove waxes, the garnier waxes, the bed head stuff, and several others</li>
            <li>its a little rough but pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.ting because of this particular</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that since if your hair is very short and lively it wont be able to hold on IF you use only the recommended amount of wax.</li>
            <li>I love how little of this you have to use and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not especially long, but pretty unruly...</li>
            <li>First of, on the Amazon page it is advertised for VERY short hair.</li>
            <li>so no risk of white residue on your forehead, thank god for quality wax products and very high quality packaging as well.</li>
            <li>I have short and straight hair, I basically stand it up.  </li>
            <li>This is for natural look.</li>
            <li>natural does the hair feel throughout the day?  </li>
            <li>It gives your hair the look of being disheveled/dirty in the cool way rather than being overly shiny/crusty and weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li>Again, the pink IS stronger hold but has a tiny bit more shine than the grey.  </li>
            <li>This particular product should last for 12+ hours before you see any loss in hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like green apples, and it only takes a little bit (I touch two fingers to the surface of it and get the tiniest of smears, rub it around in both hands to warm it up, and apply it).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fixed, without any gunk left on my fingers!</li>
            <li>This offers a very strong hold, that never gets hard or stiff, and doesn&#x27;t look sheen.</li>
            <li>The grey is completely matte.</li>
            <li>Other than that, highly recommended...</li>
            <li>I usually just let the shampoo sit in my hair for a few minutes, and it gets most of it out.  </li>

            <li> natural does the hair feel throughout the day?  </li>
            <li> It gives your hair the look of being disheveled/dirty in the cool way rather than being overly shiny/crusty and weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> Again, the pink IS stronger hold but has a tiny bit more shine than the grey.  </li>
            <li> This particular product should last for 12+ hours before you see any loss in hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells like green apples, and it only takes a little bit (I touch two fingers to the surface of it and get the tiniest of smears, rub it around in both hands to warm it up, and apply it).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fixed, without any gunk left on my fingers!</li>
            <li> This offers a very strong hold, that never gets hard or stiff, and doesn&#x27;t look sheen.</li>
            <li> The grey is completely matte.</li>

            <li> Great hold but you now become a walking air cleaner.  The hold is great for spiking my 3-4&amp;#34; long hair up in the air all day. The downside is that it stays tacky in your hair all day long.  As a result, all debris, dust, lint, and anything else flying around your head gets stuck in your hair.  I&#x27;ve even tried using less but it still happens.  I&#x27;m going back to a more traditional hair product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It doesn&#x27;t seem like it will hold well while you are putting it in, but it does and keeps a dry look. You wake up the next day, just reshape it and it still will hold. Good stuff and great price.</li>
            <li> I have coarse thick hair.  This is about the only product that works for me.  Gives me the messy, tousled look plus the matte finish that I want.</li>
            <li> i have thick coarse asian hair. this didnt do much noticeable anything for me. hair stayed shifted slightly when styled, but not much and not aesthetically pleasing</li>
            <li> Great product. I like how as more wax is used, the more matted the hair becomes. Speedy delivery as well</li>
            <li> I will start of by saying its the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used although its not perfect for everyone. First of, on the Amazon page it is advertised for VERY short hair. (this is either a translation error or a miscommunication) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that since if your hair is very short and lively it wont be able to hold on IF you use only the recommended amount of wax. Yes it will create and hold the general form of your styling but it wont be able to hold the more detailed stylings, I have that hair and i tried with and without showering and my hair just overpowers it. However if you don&#x27;t care about detailing so much but still want to have a simple short matte hair style then go for it, it wont be perfect but it will be really good even compared to other waxes. For medium short hair tho? its perfect, once you get the styling down you wont ever want to swap to a different wax, also the wax turns transparent once you start thinning it out on you fingers or on your hair so no risk of white residue on your forehead, thank god for quality wax products and very high quality packaging as well.</li>
            <li> My go to wax for my hair. Holds great without making your hair look soaking wet or like you splashed a ton of soul glo on your melon. Just dont put too much on, cos youll have to wash with a bunch of shampoo to get it all out</li>
            <li> This is great for holding up fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t look/feel greasy at all. It allows your hair to feel soft, easy to style, and holds well.</li>
            <li> My go-to for my messy comb-over style...it works well for messy looks as well as cleaned up styles. Finishes matte but it doesn&#x27;t really hold all day...it eventually gets a bit limp but can easily be fixed by hand combing. A little goes a long way so although it&#x27;s small, it&#x27;s worth it. Smells nice. Only gripe is that it&#x27;s hard to wash completely off...sometimes you feel like no matter how much you wash, hair still feels like there might be a bit of product left. Other than that, highly recommended...</li>
            <li> Good product works well but I prefer the loose shuffle to grunge it was not as thick.</li>
            <li> its a little rough but pretty good.  I might try one of the other versions like pink with a little shine to it.  I do tend to use the tigi matte more but they are both good.  I also use American Crew Fiber but this is definitely stronger.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I have short and straight hair, I basically stand it up.  This product helps me keep my hair in place, but keeps it looking dry.  Not sure how I used to go around with my hair as stiff as a rock and wet looking.  This is wax though, so it&#x27;s not easy getting it out of your hair.  I usually just let the shampoo sit in my hair for a few minutes, and it gets most of it out.  Not something I&#x27;d recommend rolling around on your pillow with it still in your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the pink, green, purple, and the grey gatsby moving rubber series. The grey has the best feeling hold in my opinion. The pink holds stronger, but also clumps more. The green and purple do not hold very well for my hair. The hold is strong, but it still retains a very matte and dry look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 30 different pastes-waxes etc on my hair.  It&#x27;s not especially long, but pretty unruly...especially in the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is GREAT in the heat, I&#x27;d put it in the top 1-2 waxes/puttys I&#x27;ve ever tried.  And it&#x27;s cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For styling it works well in either dry or damp hair, and the hold is good but you do need some hairspray to keep it firm.  I&#x27;ve used bedhead matte texture before, which is better on its own without hairspray (so you have a comparison).  Nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried that&#x27;s still produced has come close to this.  Definite buy for hair of any length.</li>
            <li> This thing is AWESOME. Matte like how matte should be. Strong, but moveable and bouncy (if blowdried). I do my hair up, not like how the videos of gatsby show. I don&#x27;t do it like the japanese guys. My hair stays up and when the wind blows it, I just run my fingers through my hair and it&#x27;s fixed, without any gunk left on my fingers! It&#x27;s great, but if you are looking for something that holds like a statue, this is not it. This is for natural look. (Used american crew before and thought that was perfect until I found this)</li>
            <li> I have 3 sons ages 23, 21 and 18 and they all swear by this product.  My 2nd son found it and the other 2 borrowed it and the rest is history.  So whenever, I have to order for 1 son,  I just order for all 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say it gives their hair body without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Dont order it says not approved by FDA my money is gone</li>
            <li> I have been using hair gels/waxes for almost 15 years of my life and have used almost any type of wax, pomenade, hair powder, gel you can think of; short sexy hair, ice spiker, american crew, big sexy hair, all the axe products, the dove waxes, the garnier waxes, the bed head stuff, and several others I can&#x27;t remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent anywhere from $7 to $30 for wax and I have never got the look I want, this product gives you a dry hair style that actually looks like bed head. I have got more compliments in the past several days of wearing this product than I ever have wearing any other product, needless to say I am sold for life and highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> My hair is 1-2 inches, extremely thick and I prefer the spiky look.  Over the past year, I have been in search of the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair creme/wax which provides the highest hold and a matte look.  In short, there are lots of options that function very differently.  To date, I have tried American Crew Fiber, D:fi D:sculpt, TIGI matte separation, Moving Rubber Spiky Edge, Moving Rubber Grunge Mat, Jonathan Dirt, Sticky Rice, TRENDStarter matte finishing wax and Eufora Hero.  All of these options are priced in the same range (per oz) but each have a unique set of pros and cons.  I&#x27;m still searching for the silver bullet (for my hair type and style).  For Grunge Mat, here&#x27;s the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the \\&quot;actual\\&quot; hold like?  Very good - better than Fiber.  The hold is also extremely consistent throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How easy is it to work into the hair?  Very easy.  Unlike other products, the color is grey.  The texture is very creamy and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How natural does the hair feel throughout the day?  Somewhat unnatural.  This product is in the middle regarding overall feel (relative to the other products).  It&#x27;s not as natural as Fiber but better than some of the cheaper options, like TIGI.  I believe that this con is inherent because of the super-strong hold that you get from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the hold consistent? Yes.  This particular product should last for 12+ hours before you see any loss in hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much do you need to get a decent hold?  Not much.  This product definitely gives you the biggest bang-for-your-buck regarding the amount you need to use to achieve a good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it wash out easily?  Not at all.  This is almost as bad as American Crew molding clay (which it comes time to wash your hair).  To be fair, it&#x27;s still not as bad as the worst but you may need to do 2 washes to fully-remove the product.  While I was ready to settle on this particular product (for my needs), I decided to keep experimenting because of this particular con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it smell? Waxy and floral.  The smell is slightly strong and definitely not preferable to many of the other options, like Dirt, Sticky Rice and Spiky Edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see my other reviews to compare against all of the above products.  Overall, this is a top contender.  If you can accept the challenges associated with washing this product out and a slightly sandy texture, you may find this to be the best option out there.  I don&#x27;t really prefer the smell but, on the other hand, it&#x27;s strong and very easy to work with.  Highly recommended.ting because of this particular con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it smell? Waxy and floral.

            <li> Tons of hold, love the matte finish.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised</li>
            <li> It feels like mousse after it goes on.  It&#x27;s more matte finish than the pink version (The pink has the strongest hold though). The purple is stronger too but the purple is shinier. I&#x27;ve been using the pink (spikey ) and this.  This leave more of a sticky grit to the hair.  I, however, like the grit because I have fine hair that I spike in a faux haw.  It has a slightly sticky feels on wet hair. It holds well but is VERY hard to wash out.  Again, the pink IS stronger hold but has a tiny bit more shine than the grey.  The grey is completely matte.</li>
            <li> I tried the Pink, Purple and Grey (this) one.  Out of the three, I like this one the best. It leaves a light residue that lets my hair pile messily on top without having too much of a sticky or hard residue. Wish I had this product before I spend money on Bed Head Tigi Manipulator for years.</li>
            <li> Amazing wax, I have the long hair to the side and this Gatsby hair wax does the job. The wind use to mess up my hair everytime I went out ofcourse wih no gel or anything on hair but I decided to use gel or spray but still my hair was moving all around then I found out about this on a korean drama episode.  Got a little curious about it and found it on Amazon.  It was worth my time and money.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Love the product..it&#x27;s great..Good price, its matte and it stays all day. ..Very good product, definitely would recommend it for short hair.</li>
            <li> Great Wax for short to medium hair, if not the BEST! Not oily at all. Provides the right amount of hold for my hair (black thick asian hair) and can be restyled various times on the go. Great for styling with a hair iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Story Time: I&#x27;ve used many types of hair wax and hair gels (American Crew, TIGI, Suave, Loreal, Redken, etc.) Once I tried this I never went back, it&#x27;s that good and if you style yourself right, you will get compliments about what type of hair wax you use! Hair styles I run with this are those asian hairstyles with layered and textured hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If you put too much, you might have to shampoo twice.</li>
            <li> I love how little of this you have to use and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film feeling to the hair. It stays soft, adds body and holds fairly well.</li>
            <li> Love works really well, i can mold my hair any way i want to, and it holds without the greasy look.</li>
            <li> just good , use comfortable,smell like green apple ,like it</li>
            <li> I loved it temporary, but it started to break me a out on my forehead. Since I spoke my hair up some of the residue goes on my forehead and i started to break out. I notice you can get this at your local ranch 99 grocery stores. They are about the same price as amazon.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 star because this is perfect for my type of hair. I have really thick, stubborn asian hair that is typically impossible to style with average products. But this stuff holds my hair super well (i use it for a quiff/pompadour) and it is very pliable. And i really love the matte look aswell. I recommend this product to all of you with hair like mine.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve used this for over 4 years, and have been very pleased with the results. This offers a very strong hold, that never gets hard or stiff, and doesn&#x27;t look sheen. It&#x27;s great for a &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; look, with a little more hold, and manipulation. Also, it smells like apples #truestory</li>
            <li> This hair wax targets individual hairs and has a very strong hold. Be careful not to use too much, because then it will be almost impossible to adjust after it has dried. This helps give a lot of texture to your hair, and keeps it in place. At first the product may make your hair look like you just put gell in it. Once it dries, however, it looks very natural, and really good. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to be able to style individual hairs while still maintaining that natural look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, you can easily do whatever style on your hair, not hard. Make messy hair look you like but hair looks no shine! Still very nice gatsby hair wax! I really enjoy it!</li>
            <li> Love it. works great. do not combine with a hairspray if you plan on not showering, yet adding more in the morning.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, goes in easy and gives great hold a matte texture. Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm. I have slightly curly and stiff hair and it did the job for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is weird...in a good way. I am a lady with have fine wavy hair, but I have lots of it. I got my hair cut off to a pixie style. Wanting to forgo the $28 product they offered at the salon, I sought out other options. This Grunge Mat is amazing. It smells like green apples, and it only takes a little bit (I touch two fingers to the surface of it and get the tiniest of smears, rub it around in both hands to warm it up, and apply it). It gives your hair the look of being disheveled/dirty in the cool way rather than being overly shiny/crusty and weighing your hair down. It holds all day for me. It also seems like it&#x27;ll last forever if you only use a little bit.</li>
            <li> Looks like it will be shiny and wet looking but it is what it says it is. Do put it in your hair while it is dry though otherwise your hair can get crunchy.</li>
