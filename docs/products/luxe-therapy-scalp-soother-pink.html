            <li> Goes to those sensitive areas on your scalp and feels fab.</li>
            <li> You can scratch your scalp without ruining your braid pattern and the tooth of the comb is long enough to reach any part of your scalp.</li>
            <li> I wish it would come in other colors soon</li>
            <li> I gave a 4 star cause the fingers are rough not smooth.</li>
            <li> Those who have weaves or wigs are truly missing out.  </li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> Rather than irritating it, I feel like I am massaging my scalp.</li>
            <li> I got really tired of patting my head trying to scatch that itch.  </li>
            <li> Kinda sorry to have purchased this cause</li>
            <li> I wish the price was cheaper, it was expensive just for a plastic comb.  </li>
            <li> No more head patting like a mad woman!</li>
            <li> and it drove me crazy.</li>
            <li> You gotta experience this; you will NOT be mad.</li>
            <li> OH my badness!!!!! This is the worst company to order from.</li>
            <li> however I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> Worst!</li>

            <li> Love it! I use it for my own hair, braids, and weave. It still has the same affect as if you were using your nails, so instead of patting or scratching my scalp I just pick up my comb. My family fights over who is going to use it for their scalp and they wear natural styles. Kudos to creator of this product.</li>
            <li> I gave a 4 star cause the fingers are rough not smooth.</li>
            <li> Works very well and I received the item very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the scalp soother!! It&#x27;s gentle on the scalp &amp; flexible.</li>
            <li> OH my badness!!!!! This is the worst company to order from. First of all the order was place a month ago today and it looks like I am not getting it until April 2nd WHAT!!! ????.... This is a plastic comb light as paper, and cost five dollars to ship.. I wish I had never placed the order..No customer service dept. No phone numbers to reach them on .THE Worst!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product. It truly soothes an itching scalp without irritation.</li>

            <li> This items is amazing.</li>
            <li> Fabulous. Goes to those sensitive areas on your scalp and feels fab. Bought one for my beautician. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Oooohhh! Listen....this Scalp Soother is THE best product ever made for relieving that &#x27;itch&#x27;! I just had to write a review because I think that this is the most ingenious product I&#x27;ve come across in a long time AND it feels so good...seriously!  Ladies, if you wear braid or weave hairstyles, I suggest that you invest in one (especially for only $9.99).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say ...the teeth on the Scalp Soother are actually sturdy but also flexible enough to get under your braids or weave to get to that &#x27;itch&#x27;.  And I was so excited to find out that it comes in PINK so I WILL BE purchasing another one!</li>
            <li> This item is a godsend!!!</li>
            <li> EVERY woman needs one of these... weave or not... it&#x27;s a great scratch! I use it daily! it gets right to the spot you need and curves perfectly with your scalp!</li>
            <li> The best invention ever made! It gets right to my scalp &amp; under my braids when I have a sew in weave</li>
            <li> The scalp soother is the absolute best.  Those who have weaves or wigs are truly missing out.  This comb goes right to the spot and doesn&#x27;t damage the hair.  I got really tired of patting my head trying to scatch that itch.  Thanks Luxe Therapy!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a must for weave wearers. Nothing that I have ever used gets under my weave like this!!! Don&#x27;t love the color but it feels do good I don&#x27;t even care!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I would recommend to my friends that wear protective styles. The quality is good. However it&#x27;s a little on the expensive side. Shipping should not be that much.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product at first, but it works perfectly. Gets underneath hair weave with ease. I also plan to keep using this no matter what hairstyle I&#x27;m wearing. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a good head scratching.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the product to do wonders... however I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> It worked to scratch my scalp when I had a weave.  I wish the price was cheaper, it was expensive just for a plastic comb.  But it took care of the job at hand.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works great! It wonders for those of us who wear hair weaves. You can scratch your scalp without ruining your braid pattern and the tooth of the comb is long enough to reach any part of your scalp. I am in heaven...</li>
            <li> Such a great product! Best invention for women who wear extensions! Gets every corner! I have already recommended it to several friends!</li>
            <li> I LOVE  the product  but beware if you order you may not receive it...</li>
            <li> This smoother is great when your head is itchy with braids and when you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> This scalp soother is great for someone who likes to massage their hair. It is also great for someone who has natural course hair.</li>

            <li> Ladies if you were weaves this product is for you. I have always had problemy getting under the tracks ot scratch my scalp and it drove me crazy. Well with the sc I am able to get under becasue the ss is curved and the tips are not sharp like a rat tail comb. It is heaven on earth and worth the money.</li>
            <li> This soother can be described in one word: AWESOME!! I&#x27;m sure with all the &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; it has to aid in cleaning the scalp during a shampoo with a sew in.</li>
            <li> This product did perfect for my weave. I could get in between the tracks and it felt marvelous while I was scratching.</li>
            <li> My clients enjoys this scalp  smoother. I wish it would come in other colors soon</li>
