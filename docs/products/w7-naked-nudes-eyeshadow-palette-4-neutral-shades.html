            <li>Im keeping them :)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It would be okay for a highlight color under eyebrows MAYBE</li>
            <li>There is pretty much no pigment in these shadows at all, they kind of suck for me</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t as dark as the picture shows but they are still great nude colors.</li>
            <li>This eye shadow goes on well and it coats applicators/brushes very good, unlike some powders that are hard.</li>
            <li>Delivery was a bit long but colors are great if you want the natural tones.</li>
            <li>T&#x27;was fast transaction/shipment!</li>
            <li>Love the pigmentation, W7 is definitely a go to brand for affordable usable makeup</li>
            <li>The reason I gave this a three star is because first of all I didnt even order this product, I put it in my wish list and yall charged me...</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow feels chalky and the colors are too light that they are pointless to wear, it&#x27;s literally like putting chalk on your eyelid.</li>
            <li>My only complaint about this palette is that I was hoping that these colors would be a little more saturated.</li>
