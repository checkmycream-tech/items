    <ol>
            <li>I was impressed and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Excellent !</li>
            <li>VERY* impressed with this product since,</li>
            <li>the best hair removal I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Everywhere else it was great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product</li>
            <li>while I said I was happy with my rear, I was not all too happy with the front.</li>
            <li>It worked great.  </li>
            <li>Very effective, I don&#x27;t have to redo it.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good and pain-free alternative to waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li>It worked good.  </li>
            <li>It smells not that good</li>
            <li>I just tried it today and have to say that I am very pleased with the results, it didn&#x27;t sting</li>
            <li>I will be the first to admit that I used this on my genitals lol, and it worked!</li>
            <li>My husband and I really love it!</li>
            <li>You put the cream on and then have to wait to take it off but still love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products but none have worked this well!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I must say that this product works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>10 minutes suggested) upon applying  my skin started to feel warm and by the time I&#x27;d gotten it all off my bikini area with the sponge that comes with it, I was noticeably burned.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that this works so well</li>
            <li>The best I have tried so far!</li>
            <li>It took some of the hair off, but most of it just kind of broke off close to the root, leaving me with a bit of hair poking out.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s saying something considering my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used this, I was not 100% happy with the product.</li>
            <li>this product does ok.</li>
            <li>most of the time.</li>
            <li>Love the price</li>
            <li>I feel like I achieve better results waxing.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it does what it is meant for.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to shave more than once a week.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love Veet&#x27;s hair remover cream over Nair anyway.  </li>
            <li>I think it works well on my under arms and even my top pubic area as well :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll admit it takes  2 attempts ,2 showers , most of the time  but still.</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>Still, for me, it was a lot better than shaving...</li>
            <li>You are better off with a shaver and shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Maybe the non-shower version works better.</li>
            <li>It does what it promises and much more.  </li>
            <li>Sure it removes some hair</li>
            <li>This is much better than paying for a arm wax in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to just shave.</li>
            <li>On top of that, this product never worked for me just applying it once</li>
            <li>It is a good buy at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>But this cream is not for strong hair cause not all its going out. :)</li>
            <li>so finally when I was done I got out of the shower expecting to see smooth flawless legs.</li>
            <li>Really good product, easy and fast!</li>
            <li>they do an ok job for waxing on your own and it lasts much longer!</li>
            <li>but I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Really smooth afterwards, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and affordable!&lt;br</li>
            <li>label,\\&quot; and said label, adorned with a swirly arrow with the word \\&quot;open\\&quot; does in fact come off easily.</li>
            <li>I like it, its easy to use.</li>
            <li>this is a huge gaffe.</li>
            <li>since honestly I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use my razor that much unless I run out of this.</li>
            <li>The hair came off smoothly with the foam pad in the shower too.</li>
            <li>I used it on my legs and underarms and it was simply fantastic.</li>
            <li>Leave you&#x27;re skin smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I felt comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for my butt, but also used it on my manly parts.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t arrive in a box, where one might expect the relevant instructions to be duplicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>People with fair sensitive skin must not use this.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper!!!</li>
            <li>Have fun, my wife is!</li>
            <li>First of all it smells better then</li>
            <li>but it did what the product states, it removes hair cleanly and painlessly.</li>
            <li>I just received it today from Amazon and was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li>(Quantity wise) and rather coarse in texture.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, the container seems to have a lot in it, and while that is true, you have to use a lot of this stuff for it to give you any results.</li>
            <li>I had to do this entire process twice in the front, and it still didn&#x27;t come out good.</li>
            <li>Love veet so much.</li>
            <li>After completely washing off though, I found my legs and arms very smooth and hair free.</li>
            <li>The bottle&#x27;s label states in bold type \\&quot;Follow the directions for use and the precautions indicated on the inside of this</li>
            <li>It was mostly effective, although I (as other reviews mention) found many ingrown hairs afterwards that I had to address.</li>
            <li>After about 8 minutes I went into the shower and the hair literally just wiped right off.</li>
            <li>Very fast too.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on Amy skin type.</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth, soft, and 100% hair free, and leaving it on for the extra time did not seem to bother my skin at all--no pain, irritation, redness, or anything like that.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised to do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it works better on the upper thigh area (and maybe bikini too)</li>
            <li>Oh and a week later and I&#x27;m all healed, but scarred with more hyperpigmentation than I had before using the product.</li>
            <li>The overall product is ok it removes some hair</li>
            <li>i guess its better for people who have a lot of hair or hair that is longer is doesn&#x27;t work well on short hairs.</li>
            <li>Well this was my first ever hair removal product I have tried</li>
            <li>I would assume that if you wanted to do your arms and legs, that it would all be gone after your first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I tried it, I followed exactly as directed on the bottle.</li>
            <li>If I left it on one more minute, I believe it would of got them all.</li>
            <li>Fairly effective and less smelly than Nair.</li>
            <li>They are dry though, so you need to make sure to apply lotion afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, for these types of products to work, you have to leave them on for around 10 minutes WHILE NOT IN THE SHOWER, very time consuming for hair removal, and during these 10 minutes your whole house will smell like this product, which just reeks of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t remove hair much and it was very patchy.</li>
            <li>i do like the veet ready to use wax strips.</li>
            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>but no matter how much I scrubbed to get the strands out their pore</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this product over and over.</li>
            <li>This really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>so I really have nothing to compare to.</li>
            <li>Your skin will be left feeling smooth for a couple days.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>And lets not forget that these products only keep your legs hair free for like a week.</li>
            <li>Because I was constantly doing this twice a day once a week, my legs became more sensitive and the product began causing me pain.</li>
            <li>I can say I am happy with the work it did on my butt, hairless and smooth as a baby, but very difficult to put on in a place like that by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, I read lots of reviews from other AA women who suffer the same results from shaving, but raved about this product being gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>With this particular bottle, the sponge is enclosed inside which makes application and removal a lot easier that the normal pump bottle with the spatula glued on.  </li>
            <li>After a few more days of using it tho</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking that it would be more gentle on the skin than other creams, such as men&#x27;s nair.</li>
            <li>Leaving a barely noticeable stubble texture, but otherwise really smooth, Had I left it on the recommended maximum time of ten minutes</li>
            <li>The texture of the hair was...very strange, almost kind of spongy, so it was very easy/painless to tweeze or even sometimes just rub the rest of the hair out, but that tended to take a little extra time.</li>
            <li>If you do have sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t advise getting this unless you can donate it to someone else if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>and it says sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I have very red, very bumpy skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li>My wife stated that this item made it easier to shave, but it leaves a very chemical smell and kf course ultimately did not replace shaving.</li>
            <li>I am really hoping this makes the hairs grow back thinner and lighter.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my skin is way too sensitive but leaving this on for more than a few seconds left my skin itching for hours.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t the worse smelling hair removal product I&#x27;ve tried but it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>Because the last time I used a depilatory was in probably the 1980s when I was a teenager in high school.</li>
            <li>Good luck, I used at least half the bottle and no results.</li>
            <li>I never touch my rear with any shaving products anymore because of fear of it growing back longer, so I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>but if you actually have sensitive skin then i would not use it!</li>
            <li>Either my physiology has changed drastically or else this product has been developed with a new formula (New &amp; Improved as they say) to the point where my constant battle with my Balkan and French ancestry hair has been finally conquered by Veet.</li>
            <li>At 1st I was confused about the directions since its the 1st product tht says &amp;#34;in-shower&amp;#34; bt got the hang of it pretty quick.</li>
            <li>as I stated earlier, the older depilatories I used when I was a teen in the 1980s never worked for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about other consumers, but this product absolutely did NOT work for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of French and Macedonian descent so my body hair is fine in individual strand sense, but I have so much it is thick</li>
            <li>cause i&#x27;ve been trimming it for a few years now, while hardly ever touching my rear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This product works really well.</li>
            <li> but no matter how much I scrubbed to get the strands out their pore</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this product over and over.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> so I really have nothing to compare to.</li>
            <li> Your skin will be left feeling smooth for a couple days.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> And lets not forget that these products only keep your legs hair free for like a week.</li>
            <li> Because I was constantly doing this twice a day once a week, my legs became more sensitive and the product began causing me pain.</li>
            <li> I can say I am happy with the work it did on my butt, hairless and smooth as a baby, but very difficult to put on in a place like that by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, I read lots of reviews from other AA women who suffer the same results from shaving, but raved about this product being gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> With this particular bottle, the sponge is enclosed inside which makes application and removal a lot easier that the normal pump bottle with the spatula glued on.  </li>
            <li> After a few more days of using it tho</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it would be more gentle on the skin than other creams, such as men&#x27;s nair.</li>
            <li> Leaving a barely noticeable stubble texture, but otherwise really smooth, Had I left it on the recommended maximum time of ten minutes</li>
            <li> The texture of the hair was...very strange, almost kind of spongy, so it was very easy/painless to tweeze or even sometimes just rub the rest of the hair out, but that tended to take a little extra time.</li>
            <li> If you do have sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t advise getting this unless you can donate it to someone else if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> Arrived early.</li>
            <li> and it says sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I have very red, very bumpy skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li> My wife stated that this item made it easier to shave, but it leaves a very chemical smell and kf course ultimately did not replace shaving.</li>
            <li> I am really hoping this makes the hairs grow back thinner and lighter.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my skin is way too sensitive but leaving this on for more than a few seconds left my skin itching for hours.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t the worse smelling hair removal product I&#x27;ve tried but it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> Because the last time I used a depilatory was in probably the 1980s when I was a teenager in high school.</li>
            <li> Good luck, I used at least half the bottle and no results.</li>
            <li> I never touch my rear with any shaving products anymore because of fear of it growing back longer, so I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> but if you actually have sensitive skin then i would not use it!</li>
            <li> Either my physiology has changed drastically or else this product has been developed with a new formula (New &amp; Improved as they say) to the point where my constant battle with my Balkan and French ancestry hair has been finally conquered by Veet.</li>
            <li> At 1st I was confused about the directions since its the 1st product tht says &amp;#34;in-shower&amp;#34; bt got the hang of it pretty quick.</li>
            <li> as I stated earlier, the older depilatories I used when I was a teen in the 1980s never worked for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other consumers, but this product absolutely did NOT work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of French and Macedonian descent so my body hair is fine in individual strand sense, but I have so much it is thick</li>
            <li> cause i&#x27;ve been trimming it for a few years now, while hardly ever touching my rear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> second time I applied it very thick, dry, and waited the full 10 minutes outside the shower before getting in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and I usually shave, but I decided to use this product, and I was a little apprehensive at first, where I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and perhaps someone else will stumble along wondering the same thing.only reason I bought this and perhaps someone else will stumble along wondering the same thing.</li>
            <li> and the little scrubber pad on top of it makes it worse</li>
            <li> &quot; - i followed the directions, and maybe my skin was just a little too sensitive!  </li>
            <li> Other than that I had no other problem with it.</li>
            <li> Having no experience in the matter, it is very hard for me to find the right product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once so far, but for having left it on for the least amount of wait time, it seems to do what it says it will.</li>
            <li> So I have really coarse black hair and this product removed maybe 10% properly.</li>
            <li> I only used it in the two spots I mentioned above, which is WAY less area than if I were to do my arms or legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple of applications, I decided to cross my fingers and leave it on for a little extra time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to shave now that I&#x27;m older and dealing with osteoporosis and osteoarthritis in my spine, hips and joints.</li>
            <li> Applied dry, timed and waited, then entered shower (taking care not to wash it all off) but found it was ZERO percent</li>
            <li> many other reviews I as well need to leave it on for the max time that&#x27;s only bad part.</li>
            <li> I used it on my bikini line, left it on for the maximum recommended time (10 minutes), and then washed it odd with the sponge.</li>
            <li> The sponge it came with is very harsh on my skin and left me red for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Still, I would recommend using this product if you don&#x27;t mind there being a little hair left.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after the first use because I expected for my underarm hair to scrub completely off and leave only my skin.</li>
            <li> The thing is that I&#x27;m almost out of it which is a shame for the money spent on</li>
            <li> so I recommend you take a wet wash cloth and wipe the veet off your skin.</li>
            <li> Did the job as expected</li>
            <li> The only area that I would go through this trouble to remove the hair this way is the bikini line.</li>
            <li> my skin is not sensitive and even using the product less than 10 min</li>
            <li> I applied it and it did nothing to my hair, so I never bought Nair again (or any other depilatory for that matter).</li>
            <li> noticed the sponge it comes with practically becomes useless after your first use.</li>
            <li> Not many hairs left on arm.  </li>
            <li> I probably have this problem just because my hair is so dark.</li>
            <li> where the hair is thinner but for thick leg hair it only removes some of it.</li>
            <li> I even left it on longer than 5 minutes like it directs knowing that my hair is thick</li>
            <li> I sat down in my office chair, my feet propped up to help me reach and apply this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used it down there</li>
            <li> Unlike other types of cream depilatories out there this one did not burn my skin!</li>
            <li> be very careful!</li>
            <li> It seemed to do half the trick</li>
            <li> It was so bad I had to leave work and go home to put an antibiotic ointment and a cool compress on the area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind just shaving off the little bits and pieces,</li>
            <li> It was a lot of work for little return.</li>
            <li> My hairs in the front are a little thicker,</li>
            <li> It does stink a little</li>
            <li> I probably would have got those few little stragglers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> But there is NOTHING written behind it -- either on the back of the label or on the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> A company that sloppy shouldn&#x27;t be encouraged with sales, and I&#x27;m apprehensive about even trying the product, but I&#x27;ll post back if I do.</li>
            <li> I did have a really bad reaction under my arm pits, it really hurt.</li>
            <li> As I was applying it, it was flying all over my bathroom floor since its so messy!</li>
            <li> I am an African American female with curly hair and when I shave, I suffer terrible ingrown hairs and hyperpigmentation on my bikini area and underarms.</li>
            <li> useless for Asian hair</li>
            <li> I usually have to leave it on for about 5minutes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to fully see the results when you&#x27;re in the shower</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t bad, my problem was that there were still a few left over hairs when I got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Then a slowly scrubbed it off.</li>
            <li> It hurt so bad that by midday I could barely walk.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product, but decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shaved my legs, and underarms, haven&#x27;t tried the bikini line yet, still a little afraid to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it does remove hair, but wont give you that spotless look unless your hairs are thin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn your skin like nair, but it does leave behind irritated skin and itchy rashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quicker, less painful, and not as smelly.</li>
            <li> Now, I went into this \\&quot;experiment in hair removal\\&quot; highly skeptical and expecting no results at all.</li>
            <li> no ingrown hairs, no razor burn, and I found it difficult to get all the hair with a razor anyways!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it irritated my skin so bad never again will I buy this</li>
            <li> the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as horribly bad as nair</li>
            <li> it was rather painful :(</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine having to use it on my legs, it would be worthless a 1/4 of the way in.</li>
            <li> hate to think what someone who buys this in a store might think or do, not having access to the precautions and instructions posted here on the product page here</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible doesn&#x27;t work well at all!!!</li>
            <li> This product smells horrible.</li>
            <li> Simply horrific experience.</li>
            <li> I like veet but the smell is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really good product, easy and fast!</li>
            <li> I always thought hair removal products give you cancer.  I met a woman that says she has been using veet for over 10 years.  I tried it and will never to back to a razor on my legs.  I have tried it on my underarm.  It is gental enough to put on the vaginal area but of course no where close to the opening.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my skin is way too sensitive but leaving this on for more than a few seconds left my skin itching for hours. If you do have sensitive skin, I wouldn&#x27;t advise getting this unless you can donate it to someone else if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other consumers, but this product absolutely did NOT work for me. Not even in the slightest.</li>
            <li> Arrived early. Didn&#x27;t remove hair much and it was very patchy. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> this product does ok. it does not last longer than shaving! its the same amount of time. id rather wax than use this stuff. and it says sensitive skin but if you actually have sensitive skin then i would not use it! my skin is not sensitive and even using the product less than 10 min i have irritation and burning. and the little scrubber pad on top of it makes it worse cus it burns when you do circular motions to rub the hair off. be very careful! im going back to shaving and waxing. i do like the veet ready to use wax strips. they do an ok job for waxing on your own and it lasts much longer!</li>
            <li> This stuff does not burn your skin.............most of the time. I did have a really bad reaction under my arm pits, it really hurt. Everywhere else it was great.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised to do and I&#x27;ve bought it multiple times.</li>
            <li> Love the price but I didnt expect the stick on the bottle to say Walgreens</li>
            <li> I have to leave it on loner than it says... Washes off in the shower. NOT for underarms.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible doesn&#x27;t work well at all!!! Save your money!</li>
            <li> I will be the first to admit that I used this on my genitals lol, and it worked! Unlike other types of cream depilatories out there this one did not burn my skin! The directions state to have it applied at a minimum for two minutes but no longer than ten. I had to let it sit for ten minutes but it did what the product states, it removes hair cleanly and painlessly. Have fun, my wife is!</li>
            <li> Fairly effective and less smelly than Nair.</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t bad, my problem was that there were still a few left over hairs when I got out of the shower. I left it on for the recommended time, washed it off and there were still some hairs here and there. I only have a few itchy spots which don&#x27;t really bother me. Still, I would recommend using this product if you don&#x27;t mind there being a little hair left. I don&#x27;t mind just shaving off the little bits and pieces, since honestly I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use my razor that much unless I run out of this. I&#x27;d buy this again though. I shaved my legs, and underarms, haven&#x27;t tried the bikini line yet, still a little afraid to.</li>
            <li> This product works really well. However, if you have thicker hair you might want to leave it on longer than they say too. I just tried it today and have to say that I am very pleased with the results, it didn&#x27;t sting/burn at all and I left it on for about 10 minutes. The hair came off smoothly with the foam pad in the shower too. I was impressed and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> i tried this product because it said that it was for \\&quot;legs and body\\&quot; - i followed the directions, and maybe my skin was just a little too sensitive!  it is now 3 days later and I have very red, very bumpy skin.  it was rather painful :( i would never use again!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after the first use because I expected for my underarm hair to scrub completely off and leave only my skin. Instead my hair kinda broke off and left stubble. After a few more days of using it tho my hair was gone. I probably have this problem just because my hair is so dark. Other than that I had no other problem with it.</li>
            <li> This product smells horrible. I just received it today from Amazon and was super excited to try it. I applied it all over my legs and upper thigh area thinking that this would solve all my problems and I&#x27;d never have to pay $60 for waxing again. As I was applying it, it was flying all over my bathroom floor since its so messy! Finally I managed to apply it all over. I waited about 5 minutes, which is even longer than they suggest. I got in the shower and waited until I hit 10 minutes and started to wash it off. It&#x27;s hard to fully see the results when you&#x27;re in the shower so finally when I was done I got out of the shower expecting to see smooth flawless legs. Instead there was still some hair!!  I&#x27;d say it works better on the upper thigh area (and maybe bikini too) where the hair is thinner but for thick leg hair it only removes some of it. It was a lot of work for little return. I feel like I achieve better results waxing.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does what it is meant for. It takes off all the unwanted hairs away. It is a good buy at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have been using veet for several years. I don&#x27;t have to shave more than once a week. Love it.</li>
            <li> Works great! My husband and I really love it!</li>
            <li> I am an African American female with curly hair and when I shave, I suffer terrible ingrown hairs and hyperpigmentation on my bikini area and underarms. So, I read lots of reviews from other AA women who suffer the same results from shaving, but raved about this product being gentle and effective. I decided to purchase and used on my bikini area. I followed the directions and used in shower for only 5 minutes (not even the max 10 minutes suggested) upon applying  my skin started to feel warm and by the time I&#x27;d gotten it all off my bikini area with the sponge that comes with it, I was noticeably burned. It hurt so bad that by midday I could barely walk. It felt like pins and needles sticking me everytime I moved and when I stood up after sitting a while, it felt like scabs were being ripped off. It was so bad I had to leave work and go home to put an antibiotic ointment and a cool compress on the area. NEVER AGAIN will that stuff touch my skin. Simply horrific experience. Oh and a week later and I&#x27;m all healed, but scarred with more hyperpigmentation than I had before using the product. There goes my wearing a white bikini on my upcoming beach vacation!</li>
            <li> I love Veet&#x27;s hair remover cream over Nair anyway.  With this particular bottle, the sponge is enclosed inside which makes application and removal a lot easier that the normal pump bottle with the spatula glued on.  I usually also shower and scrub myself pretty well before use.  I think it works well on my under arms and even my top pubic area as well :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all but this stuff burns!!! Stay away! (I did follow all of the instructions!)</li>
            <li> Excellent ! Recommended Buy !</li>
            <li> So I have really coarse black hair and this product removed maybe 10% properly. I even left it on longer than 5 minutes like it directs knowing that my hair is thick and it still didn&#x27;t work. I used it on my arms too which has a bit thinner hair and it removed maybe 30% of that, the rest looking crinkly. It seemed to do half the trick but no matter how much I scrubbed to get the strands out their pore I could t remove the crinkly hairs. Oh also this product smells no better than Nair which probably worked better for me in the past. Good luck, I used at least half the bottle and no results.</li>
            <li> Now, I went into this \\&quot;experiment in hair removal\\&quot; highly skeptical and expecting no results at all. Why? Because the last time I used a depilatory was in probably the 1980s when I was a teenager in high school. I think I used NAIR (I was a product of the \\&quot;we wear short shorts\\&quot; jingle generation. I applied it and it did nothing to my hair, so I never bought Nair again (or any other depilatory for that matter). I&#x27;m of French and Macedonian descent so my body hair is fine in individual strand sense, but I have so much it is thick (Quantity wise) and rather coarse in texture.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Veet Shower depilatory thinking I&#x27;d give it a try, It&#x27;s been about thirty years since I tried a depilatory. I was *amazed* at the results! I knew my hair was the \\&quot;stubborn\\&quot; type and that it grows like weeds and it&#x27;s hard to shave now that I&#x27;m older and dealing with osteoporosis and osteoarthritis in my spine, hips and joints. I sat down in my office chair, my feet propped up to help me reach and apply this product. After about 8 minutes I went into the shower and the hair literally just wiped right off. Leaving a barely noticeable stubble texture, but otherwise really smooth, Had I left it on the recommended maximum time of ten minutes I probably would have got those few little stragglers. I&#x27;m *VERY* impressed with this product since, as I stated earlier, the older depilatories I used when I was a teen in the 1980s never worked for me. Either my physiology has changed drastically or else this product has been developed with a new formula (New &amp; Improved as they say) to the point where my constant battle with my Balkan and French ancestry hair has been finally conquered by Veet. I will absolutely buy this product over and over. I used it on my legs and underarms and it was simply fantastic. Bravo veet, Bravo!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this in the shower only because I think it rinses sooner then it should but I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Really smooth afterwards, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and affordable!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used it down there and I&#x27;ll admit it takes  2 attempts ,2 showers , most of the time  but still. Way easier then shaving. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Like many other reviews I as well need to leave it on for the max time that&#x27;s only bad part. You put the cream on and then have to wait to take it off but still love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product the best hair removal I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Same with this it don&#x27;t not work eather it irritated my skin so bad never again will I buy this</li>
            <li> Works great! The best I have tried so far! Very effective, I don&#x27;t have to redo it. One time and you done. Leave you&#x27;re skin smooth and silky.  Very fast too.</li>
            <li> Works as promised.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> useless for Asian hair</li>
            <li> I felt comfortable using it. But this cream is not for strong hair cause not all its going out. :)</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t the worse smelling hair removal product I&#x27;ve tried but it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell good. The sponge it came with is very harsh on my skin and left me red for quite a while. The overall product is ok it removes some hair i guess its better for people who have a lot of hair or hair that is longer is doesn&#x27;t work well on short hairs.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;d feel my hair growing back the next day, and I only used it 3 times before the bottle ran out. DEFINITELY  would NOT recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> My wife stated that this item made it easier to shave, but it leaves a very chemical smell and kf course ultimately did not replace shaving. If you can stand the chemical oder it makes shwving easier.</li>
            <li> Well this was my first ever hair removal product I have tried so I really have nothing to compare to. I did not purchase this for my legs or arms or anything like that. I bought this primarily for my butt, but also used it on my manly parts. It does tell you not to do it, but I did anyway and there was 0 discomfort. I never touch my rear with any shaving products anymore because of fear of it growing back longer, so I wanted to try something new. I am really hoping this makes the hairs grow back thinner and lighter. I can say I am happy with the work it did on my butt, hairless and smooth as a baby, but very difficult to put on in a place like that by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the sponge it comes with practically becomes useless after your first use. I couldn&#x27;t imagine having to use it on my legs, it would be worthless a 1/4 of the way in. Also, the container seems to have a lot in it, and while that is true, you have to use a lot of this stuff for it to give you any results. I only used it in the two spots I mentioned above, which is WAY less area than if I were to do my arms or legs. The thing is that I&#x27;m almost out of it which is a shame for the money spent on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while I said I was happy with my rear, I was not all too happy with the front. I had to do this entire process twice in the front, and it still didn&#x27;t come out good. My hairs in the front are a little thicker, cause i&#x27;ve been trimming it for a few years now, while hardly ever touching my rear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it does remove hair, but wont give you that spotless look unless your hairs are thin. Having no experience in the matter, it is very hard for me to find the right product. This is definitely not something I want to buy again. I would assume that if you wanted to do your arms and legs, that it would all be gone after your first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than all these negatives i&#x27;ve pointed out, the product does work. If I remember, i&#x27;ll come back and write if the hairs are growing in thinner or not, because that&#x27;s the only reason I bought this and perhaps someone else will stumble along wondering the same thing.only reason I bought this and perhaps someone else will stumble along wondering the same thing.</li>
            <li> The bottle&#x27;s label states in bold type \\&quot;Follow the directions for use and the precautions indicated on the inside of this label,\\&quot; and said label, adorned with a swirly arrow with the word \\&quot;open\\&quot; does in fact come off easily. But there is NOTHING written behind it -- either on the back of the label or on the bottle itself. This product didn&#x27;t arrive in a box, where one might expect the relevant instructions to be duplicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to think what someone who buys this in a store might think or do, not having access to the precautions and instructions posted here on the product page here (illiterately presented in the each-word-capped format you might expect from a second-grader).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this is a huge gaffe. A company that sloppy shouldn&#x27;t be encouraged with sales, and I&#x27;m apprehensive about even trying the product, but I&#x27;ll post back if I do.</li>
            <li> First of all it smells better then Nair and it works just like Nair. The only issue I have is the sponge it comes with doesn&#x27;t get all the hair so I recommend you take a wet wash cloth and wipe the veet off your skin. Your skin will be left feeling smooth for a couple days.</li>
            <li> I used to shave my legs, and underarms but I would always bleed and get razor bumbs. I&#x27;ve tried so many products but none have worked this well! I&#x27;m definitely going to buy it agian. It leaves my skin soft and smooth. I love it!</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used this, I was not 100% happy with the product. I used it on my bikini line, left it on for the maximum recommended time (10 minutes), and then washed it odd with the sponge. It took some of the hair off, but most of it just kind of broke off close to the root, leaving me with a bit of hair poking out. The texture of the hair was...very strange, almost kind of spongy, so it was very easy/painless to tweeze or even sometimes just rub the rest of the hair out, but that tended to take a little extra time. Still, for me, it was a lot better than shaving...no ingrown hairs, no razor burn, and I found it difficult to get all the hair with a razor anyways!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of applications, I decided to cross my fingers and leave it on for a little extra time. I left it on for about 12-13 minutes this time, and it worked wonders. My skin is very smooth, soft, and 100% hair free, and leaving it on for the extra time did not seem to bother my skin at all--no pain, irritation, redness, or anything like that. I am thrilled that this works so well and I don&#x27;t have to deal with razor burn and ingrown hairs on my bikini line.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I like veet but the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> Would not repurchase! Some areas came out, the rest I had to go over with a razor which kinda defeats the purpose</li>
            <li> I like it, its easy to use. At 1st I was confused about the directions since its the 1st product tht says &amp;#34;in-shower&amp;#34; bt got the hang of it pretty quick. leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product but truth be told it just doesn&#x27;t work. You are better off with a shaver and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once so far, but for having left it on for the least amount of wait time, it seems to do what it says it will. I&#x27;m hoping that with waiting the longer time (as suggested) all hair will be gone.</li>
            <li> Did the job as expected</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this product, but decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it, I followed exactly as directed on the bottle. Applied dry, timed and waited, then entered shower (taking care not to wash it all off) but found it was ZERO percent effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I applied it very thick, dry, and waited the full 10 minutes outside the shower before getting in. Then a slowly scrubbed it off. It was mostly effective, although I (as other reviews mention) found many ingrown hairs afterwards that I had to address. After completely washing off though, I found my legs and arms very smooth and hair free. They are dry though, so you need to make sure to apply lotion afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effective, but not if you do it as intended. Maybe the non-shower version works better. Still, it&#x27;s a good and pain-free alternative to waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li> Made my hair grow faster. Not for face and private parts. People with fair sensitive skin must not use this.</li>
            <li> Love veet so much. It does what it promises and much more.  It is very gentle on Amy skin type.</li>
            <li> Hurt like hell! Took forever to actually get the hair off and even then it left some! That&#x27;s saying something considering my hair is very fine. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get all the hair off and it makes me somewhat dizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it would be more gentle on the skin than other creams, such as men&#x27;s nair. It doesn&#x27;t burn your skin like nair, but it does leave behind irritated skin and itchy rashes. Not only that, but it doesn&#x27;t even work. Sure it removes some hair but it only does a 60% job. There will be patches left all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as horribly bad as nair though so it gets 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Does the job! Used for my arms.  It worked great.  I left it on for the 5 minutes recommended time.  It worked good.  Not many hairs left on arm.  If I left it on one more minute, I believe it would of got them all. This is much better than paying for a arm wax in my opinion. Much cheaper!!! It does stink a little but i can deal with it for the savings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and I usually shave, but I decided to use this product, and I was a little apprehensive at first, where I have sensitive skin.  I must say that this product works amazingly.  I usually have to leave it on for about 5minutes longer then it says.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this from now on!</li>
            <li> does not work as it is supposed to! &amp;#62;&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to just shave. It&#x27;s quicker, less painful, and not as smelly. First of all, for these types of products to work, you have to leave them on for around 10 minutes WHILE NOT IN THE SHOWER, very time consuming for hair removal, and during these 10 minutes your whole house will smell like this product, which just reeks of chemicals. If you choose to use a towel to remove it, it will just add to the smell and make the smell last longer. On top of that, this product never worked for me just applying it once, I had to do two rounds of it every time, so double everything. And lets not forget that these products only keep your legs hair free for like a week. Because I was constantly doing this twice a day once a week, my legs became more sensitive and the product began causing me pain. So, save your time and just shave. The only area that I would go through this trouble to remove the hair this way is the bikini line.</li>
            <li> It smells not that good</li>
