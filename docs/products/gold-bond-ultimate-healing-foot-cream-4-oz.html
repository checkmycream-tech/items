            <li>Gold Bond is great.  </li>
            <li>Great to have by your bed on the nightstand.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>I do a lot of walking on the treadmill, or should, and it&#x27;s great to have this around to soften my feet.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is very effective.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how successful this treatment was.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and this has made a huge difference with the dryness of my feet.  </li>
            <li>Every foot cream, even prescription and not as good as this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a softening foot lotion that smells good.</li>
            <li>good quality, this is a reorder</li>
            <li>And honestly, anything that can help alleviate the pain of cracking heels is a winner in my book.     </li>
            <li>It is totally my own fault, as I should have read the size description, rather than relying on my perception of the picture.</li>
            <li>This really does an excellent job at softening feet.</li>
            <li>I liked it.  </li>
            <li>and she liked it alsol</li>
            <li>The container is a handy size and handy to use.</li>
            <li>The kind that cracks and bleeds during the winter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, softens the skin on your feet, and has a pleasant, light scent.</li>
            <li>I recommended it to my mom, who bought it for her feet but then ended up using it as a hand cream too, and it&#x27;s become her favorite hand cream.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than corn huskers lotion which is what I&#x27;ve always used before.</li>
            <li>Works well to hydrate and my feet feel so much better.</li>
            <li>OK, NOT MY FAVORITE FOOT CREAM AFTER ALL.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure will vanish entirely if I&#x27;m able to keep up the routine.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even remember to apply it every day but still my feet are in better health than ever.</li>
            <li>so now I will be more diligent on using it.</li>
            <li>Many cracks had shrunk and my feet felt good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using their body lotion works much better than this foot lotion does.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>the best I&#x27;ve tried for dry feet.</li>
            <li>the best foot cream there is for dry cracked feet.  </li>
            <li>When I woke up - my cracked, scaly, dry and itchy feet were feeling great!  </li>
            <li>Not only does it make my feet feel softer, but gives them a nice scent and great appeal.</li>
            <li>This product was great, results after the fist application, and it only gets better after that.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s fast absorbing and that it&#x27;s a light cream with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>tried this Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Therapy Cream because I&#x27;d read that the urea ingredient is a great skin softener (I think this cream has 10% urea?).  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s important to me as I don&#x27;t just use it on my feet.  </li>
            <li>The product works great, however the picture in the ad shows two tubes and only one is sold.</li>
            <li>Take it from me because my feet look absolutely hidious, until I get a pedicure and put this stuff on them....!!!</li>
            <li>If your feet get dry in the winter, or any time of year, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>they probably did it to avoid the spills, but the tape they used would not come off clean.</li>
            <li>The delivery service was quick.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write reviews unless I find an outstanding product - and this is.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I have to use both this nice, light, moisturizing cream with another thicker cream to really allow the product a chance to actually heal the damage.</li>
            <li>Way better than Mama&#x27;s old stand by, Vasaline.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Once my feet became as good as new, I stopped using it, and after about 2 weeks I had the same problems again</li>
            <li>This is a great hand cream too, as I had rough dry cuticles and dry itchy patches on my hands from handwashing, and this foot cream works great for those issues.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smell like old medicine creams.</li>
            <li>My feet feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>With this product, for the first time I notice an ongoing, long-term difference.</li>
            <li>the first application.</li>
            <li>and already I can notice some positive changes, I would buy this product again</li>
            <li>I still love this stuff &amp; use it every day to keep my feet from getting totally dry in this crappy weather we&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>You know, I really want to rave about this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>It really does heal any cracked skin.</li>
            <li>It is soothing, it really heals all the mini splints and sore spots on my feet.</li>
            <li>The cracking and peeling are all but gone and my feet feel so smooth that I even massage them only to feel my feet as I have not felt them this way in years!  </li>
            <li>It really keeps moisture in the feet for a whole day.</li>
            <li>I put on as much as my feet would absorb.  </li>
            <li>Cream really works.</li>
            <li>I really like Gold bond body lotion.  </li>
            <li>And it really soothes my skin - esp around my knuckles.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t use much at a time and things stay moist all day.</li>
            <li>Very misleading.</li>
            <li>, my sunless tanner works much more evenly now and my skin is soft (AND moisturized, double bonus!).  </li>
            <li>This is OK, but not worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>everything returns to normal.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily - esp if your hands are a little damp.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, not messy.</li>
            <li>It was the last thing on the list, so hopefully the product does not contain too much of that substance.</li>
            <li>The cream isn&#x27;t greasy, my hands are also soft from applying to  my feet.</li>
            <li>for the price, this is best.&lt;br /&gt;And almost as good as the ones which are 4 times as expensive.</li>
            <li>I also used a shaver for feet, specially designed to remove dead skin.</li>
            <li>However, after only about 5 days my feet were like new.</li>
            <li>It IS moisturizing and all that, but the problem I&#x27;ve had is that it really doesn&#x27;t help my feet stay moisturized for very long.</li>
            <li>However, it hydrates my feet really well and softens some of the heavier dry skin accumulations around my heels and toes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A little over a week later, after following the same procedure, my feet are significantly better.  </li>
            <li>Since using it, it has completely and totally revitalized my feet.  </li>
            <li>However, when I opened our Amazon shipment, I was surprised that only one tube was included.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do anything for me that other lotions or Vaseline doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>The dry, cracking feet are almost back to 100% with just a couple of areas that aren&#x27;t completely healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my feet a little bit softer, but nothing really noticeable.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very quicky but I was not happy to see large tape on the cap...</li>

            <li> The product arrived very quicky but I was not happy to see large tape on the cap...</li>
            <li> The Foot Therapy Cream is a little more expensive and feels a little sticker, at first, than the Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Cream.</li>
            <li> I was seriously about to cry that first day at work when I had applied only this cream to my feet in the morning--</li>
            <li> However, despite trying almost everything out there for dry, cracked heels, this product falls slightly short.</li>
            <li> and I\\&quot;m on my feet a lot) before I can feel my dry heels starting to re-crack.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s slightly helped.</li>
            <li> I put it on several times during the day when the air is dry.</li>
            <li> It last all day and my heels don&#x27;t look dry.</li>
            <li> My feet are already soft, but due to rough, barefoot dance practices</li>
            <li> I have very rough heels with cracks so deep that they occasionally bleed.  </li>
            <li> With other foot lotions, I feel like I constantly have issues with dry heels/feet (especially in the winter) except for when I&#x27;m applying the lotion.</li>
            <li> The fact that I also have to use two products to get only a minimal amount of comfort is also a factor in my rating.</li>
            <li> And heck, maybe in the long run, it might over time work a miracle for me too.</li>
            <li> I had rough skin on the bottom of my feet, my big toe \\&quot;knuckles\\&quot;, my elbows, and my hands.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I used sports shoes for a long time my feet feel itchy and sore.</li>
            <li> My feet are soft and I have few if any callouses although I go barefoot all summer.</li>
            <li> you use this and let it soak-in for a while/overnight, be CAREFUL when next taking a bath or shower, the bottoms of your feet may be slippery!</li>
            <li> this is the only one that has smoothed the rough skin in 2-3 days of use.love it!</li>
            <li> Then she recommended it to my dad, who has dry itchy skin on his lower legs</li>
            <li> No longer are my feet dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic with dry skin issues and have to keep my feet moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Works well on my dry cracking feet.</li>
            <li> That definitely knocked its rating down in my book.</li>
            <li> Has done wonders for my rough dry feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very dry heels,to the extent that the cracks hurt while walking..</li>
            <li> I used aquaphor vaseline and other feet creams but nothing helped my feet from getting cracked skin and from being dry.</li>
            <li> recently they became a little rough.</li>
            <li> Because I use bottled sunless tanner, those rough areas would grab onto the sunless tanner and be way darker than everywhere else on my body.  </li>
            <li> order carefully and read the text - don&#x27;t rely on pictures when ordering this product.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of applying this cream before bed and wearing socks to sleep, my cracks are much less deep</li>
            <li> I recently, (within the past 6 mos.) became diabetic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get how other people like the scent.</li>
            <li> I have Diabetis and am very careful with my feet.</li>
            <li> No more dry, rough soles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried a lot of other lotions and creams (Vaseline creams, Neutrogena thick hand cream, Aveeno daily moisturizing lotion, 100% shea butter, Lubriderm, etc), even slathering the stuff on and putting on socks, but my skin would not soften.  </li>
            <li> Have had dry, cracked skin on the bottom seasonally for a couple of years, usually mid-summer and mid-winter (in the North-East of the country).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As much as I hate thick creams, they really give my feet long lasting protection against the inevitable dryness that will undoubtedly occur.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got itchy, scaly feet, try it for a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just found about this product a few weeks ago and for me it seems to help a lot  </li>
            <li> I put this on with some little cotton socks and voila!</li>
            <li> My feet were very dry, cracked badly, and even had some cracks that were severe enough to bleed.</li>
            <li> But maybe for other people without such bad problems, this stuff might work miracles.</li>
            <li> skin is now hydrated, soft and no longer painful.  </li>
            <li> Sticky, thick, doesn&#x27;t absorb well.</li>
            <li> It might moisturize well, but I had to stop using it because it was so thick.</li>
            <li> You need to use it several days in a row and it will repair some nasty dry feet.</li>
            <li> he brought up the topic without me asking, which is saying a lot coming from my tough non-foo-foo</li>
            <li> that gets worse in the winter, working outdoors, even despite him using Jergens lotion on his legs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy about the paraben listed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This does the job as well as expensive diabetic creams.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I hate that I can smell in on my hands after I rub it over my feet at night.</li>
            <li> Now I have a sticky nasty bottle</li>
            <li> I think it smells terrible</li>
            <li> I have terrible neuropathy in my feet that causes severe calluses and splits in the skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> for the price, this is best.&lt;br /&gt;And almost as good as the ones which are 4 times as expensive.</li>
            <li> You know, I really want to rave about this stuff. I love that it&#x27;s fast absorbing and that it&#x27;s a light cream with a pleasant smell. I really do. However, despite trying almost everything out there for dry, cracked heels, this product falls slightly short. Yes, it worked for me to an extent. It IS moisturizing and all that, but the problem I&#x27;ve had is that it really doesn&#x27;t help my feet stay moisturized for very long. I have maybe an hour or two (and I\\&quot;m on my feet a lot) before I can feel my dry heels starting to re-crack. As much as I hate thick creams, they really give my feet long lasting protection against the inevitable dryness that will undoubtedly occur. I&#x27;ve found that I have to use both this nice, light, moisturizing cream with another thicker cream to really allow the product a chance to actually heal the damage. So far, it&#x27;s slightly helped. And honestly, anything that can help alleviate the pain of cracking heels is a winner in my book.     If I could give this product 3.5 stars, I would. I was seriously about to cry that first day at work when I had applied only this cream to my feet in the morning--after only 2 hours, it was like I had done nothing to my feet. That definitely knocked its rating down in my book. The fact that I also have to use two products to get only a minimal amount of comfort is also a factor in my rating. But maybe for other people without such bad problems, this stuff might work miracles. And heck, maybe in the long run, it might over time work a miracle for me too. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and hope that I&#x27;ll get some relief soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent foot cream. It really does heal any cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and this has made a huge difference with the dryness of my feet.  Would purchase this again.  The delivery service was quick.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome after a pedicure. Not only does it make my feet feel softer, but gives them a nice scent and great appeal. Take it from me because my feet look absolutely hidious, until I get a pedicure and put this stuff on them....!!!</li>
            <li> This product was great, results after the fist application, and it only gets better after that. Arrived on time, not messy. I put this on with some little cotton socks and voila! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Gold Bond is great.  Way better than Mama&#x27;s old stand by, Vasaline.  Not only treats your feet but your hands as well.  Works 1st treatment.  Great to have by your bed on the nightstand.</li>
            <li> I had rough skin on the bottom of my feet, my big toe \\&quot;knuckles\\&quot;, my elbows, and my hands.  Because I use bottled sunless tanner, those rough areas would grab onto the sunless tanner and be way darker than everywhere else on my body.  I&#x27;d tried a lot of other lotions and creams (Vaseline creams, Neutrogena thick hand cream, Aveeno daily moisturizing lotion, 100% shea butter, Lubriderm, etc), even slathering the stuff on and putting on socks, but my skin would not soften.  I did some reading on ingredients, and those lotions &amp; creams were moisturizing my skin but they couldn&#x27;t soften it.  They&#x27;re two different things to me, moisturizing is not the same as softening.  I needed softening for those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Therapy Cream because I&#x27;d read that the urea ingredient is a great skin softener (I think this cream has 10% urea?).  It works great, my sunless tanner works much more evenly now and my skin is soft (AND moisturized, double bonus!).  This is a great hand cream too, as I had rough dry cuticles and dry itchy patches on my hands from handwashing, and this foot cream works great for those issues.  I recommended it to my mom, who bought it for her feet but then ended up using it as a hand cream too, and it&#x27;s become her favorite hand cream.  Then she recommended it to my dad, who has dry itchy skin on his lower legs (I inherited this from my dad too) that gets worse in the winter, working outdoors, even despite him using Jergens lotion on his legs.  So he started using this Gold Bond Ultimate Healing foot cream on his legs and it worked so well that the next time he saw me, he mentioned how well this cream I&#x27;d recommended worked... he brought up the topic without me asking, which is saying a lot coming from my tough non-foo-foo dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this foot cream isn&#x27;t greasy or tacky, that&#x27;s important to me as I don&#x27;t just use it on my feet.  I use it every day after drying off from my shower.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, smooths chapped heels. I&#x27;m not happy about the paraben listed in the ingredients. It was the last thing on the list, so hopefully the product does not contain too much of that substance.</li>
            <li> Sticky, thick, doesn&#x27;t absorb well. It might moisturize well, but I had to stop using it because it was so thick.</li>
            <li> Whenever I used sports shoes for a long time my feet feel itchy and sore. As soon as I apply this cream everything returns to normal. It is soothing, it really heals all the mini splints and sore spots on my feet. It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t smell like old medicine creams. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It is totally my own fault, as I should have read the size description, rather than relying on my perception of the picture. I thought I was buying the large-size tube, but it was only the 4 oz one. I still love this stuff &amp; use it every day to keep my feet from getting totally dry in this crappy weather we&#x27;ve had. Next time I&#x27;ll look for the larger tube, though. It doesn&#x27;t smell any different than the regular Gold Bond Lotion, though.</li>
            <li> This really does an excellent job at softening feet. It&#x27;s even better than corn huskers lotion which is what I&#x27;ve always used before.</li>
            <li> Great foot lotion! My feet feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have Diabetis and am very careful with my feet. This  foot cream works excellent on my feet. No longer are my feet dry and flaky. Works well to hydrate and my feet feel so much better.</li>
            <li> Every foot cream, even prescription and not as good as this stuff.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my feet for about a week... the difference is night into day!  My feet have been for years cracked, peeling and clammy.  Since using it, it has completely and totally revitalized my feet.  The cracking and peeling are all but gone and my feet feel so smooth that I even massage them only to feel my feet as I have not felt them this way in years!  I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every day for several months, and my feet thank me.  No more dry, rough soles.  Don&#x27;t want to ever be without it, the best I&#x27;ve tried for dry feet.</li>
            <li> OK, NOT MY FAVORITE FOOT CREAM AFTER ALL.</li>
            <li> I liked it.  It works well on my feet.  I let my friend try it and she liked it alsol</li>
            <li> I had cracked heels and now I don&#x27;t. My feet are soft and I have few if any callouses although I go barefoot all summer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write reviews unless I find an outstanding product - and this is.  I have very rough heels with cracks so deep that they occasionally bleed.  After a few days of applying this cream before bed and wearing socks to sleep, my cracks are much less deep and I&#x27;m sure will vanish entirely if I&#x27;m able to keep up the routine.  Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> With other foot lotions, I feel like I constantly have issues with dry heels/feet (especially in the winter) except for when I&#x27;m applying the lotion. With this product, for the first time I notice an ongoing, long-term difference. I don&#x27;t even remember to apply it every day but still my feet are in better health than ever. After just a couple days of use I was impressed with the difference. For under $10, anyone looking for a foot cream should DEFINITELY give this one a try!</li>
            <li> If your feet get dry in the winter, or any time of year, this is a great product. It&#x27;s not greasy, softens the skin on your feet, and has a pleasant, light scent. It is very effective. The container is a handy size and handy to use. I do a lot of walking on the treadmill, or should, and it&#x27;s great to have this around to soften my feet. I put it on several times during the day when the air is dry.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quicky but I was not happy to see large tape on the cap...they probably did it to avoid the spills, but the tape they used would not come off clean. Now I have a sticky nasty bottle and I don&#x27;t like using it.</li>
            <li> the best foot cream there is for dry cracked feet.  I use it daily.  I am a diabetic with dry skin issues and have to keep my feet moisturized.  This does the job as well as expensive diabetic creams.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD FOR MY FEET.</li>
            <li> I have been having problems with my feet for two years maybe. I used aquaphor vaseline and other feet creams but nothing helped my feet from getting cracked skin and from being dry. When I picked this up at walmart I didn&#x27;t expect it to do anything different. However, after only about 5 days my feet were like new. I also used a shaver for feet, specially designed to remove dead skin. SO I think it was a combination of both things. I couldn&#x27;t believe how successful this treatment was. But I have to warn people who have problem feet: you have to use it every day. Once my feet became as good as new, I stopped using it, and after about 2 weeks I had the same problems again so now I will be more diligent on using it. I would highly recommend this. It really keeps moisture in the feet for a whole day.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything for me that other lotions or Vaseline doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> The Foot Therapy Cream is a little more expensive and feels a little sticker, at first, than the Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Cream. However, it hydrates my feet really well and softens some of the heavier dry skin accumulations around my heels and toes. I periodically use this as an alternative to the Ultimate Healing Skin Therapy Cream, perhaps once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I recently, (within the past 6 mos.) became diabetic.&lt;br /&gt;So my feet need extra care. This seems to do the trick. Although not advertised for that purpose, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it!</li>
            <li> Have had dry, cracked skin on the bottom seasonally for a couple of years, usually mid-summer and mid-winter (in the North-East of the country).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the first application. I put on as much as my feet would absorb.  Then I waited about 30 minutes, re-applied and put socks on for the night.  When I woke up - my cracked, scaly, dry and itchy feet were feeling great!  Many cracks had shrunk and my feet felt good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little over a week later, after following the same procedure, my feet are significantly better.  The dry, cracking feet are almost back to 100% with just a couple of areas that aren&#x27;t completely healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is now hydrated, soft and no longer painful.  Great product!  If you&#x27;ve got itchy, scaly feet, try it for a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*CAUTION*&lt;br /&gt;When you use this and let it soak-in for a while/overnight, be CAREFUL when next taking a bath or shower, the bottoms of your feet may be slippery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very dry heels,to the extent that the cracks hurt while walking..this is the only one that has smoothed the rough skin in 2-3 days of use.love it!</li>
            <li> Works well on my dry cracking feet. Best product I have found yet for the price.</li>
            <li> Kinda wish I didn&#x27;t buy this product. My feet are already soft, but due to rough, barefoot dance practices recently they became a little rough. I bought this on a whim at the store and I don&#x27;t like it. It made my feet a little bit softer, but nothing really noticeable. That might be an issue on my part because this isn&#x27;t a softening lotion, but a healing one. So I probably need another lotion entirely, in which case that&#x27;s my fault. But my biggest issue with this product is the scent. It reeks. I don&#x27;t get how other people like the scent. I think it smells terrible and I hate that I can smell in on my hands after I rub it over my feet at night. I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a softening foot lotion that smells good.</li>
            <li> Cream really works. Has done wonders for my rough dry feet. Removes calluses. The cream isn&#x27;t greasy, my hands are also soft from applying to  my feet.</li>
            <li> I really like Gold bond body lotion.  This is OK, but not worth the money.  Using their body lotion works much better than this foot lotion does.  I&#x27;ll keep using the body lotion on my feet.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended me to try this on my cracked heels. I use this twice a day, after showers and before bed. It last all day and my heels don&#x27;t look dry. Use it on my hands too, feels great.&lt;br /&gt;I too, recommend Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Therapy Cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I would purchase it again and referr others to this product.  Everyone should try it.</li>
            <li> just found about this product a few weeks ago and for me it seems to help a lot  I try to use it every day only been using for about 2 weeks and already I can notice some positive changes, I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin. The kind that cracks and bleeds during the winter. With a newborn at home, I am constantly having to wash my hands. This product is a life saver for me. It goes on easily - esp if your hands are a little damp. And it really soothes my skin - esp around my knuckles. LOVE this. I use it on both my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  You need to use it several days in a row and it will repair some nasty dry feet.</li>
            <li> I have terrible neuropathy in my feet that causes severe calluses and splits in the skin. My podiatrist told me to use this and it has worked well. $10 seems like a lot for a 4oz tube, but it&#x27;s a dimethicone (so?) cream so you don&#x27;t use much at a time and things stay moist all day. Also helps heal the cracks on your feet so they don&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> The product works great, however the picture in the ad shows two tubes and only one is sold. Very misleading.</li>
            <li> good quality, this is a reorder</li>
            <li> We have not yet used this cream.  I can&#x27;t comment on the product itself. However, when I opened our Amazon shipment, I was surprised that only one tube was included. the photo used for the product listing shows two tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving the shipment, I went back to the listing to see why there were not two tubes in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the listing&#x27;s photos at the time it was ordered. These images show two tubes (in case they are later replaced with the proper single-tube image):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u5d-1alNL.jpg&lt;br /&gt;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u5d-1alNL._SS40_.jpg&lt;br /&gt;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51u5d-1alNL._SY355_.jpg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but nowhere in the text does it say two tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just order carefully and read the text - don&#x27;t rely on pictures when ordering this product.  You will only receive one tube despite what the picture shows.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. My feet were very dry, cracked badly, and even had some cracks that were severe enough to bleed. I apply this once each day and my feet are in great shape!</li>
