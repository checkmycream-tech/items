            <li>The cinnamon tastes great</li>

            <li>Best of all I feel better on days when I rinse.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that I tried this product.</li>
            <li>This is great for first time oil-pullers... like me!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, nice taste.</li>
            <li>I prefer to be able to taste my morning coffee and pass on the clove flavored spit for the majority of my day.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Besides better breath it takes away tartar.</li>
            <li>I love the cinnamon taste as I swish around my mouth.</li>
            <li>I decided to try oil pulling after  looking for alternatives for better dental health.</li>
            <li>Ordered the cinnamon, and really enjoyed both the flavor and the mouth feel.</li>
            <li>Really love the cinnamon flavor.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this better oil, and thank goodness</li>
            <li>(wow, it tastes good!</li>
            <li>Other than that, great!</li>
            <li>I love the taste &amp; my mouth feels so clean...</li>
            <li>It has a nice cinnamon taste and works very well.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I felt the flavor of clove was too strong and the oil to sweet for my preference.</li>
            <li>Makes the mouth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>The product does work it will leave your mouth clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and  found it to be right!</li>
            <li>The service was great (bought on Amazon Prime, never a complaint on that thus far) and</li>
            <li>Great for first people just starting pulling practice.</li>
            <li>The cinnamon flavor distracts me from having a mouth full of oil.</li>
            <li>Like cinnamon candy, but not as sweet).</li>
            <li>My mouth feels extremely clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li>Canker sores heal quickly, too.</li>
            <li>It makes for a better brushing experience but the oil can get kind of messy at times.</li>
            <li>Also order the mint but the mint doesn&#x27;t hide the oil flavor or leave my mouth feeling as fresh.</li>
            <li>Trying oral pulling for the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and be sure to spit the oil into the trash or toilet.</li>
            <li>It actually inflamed that whole side of my gums, and brushing, even lightly, felt like fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My whole office really loves this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Going to reorder AGAIN, since I really did like the cinnamon a lot.</li>
            <li>So much better that trying to pull with plain, unflavored coconut oil.</li>
            <li>so far I pull for about 5 minutes per day.</li>
            <li>I was not sure if oil pulling really is useful, but this one just took my oral hygiene to another level!</li>

            <li> Just be careful you don&#x27;t stain anything.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say, where the cinnamon is refreshing, even invigorating, the mint is... flat, tepid, has almost no flavor except for the base oil.</li>

            <li> I have less tartar build up at night.</li>
            <li> I had an aching pain in a tooth, and after brushing and rinsing with the Rinse after a few days the pain went away.</li>
            <li> The taste is not strong,</li>
            <li> Seems as though the formula changed a few months ago, doesn&#x27;t get as thick from swishing.</li>
            <li> No more swelling, no more infection, no more PAIN.</li>
            <li> Holy crap, this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> coincidentally had purchased this oil for my husband, who has a broken tooth.</li>
            <li> Weird to me that this stuff works as well as it does.</li>
            <li> Sadly, they shipped me the MINT flavor by mistake, and I didn&#x27;t realize what had happened until I opened it and used it.</li>
            <li> but I dont think my oral heath is bad</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been oil pulling for over a year. I have used coconut oil, i have used seaseme oil, and i have used ayurvedic oil combinations. I personally did not like the flavor of this one. I felt the flavor of clove was too strong and the oil to sweet for my preference. Also, this left a somewhat numbing feeling in my mouth, where other blends have not. I prefer to be able to taste my morning coffee and pass on the clove flavored spit for the majority of my day. The service was great (bought on Amazon Prime, never a complaint on that thus far) and price comparison is spot on with other blends. The two star is due to personal preference, I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> My whole office really loves this product. The cinnamon tastes great and I look forward to using it each day. FYI, the mint flavor is not palatable at all. Go for the cinnamon &amp; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So much better that trying to pull with plain, unflavored coconut oil. I could never adjust to the taste of coconut oil. The cinnamon flavor of this oil is very pleasant and I actually look forward to oil pulling now!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It has a nice cinnamon taste and works very well. Great for first people just starting pulling practice.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if oil pulling really is useful, but this one just took my oral hygiene to another level!</li>
            <li> tastes like cinnamon. Not really sure if its vastly improving my oral health, but I dont think my oral heath is bad</li>
            <li> I am very delighted to say I tried the Ayurvedic Oral Pulling Rinse by Dale Audrey. I had an aching pain in a tooth, and after brushing and rinsing with the Rinse after a few days the pain went away. I am very pleased that I tried this product. I plan on keeping this as a must have for my daily Dental needs.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice taste.</li>
            <li> My husband I both use this we are on our second bottle of cinnamon.  Love it.  Makes the mouth feel clean.  I have read a lot of information on this and  found it to be right!</li>
            <li> Weird to me that this stuff works as well as it does. Besides better breath it takes away tartar. Canker sores heal quickly, too. Best of all I feel better on days when I rinse. Seems as though the formula changed a few months ago, doesn&#x27;t get as thick from swishing.</li>
            <li> I love the cinnamon taste as I swish around my mouth. I decided to try oil pulling after  looking for alternatives for better dental health. My medication that I have to take kind of ruins the enamel; and I was awful of treating Dr. Peppers and not taking care of my pearly whites when I had braces in my teen years.&lt;br /&gt;  I am on my second week  and my teeth do look whiter.</li>
            <li> Burned everything inside my mouth! That may be what it is supposed to do but no ... I will find another way to whiten my teeth.. This will not be it!</li>
            <li> U just started using this but so far so good. I love the taste &amp; my mouth feels so clean...so far I pull for about 5 minutes per day. I use it before bed...</li>
            <li> Ordered the cinnamon, and really enjoyed both the flavor and the mouth feel. Thought it was a really great product, so I ordered it again. Sadly, they shipped me the MINT flavor by mistake, and I didn&#x27;t realize what had happened until I opened it and used it. Let&#x27;s just say, where the cinnamon is refreshing, even invigorating, the mint is... flat, tepid, has almost no flavor except for the base oil. Blech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to reorder AGAIN, since I really did like the cinnamon a lot. Let&#x27;s just hope this time the shipping team doesn&#x27;t swap me out with the mint again.</li>
            <li> Trying oral pulling for the first time. Really love the cinnamon flavor. My mouth feels extremely clean and fresh after using. Also order the mint but the mint doesn&#x27;t hide the oil flavor or leave my mouth feeling as fresh.</li>
            <li> This is great for first time oil-pullers... like me! The cinnamon flavor distracts me from having a mouth full of oil. Small issue, the cinnamon is so strong that the roof of my mouth goes numb a bit. Other than that, great!</li>
            <li> Holy crap, this stuff really works. My wisdom tooth is coming in on the upper right quadrant of my mouth, and it&#x27;s so painful. It actually inflamed that whole side of my gums, and brushing, even lightly, felt like fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I coincidentally had purchased this oil for my husband, who has a broken tooth. I swished with this oil for about four minutes (wow, it tastes good! Like cinnamon candy, but not as sweet). The pain was GONE. I swished with this one or two times a day over the course of three days. No more swelling, no more infection, no more PAIN. I&#x27;m sold! I had been using another brand before that cost over $20. I had been trying that one out with my pain, but it didn&#x27;t work. So glad I found this better oil, and thank goodness it&#x27;s cheaper, oh my god.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and be sure to spit the oil into the trash or toilet. Over time it will clog your sink, so don&#x27;t spit it into the sink!</li>
            <li> It makes for a better brushing experience but the oil can get kind of messy at times. Just be careful you don&#x27;t stain anything.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of cinnamon so I will have to try another flavor. The product does work it will leave your mouth clean and refreshed. I have been oil pulling for about a month and gave seen noticeable results.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels way cleaner when i use it. I have less tartar build up at night. The taste is not strong,</li>
