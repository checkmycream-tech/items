            <li>I love</li>
            <li>but this is more helpful</li>
            <li>Glad I looked</li>
            <li>but I can tell you it is nice and light.</li>
            <li>the texture was ok but not keeping my skin mostrized over hours.</li>
            <li>and it was much much more.  </li>
            <li>For a very lightweight lotion, the amount of moisture it gives the skin is amazing!  </li>
            <li>A great light moisturizer that I would certainly recommend.</li>
            <li>i use acne.org treatment and this treatment needs light and and at the same time effective moisturizer this moisturizer is perfect with acne treatment first of all i was using \\&quot;acne free with tea tree cream\\</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a nice texture and it feels good.  </li>
            <li>It is light and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I used this product everyday and it works perfect.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy it too.</li>
            <li>Save money and go buy something way cheaper, as good or even better from your local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>This whole line is pretty good</li>
            <li>so it was really hard to find a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>it was not bad but just soso.</li>
            <li>way better than what I&#x27;ve seen in drug stores for the same price, or more.</li>
            <li>Totally worth</li>
            <li>It dispenses just the right amount  </li>
            <li>I use a lot of other things, always high end, but thi sprice is great.</li>
            <li>and I think it is a clean kind of lotion that really helps winter dry skin.</li>
            <li>I know that the item pictured was discontinued, but sometimes online I am able to get the last of something that a seller still happens to have  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into my skin, which is great when I want to throw on makeup a few minutes later.</li>
            <li>really do it</li>
            <li>Very overpriced.</li>
            <li>Just a thought to check Amazon.com and found it much cheaper.</li>
            <li>They used the picture of the discontinued product that I REALLY wanted and sent me the newer, inferior version.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would imagine this would work very well for those with skin not as uber-dry as mine who want a lightweight moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent and what scent it has</li>
            <li>It is really a treat.  </li>
            <li>I use several products from this line due to dryness and sensitivity issues and really love this lotion!  </li>
            <li>this particular lotion is now a permanent part of my skincare routine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, and hydrates very dry skin immediately, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different types of moisturizer like Olay, etc, but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this never burns or irritives.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the middle of a course of IPL and microdermabrasion treatments, which makes my skin sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne, wrinkles, big pores, you name it.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive and adult-acne-prone skin</li>

            <li> It was hard to find when I first got back to the US, but now La roche has a retail site and you can find it here...</li>
            <li> so this bottle will last for a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve invested all kinds of money trying to find a moisturizer for my face, from the cheap products you can get at a local grocery or drug store to the really expensive creams and lotions from spas.</li>
            <li> I have used this product as well as several other La Roche Posay products for several years.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it, if you have the same trouble as me.</li>
            <li> If the cheap stuff isn&#x27;t cutting it for you</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way-</li>
            <li> Acne skin can be oily but treatments often leave me dry and peeling (preferable to exfoliate dead skin)</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so one bottle lasts for quite a while, even if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Small amount goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> so nothing goes to waste.  </li>
            <li> My skin get dehydrated(although not heavily, but still makes me uncomfortable) in fall and winter.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> however this stuff can tame the savage skin beast when I need it.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount at bedtime after cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> But it is not a very good moisturizer, I dont feel my skin moisturized after I use it.</li>
            <li> Of course, this does not replace the usual skin regimen necessary to keep bad skin in check</li>
            <li> I was so angry and disappointed that the item pictured was NOT AT ALL WHAT I GOT.!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> it smells very artificial.</li>

            <li> I only use this moisturizer.  It is light and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> La Roche...This product does what it says, you feel your skin soaking it up . I love really do it</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!!  It dispenses just the right amount  so nothing goes to waste.  doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product as well as several other La Roche Posay products for several years. I use a small amount at bedtime after cleansing my face. This moisturizer goes on smoothe and does not leave my face feeling greasy or oily. It does not clog my pores. It can be used in the morning as well, I just choose not to. I have always been very satisfied with this product and hope that you will too.</li>
            <li> Very overpriced. Save money and go buy something way cheaper, as good or even better from your local pharmacy. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> i use acne.org treatment and this treatment needs light and and at the same time effective moisturizer this moisturizer is perfect with acne treatment first of all i was using \\&quot;acne free with tea tree cream\\&quot; but this is more helpful</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from my Dr.&#x27;s office for years. Just a thought to check Amazon.com and found it much cheaper. Glad I looked</li>
            <li> I was so angry and disappointed that the item pictured was NOT AT ALL WHAT I GOT.!!!!!!!  I know that the item pictured was discontinued, but sometimes online I am able to get the last of something that a seller still happens to have  (although Amazon probably has rules re. all this, I have been successful many time in quests for these kinds of products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this time!!!!!  They used the picture of the discontinued product that I REALLY wanted and sent me the newer, inferior version.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy from this seller again, because I DO NOT TRUST THAT I WILL GET WHAT I ORDERED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different types of moisturizer like Olay, etc, but this is by far my favorite. A little bit goes a long way, so one bottle lasts for quite a while, even if you use it everyday. It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, and hydrates very dry skin immediately, and lasts all day. I would definitely recommend for anyone. Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> My skin get dehydrated(although not heavily, but still makes me uncomfortable) in fall and winter. This product can help me rehydrate my skin. I definitely recommend it, if you have the same trouble as me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! The acne medication I use is very drying, and this makes my skin perfectly moisturized! Not greasy, goes on smoothly.  Lasts all day- no reapplying needed! A little goes a long way- so this bottle will last for a long time! Totally worth it- way better than what I&#x27;ve seen in drug stores for the same price, or more.</li>
            <li> I use several products from this line due to dryness and sensitivity issues and really love this lotion!  For a very lightweight lotion, the amount of moisture it gives the skin is amazing!  Small amount goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really impressed with this product line and this particular lotion is now a permanent part of my skincare routine.  I would imagine this would work very well for those with skin not as uber-dry as mine who want a lightweight moisturizer.  LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve invested all kinds of money trying to find a moisturizer for my face, from the cheap products you can get at a local grocery or drug store to the really expensive creams and lotions from spas. This is certainly one of the best. If the cheap stuff isn&#x27;t cutting it for you I would recommend investing in this. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent and what scent it has I cannot equate to anything but I can tell you it is nice and light. It absorbs quickly into my skin, which is great when I want to throw on makeup a few minutes later. I&#x27;m in the middle of a course of IPL and microdermabrasion treatments, which makes my skin sensitive. This product does not burn when I put it on and calms my skin. I&#x27;ve already purchased a second bottle.</li>
            <li> it was not bad but just soso. the texture was ok but not keeping my skin mostrized over hours. it smells very artificial. wont buy again.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive and adult-acne-prone skin so it was really hard to find a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I recomend this product. Have a great quality. I used this product everyday and it works perfect. 100% recomended for women</li>
            <li> It is good for acne prone skin. It does not cause breakouts. But it is not a very good moisturizer, I dont feel my skin moisturized after I use it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months now.  I have adult acne, wrinkles, big pores, you name it.  Of course, this does not replace the usual skin regimen necessary to keep bad skin in check but.....it&#x27;s such a nice texture and it feels good.  Acne skin can be oily but treatments often leave me dry and peeling (preferable to exfoliate dead skin) however this stuff can tame the savage skin beast when I need it.  I like to put some on the tops of my hands too.  It is really a treat.  Hope you enjoy it too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this since I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else for this price. This whole line is pretty good and I think it is a clean kind of lotion that really helps winter dry skin. I use a lot of other things, always high end, but thi sprice is great. I noticed it now selling at CVS and it was much much more.  I have sensitive skin and this never burns or irritives.</li>
            <li> I started using this while studying abroad in France per a recommendation by a French pharmacist. It was hard to find when I first got back to the US, but now La roche has a retail site and you can find it here... A great light moisturizer that I would certainly recommend.</li>
