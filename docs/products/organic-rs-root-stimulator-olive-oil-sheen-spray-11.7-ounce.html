            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times before, so I know.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using Olive Oil  Sheen for years, and I just simply love it.</li>
            <li>But I have been dealing with this for years, because I just love the look and sheen</li>
            <li>I use this faithfully and love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>And it smells sooo good and it leaves my skin so soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this, makes her feel full and bouncy!</li>
            <li>It is also easy to use.  </li>
            <li>You spray this all over and it drys nicely and tans you soooo fast!</li>
            <li>the spray bottle was fine</li>
            <li>The scent is light.  </li>
            <li>Its light weight keeps my hair looking shinny and after I straighten my hair</li>
            <li>This brings the life back into it and adds a great shine and softness.</li>
            <li>Even when the container is full, it is stiil easy to lift, position and spray.  </li>
            <li>It also helps on those hot days to keep my hair nice and straight</li>
            <li>This product is great for untangling wet hair.</li>
            <li>When the hubby came back from the barber, they had used this on him and he loved it.  </li>
            <li>This olive oil  spray is so light and is very moisturizing for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It refreshes your hairdo after a few days and makes your hair look nice and healthy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that any air movement with blow it all around and make sure your horse is used to the sound of an aerosol can.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I expected it to be more like a salon style shine than the sort of healthy glow</li>
            <li>Nice smell but have only used it for two days.</li>
            <li>The price was just right.</li>
            <li>Just the right size.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair become super glossy and straight - and STAY that way.</li>
            <li>This product is very good adds shine without leaving very fatty, and left a rich scent in the hair.</li>
            <li>Honestly the only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this particular oil sheen is when it reaches the end of the can, the spray has a tendency  to leak out and some may get on your clothes which is greasy.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is not organic, in spite of the name.</li>
            <li>you get from honey and regular DC/baggying?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m sure this works for loads of people, but if you&#x27;re already doing other stuff to give your hair shine like closing cuticles and adding your own concoctions to your dc, this probably won&#x27;t add much to that.</li>
            <li>Mmmm, mine is blonde and fine.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money and more; however, I do not use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I use it when I blow my hair out straight.</li>
            <li>The product made my hair very greasy.</li>
            <li>The product is strangely very oily but doesn&#x27;t have any of the sheen it promises.</li>
            <li>Was a gift to someone for a holiday; appreciated</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and when ever I straigten it</li>
            <li>my barber uses this stuff everytime he cuts my hair, it really works just fine on my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>it keeps my hair feeling soft and shiny without being greasy!  </li>
            <li>When I first tried to open it, it felt like it was glued shut.</li>
            <li>I do think it has a nice, subtle, natural smell.  </li>
            <li>Second, there isn&#x27;t much olive oil.</li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair it was soft to the touch and gave my hair body and shine.</li>
            <li>For people who are looking for non water base hair sprays this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Third, it&#x27;s highly flammable.</li>
            <li>This oil sheen gives your hair such a soft and natural feel to it!</li>
            <li>The cap was broken but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I live in southern Georgia and us southern girls want a deep dark tan that drives people wild!!</li>
            <li>[adds major shine and softness] once a week on wash day, and I deep condition and co-wash regularly, so</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I live in southern Georgia and us southern girls want a deep dark tan that drives people wild!!</li>
            <li> [adds major shine and softness] once a week on wash day, and I deep condition and co-wash regularly, so</li>
            <li> Use other natural products instead.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron again halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> And it makes my thick hair look really sleek and shiny without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> It does weigh your hair down a little, but if you live in humid environments or have issues with frizziness, you may like having the extra weight.</li>
            <li> It took a lot of force to open it unlike any other I&#x27;ve dealt with...</li>
            <li> I have 3c hair and this works wonders when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> it becomes really dry.</li>
            <li> It just simply didn&#x27;t do a thing for &amp;#34;root stimulation&amp;#34;, but the oily spray weighed my hair down and made me feel</li>
            <li> Although if you are white, I think it could be a little too greasy for you, but try it anyway.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing at all, which I find weird because theoretically it should do *something</li>
            <li> So if you use this product, just be careful &amp; hold it out when using</li>
            <li> I hate hairspray, but this is really more of a \\&quot;shiner\\&quot; than a holding product.</li>
            <li> I find it to be too oily and runs down off the hair.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m home for the day I spray a little onto my brush and brush my hair with it.</li>
            <li> The Organic R/S Root Stimulator Olive Oil Sheen Spray on the website image difference what I received and also all 5 bottle  are broken the cap when I open from the delivery box.</li>
            <li> If your hair seems a little dull, this brightens it up, no problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started spraying it on my feet to soften my dried, cracked feet !</li>
            <li> However I have very thin hair and can not directly spray onto my hair or my hair is very limp and oily looking all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for people with locs and need shine.</li>
            <li> The lid is very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> The cap was shipped broken.</li>
            <li> (I have thin, wavy hair), but  I think it just makes my hair oily.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take this wrong</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> * The oil sheen spray is awesome.  * It gives you a nice shine without making your hair look greasy, just try not to spray it too close to the scalp.  * I spray on my dog too and my family loves how shiny her fur looks (along with Avoderm dog biscuits, she says yum!)  * The scent is light.  * Will definitely by in the future.  * Great for everyone who wants shiny hair.</li>
            <li> This spray smells great, adds a nice shine and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy. I&#x27;ve used it on bantu knot outs and twists. It refreshes your hairdo after a few days and makes your hair look nice and healthy. Sleek shine and pleasant smell, I love the Olive Oil line of products.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND MAKES MY HAIRS LOOK SHINNY AND HEALTHY !</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair once and I fell in love...it smells so good. And it makes my thick hair look really sleek and shiny without looking greasy. It also helps on those hot days to keep my hair nice and straight so I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron again halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome.  it keeps my hair feeling soft and shiny without being greasy!  It is also a great frizz-buster.  my hair is shiny and bouncy after i use this product.  love it!</li>
            <li> Although this is a product made with olive oil, you must pay attention to the ingredients! It&#x27;s not good for people with locs and need shine. Use other natural products instead.</li>
            <li> I live in southern Georgia and us southern girls want a deep dark tan that drives people wild!! You spray this all over and it drys nicely and tans you soooo fast! 30 minutes and I was like 2 shades darker! And it smells sooo good and it leaves my skin so soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li> The cap was shipped broken. Probably busted during shipping.</li>
            <li> This oil sheen gives your hair such a soft and natural feel to it! This product is definitely one of the best oil sheens on the market! Don&#x27;t underestimate the quality of it!</li>
            <li> I hate hairspray, but this is really more of a \\&quot;shiner\\&quot; than a holding product. If your hair seems a little dull, this brightens it up, no problem.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take this wrong but we spray this on our horses manes and tails. It&#x27;s a great for detangling and leaves a rich wonderful sheen. Hair is hair and if it also helps our four legged buddies it&#x27;s worth it. My only issue is that any air movement with blow it all around and make sure your horse is used to the sound of an aerosol can. As for my hair? Mmmm, mine is blonde and fine. Maybe I&#x27;ll give it a try and let you all know.</li>
            <li> The Organic R/S Root Stimulator Olive Oil Sheen Spray on the website image difference what I received and also all 5 bottle  are broken the cap when I open from the delivery box.</li>
            <li> I love it, Excelent Product</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT! I use it when I blow my hair out straight. This one can will last you for years, no exaggeration. Great product and it smells beautiful.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it seemed to work for a friend with similar hair (I have thin, wavy hair), but  I think it just makes my hair oily.  I do think it has a nice, subtle, natural smell.  I don&#x27;t know that I would recommend it, but maybe it does work for some people.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is not organic, in spite of the name. Second, there isn&#x27;t much olive oil. Third, it&#x27;s highly flammable. That did it for me.</li>
            <li> African America, 4c, relaxed girl.&lt;br /&gt;This does literally nothing to my hair. Absolutely nothing at all, which I find weird because theoretically it should do *something*. Anyway, I use honey as a pre-poo or added to my DC [adds major shine and softness] once a week on wash day, and I deep condition and co-wash regularly, so maybe it just does not work because I already have the level of shine it would impart if I did not do those things? Perhaps I expected it to be more like a salon style shine than the sort of healthy glow you get from honey and regular DC/baggying?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m sure this works for loads of people, but if you&#x27;re already doing other stuff to give your hair shine like closing cuticles and adding your own concoctions to your dc, this probably won&#x27;t add much to that.</li>
            <li> The product made my hair very greasy. It looked shiny, but more like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in weeks. Also it smells like aerisol.</li>
            <li> I love this spray. It&#x27;s light and smells great, and makes my hair look great, too. Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that!</li>
            <li> When the hubby came back from the barber, they had used this on him and he loved it.  He&#x27;s been happy with his hair ever since.  Not greasy, but held in place and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have 3c hair and this works wonders when I blow dry it. It makes my hair become super glossy and straight - and STAY that way. It does weigh your hair down a little, but if you live in humid environments or have issues with frizziness, you may like having the extra weight.</li>
            <li> The product is strangely very oily but doesn&#x27;t have any of the sheen it promises. I have used this product many times before, so I know.</li>
            <li> Love this product.The price was just right.Delivery was prompt.The price was great for this product since it&#x27;s been going up on the beauty supplies around my area</li>
            <li> Just the right size. Good quality, will recommend to my sister.  Was a gift to someone for a holiday; appreciated</li>
            <li> This product is very good adds shine without leaving very fatty, and left a rich scent in the hair.</li>
            <li> This product smells really good and seems like it has good ingredients in it. However I have very thin hair and can not directly spray onto my hair or my hair is very limp and oily looking all day.  When I&#x27;m home for the day I spray a little onto my brush and brush my hair with it.</li>
            <li> Nice smell but have only used it for two days.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this, makes her feel full and bouncy! I find it to be too oily and runs down off the hair.</li>
            <li> For people who are looking for non water base hair sprays this is perfect. Its light weight keeps my hair looking shinny and after I straighten my hair I spray this on and it gives it a nice shine. I get asked all the time what I put on my hair and its just this</li>
            <li> This product was sold as an organic root stimulator/oil sheen spray.  It just simply didn&#x27;t do a thing for &amp;#34;root stimulation&amp;#34;, but the oily spray weighed my hair down and made me feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started spraying it on my feet to soften my dried, cracked feet !</li>
            <li> This product is great for untangling wet hair. After blow drying my hair it was soft to the touch and gave my hair body and shine.</li>
            <li> This olive oil  spray is so light and is very moisturizing for my hair.  I had a work friend who used it and I noticed how shiny, not greasy, her hair looked.  So I decided to try it.  It makes my hair look great,  moist and manageable.  It is also easy to use.  Even when the container is full, it is stiil easy to lift, position and spray.  An excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olive Oil  Sheen for years, and I just simply love it. Honestly the only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this particular oil sheen is when it reaches the end of the can, the spray has a tendency  to leak out and some may get on your clothes which is greasy. But I have been dealing with this for years, because I just love the look and sheen it gives my hair. So if you use this product, just be careful &amp; hold it out when using so it does not drip on you or your clothes.</li>
            <li> my barber uses this stuff everytime he cuts my hair, it really works just fine on my dry scalp. what!</li>
            <li> The lid is very hard to remove. When I first tried to open it, it felt like it was glued shut. It took a lot of force to open it unlike any other I&#x27;ve dealt with...</li>
            <li> This worked great on my extensions!</li>
            <li> The cap was broken but that&#x27;s okay the spray bottle was fine so I just threw that away.</li>
            <li> I use this faithfully and love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and when ever I straigten it it becomes really dry. This brings the life back into it and adds a great shine and softness. Although if you are white, I think it could be a little too greasy for you, but try it anyway. Great product! :)</li>
            <li> I like this product; it brings shien to my hair.  It is worth the money and more; however, I do not use it everyday.</li>
