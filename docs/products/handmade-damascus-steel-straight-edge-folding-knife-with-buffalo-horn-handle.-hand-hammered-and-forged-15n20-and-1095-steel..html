            <li>Absolutely beautiful blade!  </li>
            <li>Here is a great conversation piece, that you can even shave with!</li>
            <li>the blade is beautiful!!</li>
            <li>but as just a knife it is awesome.</li>
            <li>And if not, you&#x27;ve got a great looking utility knife</li>
            <li>Great blade, exegetical feel.</li>
            <li>Great piece of art.</li>
            <li>Completely happy with it.</li>
            <li>You have to know what you&#x27;re doing, honing is truly a skill, but if you&#x27;re good with a strap, this is a great razor for the price.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment, beautiful Razor!</li>
            <li>Nice design though Thank you.</li>
            <li>Looks really nice,  however does not shave well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice conversation piece, but it can&#x27;t be used to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice looking blade</li>
            <li>I think that where it is made, this is the razor to have, but for the money (perhaps a bit more,) I&#x27;d go with a nice Dovo.</li>
            <li>The blade looks gorgeous but the steel doesn&#x27;t feel right for shaving.</li>
            <li>True Damascus blades are amazing.</li>
            <li>The handle feels like it&#x27;s made out of cheap material.</li>
            <li>Makes a nice discussion starter but unusable as a straight razor.</li>
            <li>My advice is to find a nice shave ready blade elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The handle looks like cheap plastic not buffalo horn and</li>
            <li>I was very excited to begin using a straight razor and absolutely love the Damascus steel of the blade.</li>
            <li>It would have been a great gift to my husband, but it was loose, so he can&#x27;t shave with it.</li>
            <li>If this were made for a pocket knife then I&#x27;d give many more stars, but for a stright razor it just comes up way short.</li>
            <li>Now for the one star review: the steel of the blade is too soft to take the appropriate edge required for straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty razor</li>
            <li>Just wish it would have been shave ready.</li>
            <li>It is very cool-looking and somewhat of a curio, but I don&#x27;t trust the edge.</li>
            <li>I had a Damascus folding knife that would take a straight razor edge</li>
            <li>thanks for the seller</li>
            <li>The scales are cheap and flimsy and the steel fails to take a good edge.</li>
            <li>It was brought to a professional barber to sharpen, only to get a long detailed letter about how poorly this was made and how at best, it could be used as a letter opener.</li>
            <li>Nearly shave ready out of the box!</li>
            <li>The razor looks really cool but is not sharp enough to shave with.</li>
            <li>Good razor had a hard time getting it sharp at first</li>
            <li>I sought out three professional sharpeners in Phoenix and each told me exactly the same thing I just wrote.</li>
            <li>Also it was dull blade, but that  I&#x27;m sure could be fixed.</li>
            <li>I will be sending this back very soon.</li>
            <li>A piece of beauty, arrived faster than expected as displayed, fits hand strong balanced blade and very sharp, I am going to buy another one.  </li>
            <li>expected to have to get this razor honed since the description did not indicate that it was shave ready, however, that didn&#x27;t get me shaving.</li>
            <li>The steel is physically too soft to hold a razors edge, and no amount of sharpening, honing, stripping, etc., can change the physical qualities of soft steel.</li>
            <li>it is not sharp at all upon arrival I will have to see if my husband feels he can get it sharpened to where it can actually be used to shave.</li>
            <li>Its pretty, I enjoy having it and using it, and will take enough of an edge to be dangerous but will only butcher your face if used for shaving.</li>
            <li>I received my razor and it&#x27;s dull, I have a new strop coming and will see if I can get a decent hone on it .</li>

            <li> Got this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend and he loves it!!!</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, beautiful Razor! Nearly shave ready out of the box! 50 laps and perfect! You have to know what you&#x27;re doing, honing is truly a skill, but if you&#x27;re good with a strap, this is a great razor for the price. And if not, you&#x27;ve got a great looking utility knife</li>
            <li> I just received the item and I must say I am extremely displeased with it. The blade looks gorgeous but the steel doesn&#x27;t feel right for shaving. The handle feels like it&#x27;s made out of cheap material. I will be sending this back very soon.</li>
            <li> Great blade, exegetical feel. Just wish it would have been shave ready.</li>
            <li> Not worth it cant hold An edge</li>
            <li> Great piece of art. From the blade to the handle it was everything you would expect. Completely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Good product. Bought for husband does need to be sharpened very dull when purchased. Nice design though Thank you. K</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful blade!  Wish it was sharper, but I can fix that!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to begin using a straight razor and absolutely love the Damascus steel of the blade. Now for the one star review: the steel of the blade is too soft to take the appropriate edge required for straight razor shaving. It is physically impossible for the blade material to get sharp enough. I sought out three professional sharpeners in Phoenix and each told me exactly the same thing I just wrote. Its pretty, I enjoy having it and using it, and will take enough of an edge to be dangerous but will only butcher your face if used for shaving. And yes I know that from personal experience. The proper hardness for a razor needs to be 56 or above and this blade is a 52. If this were made for a pocket knife then I&#x27;d give many more stars, but for a stright razor it just comes up way short.</li>
            <li> Looks really nice,  however does not shave well. I put it on the stones and still pulls. I wish this was not the case but it is not a pleasant shave.</li>
            <li> Makes a nice discussion starter but unusable as a straight razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice conversation piece, but it can&#x27;t be used to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected to have to get this razor honed since the description did not indicate that it was shave ready, however, that didn&#x27;t get me shaving. The steel is physically too soft to hold a razors edge, and no amount of sharpening, honing, stripping, etc., can change the physical qualities of soft steel. If you want to shave, buy something else; if you don&#x27;t mind spending $50.00 on a display piece or letter opener, well, this may be what you want. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t spend my money on this again.</li>
            <li> Nice looking blade but just wont take an edge and really not useful for shaving.  Quite a let-down and I got it as a gift for my son :-(</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t shave with it. It is very cool-looking and somewhat of a curio, but I don&#x27;t trust the edge. &amp;#34;Industrial Grade&amp;#34; comes to mind. I think that where it is made, this is the razor to have, but for the money (perhaps a bit more,) I&#x27;d go with a nice Dovo. Decent but nothing crazy special.</li>
            <li> Bad forge welding made the blade unusable. I began my hone only to find out one layer of steel was not welded properly and made honing the final 1cm nose of the blade unusable. The scales are cheap and flimsy and the steel fails to take a good edge. True Damascus blades are amazing. I had a Damascus folding knife that would take a straight razor edge and this does not compare at all. My advice is to find a nice shave ready blade elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Good razor had a hard time getting it sharp at first but once it got sharp it shaved</li>
            <li> it had a curve in the cutting edge</li>
            <li> Here is a great conversation piece, that you can even shave with!</li>
            <li> While this looks neat the actual use is yet to be determined. it is not sharp at all upon arrival I will have to see if my husband feels he can get it sharpened to where it can actually be used to shave. The handle looks like cheap plastic not buffalo horn and the hinge is very loose on the blade connection.</li>
            <li> I received my razor and it&#x27;s dull, I have a new strop coming and will see if I can get a decent hone on it . the blade is beautiful!! but, the handle is very thick and kinds cheesy.</li>
            <li> The razor looks really cool but is not sharp enough to shave with. The idea was to shave with it.</li>
            <li> This was a VERY bad decision... It was brought to a professional barber to sharpen, only to get a long detailed letter about how poorly this was made and how at best, it could be used as a letter opener. Very sad, a hopeless waste of money.  Worthless.</li>
            <li> Looking at the other reviews you probably won&#x27;t get anything out of this that you would from anybody else&#x27;s opinion. Its a pretty razor but it holds its edge very poorly.</li>
            <li> It would have been a great gift to my husband, but it was loose, so he can&#x27;t shave with it. I threw away receipt and couldn&#x27;t return. Unhappy to have bought him a shelf razor when I wanted him to have one to use. Also it was dull blade, but that  I&#x27;m sure could be fixed.</li>
            <li> A piece of beauty, arrived faster than expected as displayed, fits hand strong balanced blade and very sharp, I am going to buy another one.  thanks for the seller A+</li>
            <li> Did not hone well and did not come with an edge.</li>
            <li> This thing looks badass. Other reviews say you can&#x27;t actually shave with it and I agree. Sucks as a shaver but as just a knife it is awesome.</li>
