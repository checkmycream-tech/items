            <li>Sturdy and comfortable!!!</li>
            <li>The seat fits very nicely on a Home Depot bucket.  </li>
            <li>Very handy for our pop up camper</li>
            <li>It goes on a 5 gallon bucket perfect and have bought 4 more for our camping friends.</li>
            <li>....put scented kitty litter in the 5 gallon bucket and you have a handy potty!</li>
            <li>To use it this summer on my dlx 1765 CS with friends and family out on most beautiful lake Jordan!</li>
            <li>Keep A Bunch Handy !</li>
            <li>Works great, better than squatting!</li>
            <li>A perfect fit for home depot orange buckets which they sell for $2.97.  </li>
            <li>Mine arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li>no idea how good it is at containing odors.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good value purchase.</li>
            <li>Price was good.  </li>
            <li>Good to have around for the ladies.</li>
            <li>I loved this.  </li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>Fits good.</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly on the orange Homer bucket.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the fix on a five gallon bucket along with how comfortable it is.</li>
            <li>So, it was a good buy for me.</li>
            <li>Awesome and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>I feel good having this in my emergency stuff..</li>
            <li>but I chose it because it has a &amp;#34;rubber gasket to seal in odors&amp;#34;  and because it had a good reputation for  snapping on the bucket.</li>
            <li>Seat fit perfectly on Home depot bucket and plan to use trash</li>
            <li>We were able to snap on the bucket with a plastic garbage bag tucked under it and it did great.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable and cushy it is not.</li>
            <li>It is perfect and super easy!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, just wish I purchased it sooner !!</li>
            <li>That seal lasts longer than most relationships!</li>
            <li>Remember, when  you are in the woods, do not bury or leave plastic bags, They belong in the garbage make sure they get there!</li>
            <li>this fit great on a three gallon bucket regardless the directions said 4, 5 , 6 galllon bucket ...</li>
            <li>An amazing product.</li>
            <li>Hopefully we never have to use it, but if we do, it looks like it will do the job nicely.</li>
            <li>I bought it for a prepping scenario, so I don&#x27;t know yet what will become of the bags that have been used in it, by I&#x27;m resourceful and</li>
            <li>If your camping in California State parks, bring your own bucket, BYOB.</li>
            <li>What I liked about this one, is that it has a rubber seal around the lid.</li>
            <li>Every one cooperated with taking care of their own &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; waste&amp;#34; by adding kitty litter to the used bag before throwing in the trash.</li>
            <li>It seems to be durable looking, fits perfectly on a Home Depot orange 5gal bucket and was reasonable.</li>
            <li>the cheaper ones (I think, I dont own the others</li>
            <li>This snaps onto my 5 gallon bucket nicely.  </li>
            <li>It has also come in handy out on our farm where there is no bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Has some nice features like the rubber gasket inside the lid</li>
            <li>I own two of these lids.</li>
            <li>Has a nice seal around the lid so that smells don&#x27;t get out and flies don&#x27;t get in.  </li>
            <li>Fit perfectly with a good seal the first time.</li>
            <li>It fit the True Value 5 gallon pail that I had with a garbage bag liner perfectly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this is perfect and highly recommended for  &amp;#34;whats about to happen&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Very easy and convenient.</li>
            <li>by far the best investment for a woman camping...!!!!</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly for us with 2 young grandchildren</li>
            <li>In an emergency I am sure that it would come in handy.</li>
            <li>So easy!</li>
            <li>works great, such a great deal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it advertises to be, and did a great job</li>
            <li>The lid closes very securely so that  odors will, hopefully, not escape.</li>
            <li>Very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>We loved how it fit easily onto a 5 gallon bucket.  </li>
            <li>But she thinks it&#x27;s way better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Fits on top of an orange home depot 5 gallon bucket.</li>
            <li>I love this seat.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad we did.  </li>
            <li>and I was concerned about odors escaping as I put it together, but figured this was one sure way to &#x27;field test&#x27; my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went to Home Depot and got one of their orange buckets, filled it with Dollar Store supplies* and Viola!  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask?</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Would have liked for this to actually fit on a five gallon bucket.</li>
            <li>No pun intended :)</li>
            <li>it HAS to be more comfy than sitting on the edge of the 5 gallon bucket - and I hope to never need to use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>These are great for camping with no facilities or just not wanting to get out of your nice, warm tent in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>More kitty litter on top covered up the odor.</li>
            <li>i drop bombs and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought more than one of these.</li>
            <li>Made tent camp life considerably more livable.</li>
            <li>Lined them from top over seat and everything.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s So Light !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>This was one of the best things I purchased for our recent camping trip!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it five stars if I could safely leave the lid on for transport.</li>
            <li>Like some folks have mentioned, using scented kitty litter will keep the odors even more at bay, and absorb the liquids.</li>
            <li>This product is so much better.</li>
            <li>Anyway, It is sturdy and stable, and (with the right bucket)it is good to have for an emergency or for camping.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would work great in an emergency situation where normal plumbing/water systems are out.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>You do have to apply a good amount of pressure the first time.</li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable, but better than sitting on just the top of a bucket.</li>
            <li>camping thing that with a 5 gallon bucket can really come in handy on any camping trip you may go on !</li>
            <li>This is a great way to live outdoors but not have to &#x27;go&#x27; outdoors.  </li>
            <li>A Clean Up Saver !</li>
            <li>The toilet seat is a perfect fit and snaps on snugly to the bucket.</li>
            <li>It is very good for the price, I think it do the same as you buy an espencer one.</li>
            <li>This also sits at a more comfortable height than the camp toilets.  </li>
            <li>If it had fit, I would&#x27;ve been decently pleased with the quality of the product for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>My six year old daughter thought it was great for camping.  </li>
            <li>This works great for our 3 year old grand-daughter at our backwoods cabin.  </li>
            <li>They are still usable, but could be a better fit</li>
            <li>A lot more comfortable than sitting on a bucket without it</li>
            <li>After doing it this way I was able to fit the lid onto every bucket I had in my house which included buckets from Aubuchon, Walmart, VIP, and Home Depot.</li>
            <li>fast deliver and good product</li>
            <li>No smell, and easy clean up!</li>
            <li>Was very happy to read the other reviews about using kitty litter.  </li>
            <li>The garbage bag removed easily for disposal.  </li>
            <li>(Put a plastic garbage bag in it for easy disposal.)</li>
            <li>I think it would be easy to make this a five star product though.</li>
            <li>Alone, it&#x27;s compact &amp; easy to store.  </li>
            <li>Easy to take on and off bucket.</li>
            <li>Easy Flush</li>
            <li>it easily snapped onto the bucket and has not been a problem since.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to snap off from the buckets as well, so no complain from me.</li>
            <li>We got a 5 gallon frosting bucket from the local doughnut shop and the seat fits nicely and makes a good seal.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend buying sturdy plastic bags to line the bucket.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light weight, concerned it will brake quickly.</li>
            <li>Good price for a great little luxury when camping!</li>
            <li>The seat and lid snap on to any bucket I&#x27;ve tried, tho many have a problem finding a proper bucket, I have been successful with any/every bucket I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The seat looked fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably fine but the 5 gallon bucket I&#x27;m trying to attach it to will not accept it.</li>
            <li>The lid itself could be shaped more ergonomically, and a sturdier plastic is something I&#x27;d be willing to pay more for.</li>
            <li>I got this to work on a Home Depot orange 5 gal bucket just fine.</li>
            <li>and it fits fine.</li>
            <li>the are cheap yet strong),</li>
            <li>is strong, seals up great around a standard 5 gallon bucket.  </li>
            <li>Fit kids up to 200+ person just fine.</li>
            <li>It would probably be great for camping, especially with kids who may not have mastered the fine art of squatting over a hole in the ground.</li>
            <li>I would have given this product 5 stars if the Jerks that distribute this didn&#x27;t put on a HUGE label on the cover (with advertising and no helpful information) that took me about 15 minutes to remove with a paint scraper and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>and I find it to be rather comfortable and stable even for some extended 10 plus minute visits, considering my 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic alternative.  </li>
            <li>I test fitted the seat on a 5 gallon bucket from Home Depot and it fit snug.</li>
            <li>This seat didn&#x27;t even remotely fit our 5 gallon bucket.</li>
            <li>This bucket , along with it&#x27;s Canadian-made competitor, wouldn&#x27;t fit onto an ACE Hardware 5 gallon bucket.  </li>
            <li>Bucket\\&quot; and they both fit.</li>
            <li>We took the lid after it arrived to Home Depot to try to fit it</li>
            <li>It fit nothing in the store.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 3 of these which were supposed to fit any 5 or 6 gallon bucket.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>happy with this seat and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>It appears to fit snugly to the bucket.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*TP, Baby Wipes, Kitchen trash bags, cheap scented cat litter, disinfectant spray,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thicker plastic and there is also a rubber seal inside the lid to give it a snug fit when you close it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Had to search for a bucket it fit.</li>
            <li>It looks to be serviceable even though it is made of light weight plastic.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product, firm and sturdy and it fits perfectly on my 5 gallon buckets</li>
            <li>bucket, may fit a 6 gal., but I&#x27;ve never seen a 6 gal.</li>
            <li>but it did fit onto our Home Depot 5 gal bucket.....</li>
            <li>The plastic is easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>but it will fit with effort....</li>
            <li>We were happy that it is sturdy and can handle a larger bottom.</li>
            <li>hoped it would fit snugly on one of them.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>This works great with blue walmart bucket.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, we had a 4.5 gal bucket that had held joint compound.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe the one star reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t fit a bucket.</li>
            <li>This seat fit the plastic bucket we had.  </li>
            <li>Matched the 3 1/2 green bucket perfectly</li>
            <li>and it was a good alternative for those unexpected emergency moments.</li>
            <li>OK, OK, she was worried about the whole disaster thing</li>
            <li>Best of all, when used with a liner (we use doubled tall kitchen bags) and an absorbing material (kitty litter, saw dust or peat moss), disposal is as simple as tying up the bag and putting it into the dumpster.  </li>
            <li>This lid snaps down very securely over a 5 gallon bucket lid and did a great job.  </li>
            <li>fits perfectly on a five gallon bucket, rubber seal securely closes to keep out smells - it&#x27;s comfortable - not a grand ritz</li>
            <li>What can you say about a toilet seat, works great.</li>
            <li>We bought this toilet seat from \\&quot;Number 1 in Service\\&quot; (fulfilled by Amazon) and it works great.</li>
            <li>As its got a good seal and easy open lid.</li>
            <li>No more looking for the perfect log to sit on while driving logging roads looking for grouse.</li>
            <li>This is something I think everybody should have, for emergencies or just for the fact your toilet may stop up or backup and this will come in very handy to use temporarily.  </li>
            <li>the contents, while transporting to be dumped, are well contained and clean to carry.</li>
            <li>, I have a full bathroom when I add the bucket shower hose to the mix.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for late night potty needs while tent camping.</li>
            <li>Everyone loved it, especially the ladies.</li>
            <li>Definitely will make a good seat to do your business when camping.  </li>
            <li>I do not use this lid for transporting a full bucket.</li>
            <li>Even doing that it is still more comfortable and way more convenient than simply using a bucket and snapping a lid on every time.</li>
            <li>As an avid tinkerer and outdoor project guy, my bathroom is a long way from the garage where I spend most of my free time, I needed something convenient to use in order to answer that important call of nature !!  </li>
            <li>Yes , and fit the home depot bucket with a costco garbage bag folded over the rim just right.  </li>
            <li>Fit right on to my 5 gallon bucket.</li>
            <li>Good for what it is, not for a large adult.</li>
            <li>This is super sturdy.  </li>
            <li>This one does fit nicely on a Lowe&#x27;s blue five gallon bucket both by itself and when snapped over a plastic bag liner.  </li>
            <li>I shopped around and amazon had good prices on these bucket style toilet seat lids.</li>
            <li>Watch My Private Room TV In Total Joy !</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for the ladies who love to camp.</li>
            <li>My wife wasn&#x27;t comfortable camping, because there wasn&#x27;t always a bathroom close, this made her more comfortable and probably a lot cleaner solution than using public camping bathrooms.  </li>
            <li>It fit on the first bucket I tried, a Home Depot bucket.</li>
            <li>everyone of them said they would actually use it if they had to....and that they were surprised how comfortable it was for being plastic and attached to a 5 gallon bucket lol...</li>
            <li>The fit to bucket is snug but not difficult to remove and the lid fits snug with a gasket to hold in moisture and smells.  </li>
            <li>This is a handy way to have a cheap emergency toilet and not have to make a run to the bathhouse or woods.  </li>
            <li>I have those &amp;#34;food safe&amp;#34; white 5 gallon buckets that you can buy at home depot, and this Tote-able Toilet Seat/Lid fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Of course not as comfortable as as a regular toilet, but a very good alternative if convenience is what you seek.</li>
            <li>This seat is great for kids, but for an adult size butt, better be careful!  </li>
            <li>Works as advertised - positive snap onto the bucket - comfortable for adults of any size.  </li>
            <li>We live in an area that recently experienced flooding that knocked out sewer lines for the next couple of months</li>
            <li>The seal and the tight lid do a great job of containing odour and keeping pests out!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend for the price and mainly comfort to anyone who is trying to decide from the many out ere, plus price since I didn&#x27;t want to spend slot of money on a item like this and put more towards other more valued items....</li>
            <li>Had the manufacturers simply used a durable plastic, the kind that doesn&#x27;t crack, this would be a 5 star item.  </li>
            <li>the cat liter absorbed all the moisture.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re catering to a city queen who loathes the prospect of popping a squat, it&#x27;d be useful.</li>
            <li>I got this to fit on top of a seven gallon bucket (only for the height).</li>
            <li>Worth the $$.  </li>
            <li>taste in my mouth from this purchasing experience, but it&#x27;s better than actually using this product and expecting it to fit and perform as specified.  </li>
            <li>Stores away nicely until the next trip.</li>
            <li>Well made &amp; worth the money asked.</li>
            <li>Simple but effective.</li>
            <li>Well made, better than other brands, tighter seal and more durable.</li>
            <li>Ok this product is simple and straightforward.</li>
            <li>Great little seat and does exactly  as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy and snaps right on to the bucket, in my case a HomDep orange &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s do this&amp;#34; bucket.</li>
            <li>Snaps right on to a Home Depot orange bucket.</li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>so when I find the right one, it should work.</li>
            <li>yes that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>But it snapped right on the bucket I bought at Lowes for $3 bucks, no problem.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for what we need and the cover snaps on very tight to a 5-gallon pail.</li>
            <li>If you have to cart your own toilet around, this is the way to do it.</li>
            <li>I also own one of those camping fold up toilets, that the come with bags and a clip on toilet seat, without any lid to contain the odors.</li>
            <li>It actually fits perfect and creates a tight seal.</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend this appliance for campers and preppers!</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t fit on my 3 different size of buckets, it is quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>Construction is adequate at this point because I have not used it in the real world.</li>
            <li>The seal is a good feature though not water tight.</li>
            <li>it works very very well ..</li>
            <li>This seat sure beats some of the other options available  when roughing it.</li>
            <li>thanks alot...........!</li>
            <li>I intend to line the bucket with a 13 gallon kitchen trash bag first, then the Wal-Mart bag.  </li>
            <li>Ok...I took my city girl wife camping for the FIRST TIME.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t pick the whole thing up by the hinge!  </li>
            <li>a pottie ;-)</li>
            <li>I only give 2 star for this product,for some reason it doesn&#x27;t fit well on my 5 gallon bucket!</li>
            <li>My husband didn&#x27;t think he would be able to use it while camping because he&#x27;s a pretty big guy (6&#x27;3-260lbs)</li>
            <li>Sure will beat squatting over a bucket in the middle of the night while camping!!</li>
            <li>The pump quit working on the first fill of water.  </li>
            <li>The kids love knowing we have a tiny potty just for them.</li>
            <li>Keep One Ready !</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li>Then Ready !</li>
            <li>The ring that I used for the home depot bucket was the inner most ring.</li>
            <li>I first received the seat</li>
            <li>This was the first seat I purchased</li>
            <li>More importantly, the seal/snap down lid/kitty litter combo</li>
            <li>Sat on it and it feels comfortable and adequate enough for temporary or emergecny use.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see that the lid fit tightly on my 5 gallon bucket after seeing several reviews that it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>While not quite as comfy as a regular toilet seat (no surprise, esp since I am nearly 6ft tall and in no way &#x27;dainty&#x27;), it does the job.</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t sit right but snaps on nice and tight to the Home Depot bucket.</li>
            <li>doesnt snap very tight to the bucket, otherwise is a good product</li>
            <li>Molded plastic that doesn&#x27;t really fit securely on any of the 9 empty buckets I&#x27;ve tried it on.</li>
            <li>I expected it to fit securely as was advertised</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to have as an option to use when rain or cold makes going outdoors for that scenic stroll to the restrooms about as appealing as a trip to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Soooooo much better than emptying the holding tank of the camp toilet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better made than the Luggable Loo toilet seat.</li>
            <li>I just received this tote-able toilet seat and found out why there is so much confusion about fitting these onto a bucket.</li>
            <li>I purchased this toilet seat for my emergency/ BOV/ camping kit awhile back, but had never used it beyond snapping it to a bucket to be sure it fit correctly.</li>
            <li>The lid also is easy to snap close and open and</li>
            <li>One enhancement that I plan to try is to nest one bucket into a second five gallon bucket to raise the seat of the toilet to a more comfortable height.  </li>
            <li>We take weekends on the boat, and have found this by far the best way to deal with toilet waste.</li>
            <li>I was afraid at first that it would be flimsy, but it really was made good, and perfect for camping.. using an ordinary hardware store bucket..</li>
            <li>We were in a large tent</li>
            <li>I put a large trash bag inside it, and dumped some kitty litter.</li>
            <li>the gasket seals in odors which is great since we keep it in the tent for my 2 little girls to &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>So, I left the bucket and seat in the sun until they were very hot and presto!</li>
            <li>It was a huge relief to find something as simple as this to solve a problem that seemed unsolvable!  </li>
            <li>this seat won&#x27;t fit - despite what most negative reviews have to say.</li>
            <li>No pathogens or parasites survive composting and the compost is ready to add to a garden, orchard or flower beds.</li>
            <li>We have the Real Tree Bucket from Wal-Mart and their website says the width is 13.8&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This product made our camping trip so much easier...</li>
            <li>I would like for it to seal better when closed.</li>
            <li>It all works out very well.  </li>
            <li>This seat DOES fit the orange Home Depot 5 gallon bucket and both white 5 gallon Walmart buckets.</li>
            <li>Tried 5 different 5 gallon pails from Home Depot, Lowes, Menards, a joint compound pail &amp; a food grade pail from a bakery &amp; none would fit this seat.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected,</li>
            <li>I put this lid inside the foldable tent and we are ready to go camping.</li>
            <li>You still feel like, well, you know, but you were ready for it.</li>
            <li>Seat feels like a regular fit.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>We used it lined with a regular, but heavy-duty, trash bag and partially filled with odor-absorbing kitty litter.</li>
            <li>fits all buckets used out camping very sturdy</li>
            <li>Product description is incorrect and misleading; not sized to fit standard buckets, as confirmed by others recent to this review.  </li>
            <li>No, and thanks for nothing.  </li>
            <li>let&#x27;s just say this items use is really in a pinch or emergency folks and face your taking a dump in a bucket</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was finding a bucket it would fit.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Need a bed pan(pale) for the end of my pregnancy waited awhile to get and now it doesnt&#x27; fit standard 5 gal.</li>
            <li>While the product snaps securely onto my bucket and will do the job, I will only give it 2 stars-</li>
            <li>The locking tab/latch on the lid doesn&#x27;t engage the seat very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Again</li>
            <li>Very durable and well made.</li>
            <li>Just put a garbage bag inside, put the lid on and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>If the bucket were to fall over the lid would readily pop off</li>
            <li>After snapping the lid on and off maybe a dozen times it became much easier to snap on by hand]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because it took a while to find a bucket that it would fit</li>
            <li>but it does fit on the all white one (non-branded) lowes sells.</li>
            <li>I love this little tote able toilet seat and lid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; tall and 235 pounds and though the seat&#x27;s too small for me to want to spend all day enjoying the view it&#x27;s sized adequately for its purpose.</li>
            <li>other than that is good, Im not taking it back</li>
            <li>The toilet seat is working perfectly for solid waste with no smells.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to report that this product is performing extremely well.</li>
            <li>They are stronger than the other seats, better quality.</li>
            <li>The rubber seal on this seems to contain odors better than other models without.</li>
            <li>When combined with that all important bucket, it becomes a functional emergency or boondocking toilet.  </li>
            <li>This toilet seat fits 5 gallon buckets nicely and is comfortable although a bit small.</li>
            <li>almost too easy, it almost falls off its that loose (?).</li>
            <li>Just put bag down in hole and fold back over seat for a sanitary way to make sure everything stays clean during our trip.</li>
            <li>There is a snapping tab to hold the lid down between uses but using this bucket on a boat I might be inclined to rig up some bungee cord to make sure the lid gasket stays snug on the seat.</li>
            <li>Once the lid is closed there is no odor and snaps on and off the bucket easily.</li>
            <li>Ok, should cost much less, handle gets in the way and is unneccessary</li>
            <li>This portable potty is mainly used by our toddlers because they can&#x27;t make it all the way to the bathrooms while we are camping.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the attached lid</li>
            <li>Then I decided to inspect the seat more closely and realized that underneath there are several rings which are meant for different size buckets.</li>
            <li>It fit well and didnt seem loose.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for emergency kits, campervans/BOVs, car camping or any situation where facilities are unavailable, unsanitary...</li>
            <li>Highly recomend for those of you who did not want to deal with a portapotty.</li>
            <li>It fit really snug and I won&#x27;t worry about it slipping when I sit on it!</li>
            <li>Not as sturdy as it appeared, but once fitted on a 5gal bucket, it will do well for anyone except a very large/tall adult.  </li>
            <li>Also, it seems a bit cheap for the money spent.  </li>
            <li>I have used pine shavings (hamster bedding) from Walmart and $3 worth will last over a week.  </li>
            <li>I am a heavy person and was worry that it was not going to withstand my weight, but it was safe and I never felt that it was buckling.  </li>
            <li>With that being said, I think it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>when you do go to open it after a few sessions the smell can be very overwhelming- duh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>It does NOT fit most buckets</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since a few people said this seat didn&#x27;t snap onto their 5 gallon bucket.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for an emergency toilet seat to use on a bucket, for comfort use a 6 gal bucket!!</li>
            <li>I can buy commercial urea and mix it with water, but why buy it and flush my own down the commode.</li>
            <li>Every camping family, especially those with kids, should have one as well--it&#x27;s far more convenient to use with a toddler with 200 trips to the bathroom per day than running to the campground toilet!  </li>
            <li>When done just unclip the cover, remove the plastic bags and put new ones.  </li>
            <li>I just bought the lid, went and got a new Lowes bucket</li>
            <li>I live in town.</li>
            <li>The lid is slightly flimsy and appears the hinge might break easily, but we will see.</li>
            <li>Basic, inexpensive, comfortable and a big step up from hovering over a hole in the ground.</li>
            <li>You do need to place the bucket near to a wall, tree or close to the side of your tent when the seat is in use, since the lid makes it a bit top heavy</li>
            <li>Not quite big enough to fit over it.</li>
            <li>turn it upside down and push it onto the lid and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Cramped quarters meant that there was no way to have it truly out of potential nose range, so it&#x27;s odorless nature was well appreciated!  </li>
            <li>I also read another recommendation to use scent free cat litter to keep odor down.  </li>
            <li>It fits a 5 gallon bucket as promised &amp; the lid does lean back far enough so as not to get in the way of being able to sit on it properly.</li>
            <li>We also tried a Home Depot bucket all of these for 4 to 6 and half gallon buckets this fit NONE of them.</li>
            <li>This toilet seat with lid was much more expensive than many others offered but because&lt;</li>
            <li>Comfortable seat, too, except that the nice tight seal created by the necessary rubber gasket will create some condensation on the seat &amp; lid after a few days of use, so be aware that you will need to wipe that dry before using!</li>
            <li>We double line the bucket with large kitchen trash bags and add some kitty liter.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time fitting it to the bucket I had.  </li>
            <li>The one that was shipped to me DOES NOT fit securely on an orange Home Depot bucket.</li>
            <li>a cheap green &#x27;faux&#x27; grass mat on the ground</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had to use it yet, but had no trouble setting it</li>
            <li>In fact, the lid was tucked away in a closet, nearly forgotten.</li>
            <li>Used this for camping when the facilities were either non existent or too far from camp.</li>
            <li>Called Emergency Essentials customer service on 5/5/2014 &amp; spoke to a polite young lady about this problem.</li>
            <li>Provides a ready mechanism to accomplish #2&#x27;s during camping, while still maintaining a reasonable form (e.g. not squatting over a log in the woods that has poison ivy growing on it resulting in a rash for several weeks after the camping event for a non-experienced friend who will likely never go camping with you again,</li>
            <li>and this is by far the easiest, cheapest option for weekenders.</li>
            <li>No trouble snapping it onto a 5 gallon bucket.</li>
            <li>im keeping the hills alive and poopless..</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to fit it on a bucket you have laying around the house or the yard for 10 years with dings and dents in it it might not fit</li>
            <li>So I was getting ready to return the seat back to Amazon.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m around 250 pounds and nearly 6&#x27; tall.  </li>
            <li>but any way I got one from my local HomeDepot which did a perfect fit have not used it yet because of our weather conditions been to cold but am planning a camping trip in the next few weeks which I am getting prepared for and this item will be included.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just add 2 or 3 inches of sawdust or peatmoss to the bottom and add a little more every time you use the toilet</li>
            <li>so you can close it airtight if you can&#x27;t empty it right away.  </li>
            <li>, I can say that it is sturdy enough, fits well enough, and seals well enough that is should be fine when put to the ultimate test.</li>
            <li>You can store toilet paper or wipes, and garbage bags in the bucket until you&#x27;re ready to use them.</li>
            <li>Each morning I would dig a small hole, dump the bucket, change the kitty littler (no smell thanks to the kitty litter) and start with a fresh bag.</li>
            <li>I looked through all the reviews on Amazon of similar products before selecting this particular product.  </li>
            <li>(a small shovel is good idea to add if you can, or want to bury the bagged waste)</li>
            <li>Once full it is easy to remove the seat and dump the contents into a slow compost pile to break down and age for a couple years.</li>
            <li>Wal-Mart and other plastic bags will fit over the bucket and under the toilet seat without any problem.  </li>
            <li>I use garbage bags to keep the bucket clean and to be able to seal the waste, but this seat is not a good design.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit a standard 5 gallon bucket, I bought three of these for emergency use or camping and none of them fit on the buckets, they are slightly too small.</li>
            <li>(We&#x27;re assuming you went into another room and closed the door first.)</li>
            <li>Change your bags out before they get full and HEAVY.)</li>
            <li>That ended abruptly this morning, when the main sewer pump where I live died unexpectedly, leaving everyone with no bathroom facilities until sometime tomorrow.</li>
            <li>I live in a Tiny Home with a waterless commode system.</li>
            <li>I use it with a 5 gallon plastic bucket I found in my garage and while it&#x27;s a hard snap on and off, it works fine.</li>
            <li>Since a single bucket with the seat weights little and seems a bit \\&quot;tippy\\&quot;, I also plan to put some sand in the bottom bucket to see if it can help make a more stable overall setup.</li>
            <li>VERY tight fit on a standard 5 gallon bucket...</li>
            <li>But no worse than standard toilet seats.</li>
            <li>Company offers to sell their (standard?)</li>
            <li>Another feature worth considering is the fact the way this toilet seat is designed and the way it snugly fits the bucket and how your bottom actually makes a tight seal when sitting on it, any loud or excessive flatulence is actually muffled when in use which is important in a possible&lt;br /&gt;potential embarrassing moment.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it on I immediately assumed the same as other reviewers about the home depot bucket.</li>
            <li>It is a decent buy, especially compared to more expensive portable potties.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is hard to get too excited about a product like this, but it will work quite well.</li>
            <li>It fit the 5 gallon pail snuggly and snaps tight when closed.  </li>
            <li>I have three young girls I am introducing to camping and a &amp;#34;city&amp;#34; wife who needs &amp;#34;adequate toilet facilities.&amp;#34;  Along with a pop up tent, bucket, can liner (cat box liners</li>
            <li>Well, as far as toilet seat comfort this one is not comfy!</li>
            <li>Well, it was very hard to snap it on the first time but much easier after that.</li>
            <li>I bought this particular one, because someone wrote that the seat cover did not go all the way up on one of the other seats that Amazon sells.  </li>
            <li>sturdy and barely big enough for an adult but big enough nonetheless.</li>
            <li>No more uncomfortable hunts, lol.</li>
            <li>The seat is priced reasonably but Alas, they chose a brittle plastic and mine broke before reaching its first camp.  </li>
            <li>It might take a little muscle to insert the lid, but it&#x27;s definitely a perfectly tight fit.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This mounts absolutely perfect on a 5 gallon bucket.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the cabin.</li>
            <li> It is mentioned in the description that this lid fits best on a 4.5 gallon bucket.  </li>

            <li> The seat fits that bucket, perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I use peat moss to cover deposits and smell rather than chemicals and this works perfectly well for my wife and me.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for our camping needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others.  </li>

            <li> Quality very good.</li>

            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> Great.</li>
            <li> This is a great appliance I wish I had acquired yearts ago.</li>
            <li> great to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> is a great price and convenience.</li>
            <li> I bought this for camping and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great for in a deer stand...</li>
            <li> lol....</li>
            <li> Great idea but</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> We put this lid on a 3 gallon bucket and use it out in the woods when we got camping, it is great.</li>
            <li> Created a great seal with the bucket.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to see that the seat cover does go all the way up on this one.</li>
            <li> It fits great on the bucket and even snaps onto the B uckett  </li>
            <li> I am definitely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great for making a bucket loo.  </li>
            <li> Be sure that you have a bucket that can withstand the weight of a person!!  </li>
            <li> Sturdy and comfortable!!!</li>
            <li> The seat fits very nicely on a Home Depot bucket.  </li>
            <li> Very handy for our pop up camper</li>
            <li> It goes on a 5 gallon bucket perfect and have bought 4 more for our camping friends.</li>
            <li> ....put scented kitty litter in the 5 gallon bucket and you have a handy potty!</li>
            <li> To use it this summer on my dlx 1765 CS with friends and family out on most beautiful lake Jordan!</li>
            <li> Keep A Bunch Handy !</li>
            <li> Works great, better than squatting!</li>
            <li> A perfect fit for home depot orange buckets which they sell for $2.97.  </li>
            <li> Mine arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> no idea how good it is at containing odors.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good value purchase.</li>
            <li> Price was good.  </li>
            <li> Good to have around for the ladies.</li>
            <li> I loved this.  </li>
            <li> She loved it.</li>
            <li> Fits good.</li>
            <li> It fit perfectly on the orange Homer bucket.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the fix on a five gallon bucket along with how comfortable it is.</li>
            <li> So, it was a good buy for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.</li>
            <li> I feel good having this in my emergency stuff..</li>
            <li> but I chose it because it has a &amp;#34;rubber gasket to seal in odors&amp;#34;  and because it had a good reputation for  snapping on the bucket.</li>
            <li> Seat fit perfectly on Home depot bucket and plan to use trash</li>
            <li> We were able to snap on the bucket with a plastic garbage bag tucked under it and it did great.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable and cushy it is not.</li>
            <li> It is perfect and super easy!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, just wish I purchased it sooner !!</li>
            <li> That seal lasts longer than most relationships!</li>
            <li> Remember, when  you are in the woods, do not bury or leave plastic bags, They belong in the garbage make sure they get there!</li>
            <li> this fit great on a three gallon bucket regardless the directions said 4, 5 , 6 galllon bucket ...</li>
            <li> An amazing product.</li>
            <li> Hopefully we never have to use it, but if we do, it looks like it will do the job nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a prepping scenario, so I don&#x27;t know yet what will become of the bags that have been used in it, by I&#x27;m resourceful and</li>
            <li> If your camping in California State parks, bring your own bucket, BYOB.</li>
            <li> What I liked about this one, is that it has a rubber seal around the lid.</li>
            <li> Every one cooperated with taking care of their own &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; waste&amp;#34; by adding kitty litter to the used bag before throwing in the trash.</li>
            <li> It seems to be durable looking, fits perfectly on a Home Depot orange 5gal bucket and was reasonable.</li>
            <li> the cheaper ones (I think, I dont own the others</li>
            <li> This snaps onto my 5 gallon bucket nicely.  </li>
            <li> It has also come in handy out on our farm where there is no bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Has some nice features like the rubber gasket inside the lid</li>
            <li> I own two of these lids.</li>
            <li> Has a nice seal around the lid so that smells don&#x27;t get out and flies don&#x27;t get in.  </li>
            <li> Fit perfectly with a good seal the first time.</li>
            <li> It fit the True Value 5 gallon pail that I had with a garbage bag liner perfectly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this is perfect and highly recommended for  &amp;#34;whats about to happen&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> by far the best investment for a woman camping...!!!!</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for us with 2 young grandchildren</li>
            <li> In an emergency I am sure that it would come in handy.</li>
            <li> So easy!</li>
            <li> works great, such a great deal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it advertises to be, and did a great job</li>
            <li> The lid closes very securely so that  odors will, hopefully, not escape.</li>
            <li> Very cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> We loved how it fit easily onto a 5 gallon bucket.  </li>
            <li> But she thinks it&#x27;s way better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Fits on top of an orange home depot 5 gallon bucket.</li>
            <li> I love this seat.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad we did.  </li>
            <li> and I was concerned about odors escaping as I put it together, but figured this was one sure way to &#x27;field test&#x27; my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went to Home Depot and got one of their orange buckets, filled it with Dollar Store supplies* and Viola!  </li>
            <li> What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Would have liked for this to actually fit on a five gallon bucket.</li>
            <li> No pun intended :)</li>
            <li> it HAS to be more comfy than sitting on the edge of the 5 gallon bucket - and I hope to never need to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> These are great for camping with no facilities or just not wanting to get out of your nice, warm tent in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> More kitty litter on top covered up the odor.</li>
            <li> i drop bombs and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought more than one of these.</li>
            <li> Made tent camp life considerably more livable.</li>
            <li> Lined them from top over seat and everything.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So Light !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This was one of the best things I purchased for our recent camping trip!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars if I could safely leave the lid on for transport.</li>
            <li> Like some folks have mentioned, using scented kitty litter will keep the odors even more at bay, and absorb the liquids.</li>
            <li> This product is so much better.</li>
            <li> Anyway, It is sturdy and stable, and (with the right bucket)it is good to have for an emergency or for camping.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would work great in an emergency situation where normal plumbing/water systems are out.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> You do have to apply a good amount of pressure the first time.</li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable, but better than sitting on just the top of a bucket.</li>
            <li> camping thing that with a 5 gallon bucket can really come in handy on any camping trip you may go on !</li>
            <li> This is a great way to live outdoors but not have to &#x27;go&#x27; outdoors.  </li>
            <li> A Clean Up Saver !</li>
            <li> The toilet seat is a perfect fit and snaps on snugly to the bucket.</li>
            <li> It is very good for the price, I think it do the same as you buy an espencer one.</li>
            <li> This also sits at a more comfortable height than the camp toilets.  </li>
            <li> If it had fit, I would&#x27;ve been decently pleased with the quality of the product for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> My six year old daughter thought it was great for camping.  </li>
            <li> This works great for our 3 year old grand-daughter at our backwoods cabin.  </li>
            <li> They are still usable, but could be a better fit</li>
            <li> A lot more comfortable than sitting on a bucket without it</li>
            <li> After doing it this way I was able to fit the lid onto every bucket I had in my house which included buckets from Aubuchon, Walmart, VIP, and Home Depot.</li>
            <li> fast deliver and good product</li>
            <li> No smell, and easy clean up!</li>
            <li> Was very happy to read the other reviews about using kitty litter.  </li>
            <li> The garbage bag removed easily for disposal.  </li>
            <li> (Put a plastic garbage bag in it for easy disposal.)</li>
            <li> I think it would be easy to make this a five star product though.</li>
            <li> Alone, it&#x27;s compact &amp; easy to store.  </li>
            <li> Easy to take on and off bucket.</li>
            <li> Easy Flush</li>
            <li> it easily snapped onto the bucket and has not been a problem since.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to snap off from the buckets as well, so no complain from me.</li>
            <li> We got a 5 gallon frosting bucket from the local doughnut shop and the seat fits nicely and makes a good seal.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend buying sturdy plastic bags to line the bucket.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very light weight, concerned it will brake quickly.</li>
            <li> Good price for a great little luxury when camping!</li>
            <li> The seat and lid snap on to any bucket I&#x27;ve tried, tho many have a problem finding a proper bucket, I have been successful with any/every bucket I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> The seat looked fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably fine but the 5 gallon bucket I&#x27;m trying to attach it to will not accept it.</li>
            <li> The lid itself could be shaped more ergonomically, and a sturdier plastic is something I&#x27;d be willing to pay more for.</li>
            <li> I got this to work on a Home Depot orange 5 gal bucket just fine.</li>
            <li> and it fits fine.</li>
            <li> the are cheap yet strong),</li>
            <li> is strong, seals up great around a standard 5 gallon bucket.  </li>
            <li> Fit kids up to 200+ person just fine.</li>
            <li> It would probably be great for camping, especially with kids who may not have mastered the fine art of squatting over a hole in the ground.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars if the Jerks that distribute this didn&#x27;t put on a HUGE label on the cover (with advertising and no helpful information) that took me about 15 minutes to remove with a paint scraper and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> and I find it to be rather comfortable and stable even for some extended 10 plus minute visits, considering my 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic alternative.  </li>
            <li> I test fitted the seat on a 5 gallon bucket from Home Depot and it fit snug.</li>
            <li> This seat didn&#x27;t even remotely fit our 5 gallon bucket.</li>
            <li> This bucket , along with it&#x27;s Canadian-made competitor, wouldn&#x27;t fit onto an ACE Hardware 5 gallon bucket.  </li>
            <li> Bucket\\&quot; and they both fit.</li>
            <li> We took the lid after it arrived to Home Depot to try to fit it</li>
            <li> It fit nothing in the store.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these which were supposed to fit any 5 or 6 gallon bucket.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> happy with this seat and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> It appears to fit snugly to the bucket.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*TP, Baby Wipes, Kitchen trash bags, cheap scented cat litter, disinfectant spray,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thicker plastic and there is also a rubber seal inside the lid to give it a snug fit when you close it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Had to search for a bucket it fit.</li>
            <li> It looks to be serviceable even though it is made of light weight plastic.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, firm and sturdy and it fits perfectly on my 5 gallon buckets</li>
            <li> bucket, may fit a 6 gal., but I&#x27;ve never seen a 6 gal.</li>
            <li> but it did fit onto our Home Depot 5 gal bucket.....</li>
            <li> The plastic is easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> but it will fit with effort....</li>
            <li> We were happy that it is sturdy and can handle a larger bottom.</li>
            <li> hoped it would fit snugly on one of them.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable.</li>
            <li> This works great with blue walmart bucket.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, we had a 4.5 gal bucket that had held joint compound.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the one star reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t fit a bucket.</li>
            <li> This seat fit the plastic bucket we had.  </li>
            <li> Matched the 3 1/2 green bucket perfectly</li>
            <li> and it was a good alternative for those unexpected emergency moments.</li>
            <li> OK, OK, she was worried about the whole disaster thing</li>
            <li> Best of all, when used with a liner (we use doubled tall kitchen bags) and an absorbing material (kitty litter, saw dust or peat moss), disposal is as simple as tying up the bag and putting it into the dumpster.  </li>
            <li> This lid snaps down very securely over a 5 gallon bucket lid and did a great job.  </li>
            <li> fits perfectly on a five gallon bucket, rubber seal securely closes to keep out smells - it&#x27;s comfortable - not a grand ritz</li>
            <li> What can you say about a toilet seat, works great.</li>
            <li> We bought this toilet seat from \\&quot;Number 1 in Service\\&quot; (fulfilled by Amazon) and it works great.</li>
            <li> As its got a good seal and easy open lid.</li>
            <li> No more looking for the perfect log to sit on while driving logging roads looking for grouse.</li>
            <li> This is something I think everybody should have, for emergencies or just for the fact your toilet may stop up or backup and this will come in very handy to use temporarily.  </li>
            <li> the contents, while transporting to be dumped, are well contained and clean to carry.</li>
            <li> , I have a full bathroom when I add the bucket shower hose to the mix.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for late night potty needs while tent camping.</li>
            <li> Everyone loved it, especially the ladies.</li>
            <li> Definitely will make a good seat to do your business when camping.  </li>
            <li> I do not use this lid for transporting a full bucket.</li>
            <li> Even doing that it is still more comfortable and way more convenient than simply using a bucket and snapping a lid on every time.</li>
            <li> As an avid tinkerer and outdoor project guy, my bathroom is a long way from the garage where I spend most of my free time, I needed something convenient to use in order to answer that important call of nature !!  </li>
            <li> Yes , and fit the home depot bucket with a costco garbage bag folded over the rim just right.  </li>
            <li> Fit right on to my 5 gallon bucket.</li>
            <li> Good for what it is, not for a large adult.</li>
            <li> This is super sturdy.  </li>
            <li> This one does fit nicely on a Lowe&#x27;s blue five gallon bucket both by itself and when snapped over a plastic bag liner.  </li>
            <li> I shopped around and amazon had good prices on these bucket style toilet seat lids.</li>
            <li> Watch My Private Room TV In Total Joy !</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for the ladies who love to camp.</li>
            <li> My wife wasn&#x27;t comfortable camping, because there wasn&#x27;t always a bathroom close, this made her more comfortable and probably a lot cleaner solution than using public camping bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> It fit on the first bucket I tried, a Home Depot bucket.</li>
            <li> everyone of them said they would actually use it if they had to....and that they were surprised how comfortable it was for being plastic and attached to a 5 gallon bucket lol...</li>
            <li> The fit to bucket is snug but not difficult to remove and the lid fits snug with a gasket to hold in moisture and smells.  </li>
            <li> This is a handy way to have a cheap emergency toilet and not have to make a run to the bathhouse or woods.  </li>
            <li> I have those &amp;#34;food safe&amp;#34; white 5 gallon buckets that you can buy at home depot, and this Tote-able Toilet Seat/Lid fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Of course not as comfortable as as a regular toilet, but a very good alternative if convenience is what you seek.</li>
            <li> This seat is great for kids, but for an adult size butt, better be careful!  </li>
            <li> Works as advertised - positive snap onto the bucket - comfortable for adults of any size.  </li>
            <li> We live in an area that recently experienced flooding that knocked out sewer lines for the next couple of months</li>
            <li> The seal and the tight lid do a great job of containing odour and keeping pests out!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend for the price and mainly comfort to anyone who is trying to decide from the many out ere, plus price since I didn&#x27;t want to spend slot of money on a item like this and put more towards other more valued items....</li>
            <li> Had the manufacturers simply used a durable plastic, the kind that doesn&#x27;t crack, this would be a 5 star item.  </li>
            <li> the cat liter absorbed all the moisture.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re catering to a city queen who loathes the prospect of popping a squat, it&#x27;d be useful.</li>
            <li> I got this to fit on top of a seven gallon bucket (only for the height).</li>
            <li> Worth the $$.  </li>
            <li> taste in my mouth from this purchasing experience, but it&#x27;s better than actually using this product and expecting it to fit and perform as specified.  </li>
            <li> Stores away nicely until the next trip.</li>
            <li> Well made &amp; worth the money asked.</li>
            <li> Simple but effective.</li>
            <li> Well made, better than other brands, tighter seal and more durable.</li>
            <li> Ok this product is simple and straightforward.</li>
            <li> Great little seat and does exactly  as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy and snaps right on to the bucket, in my case a HomDep orange &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s do this&amp;#34; bucket.</li>
            <li> Snaps right on to a Home Depot orange bucket.</li>
            <li> Priced right.</li>
            <li> so when I find the right one, it should work.</li>
            <li> yes that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> But it snapped right on the bucket I bought at Lowes for $3 bucks, no problem.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for what we need and the cover snaps on very tight to a 5-gallon pail.</li>
            <li> If you have to cart your own toilet around, this is the way to do it.</li>
            <li> I also own one of those camping fold up toilets, that the come with bags and a clip on toilet seat, without any lid to contain the odors.</li>
            <li> It actually fits perfect and creates a tight seal.</li>
            <li> I certainly recommend this appliance for campers and preppers!</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t fit on my 3 different size of buckets, it is quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> Construction is adequate at this point because I have not used it in the real world.</li>
            <li> The seal is a good feature though not water tight.</li>
            <li> it works very very well ..</li>
            <li> This seat sure beats some of the other options available  when roughing it.</li>
            <li> thanks alot...........!</li>
            <li> I intend to line the bucket with a 13 gallon kitchen trash bag first, then the Wal-Mart bag.  </li>
            <li> Ok...I took my city girl wife camping for the FIRST TIME.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t pick the whole thing up by the hinge!  </li>
            <li> a pottie ;-)</li>
            <li> I only give 2 star for this product,for some reason it doesn&#x27;t fit well on my 5 gallon bucket!</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t think he would be able to use it while camping because he&#x27;s a pretty big guy (6&#x27;3-260lbs)</li>
            <li> Sure will beat squatting over a bucket in the middle of the night while camping!!</li>
            <li> The pump quit working on the first fill of water.  </li>
            <li> The kids love knowing we have a tiny potty just for them.</li>
            <li> Keep One Ready !</li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon !</li>
            <li> Then Ready !</li>
            <li> The ring that I used for the home depot bucket was the inner most ring.</li>
            <li> I first received the seat</li>
            <li> This was the first seat I purchased</li>
            <li> More importantly, the seal/snap down lid/kitty litter combo</li>
            <li> Sat on it and it feels comfortable and adequate enough for temporary or emergecny use.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see that the lid fit tightly on my 5 gallon bucket after seeing several reviews that it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> While not quite as comfy as a regular toilet seat (no surprise, esp since I am nearly 6ft tall and in no way &#x27;dainty&#x27;), it does the job.</li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t sit right but snaps on nice and tight to the Home Depot bucket.</li>
            <li> doesnt snap very tight to the bucket, otherwise is a good product</li>
            <li> Molded plastic that doesn&#x27;t really fit securely on any of the 9 empty buckets I&#x27;ve tried it on.</li>
            <li> I expected it to fit securely as was advertised</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to have as an option to use when rain or cold makes going outdoors for that scenic stroll to the restrooms about as appealing as a trip to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Soooooo much better than emptying the holding tank of the camp toilet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better made than the Luggable Loo toilet seat.</li>
            <li> I just received this tote-able toilet seat and found out why there is so much confusion about fitting these onto a bucket.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toilet seat for my emergency/ BOV/ camping kit awhile back, but had never used it beyond snapping it to a bucket to be sure it fit correctly.</li>
            <li> The lid also is easy to snap close and open and</li>
            <li> One enhancement that I plan to try is to nest one bucket into a second five gallon bucket to raise the seat of the toilet to a more comfortable height.  </li>
            <li> We take weekends on the boat, and have found this by far the best way to deal with toilet waste.</li>
            <li> I was afraid at first that it would be flimsy, but it really was made good, and perfect for camping.. using an ordinary hardware store bucket..</li>
            <li> We were in a large tent</li>
            <li> I put a large trash bag inside it, and dumped some kitty litter.</li>
            <li> the gasket seals in odors which is great since we keep it in the tent for my 2 little girls to &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> So, I left the bucket and seat in the sun until they were very hot and presto!</li>
            <li> It was a huge relief to find something as simple as this to solve a problem that seemed unsolvable!  </li>
            <li> this seat won&#x27;t fit - despite what most negative reviews have to say.</li>
            <li> No pathogens or parasites survive composting and the compost is ready to add to a garden, orchard or flower beds.</li>
            <li> We have the Real Tree Bucket from Wal-Mart and their website says the width is 13.8&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product made our camping trip so much easier...</li>
            <li> I would like for it to seal better when closed.</li>
            <li> It all works out very well.  </li>
            <li> This seat DOES fit the orange Home Depot 5 gallon bucket and both white 5 gallon Walmart buckets.</li>
            <li> Tried 5 different 5 gallon pails from Home Depot, Lowes, Menards, a joint compound pail &amp; a food grade pail from a bakery &amp; none would fit this seat.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected,</li>
            <li> I put this lid inside the foldable tent and we are ready to go camping.</li>
            <li> You still feel like, well, you know, but you were ready for it.</li>
            <li> Seat feels like a regular fit.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> We used it lined with a regular, but heavy-duty, trash bag and partially filled with odor-absorbing kitty litter.</li>
            <li> fits all buckets used out camping very sturdy</li>
            <li> Product description is incorrect and misleading; not sized to fit standard buckets, as confirmed by others recent to this review.  </li>
            <li> No, and thanks for nothing.  </li>
            <li> let&#x27;s just say this items use is really in a pinch or emergency folks and face your taking a dump in a bucket</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was finding a bucket it would fit.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Need a bed pan(pale) for the end of my pregnancy waited awhile to get and now it doesnt&#x27; fit standard 5 gal.</li>
            <li> While the product snaps securely onto my bucket and will do the job, I will only give it 2 stars-</li>
            <li> The locking tab/latch on the lid doesn&#x27;t engage the seat very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Again</li>
            <li> Very durable and well made.</li>
            <li> Just put a garbage bag inside, put the lid on and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> If the bucket were to fall over the lid would readily pop off</li>
            <li> After snapping the lid on and off maybe a dozen times it became much easier to snap on by hand]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because it took a while to find a bucket that it would fit</li>
            <li> but it does fit on the all white one (non-branded) lowes sells.</li>
            <li> I love this little tote able toilet seat and lid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; tall and 235 pounds and though the seat&#x27;s too small for me to want to spend all day enjoying the view it&#x27;s sized adequately for its purpose.</li>
            <li> other than that is good, Im not taking it back</li>
            <li> The toilet seat is working perfectly for solid waste with no smells.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to report that this product is performing extremely well.</li>
            <li> They are stronger than the other seats, better quality.</li>
            <li> The rubber seal on this seems to contain odors better than other models without.</li>
            <li> When combined with that all important bucket, it becomes a functional emergency or boondocking toilet.  </li>
            <li> This toilet seat fits 5 gallon buckets nicely and is comfortable although a bit small.</li>
            <li> almost too easy, it almost falls off its that loose (?).</li>
            <li> Just put bag down in hole and fold back over seat for a sanitary way to make sure everything stays clean during our trip.</li>
            <li> There is a snapping tab to hold the lid down between uses but using this bucket on a boat I might be inclined to rig up some bungee cord to make sure the lid gasket stays snug on the seat.</li>
            <li> Once the lid is closed there is no odor and snaps on and off the bucket easily.</li>
            <li> Ok, should cost much less, handle gets in the way and is unneccessary</li>
            <li> This portable potty is mainly used by our toddlers because they can&#x27;t make it all the way to the bathrooms while we are camping.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the attached lid</li>
            <li> Then I decided to inspect the seat more closely and realized that underneath there are several rings which are meant for different size buckets.</li>
            <li> It fit well and didnt seem loose.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for emergency kits, campervans/BOVs, car camping or any situation where facilities are unavailable, unsanitary...</li>
            <li> Highly recomend for those of you who did not want to deal with a portapotty.</li>
            <li> It fit really snug and I won&#x27;t worry about it slipping when I sit on it!</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as it appeared, but once fitted on a 5gal bucket, it will do well for anyone except a very large/tall adult.  </li>
            <li> Also, it seems a bit cheap for the money spent.  </li>
            <li> I have used pine shavings (hamster bedding) from Walmart and $3 worth will last over a week.  </li>
            <li> I am a heavy person and was worry that it was not going to withstand my weight, but it was safe and I never felt that it was buckling.  </li>
            <li> With that being said, I think it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> when you do go to open it after a few sessions the smell can be very overwhelming- duh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> It does NOT fit most buckets</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since a few people said this seat didn&#x27;t snap onto their 5 gallon bucket.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for an emergency toilet seat to use on a bucket, for comfort use a 6 gal bucket!!</li>
            <li> I can buy commercial urea and mix it with water, but why buy it and flush my own down the commode.</li>
            <li> Every camping family, especially those with kids, should have one as well--it&#x27;s far more convenient to use with a toddler with 200 trips to the bathroom per day than running to the campground toilet!  </li>
            <li> When done just unclip the cover, remove the plastic bags and put new ones.  </li>
            <li> I just bought the lid, went and got a new Lowes bucket</li>
            <li> I live in town.</li>
            <li> The lid is slightly flimsy and appears the hinge might break easily, but we will see.</li>
            <li> Basic, inexpensive, comfortable and a big step up from hovering over a hole in the ground.</li>
            <li> You do need to place the bucket near to a wall, tree or close to the side of your tent when the seat is in use, since the lid makes it a bit top heavy</li>
            <li> Not quite big enough to fit over it.</li>
            <li> turn it upside down and push it onto the lid and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Cramped quarters meant that there was no way to have it truly out of potential nose range, so it&#x27;s odorless nature was well appreciated!  </li>
            <li> I also read another recommendation to use scent free cat litter to keep odor down.  </li>
            <li> It fits a 5 gallon bucket as promised &amp; the lid does lean back far enough so as not to get in the way of being able to sit on it properly.</li>
            <li> We also tried a Home Depot bucket all of these for 4 to 6 and half gallon buckets this fit NONE of them.</li>
            <li> This toilet seat with lid was much more expensive than many others offered but because&lt;</li>
            <li> Comfortable seat, too, except that the nice tight seal created by the necessary rubber gasket will create some condensation on the seat &amp; lid after a few days of use, so be aware that you will need to wipe that dry before using!</li>
            <li> We double line the bucket with large kitchen trash bags and add some kitty liter.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time fitting it to the bucket I had.  </li>
            <li> The one that was shipped to me DOES NOT fit securely on an orange Home Depot bucket.</li>
            <li> a cheap green &#x27;faux&#x27; grass mat on the ground</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use it yet, but had no trouble setting it</li>
            <li> In fact, the lid was tucked away in a closet, nearly forgotten.</li>
            <li> Used this for camping when the facilities were either non existent or too far from camp.</li>
            <li> Called Emergency Essentials customer service on 5/5/2014 &amp; spoke to a polite young lady about this problem.</li>
            <li> Provides a ready mechanism to accomplish #2&#x27;s during camping, while still maintaining a reasonable form (e.g. not squatting over a log in the woods that has poison ivy growing on it resulting in a rash for several weeks after the camping event for a non-experienced friend who will likely never go camping with you again,</li>
            <li> and this is by far the easiest, cheapest option for weekenders.</li>
            <li> No trouble snapping it onto a 5 gallon bucket.</li>
            <li> im keeping the hills alive and poopless..</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to fit it on a bucket you have laying around the house or the yard for 10 years with dings and dents in it it might not fit</li>
            <li> So I was getting ready to return the seat back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m around 250 pounds and nearly 6&#x27; tall.  </li>
            <li> but any way I got one from my local HomeDepot which did a perfect fit have not used it yet because of our weather conditions been to cold but am planning a camping trip in the next few weeks which I am getting prepared for and this item will be included.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just add 2 or 3 inches of sawdust or peatmoss to the bottom and add a little more every time you use the toilet</li>
            <li> so you can close it airtight if you can&#x27;t empty it right away.  </li>
            <li> , I can say that it is sturdy enough, fits well enough, and seals well enough that is should be fine when put to the ultimate test.</li>
            <li> You can store toilet paper or wipes, and garbage bags in the bucket until you&#x27;re ready to use them.</li>
            <li> Each morning I would dig a small hole, dump the bucket, change the kitty littler (no smell thanks to the kitty litter) and start with a fresh bag.</li>
            <li> I looked through all the reviews on Amazon of similar products before selecting this particular product.  </li>
            <li> (a small shovel is good idea to add if you can, or want to bury the bagged waste)</li>
            <li> Once full it is easy to remove the seat and dump the contents into a slow compost pile to break down and age for a couple years.</li>
            <li> Wal-Mart and other plastic bags will fit over the bucket and under the toilet seat without any problem.  </li>
            <li> I use garbage bags to keep the bucket clean and to be able to seal the waste, but this seat is not a good design.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit a standard 5 gallon bucket, I bought three of these for emergency use or camping and none of them fit on the buckets, they are slightly too small.</li>
            <li> (We&#x27;re assuming you went into another room and closed the door first.)</li>
            <li> Change your bags out before they get full and HEAVY.)</li>
            <li> That ended abruptly this morning, when the main sewer pump where I live died unexpectedly, leaving everyone with no bathroom facilities until sometime tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I live in a Tiny Home with a waterless commode system.</li>
            <li> I use it with a 5 gallon plastic bucket I found in my garage and while it&#x27;s a hard snap on and off, it works fine.</li>
            <li> Since a single bucket with the seat weights little and seems a bit \\&quot;tippy\\&quot;, I also plan to put some sand in the bottom bucket to see if it can help make a more stable overall setup.</li>
            <li> VERY tight fit on a standard 5 gallon bucket...</li>
            <li> But no worse than standard toilet seats.</li>
            <li> Company offers to sell their (standard?)</li>
            <li> Another feature worth considering is the fact the way this toilet seat is designed and the way it snugly fits the bucket and how your bottom actually makes a tight seal when sitting on it, any loud or excessive flatulence is actually muffled when in use which is important in a possible&lt;br /&gt;potential embarrassing moment.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it on I immediately assumed the same as other reviewers about the home depot bucket.</li>
            <li> It is a decent buy, especially compared to more expensive portable potties.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to get too excited about a product like this, but it will work quite well.</li>
            <li> It fit the 5 gallon pail snuggly and snaps tight when closed.  </li>
            <li> I have three young girls I am introducing to camping and a &amp;#34;city&amp;#34; wife who needs &amp;#34;adequate toilet facilities.&amp;#34;  Along with a pop up tent, bucket, can liner (cat box liners</li>
            <li> Well, as far as toilet seat comfort this one is not comfy!</li>
            <li> Well, it was very hard to snap it on the first time but much easier after that.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular one, because someone wrote that the seat cover did not go all the way up on one of the other seats that Amazon sells.  </li>
            <li> sturdy and barely big enough for an adult but big enough nonetheless.</li>
            <li> No more uncomfortable hunts, lol.</li>
            <li> The seat is priced reasonably but Alas, they chose a brittle plastic and mine broke before reaching its first camp.  </li>
            <li> It might take a little muscle to insert the lid, but it&#x27;s definitely a perfectly tight fit.</li>
            <li> but after asking other purchasers which buckets it would fit, they assured me it would fit and that it was just very tight and difficult to snap onto the buckets.  </li>
            <li> When I first purchased this I was going to give it a bad review because it didn&#x27;t fit any of the three 5 gal buckets I had</li>
            <li> bucket with ease and feels like you&#x27;re sitting on a regular toilet.</li>
            <li> Now its so simple and when I go camping I can use it for a composting toilet.</li>
            <li> I now have a totally convenient and portable toilet to take with me camping, or to use in emergencies.  </li>
            <li> As the rear and sides of the bucket lip slide into the seating ring you will be able to look down at the front of the bucket and see the lip bulging out over approximately 6 inches of the front of the ring when it is almost seated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re short and thin, you&#x27;ll probably find it adequate.  </li>
            <li> I should have investigated the bucket lid more thoroughly, instead of simply taking the company&#x27;s word; now I&#x27;m left with an awkward piece of plastic with propriety fitment needs.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this brand of seat for as long as I&#x27;m in my Tiny Home.</li>
            <li> It fits squarely onto my Big Box hardware store 5 gallon bucket and stays there as long as you don&#x27;t lift it by the &amp;#34;rear end&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> The plastic seat seems a little thin, but when you put it on the bucket it is ok.  </li>
            <li> odour absorbing cat litter and not one complaint about the bathroom for the entire trip!&lt;br /&gt;Seat</li>
            <li> I used the toilet for three days sprinkling cat liter each time</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who needs a portable toilet.</li>
            <li> its a toilet lid and seat.....</li>
            <li> We bought this as a temporary toilet seat/lid for our storm shelter if needed.  </li>
            <li> Buy lots of toilet paper too.</li>
            <li> Also used when the toilet at home was out of commission</li>
            <li> + survival toilet for under $20.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this toilet seat for emergency purposes.  </li>
            <li> Just find a bucket it fits on and throw in a plastic bag, tada! Toilet.</li>
            <li> But then this toilet seat saved the day.</li>
            <li> If I ever manage to get some land or lease it I will be setting up a cabin with a composting toilet</li>
            <li> What can I say about a toilet?</li>
            <li> Had a porta potti that you added water and pumped like a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; toilet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toilet seat that affixes to any $3 5-gallon paint bucket.</li>
            <li> It fits the rim of my 5 gallon bucket and should work as a temporary solution to toilet use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to see if I could save some water by making humanure with a composting toilet.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it is a plastic seat to use for an emergency toilet.</li>
            <li> Brought this toilet seat a couple of weeks ago for my fishing pontoon boat.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the complains posted in Amazon, the toilet seat fits all the 5 gallon buckets I found in the house, including Lowe&#x27;s, Home Depot, paint, etc.</li>
            <li> Enter toilet seat and bucket!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit with a gamma seal lid, which makes a 5 gal bucket toilet ... useless.</li>
            <li> At this point,along with slow delivery, I can only assume that the customer service manager &amp; Emergency Essentials is high on sales and lite on customer service.</li>
            <li> The only time the comfort of a full size toilet was missed was during the subsequent cleanup of the second order of business which was slightly awkward but tolerable.]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wondered what product would be so amazing or terrible as to elicit my first review, and this is it.  </li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s just too damned cold to get out of the tent at 2AM :)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t fit any of the 3 types of 5 gallon buckets I have.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but handle carefully if you want it to last</li>
            <li> Only issue is that I&#x27;ll likely never use it again after smelling the combination of cat litter and human waste.  </li>
            <li> Needed this for a long time.</li>
            <li> We got this to carry with us when we go out on long kayak trips.  </li>
            <li> She offered to sell me a pail for $5.00 which I agreed to as long as they would cover shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Bought this in case we had long power outages.  </li>
            <li> I just would not have spent the extra</li>
            <li> The inner part of the lid has a rubber seal, and when closed it can help seal out the odors.</li>
            <li> you want to use it for convenience at a festival or other event where maintained chemical toilets are present, stick to the chemical toilets (even if a bunch of tripping hippies have sprayed their vegan diet byproducts and PBR all over the place).  </li>
            <li> While my neighbors have been making the 3+ mile commute to the nearest public potty all day (or &#x27;roughing it in the back 40&#x27;), I have had this little unit, set up on a Home Depot 5 gal bucket with a plastic bag liner and some kitty litter, to use.</li>
            <li> Lay the seat onto firm but soft flat surface (carpet) upside down with the lid opening tab facing away from you and the hinge toward you.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Even after sustained regular use, the seal remained functional and the toilet set remained tight sealing for odor control.  </li>
            <li> I understand that one is limited by the size of the 5 gallon opening.  </li>
            <li> I think the pail is slightly too big</li>
            <li> The whole concept is flawed because a seat that approximately fits a 5 gallon can isn&#x27;t appropriate for an adult behind.</li>
            <li> If it fit, it would be fine; however, it does not, and it&#x27;s shocking how they could mess that up.  </li>
            <li> For just over $20 (lid+bucket+kitty litter), I have had a functional, sanitary toilet all day and night in a real life, sewer related emergency that has had other, unprepared folks scrambling, inconvenienced, and majorly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I put kitty litter in the bottom, lined the bucket with a grocery bag that had a small rip in the bottom (enough to let liquid through) and asked the family to please change the bag if they left anything other than liquid.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for a plastic toilet lid.  </li>
            <li> Since home depot refuses to honor veterans cards anymore unless you are a disabled vet, cross them off your shopping list.</li>
            <li> Once on it worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I would not fit a standard 5 gallon paint</li>
            <li> I used 13 gallon heavy duty plastic bags - double it to prevent leaks and the cheapest cat litter i found.  </li>
            <li> No much to say.</li>
            <li> Does not fit a standard size 5 gal.</li>
            <li> The handle for carrying it was a differentiator, works as expected.</li>
            <li> Dispose of waste properly!</li>
            <li> empty 5 gallon bucket and some reading material....</li>
            <li> The Rubber seal on the lid when closed keeps the smells contained, and the bugs out.</li>
            <li> so we needed a solution for solid waste.</li>
            <li> When the lid is closed you can pick it up by the handle on the lid, but not by the bucket handle because it won&#x27;t go around the lid.</li>
            <li> When the lip is no longer slipping into the seating ring, smack the bulging part with your fist or a rubber mallet, which will pop it into place with an audible snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product does not fit any 5 gallon bucket we have tried which is now five different buckets</li>
            <li> does NOT fit your standard size bucket.</li>
            <li> First time use: lay the lid upside down on the ground, turn the bucket upside down and press down hard.</li>
            <li> It is thin, smaller than a regular toilet seat</li>
            <li> Loosely place the bucket upside down onto the center ring of the seat with the bucket handle lined up with the seat lid tab (away from the hinge).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do your business and throw some sawdust over it afterward, and other than wet saw dust, there won&#x27;t be a smell.  </li>
            <li> One is in my camper, the other in a remote yurt.</li>
            <li> We have been having trouble deciding on a toilet for our vintage camper trailer and we bought this for in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Use a liner along with saw dust, peat moss, or cat litter for liquid &amp; odor management, along with the snap-tight lid, and there are literally NO odors even when the well used toilet is just a few feet</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the reviews that say this toilet seat does not fit the orange home depot buckets.</li>
            <li> no more running to the outhouse in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> No more freezing outside.  </li>
            <li> I agree with all the other one stars.</li>
            <li> I tried it on other types of buckets  </li>
            <li> I was using other containers as a urinal and transferring it.</li>
            <li> I should have believed other reviewers who said this did not snap onto pails, but just lodged atop them.  </li>
            <li> Tent camping with small children is the pits!&lt;br /&gt;Not unless you have a toilet that is within or close-by your tent!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are putting liquid waste in our camping toilet so I can&#x27;t say how the seat/frosting bucket combo would would with liquid waste.</li>
            <li> bucket, shipping makes it not worth it.  </li>
            <li> so we didn&#x27;t have to walk to the restrooms in the wee hours when it&#x27;s still dark out.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> When mounting the lid, put the lid upside down on the floor and then push the bucket down into the lid.</li>
            <li> I took the bucket inside, sat down and relieved myself.</li>
            <li> Pine isn&#x27;t a bad smell and the bucket cleans out easily with just a rinse.&lt;br /&gt;The seat I received was dark green though in the picture it appears black.  </li>
            <li> If you work in a location a &amp;#34;far piece&amp;#34; from a bathroom, keep one of this hidden in a closet.</li>
            <li> The lid snaps down tight and it pops on and off a 5 gallon bucket with ease.</li>
            <li> In case of accidental tip-over inside the tent, it will help minimize the mess.</li>
            <li> but the problem is that it does not fit the average 5 gallon bucket.  </li>
            <li> just had to firmly push it down all around like a lid on a plastic storage bowl.</li>
            <li> Seals tight on 5 gal bucket witch helps with odor control.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that a plastic liner will work well hanging over the edges of the bucket since the lid snapped on quite tightly -</li>
            <li> So no matter how tight the gasket from the lid to seat the problem is the seat to bucket.  </li>
            <li> The unit is compact and lightweight and with a little manipulation the lid snaps snugly onto a 5 gallon paint bucket.  </li>
            <li> We added a liner with a little cat litter and wala...</li>
            <li> A little bit of bother, but it works.  </li>
            <li> The plastic does seem a little flimsy, but the 5 gallon bucket is bearing your weight, so the seat does hold up.</li>
            <li> (A little helpful hint here.</li>
            <li> Perhaps some of them are a little easier</li>
            <li> Works and is less expensive than other similar products.</li>
            <li> Does not fit all plastic tubs it says sit does.</li>
            <li> It was purchased for use in Africa where buckets are constructed using metric measurements, so it will not fit on the equivalent to a five-gallon bucket, which is 20 liters.  </li>
            <li> Trouble is, the loo is being used.</li>
            <li> Messy job.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying the bucket before the seat was delivered, and found out that it would not fit the Home Depot 5-gallon bucket.  </li>
            <li> After you take it on and off a few times it gets easier.</li>
            <li> We lined bucket with a heavy duty plastic bag and used kitty litter like people suggested in reviews I had read.  </li>
            <li> it is a waste of money</li>
            <li> does not fit the home depot orange bucket</li>
            <li> The rubber gasket between the seat and cover works really well to seal out any unpleasant odors.</li>
            <li> and it does not seal tight enough that the rubber gasket even touches the plastic below it so its practically useless.</li>
            <li> so I have a very tight lid for that purpose.</li>

            <li> I cut a small downward slot in the bucket and popped it on.  </li>
            <li> Based on the injection mold design, I would expect adding a coupe hooks wouldn&#x27;t be that difficult, but that would likely limit the bucket options as a result.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> item was as described</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. We have 80 acres of timber with some friends and spend a lot of time there. However, there is no running water so she has to squat. Not anymore.  Look, it&#x27;s nothing great. Molded plastic that doesn&#x27;t really fit securely on any of the 9 empty buckets I&#x27;ve tried it on. The one that was shipped to me DOES NOT fit securely on an orange Home Depot bucket. But she thinks it&#x27;s way better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Had the manufacturers simply used a durable plastic, the kind that doesn&#x27;t crack, this would be a 5 star item.  The seat is priced reasonably but Alas, they chose a brittle plastic and mine broke before reaching its first camp.  Actually the lid split. The unit is compact and lightweight and with a little manipulation the lid snaps snugly onto a 5 gallon paint bucket.  It does the job, but handle carefully if you want it to last</li>
            <li> now I can poop in the garage, thanks alot...........!</li>
            <li> This mounts absolutely perfect on a 5 gallon bucket. We double line the bucket with large kitchen trash bags and add some kitty liter. This portable potty is mainly used by our toddlers because they can&#x27;t make it all the way to the bathrooms while we are camping. It is perfect and super easy!</li>
            <li> As an avid tinkerer and outdoor project guy, my bathroom is a long way from the garage where I spend most of my free time, I needed something convenient to use in order to answer that important call of nature !!  I have a standard white 5 gallon bucket that I purchased from Home Depot and I fill it up to about halfway with water. The toilet seat is a perfect fit and snaps on snugly to the bucket. I sit on it several times throughout the day and I find it to be rather comfortable and stable even for some extended 10 plus minute visits, considering my 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34; 225 pound stature. The rubber gasket between the seat and cover works really well to seal out any unpleasant odors. Of course not as comfortable as as a regular toilet, but a very good alternative if convenience is what you seek. Another feature worth considering is the fact the way this toilet seat is designed and the way it snugly fits the bucket and how your bottom actually makes a tight seal when sitting on it, any loud or excessive flatulence is actually muffled when in use which is important in a possible&lt;br /&gt;potential embarrassing moment. Fantastic product, just wish I purchased it sooner !!</li>
            <li> This toilet seat fits 5 gallon buckets nicely and is comfortable although a bit small. It is thin, smaller than a regular toilet seat and of course it&#x27;s made in China. If there had been an American made counterpart I would have bought it in a heartbeat. We use these at our camp. Just add 2 or 3 inches of sawdust or peatmoss to the bottom and add a little more every time you use the toilet and it will never smell or attract flies. Once full it is easy to remove the seat and dump the contents into a slow compost pile to break down and age for a couple years. No pathogens or parasites survive composting and the compost is ready to add to a garden, orchard or flower beds.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the cabin. We added a liner with a little cat litter and wala...no more running to the outhouse in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> Anyone who&#x27;s owned one of those expensive camp toilets with the water &amp;#34;flushing&amp;#34; and holding tank knows how horrible it is to empty the thing at the end of the camping trip.  This is a fantastic alternative.  Put a kitchen size trash bag in the 5-gallon bucket, snap the seat/lid on and keep some kitty litter next to it.  Do your business and sprinkle it with some kitty litter then close the lid.  The lid closes tightly enough that it keeps the smell in and the litter keeps the smell in check when in use.  At the end of the camping trip (or every day if getting enough use) simply pop the seat/lid off, tie up the trash bag and throw it away.  Soooooo much better than emptying the holding tank of the camp toilet.  This also sits at a more comfortable height than the camp toilets.  Basic, inexpensive, comfortable and a big step up from hovering over a hole in the ground.</li>
            <li> Very light weight, concerned it will brake quickly.</li>
            <li> It fit the True Value 5 gallon pail that I had with a garbage bag liner perfectly.  I also read another recommendation to use scent free cat litter to keep odor down.  I used the toilet for three days sprinkling cat liter each time I used it.  There was no odor and the cat liter absorbed all the moisture.  The garbage bag removed easily for disposal.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a portable toilet.</li>
            <li> I test fitted the seat on a 5 gallon bucket from Home Depot and it fit snug. Sat on it and it feels comfortable and adequate enough for temporary or emergecny use. I purchased this for our emergency kit. Hopefully we never have to use it, but if we do, it looks like it will do the job nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it advertises to be, and did a great job (I&#x27;m 6&#x27; tall and 245 lbs, and it didn&#x27;t even bat an eye).  Only issue is that I&#x27;ll likely never use it again after smelling the combination of cat litter and human waste.  I used to give cat waste a bad rap, until I realized it&#x27;s the litter that makes everything so terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use it for convenience at a festival or other event where maintained chemical toilets are present, stick to the chemical toilets (even if a bunch of tripping hippies have sprayed their vegan diet byproducts and PBR all over the place).  If you&#x27;re catering to a city queen who loathes the prospect of popping a squat, it&#x27;d be useful.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed when I go sit in my blind.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for a plastic toilet lid.  It works for it&#x27;s intended use.</li>
            <li> Does not fit all plastic tubs it says sit does.</li>
            <li> Fits on top of an orange home depot 5 gallon bucket. Has a rubber gasket to seal as well. A perfect fit for home depot orange buckets which they sell for $2.97.  You can put the Seat and Lid back in its bag where it will take up no room. It fits in back of the seat in a pickup truck or in the trunk of a car. Since home depot refuses to honor veterans cards anymore unless you are a disabled vet, cross them off your shopping list. I have. I used to spend over $1,500 a year there, no more. I take my business elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This seat didn&#x27;t even remotely fit our 5 gallon bucket. We have the Real Tree Bucket from Wal-Mart and their website says the width is 13.8&amp;#34;. If it had fit, I would&#x27;ve been decently pleased with the quality of the product for the price I paid. It&#x27;s made in China so take that for what it is.</li>
            <li> its a toilet lid and seat.....what&#x27;s left to say</li>
            <li> I love this seat. I&#x27;m a girl who loves to camp but not to &#x27;go&#x27; in the wilderness. I camp in a 1986 Hippie VW Vanagon, with the extra &#x27;tent&#x27; that I attach to the rear hatch, a tie dye sheet snapped into the back opening in the van, and a cheap green &#x27;faux&#x27; grass mat on the ground, I have a full bathroom when I add the bucket shower hose to the mix.  The seat and lid snap on to any bucket I&#x27;ve tried, tho many have a problem finding a proper bucket, I have been successful with any/every bucket I&#x27;ve tried.  I settled on a restaurant pickle bucket that I decorated for camping.  With grape scented cat litter, I&#x27;m all set.  This is a great way to live outdoors but not have to &#x27;go&#x27; outdoors.  Get one, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use it yet, but it looks up to the job.</li>
            <li> This bucket , along with it&#x27;s Canadian-made competitor, wouldn&#x27;t fit onto an ACE Hardware 5 gallon bucket.  I went to Home Depot and got an orange \\&quot;Homer&#x27;s All Purpose Bucket\\&quot; and they both fit.</li>
            <li> I went camping with my girlfriend and all of her friends. This product made our camping trip so much easier... I highly recommend this for the ladies who love to camp.</li>
            <li> Satisfactory...get the job done.  Still quite expensive for a piece of plastic and a rubber gasket.  Worked as advertised. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Seems like it would work out.  I would like for it to seal better when closed.</li>
            <li> We bought this as a temporary toilet seat/lid for our storm shelter if needed.  The only problem was that we could not find a 4.5 gallon bucket at Home Depot or any where else for that matter.  It is mentioned in the description that this lid fits best on a 4.5 gallon bucket.  We took the lid after it arrived to Home Depot to try to fit it and I&#x27;m glad we did.  It fit nothing in the store.  We finally wound up buying a bucket/lid combination that was made as a set.</li>
            <li> 6/9/15&lt;br /&gt;this is perfect and highly recommended for  &amp;#34;whats about to happen&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Sturdy and snaps right on to the bucket, in my case a HomDep orange &amp;#34;Let&#x27;s do this&amp;#34; bucket.</li>
            <li> Yes , and fit the home depot bucket with a costco garbage bag folded over the rim just right.  No more looking for the perfect log to sit on while driving logging roads looking for grouse.</li>
            <li> this fit great on a three gallon bucket regardless the directions said 4, 5 , 6 galllon bucket ...this is a great idea</li>
            <li> Got it, can&#x27;t wait to use it! Needed this for a long time. Thank  you ,  Linda</li>
            <li> Not bad for an emergency toilet seat to use on a bucket, for comfort use a 6 gal bucket!!</li>
            <li> I got this to fit on top of a seven gallon bucket (only for the height). I bought it for a prepping scenario, so I don&#x27;t know yet what will become of the bags that have been used in it, by I&#x27;m resourceful and will come up with a plan.  Wal-Mart and other plastic bags will fit over the bucket and under the toilet seat without any problem.  I intend to line the bucket with a 13 gallon kitchen trash bag first, then the Wal-Mart bag.  It all works out very well.  Be prepared!  Buy lots of toilet paper too.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time fitting it to the bucket I had.  I had to take off the lid and put some effort into it. Once on it worked as expected.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP THAT FITS NO STANDARD 5 GALLON BUCKETS.  DO NOT BUY THIS!&lt;br /&gt;DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use to be prepared for  an emergency.  It seems like it will do what it is supposed to do.  The plastic seat seems a little thin, but when you put it on the bucket it is ok.  It is a decent buy, especially compared to more expensive portable potties.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of these which were supposed to fit any 5 or 6 gallon bucket.  I tried 8 different buckets both 5 &amp; 6 gallon and the seats do not&lt;br /&gt;secure even though they have a rubber gasket.  This toilet seat with lid was much more expensive than many others offered but because&lt;br /&gt;this had rubber gaskets on the seat and lid I expected it to fit securely as was advertised but I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ok...I took my city girl wife camping for the FIRST TIME.  I knew if I didn&#x27;t attempt to give her home style luxuries I would probably never get to take her again.  We were in a large tent and I wanted an emergency bathroom for her if she got up during the night.  This lid snaps down very securely over a 5 gallon bucket lid and did a great job.  We were able to snap on the bucket with a plastic garbage bag tucked under it and it did great.  This is a handy way to have a cheap emergency toilet and not have to make a run to the bathhouse or woods.  I would recommend this product.  I plan to use this for overnight hunting trips too.  No more freezing outside.  Turn on the tent heater and go in the tent.  AWESOMENESS!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but it will get lots of use this summer as I camp with my granddaughter.  Looks like it will do the job.</li>
            <li> Works!  We got this to carry with us when we go out on long kayak trips.  Haven&#x27;t had to use it yet, but had no trouble setting it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple notes:&lt;br /&gt;- Put a bag in the bucket first.&lt;br /&gt;- When mounting the lid, put the lid upside down on the floor and then push the bucket down into the lid. Watch to make sure the edges don&#x27;t overlap and bend the edge wrong.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit. False advertising</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t leave home without it</li>
            <li> I purchased this toilet seat for my emergency/ BOV/ camping kit awhile back, but had never used it beyond snapping it to a bucket to be sure it fit correctly. In fact, the lid was tucked away in a closet, nearly forgotten. That ended abruptly this morning, when the main sewer pump where I live died unexpectedly, leaving everyone with no bathroom facilities until sometime tomorrow. While my neighbors have been making the 3+ mile commute to the nearest public potty all day (or &#x27;roughing it in the back 40&#x27;), I have had this little unit, set up on a Home Depot 5 gal bucket with a plastic bag liner and some kitty litter, to use. It is indoors and I was concerned about odors escaping as I put it together, but figured this was one sure way to &#x27;field test&#x27; my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to report that this product is performing extremely well. While not quite as comfy as a regular toilet seat (no surprise, esp since I am nearly 6ft tall and in no way &#x27;dainty&#x27;), it does the job. More importantly, the seal/snap down lid/kitty litter combo is containing all odors between uses. Disposal is as simple as popping off the lid and tying up the bag, which gives it points over flushable port a pots in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line- For just over $20 (lid+bucket+kitty litter), I have had a functional, sanitary toilet all day and night in a real life, sewer related emergency that has had other, unprepared folks scrambling, inconvenienced, and majorly uncomfortable. I highly recommend this product for emergency kits, campervans/BOVs, car camping or any situation where facilities are unavailable, unsanitary... or it&#x27;s just too damned cold to get out of the tent at 2AM :)</li>
            <li> fits perfectly on a five gallon bucket, rubber seal securely closes to keep out smells - it&#x27;s comfortable - not a grand ritz but hey!  It&#x27;s a bucket!  I would buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Snaps right on to a Home Depot orange bucket.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent seat for the camping lifestyle!  It almost makes you feel like you are at home when you have to go!.  It was purchased for use in Africa where buckets are constructed using metric measurements, so it will not fit on the equivalent to a five-gallon bucket, which is 20 liters.  However, since the seat was not meant to be used permanently on the bucket, we just use it with  a ten-liter bucket. After it is used, just remove the seat and replace the bucket cover.  You do need to place the bucket near to a wall, tree or close to the side of your tent when the seat is in use, since the lid makes it a bit top heavy and it can tip over.  Thankfully, the bucket has not yet tipped over when this happened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this seat and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Used this for camping when the facilities were either non existent or too far from camp. Works well and as described. Priced right. Also used when the toilet at home was out of commission and it was a good alternative for those unexpected emergency moments.</li>
            <li> This seat is great for kids, but for an adult size butt, better be careful!  Not what we thought foresure.</li>
            <li> This is super sturdy.  I am impressed.  We have been having trouble deciding on a toilet for our vintage camper trailer and we bought this for in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$.  Mine arrived in good condition. Not as sturdy as it appeared, but once fitted on a 5gal bucket, it will do well for anyone except a very large/tall adult.  I went to Home Depot and got one of their orange buckets, filled it with Dollar Store supplies* and Viola!  A fancy $50+ survival toilet for under $20.  I&#x27;ve never used one, so no idea how good it is at containing odors. It appears to fit snugly to the bucket.  Just don&#x27;t pick the whole thing up by the hinge!  It will fall off.  Use the bucket&#x27;s handle to transport the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*TP, Baby Wipes, Kitchen trash bags, cheap scented cat litter, disinfectant spray, hand sanitizer and kleenex. (a small shovel is good idea to add if you can, or want to bury the bagged waste)</li>
            <li> I purchased this toilet seat for emergency purposes.  I have not used it,  but it looks like it will be great.  The lid closes very securely so that  odors will, hopefully, not escape.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for x-mas!!!!  OK, OK, she was worried about the whole disaster thing so this was part of the disaster kit I gave her.  Us guys can go anywhere but the ladies need.... a pottie ;-)</li>
            <li> by far the best investment for a woman camping...!!!!</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;terlet&amp;#34; seat.  Not having actually used it yet, I can say that it is sturdy enough, fits well enough, and seals well enough that is should be fine when put to the ultimate test.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit with a gamma seal lid, which makes a 5 gal bucket toilet ... useless.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. It&#x27;s way better made than the Luggable Loo toilet seat. It&#x27;s a thicker plastic and there is also a rubber seal inside the lid to give it a snug fit when you close it. The rubber seal does in fact help suppress and odors. This seat DOES fit the orange Home Depot 5 gallon bucket and both white 5 gallon Walmart buckets. You do have to apply a good amount of pressure the first time. I think it&#x27;s a good value purchase.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars if the Jerks that distribute this didn&#x27;t put on a HUGE label on the cover (with advertising and no helpful information) that took me about 15 minutes to remove with a paint scraper and rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> doesnt snap very tight to the bucket, otherwise is a good product</li>
            <li> It is what it is !  I would not fit a standard 5 gallon paint can--it was too small.  I cut a small downward slot in the bucket and popped it on.  A little bit of bother, but it works.  What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> Tried 5 different 5 gallon pails from Home Depot, Lowes, Menards, a joint compound pail &amp; a food grade pail from a bakery &amp; none would fit this seat. Called Emergency Essentials customer service on 5/5/2014 &amp; spoke to a polite young lady about this problem. She offered to sell me a pail for $5.00 which I agreed to as long as they would cover shipping cost. She checked with her manager &amp; he refused to cover shipping cost. At this point,along with slow delivery, I can only assume that the customer service manager &amp; Emergency Essentials is high on sales and lite on customer service. I will not be purchasing anything else from Emergenct Essentials and will advise anybody else I can from doing so also.</li>
            <li> Provides a ready mechanism to accomplish #2&#x27;s during camping, while still maintaining a reasonable form (e.g. not squatting over a log in the woods that has poison ivy growing on it resulting in a rash for several weeks after the camping event for a non-experienced friend who will likely never go camping with you again, ever - just saying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only knock is that there&#x27;s no way to hook/attach the seat to the bucket with bungie cables to increase the overall stability.  Based on the injection mold design, I would expect adding a coupe hooks wouldn&#x27;t be that difficult, but that would likely limit the bucket options as a result.</li>
            <li> The seat fits very nicely on a Home Depot bucket.  It&#x27;s comfortable and does the job.  Do your business and throw some sawdust over it afterward, and other than wet saw dust, there won&#x27;t be a smell.  If you don&#x27;t have access to sawdust, pick up some rodent bedding.  I have used pine shavings (hamster bedding) from Walmart and $3 worth will last over a week.  Pine isn&#x27;t a bad smell and the bucket cleans out easily with just a rinse.&lt;br /&gt;The seat I received was dark green though in the picture it appears black.  It makes no difference to me, but I&#x27;ll mention it in case it matters to you.</li>
            <li> Makes it easier than finding the local &amp;#34;potty bush&amp;#34; when camping in the wilderness.  Had to search for a bucket it fit.</li>
            <li> just as described. love it</li>
            <li> Works as intended. Not the most comfortable, but better than sitting on just the top of a bucket.</li>
            <li> Would have liked for this to actually fit on a five gallon bucket. Not quite big enough to fit over it.</li>
            <li> Works great...does what it says...can&#x27;t do without it...not bad price...if you live in your van one day you will need it...</li>
            <li> I only give 2 star for this product,for some reason it doesn&#x27;t fit well on my 5 gallon bucket!</li>
            <li> I have three young girls I am introducing to camping and a &amp;#34;city&amp;#34; wife who needs &amp;#34;adequate toilet facilities.&amp;#34;  Along with a pop up tent, bucket, can liner (cat box liners the are cheap yet strong), odour absorbing cat litter and not one complaint about the bathroom for the entire trip!&lt;br /&gt;Seat is strong, seals up great around a standard 5 gallon bucket.  Price was good.  I especially like the gasket seal on the rim.  The seal and the tight lid do a great job of containing odour and keeping pests out!&lt;br /&gt;Would work great in an emergency situation where normal plumbing/water systems are out.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised - positive snap onto the bucket - comfortable for adults of any size.  You won&#x27;t be without &amp;#34;facilities&amp;#34; if you have this and a bucket.</li>
            <li> Great. Bought one for our boat, decorated it with decals, and then ordered another for my son&#x27;s  boat.  Good to have around for the ladies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sort of portable potties for camping and this is by far the easiest, cheapest option for weekenders.</li>
            <li> Purchased this seat for storage in our disaster kit in an outside shed. Hopefully we will never need to use it. It looks to be serviceable even though it is made of light weight plastic.</li>
            <li> works great, such a great deal.  No need to buy the expensive ones.  Just add a 5 gallon bucket, line it with a trash bag with some kitty litter.</li>
            <li> This seat sure beats some of the other options available  when roughing it. I use it with a 5 gallon plastic bucket I found in my garage and while it&#x27;s a hard snap on and off, it works fine. I use ground up corncob kitty litter and small kitchen trash can plastic bags for liners.&lt;br /&gt;Sure this seat is made in China but I get to think about China every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great appliance I wish I had acquired yearts ago. It is easay to install. The lid snaps down,l which improves sanitation.. I certainly recommend this appliance for campers and preppers!</li>
            <li> fast deliver and good product</li>
            <li> What can you say about a toilet seat, works great. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Does the job when you have to do your job.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other one stars. Too late to return it so I will try to modify the seat or/and the bucket, but no way this fits on a standard 5 gallon bucket. From now on, anything I buy online I will test for utility before the refund period expires.</li>
            <li> No trouble snapping it onto a 5 gallon bucket.</li>
            <li> If your camping in California State parks, bring your own bucket, BYOB.</li>
            <li> My wife wasn&#x27;t comfortable camping, because there wasn&#x27;t always a bathroom close, this made her more comfortable and probably a lot cleaner solution than using public camping bathrooms.  I would line it with a big garbage bag for leaks if use grocery plastic bags.</li>
            <li> I loved this.  I bought a five gallon bucket at a hardware store that cost me $5 and this clipped perfect.  We used it on a camping trip.  I used 13 gallon heavy duty plastic bags - double it to prevent leaks and the cheapest cat litter i found.  I used one bag of litter a day and it worked like a charm.  No smell, no hazzards.  When done just unclip the cover, remove the plastic bags and put new ones.  I am a heavy person and was worry that it was not going to withstand my weight, but it was safe and I never felt that it was buckling.  I recommend this 100%</li>
            <li> The best camping purchase ever. It goes on a 5 gallon bucket perfect and have bought 4 more for our camping friends.</li>
            <li> Fit right on to my 5 gallon bucket. Perfect for late night potty needs while tent camping. Fit kids up to 200+ person just fine. Lid seals in smell too!</li>
            <li> Used in our Ice House/Camper. Seals tight on 5 gal bucket witch helps with odor control.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, firm and sturdy and it fits perfectly on my 5 gallon buckets</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gag gift for a friend who hangs out in the garage a lot &amp; always jokes about how she&#x27;d never leave if only there was a bathroom. She loved it. It fits a 5 gallon bucket as promised &amp; the lid does lean back far enough so as not to get in the way of being able to sit on it properly. The plastic does seem a little flimsy, but the 5 gallon bucket is bearing your weight, so the seat does hold up. It would probably be great for camping, especially with kids who may not have mastered the fine art of squatting over a hole in the ground.</li>
            <li> We took it too the beach, along with the 5 gallon bucket and a privacy shelter.  It worked perfectly.  Everyone loved it, especially the ladies.</li>
            <li> What I liked about this one, is that it has a rubber seal around the lid. With that being said, I think it is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This seat works great!!!Fits the Home Depot orange all purpose bucket perfectly!!! I tried it on other types of buckets  I had in the garage and it wouldn&#x27;t sit right but snaps on nice and tight to the Home Depot bucket. It looks small but looks can be deceiving. My husband didn&#x27;t think he would be able to use it while camping because he&#x27;s a pretty big guy (6&#x27;3-260lbs) and he had no problems. If you&#x27;re going camping and don&#x27;t want to use the woods this is the way to go. No pun intended :)</li>
            <li> What a great idea, Wish I had thought of it! If you work in a location a &amp;#34;far piece&amp;#34; from a bathroom, keep one of this hidden in a closet. (Put a plastic garbage bag in it for easy disposal.)</li>
            <li> It fit the 5 gallon pail snuggly and snaps tight when closed.  Works better than expected,</li>
            <li> No much to say. It works in a pinch. Fits good. Get some 8 gal bags for it.</li>
            <li> Great product...works as advertised!!</li>
            <li> Very cheap plastic. Does not fit a standard size 5 gal. bucket, may fit a 6 gal., but I&#x27;ve never seen a 6 gal.</li>
            <li> The seat looked fine. It has gone into our former hurricane evac bin from Florida which is now our wildfire evacuation bin for California. Both places end up in traffic gridlock in an emergency, so a bucket, some bags and this lid will go with us in the car.  I can&#x27;t say that a plastic liner will work well hanging over the edges of the bucket since the lid snapped on quite tightly - but it looks like it will seal well enough for an emergency.&lt;br /&gt;And it HAS to be more comfy than sitting on the edge of the 5 gallon bucket - and I hope to never need to use it.</li>
            <li> Seems substantial enough to work for me (150 lbs).  It fit on the first bucket I tried, a Home Depot bucket.</li>
            <li> Quality very good. It fits standard size buckets. I put this lid inside the foldable tent and we are ready to go camping. I can recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably fine but the 5 gallon bucket I&#x27;m trying to attach it to will not accept it. I think the pail is slightly too big so when I find the right one, it should work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I think it would be easy to make this a five star product though. Incorporate an insert (like a gamma lid) that screws in under the seat to seal the container. The lid itself could be shaped more ergonomically, and a sturdier plastic is something I&#x27;d be willing to pay more for. Probably would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Yes, we&#x27;ve all had to do it. You&#x27;re in an apartment with one bathroom and your significant other has a nasty bug. They&#x27;re in the only bathroom and you suddenly realize you have the bug too. Trouble is, the loo is being used. Enter toilet seat and bucket! (No, don&#x27;t enter it. The seat enters the scene, ya silly.) You still feel like, well, you know, but you were ready for it. You had the foresight to keep one on hand so now your dignity is intact. (We&#x27;re assuming you went into another room and closed the door first.)</li>
            <li> Definitely will make a good seat to do your business when camping.  Fit perfectly with a good seal the first time. The lid is slightly flimsy and appears the hinge might break easily, but we will see. Seat feels like a regular fit.  Be sure that you have a bucket that can withstand the weight of a person!!  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Works great, better than squatting! Just find a bucket it fits on and throw in a plastic bag, tada! Toilet.</li>
            <li> These are great for camping with no facilities or just not wanting to get out of your nice, warm tent in the middle of the night. We used it lined with a regular, but heavy-duty, trash bag and partially filled with odor-absorbing kitty litter. No smell, and easy clean up! If you have to cart your own toilet around, this is the way to do it.</li>
            <li> It snapped onto our 5 gallon Lowes bucket with no issues.  My six year old daughter thought it was great for camping.  Lid seals.  That&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for camping and travels.  Lightweight.</li>
            <li> I love this little tote able toilet seat and lid. It snaps on and off my 5 gal. bucket with ease and feels like you&#x27;re sitting on a regular toilet. The lid also is easy to snap close and open and the contents, while transporting to be dumped, are well contained and clean to carry. I have friends who go tent camping a lot and I will be buying these for them in the future.</li>
            <li> fits all buckets used out camping very sturdy</li>
            <li> Well, it does what it&#x27;s intended to do... catch poo! (or pee)</li>
            <li> great to have on hand.</li>
            <li> The restroom at the campground stank extremely bad. But then this toilet seat saved the day. It fit perfectly on the orange Homer bucket. I put a large trash bag inside it, and dumped some kitty litter. I carry a changing station with me on camping trips. I took the bucket inside, sat down and relieved myself. I weigh over 200 lb, and the bucket did not break. More kitty litter on top covered up the odor. So easy!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; it yet but it did fit onto our Home Depot 5 gal bucket..... just had to firmly push it down all around like a lid on a plastic storage bowl. It fit really snug and I won&#x27;t worry about it slipping when I sit on it! Sure will beat squatting over a bucket in the middle of the night while camping!!</li>
            <li> Very handy for our pop up camper....put scented kitty litter in the 5 gallon bucket and you have a handy potty!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the fix on a five gallon bucket along with how comfortable it is. Great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful when I ordered this, but was disappointed when it arrived already broken.</li>
            <li> Tent camping with small children is the pits!&lt;br /&gt;Not unless you have a toilet that is within or close-by your tent!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price and convenience.</li>
            <li> I bought this for camping and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Well, as far as toilet seat comfort this one is not comfy! But it was inexpensive mind you. It performs well for its intended use. I got it for home use and some camping. As a wool processor and dyer for my spinning. Urea or urine is used in processing and as a mordant for some dyes and tanning leather. I can buy commercial urea and mix it with water, but why buy it and flush my own down the commode. I was using other containers as a urinal and transferring it. Messy job. Now its so simple and when I go camping I can use it for a composting toilet. If I ever manage to get some land or lease it I will be setting up a cabin with a composting toilet and I will probably buy another one for that. As its got a good seal and easy open lid. Comfortable and cushy it is not. But no worse than standard toilet seats. The plastic is easy to clean as well. Works and is less expensive than other similar products. Once the lid is closed there is no odor and snaps on and off the bucket easily. So, it was a good buy for me.</li>
            <li> This is a product that is definitely KISS (Keep It Simple Silly).  Alone, it&#x27;s compact &amp; easy to store.  When combined with that all important bucket, it becomes a functional emergency or boondocking toilet.  Use a liner along with saw dust, peat moss, or cat litter for liquid &amp; odor management, along with the snap-tight lid, and there are literally NO odors even when the well used toilet is just a few feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should have one of these in their emergency supplies, for everything from a temporary water/sewer emergency to storm outages or worse.  Every camping family, especially those with kids, should have one as well--it&#x27;s far more convenient to use with a toddler with 200 trips to the bathroom per day than running to the campground toilet!  It&#x27;s also great to have as an option to use when rain or cold makes going outdoors for that scenic stroll to the restrooms about as appealing as a trip to the dentist.  Best of all, when used with a liner (we use doubled tall kitchen bags) and an absorbing material (kitty litter, saw dust or peat moss), disposal is as simple as tying up the bag and putting it into the dumpster.  (If you compost it, do not use on food producing plants for health reasons.)  This also works well when spending the day on a fishing trip, bringing along on a picnic/road trip, etc. when bathrooms may not appear when they are needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used ours for over 2 years during an extended semi-boondocking experience in a travel trailer.  Cramped quarters meant that there was no way to have it truly out of potential nose range, so it&#x27;s odorless nature was well appreciated!  (Yes, we put it outside when possible, but there were times that it had to stay indoors with us.)  It&#x27;s one of those things that got a trial by fire as a result of many things going horribly wrong.  It was a huge relief to find something as simple as this to solve a problem that seemed unsolvable!  Even after sustained regular use, the seal remained functional and the toilet set remained tight sealing for odor control.  That seal lasts longer than most relationships!</li>
            <li> Fits great on my 5 gallon home depot pail! Snaps on and stays on!</li>
            <li> My grandkids use it when camping outside.  Sturdy enough, fits on plastic bucket.</li>
            <li> I bought this or my Emergency preparedness supplies at home.  The handle for carrying it was a differentiator, works as expected.</li>
            <li> I got this to work on a Home Depot orange 5 gal bucket just fine. Put the lid on the ground and snap the bucket on to it from above.</li>
            <li> Bought this in case we had long power outages.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t fit any of the 3 types of 5 gallon buckets I have.</li>
            <li> works as advertised.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t fit on my 3 different size of buckets, it is quite comfortable. You will need this for camping.</li>
            <li> Product description is incorrect and misleading; not sized to fit standard buckets, as confirmed by others recent to this review.  I should have investigated the bucket lid more thoroughly, instead of simply taking the company&#x27;s word; now I&#x27;m left with an awkward piece of plastic with propriety fitment needs.  They could have at least sized it so there&#x27;s overhang, allowing it to be usable even if not sealable.  Pay return shipping, or modify the product to somewhat match product description?  No, and thanks for nothing.  Company offers to sell their (standard?) bucket, shipping makes it not worth it.  Misleading marketing, will avoid company in future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sour taste in my mouth from this purchasing experience, but it&#x27;s better than actually using this product and expecting it to fit and perform as specified.  I&#x27;ve always wondered what product would be so amazing or terrible as to elicit my first review, and this is it.  If it fit, it would be fine; however, it does not, and it&#x27;s shocking how they could mess that up.  Quite frankly, there&#x27;s nothing to this type of product, as evidenced by 5 gallon buckets being an industry standard.  The company&#x27;s misleading marketing, however, is deplorable.  The Dude does not abide.</li>
            <li> VERY tight fit on a standard 5 gallon bucket... tough to get the thing to snap on... but it will fit with effort.... Great for in a deer stand...</li>
            <li> Hey, if ya gotta go... It  is what it is.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s just say this items use is really in a pinch or emergency folks and face your taking a dump in a bucket lol....but besides that fact I have asked may women who happen to be very let&#x27;s say not outdoorsy,to sit on for a few minutes and everyone of them said they would actually use it if they had to....and that they were surprised how comfortable it was for being plastic and attached to a 5 gallon bucket lol...it fits snug without any leaks dueto the rubber seal under the lid and lip over the rim of bucket....I recommend for the price and mainly comfort to anyone who is trying to decide from the many out ere, plus price since I didn&#x27;t want to spend slot of money on a item like this and put more towards other more valued items....</li>
            <li> have taken it camping twice and it does the trick. the gasket seals in odors which is great since we keep it in the tent for my 2 little girls to &amp;#34;go&amp;#34; in the middle of the night. i drop bombs and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell. we use quality trash bags with $2 kitty litter sprinkled after every use. still though, dump daily. when you do go to open it after a few sessions the smell can be very overwhelming- duh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its sturdy and barely big enough for an adult but big enough nonetheless. beats the nasty outhouse ANYDAY!</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this years ago. No more uncomfortable hunts, lol.</li>
            <li> Ok, should cost much less, handle gets in the way and is unneccessary</li>
            <li> Good for what it is, not for a large adult.</li>
            <li> I live in a Tiny Home with a waterless commode system. I weigh 200+ Lbs and the last thing I need is a seat that can&#x27;t hold up to use.&lt;br /&gt;These seats are great! They are stronger than the other seats, better quality. The seal is a good feature though not water tight. In case of accidental tip-over inside the tent, it will help minimize the mess. I will continue to use this brand of seat for as long as I&#x27;m in my Tiny Home.</li>
            <li> This works great for our 3 year old grand-daughter at our backwoods cabin.  Was very happy to read the other reviews about using kitty litter.  It&#x27;s great for what we need and the cover snaps on very tight to a 5-gallon pail.</li>
            <li> Great idea but doesn&#x27;t fit a standard 5 gallon bucket, I bought three of these for emergency use or camping and none of them fit on the buckets, they are slightly too small. They are still usable, but could be a better fit</li>
            <li> Awesome and comfortable. Easy to take on and off bucket. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Great little seat and does exactly  as advertised.  The only problem I had was finding a bucket it would fit.  It does NOT fit most buckets but I did find finally a 4 and 1/2 gallon one at Home depot.  Now I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I put kitty litter in the bottom, lined the bucket with a grocery bag that had a small rip in the bottom (enough to let liquid through) and asked the family to please change the bag if they left anything other than liquid. It worked perfect. Each morning I would dig a small hole, dump the bucket, change the kitty littler (no smell thanks to the kitty litter) and start with a fresh bag. Every one cooperated with taking care of their own &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; waste&amp;#34; by adding kitty litter to the used bag before throwing in the trash. Remember, when  you are in the woods, do not bury or leave plastic bags, They belong in the garbage make sure they get there!</li>
            <li> This is just what we needed to meet our outdoor camping emergency needs. It seems to be durable looking, fits perfectly on a Home Depot orange 5gal bucket and was reasonable. The seller shipped and it arrived promptly even earlier than projected.</li>
            <li> It is very good for the price, I think it do the same as you buy an espencer one. I recoment this to any one. Thanks</li>
            <li> An amazing product. I was driving my van down the road on my way to see Dolly Parton in concert and am so thankful I had this bad boy in the back seat of my van. Now, I cant say that the smell in my van wasnt bad if not putrid but it definitely was a life saver. It was just too bad that my friends in my van couldnt see its value as I did. Great product that I recommend!</li>
            <li> I looked through all the reviews on Amazon of similar products before selecting this particular product.  This one does fit nicely on a Lowe&#x27;s blue five gallon bucket both by itself and when snapped over a plastic bag liner.  One enhancement that I plan to try is to nest one bucket into a second five gallon bucket to raise the seat of the toilet to a more comfortable height.  Since a single bucket with the seat weights little and seems a bit \\&quot;tippy\\&quot;, I also plan to put some sand in the bottom bucket to see if it can help make a more stable overall setup.</li>
            <li> What can I say about a toilet? We popped it on a bucket and took it camping. It does what it is supposed to do. We were happy that it is sturdy and can handle a larger bottom.</li>
            <li> A \\&quot;must\\&quot; for any prepper. I use it on a Home Depot orange bucket with no problems with double liners.  Remember to use some cat litter &amp; some drops of Pine Oil/Cleaner in the bottom bags. Dispose of waste properly! If used for emergency/SHTF, have some hand sanitizer &amp; cleansing wipes nearby. Helps prevent spreading of disease &amp; creeping crud.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my wife  to use on a recent camping trip so she didn&#x27;t have to trek up to the bathhouse in the middle of the night. Together with a Home Depot five-gallon bucket and some kitty litter, and placed in our camping shower enclosure, she was set. She reports it worked perfectly and she&#x27;s very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Need a bed pan(pale) for the end of my pregnancy waited awhile to get and now it doesnt&#x27; fit standard 5 gal. bucket!!</li>
            <li> We take weekends on the boat, and have found this by far the best way to deal with toilet waste. Very easy and convenient.</li>
            <li> I thought I bought the one with the bucket but any way I got one from my local HomeDepot which did a perfect fit have not used it yet because of our weather conditions been to cold but am planning a camping trip in the next few weeks which I am getting prepared for and this item will be included.&lt;br /&gt;It came in on time found with no issues.</li>
            <li> A lot more comfortable than sitting on a bucket without it</li>
            <li> I feel good having this in my emergency stuff..I particularly like the attached lid</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought more than one of these. Well made, better than other brands, tighter seal and more durable.</li>
            <li> only thing you need is ..empty 5 gallon bucket and some reading material....it works very very well ..I use cat liter and  trash bag ..yes that&#x27;s right im keeping the hills alive and poopless..get you one</li>
            <li> Had a porta potti that you added water and pumped like a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; toilet.  The pump quit working on the first fill of water.  So, purchased this and don&#x27;t have that issue.  Works for my needs.</li>
            <li> I shopped around and amazon had good prices on these bucket style toilet seat lids. When I was looking for one this one was not the cheapest but I chose it because it has a &amp;#34;rubber gasket to seal in odors&amp;#34;  and because it had a good reputation for  snapping on the bucket. Well, it was very hard to snap it on the first time but much easier after that. almost too easy, it almost falls off its that loose (?). That and it does not seal tight enough that the rubber gasket even touches the plastic below it so its practically useless. other than that is good, Im not taking it back and Im not too disappointed with it. I just would not have spent the extra had I have know this one would be no better then the cheaper ones (I think, I dont own the others so Im not sure).</li>
            <li> I should have believed other reviewers who said this did not snap onto pails, but just lodged atop them.  I had pails from OSH, Home Depot, and Lowes, and thought/hoped it would fit snugly on one of them.  It doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m disabled due to stroke and have balance problems, so this is useless to me.  I will keep it in case someone with me gets &amp;#34;caught short&amp;#34;, but probably should return it instead.</li>
            <li> Is for my shelter.  It is perfect</li>
            <li> Best choice because lid seals!</li>
            <li> While the product snaps securely onto my bucket and will do the job, I will only give it 2 stars- it is way too expensive for a couple Chinese molded parts.  The locking tab/latch on the lid doesn&#x27;t engage the seat very well.</li>
            <li> We loved how it fit easily onto a 5 gallon bucket.  Seems to be quality and durable.  A must have for any camper with small children!</li>
            <li> I tried attaching this cover to my Home Depot, Lowes, and Menards 5 gallon buckest and it would not &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; onto any of them.  Maybe I just got a defective one...  I tried a &amp;#34;dry run&amp;#34; by sitting on the lid while it was on the bucket and it just flipped off backwards and onto the floor when I stood up.  Not good.  Also, it seems a bit cheap for the money spent.  I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> We put this lid on a 3 gallon bucket and use it out in the woods when we got camping, it is great.</li>
            <li> Not at home but it works for what it is used for.</li>
            <li> We bought this just prior to a 10 day trip. Line your bucket with a bag, and cover your business with cat litter. The Rubber seal on the lid when closed keeps the smells contained, and the bugs out. (A little helpful hint here. Change your bags out before they get full and HEAVY.) Stores away nicely until the next trip. Well made &amp; worth the money asked.</li>
            <li> Simple but effective. Comfortable. Created a great seal with the bucket. Made tent camp life considerably more livable.</li>
            <li> This works great with blue walmart bucket. My husband and I went in a primitive camping trip and we used blacked out tall kitchen garbage bags. Lined them from top over seat and everything. Just put bag down in hole and fold back over seat for a sanitary way to make sure everything stays clean during our trip. Just grab the bag and tie shut after each use.</li>
            <li> We live in an area that recently experienced flooding that knocked out sewer lines for the next couple of months so we needed a solution for solid waste. We bought this toilet seat from \\&quot;Number 1 in Service\\&quot; (fulfilled by Amazon) and it works great. We got a 5 gallon frosting bucket from the local doughnut shop and the seat fits nicely and makes a good seal. We are double lining it with plastic bags and sprinkling laundry detergent and fireplace ash after each use. The toilet seat is working perfectly for solid waste with no smells. *Note: We are putting liquid waste in our camping toilet so I can&#x27;t say how the seat/frosting bucket combo would would with liquid waste.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see that the lid fit tightly on my 5 gallon bucket after seeing several reviews that it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> This snaps onto my 5 gallon bucket nicely.  It is reserved for emergencies, so I havn&#x27;t used it yet.  I strongly recommend buying sturdy plastic bags to line the bucket.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to get too excited about a product like this, but it will work quite well.</li>
            <li> Fits a 5-gallon bucket just as it is designed to do. Comfortable seat, too, except that the nice tight seal created by the necessary rubber gasket will create some condensation on the seat &amp; lid after a few days of use, so be aware that you will need to wipe that dry before using! Good price for a great little luxury when camping!</li>
            <li> camping thing that with a 5 gallon bucket can really come in handy on any camping trip you may go on !</li>
            <li> To use it this summer on my dlx 1765 CS with friends and family out on most beautiful lake Jordan!</li>
            <li> This may seem like a purchase you could do without, but for my family it is an ESSENTIAL. We got this for camping, but I keep it in the back of our van all the time.  We have four small children, and someone always has to go when we are miles from a service station.  This snaps onto a 5-gallon bucket.  You just place a garbage sack into the bucket, put some kitty litter in the bottom of the sack (for odor control), and snap the lid on.  Voila! The kids love knowing we have a tiny potty just for them. It has also come in handy out on our farm where there is no bathroom.  I would recommend it for hunters, too.  I have even seen camo buckets to accompany the lid!</li>
            <li> I was afraid at first that it would be flimsy, but it really was made good, and perfect for camping.. using an ordinary hardware store bucket..</li>
            <li> This product worked as intended no complaints. It fit well and didnt seem loose. X x x x x x x x x</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for? It&#x27;s a toilet seat that affixes to any $3 5-gallon paint bucket. Works great!</li>

            <li> ...don&#x27;t buy a Home Depot bucket to use with it.  I made the mistake of buying the bucket before the seat was delivered, and found out that it would not fit the Home Depot 5-gallon bucket.  Fortunately, we had a 4.5 gal bucket that had held joint compound.  The seat fits that bucket, perfectly.  Go figure.  Anyway, It is sturdy and stable, and (with the right bucket)it is good to have for an emergency or for camping.  I bought this particular one, because someone wrote that the seat cover did not go all the way up on one of the other seats that Amazon sells.  I&#x27;m happy to see that the seat cover does go all the way up on this one. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for this! A woman&#x27;s savior on camping excursions. Very durable and well made. Not to uncomfy  either.</li>
            <li> Ok this product is simple and straightforward. Has some nice features like the rubber gasket inside the lid so you can close it airtight if you can&#x27;t empty it right away.  I&#x27;m using it with a blue Lowes bucket. First time use: lay the lid upside down on the ground, turn the bucket upside down and press down hard. After you take it on and off a few times it gets easier. When the lid is closed you can pick it up by the handle on the lid, but not by the bucket handle because it won&#x27;t go around the lid. Take the lid off if you want to carry the bucket by itself . You can store toilet paper or wipes, and garbage bags in the bucket until you&#x27;re ready to use them. Just put a garbage bag inside, put the lid on and you&#x27;re ready to go. Pun intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just read some of the 1 star reviews about the lid not fiting 5 gallon buckets. If you&#x27;re trying to fit it on a bucket you have laying around the house or the yard for 10 years with dings and dents in it it might not fit so go buy a $3 bucket at Lowes turn it upside down and push it onto the lid and you&#x27;ll be fine. Don&#x27;t believe the one star reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t fit a bucket. I just bought the lid, went and got a new Lowes bucket and it fits fine.</li>
            <li> I understand that one is limited by the size of the 5 gallon opening.  However, this didn&#x27;t seal on Home Depot or Lowe&#x27;s brand.  The whole concept is flawed because a seat that approximately fits a 5 gallon can isn&#x27;t appropriate for an adult behind.</li>
            <li> I Like It ....It fits great on the bucket and even snaps onto the B uckett  I haven&#x27;t used it yet but will soon</li>
            <li> This beats the He** out of a port a potty.  Buy some 8 gallon trash bags (use2) and some cat litter(scented);  filler er up, tie it off and throw away.  K.I.S.S.  Keep It Simple Stupid!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the reviews that say this toilet seat does not fit the orange home depot buckets. It actually fits perfect and creates a tight seal. When I first tried it on I immediately assumed the same as other reviewers about the home depot bucket. So I was getting ready to return the seat back to Amazon. Then I decided to inspect the seat more closely and realized that underneath there are several rings which are meant for different size buckets. The ring that I used for the home depot bucket was the inner most ring. It might take a little muscle to insert the lid, but it&#x27;s definitely a perfectly tight fit. I am definitely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was one of the best things I purchased for our recent camping trip!  It rained the entire trip, so having this saved me going out at night in the rain.  When I first purchased this I was going to give it a bad review because it didn&#x27;t fit any of the three 5 gal buckets I had but after asking other purchasers which buckets it would fit, they assured me it would fit and that it was just very tight and difficult to snap onto the buckets.  So, I left the bucket and seat in the sun until they were very hot and presto! it easily snapped onto the bucket and has not been a problem since.</li>
            <li> I own two of these lids. One is in my camper, the other in a remote yurt. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;5&amp;#34; tall and 235 pounds and though the seat&#x27;s too small for me to want to spend all day enjoying the view it&#x27;s sized adequately for its purpose. I have yet to find a buck this seat won&#x27;t fit - despite what most negative reviews have to say. The fit to bucket is snug but not difficult to remove and the lid fits snug with a gasket to hold in moisture and smells.  I use peat moss to cover deposits and smell rather than chemicals and this works perfectly well for my wife and me. I do not use this lid for transporting a full bucket. If the bucket were to fall over the lid would readily pop off so I have a very tight lid for that purpose. I&#x27;d give it five stars if I could safely leave the lid on for transport.</li>
            <li> Well made product but too hard to snap on and snap off the bucket.  I use garbage bags to keep the bucket clean and to be able to seal the waste, but this seat is not a good design.  Tried several buckets and had the same problem with all of them.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for our camping needs. Sturdy and comfortable!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since a few people said this seat didn&#x27;t snap onto their 5 gallon bucket.  But it snapped right on the bucket I bought at Lowes for $3 bucks, no problem.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others.  I now have a totally convenient and portable toilet to take with me camping, or to use in emergencies.  5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> This seat fit the plastic bucket we had.  We lined bucket with a heavy duty plastic bag and used kitty litter like people suggested in reviews I had read.  Worked perfectly for us with 2 young grandchildren so we didn&#x27;t have to walk to the restrooms in the wee hours when it&#x27;s still dark out.  Packed away for our next trip out.</li>
            <li> Fits as stated -- this can be a life saver !</li>
            <li> I just received this tote-able toilet seat and found out why there is so much confusion about fitting these onto a bucket. Perhaps some of them are a little easier but mine seemed impossible. I weigh over 250 and I was unable to press the seat onto the bucket in any way shape or form. Then I discovered the secret on mine was to not press the seat onto the bucket but to press the bucket onto the seat! After doing it this way I was able to fit the lid onto every bucket I had in my house which included buckets from Aubuchon, Walmart, VIP, and Home Depot. A smaller person may need to improvise with added weight or the help of a second person but this is how it worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update: After snapping the lid on and off maybe a dozen times it became much easier to snap on by hand]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Lay the seat onto firm but soft flat surface (carpet) upside down with the lid opening tab facing away from you and the hinge toward you.&lt;br /&gt;2) Loosely place the bucket upside down onto the center ring of the seat with the bucket handle lined up with the seat lid tab (away from the hinge).&lt;br /&gt;3) Kneeling behind the hinge of the seat lay your chest on the bucket so the bucket lip closest to you pushes into the seating ring first.&lt;br /&gt;4) Slowly rock your weight forward pushing the lip of the bucket into the ring working both sides toward the front. You can run your fingers behind the seam as it closes but do not let your weight get in front of the seam or the back will pop back out.&lt;br /&gt;5) As the rear and sides of the bucket lip slide into the seating ring you will be able to look down at the front of the bucket and see the lip bulging out over approximately 6 inches of the front of the ring when it is almost seated.&lt;br /&gt;6) When the lip is no longer slipping into the seating ring, smack the bulging part with your fist or a rubber mallet, which will pop it into place with an audible snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received the seat it seemed lightweight but once snappedinto place it feels rock solid. [Update: testing \\&quot;in the wild\\&quot; I discovered it is not a problem to situate myself to take care of all business with one seating. The only time the comfort of a full size toilet was missed was during the subsequent cleanup of the second order of business which was slightly awkward but tolerable.] There is a snapping tab to hold the lid down between uses but using this bucket on a boat I might be inclined to rig up some bungee cord to make sure the lid gasket stays snug on the seat. Even doing that it is still more comfortable and way more convenient than simply using a bucket and snapping a lid on every time.</li>
            <li> Got caught in a terrible traffic jam for over 5-hours and it was the perfect solution for those moments when you can&#x27;t wait any longer :o).</li>
            <li> This product does not fit any 5 gallon bucket we have tried which is now five different buckets it is a waste of money</li>
            <li> As advertised.  It fits the rim of my 5 gallon bucket and should work as a temporary solution to toilet use.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet and will update if my rating would change.</li>
            <li> Terrible... Does not fit on any buckets I&#x27;ve found so far.&lt;br /&gt;Product is designed poorly.</li>
            <li> I have those &amp;#34;food safe&amp;#34; white 5 gallon buckets that you can buy at home depot, and this Tote-able Toilet Seat/Lid fits perfectly.  The inner part of the lid has a rubber seal, and when closed it can help seal out the odors. Like some folks have mentioned, using scented kitty litter will keep the odors even more at bay, and absorb the liquids. This is something I think everybody should have, for emergencies or just for the fact your toilet may stop up or backup and this will come in very handy to use temporarily.  I also own one of those camping fold up toilets, that the come with bags and a clip on toilet seat, without any lid to contain the odors. This product is so much better.</li>
            <li> I paid a bit extra for this because it has a rubber gasket that was to help seal out the oders.  This may work but the problem is that it does not fit the average 5 gallon bucket.  So no matter how tight the gasket from the lid to seat the problem is the seat to bucket.  ;-(</li>
            <li> It fits squarely onto my Big Box hardware store 5 gallon bucket and stays there as long as you don&#x27;t lift it by the &amp;#34;rear end&amp;#34;...you got that didn&#x27;t you? What else can I say about this essential piece of equipment that allows you to stay in compliance with BLM back country sanitation regulations?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothin. It works.</li>
            <li> Have not used but appears fine,fits bucket perfect.</li>
            <li> I live in town. I have indoor plumbing. I bought this to see if I could save some water by making humanure with a composting toilet. This was the first seat I purchased and I really like it. The lid snaps down tight and it pops on and off a 5 gallon bucket with ease.</li>
            <li> I bought this for camping.  It fits on a Home Depot bucket well.  Has a nice seal around the lid so that smells don&#x27;t get out and flies don&#x27;t get in.  However, it&#x27;s not very comfortable to use.  If you&#x27;re short and thin, you&#x27;ll probably find it adequate.  But I&#x27;m around 250 pounds and nearly 6&#x27; tall.  Going #2 was alright, though I had to get up to wipe.  Going #1 while sitting was not in the realm of possibilities -- the seat is just way too small for that.  For camping, I&#x27;d rather dig a hole... I will be very happy to have this for emergency preparedness though.</li>
            <li> The rubber seal on this seems to contain odors better than other models without.</li>
            <li> does NOT fit your standard size bucket. We tried a bucket from Walmart that was blue. A gray bucket from Lowe&#x27;s. And a blue bucket from Lowe&#x27;s. We also tried a Home Depot bucket all of these for 4 to 6 and half gallon buckets this fit NONE of them.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it is a plastic seat to use for an emergency toilet. Construction is adequate at this point because I have not used it in the real world. In an emergency I am sure that it would come in handy.</li>
            <li> Awesome for the camper or prepper in your life. I did a 12days of prepper Christmas for my husband and this and some bio TP was the 1st day of Christmas gift ...</li>
            <li> Well made and durable product. Lid seals against seat which will help with any ordors in side my popup. Seat fit perfectly on Home depot bucket and plan to use trash can liners to dispose of daily. Highly recomend for those of you who did not want to deal with a portapotty.</li>
            <li> Great for making a bucket loo.  Fits well and is comfy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have regulated my spouse to using a bucket for failure to flush. Leaving floaties is against the house rules.</li>
            <li> Brought this toilet seat a couple of weeks ago for my fishing pontoon boat. Unlike some of the complains posted in Amazon, the toilet seat fits all the 5 gallon buckets I found in the house, including Lowe&#x27;s, Home Depot, paint, etc. It&#x27;s easy to snap off from the buckets as well, so no complain from me.</li>
            <li> It is what it is--- and I have not yet tried it. I&#x27;ll be waiting for an emergency or a camping trip. But it fits perfect on a $2.50 Home Depot Orange 5 gal bucket. The unit itself is thicker than I had thought. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Matched the 3 1/2 green bucket perfectly</li>
            <li> The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because it took a while to find a bucket that it would fit on.&lt;br /&gt;It does not fit the home depot orange bucket but it does fit on the all white one (non-branded) lowes sells.</li>
