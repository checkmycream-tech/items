            <li>Great value!</li>
            <li>Perfect for a Rogue from X-Men cosplay I did.</li>
            <li>perfect for my Bonnie</li>
            <li>Its as described and it was incredibly affordable.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I love it! :D</li>
            <li>The clips are amazing!</li>
            <li>Product good.</li>
            <li>she went and was recognized by many strangers as Anna!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute and stylish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to attach.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants to had a little awesome to their hair. :D</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>So she was quite pleased, and so was I.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the white streaks in my Bride of Frankenstein hair for Halloween!</li>
            <li>This single extension is a good price, nice quality (no creases in it either from the shipment!!), and a good white for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>Easy to sew in.</li>
            <li>By the hair is really smooth</li>
            <li>Great quality - the hair was softer and nicer than I expected considering how cheap these were.</li>
            <li>Nice long length for the zig-zag pattern :)</li>
            <li>It was super long which was good because then we were able to trim it to the exact length we needed it to be.  </li>
            <li>It is very silky and smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>But it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>purchased i was curious as to how good the quality would be</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little clip in!</li>
            <li>It looked exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just trying to figure out now how to make it look exactly like the streak of white in Anna&#x27;s hair, but that just means I need to play with it more.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>I assumed it was real, because these cost so much $$.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair is very silky and blends well with her hair.</li>
            <li>so I could do my hair as Anna from Frozen in her coronation style updo, and it is exactly what I asked for, and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I wear a full set of blue clip in hair extensions, but I wanted another piece to spice things up a bit.</li>
            <li>Feels completely like real hair.</li>
            <li>The hair is very white, but not thick and the clip and thread are black, so they show in my white hair - I had to  paint them, although that worked out OK</li>
            <li>This ships from China so it won&#x27;t be at your apartment the next day unless you live in China.</li>
            <li>Beautifull and the hair is soft as silk, the only problem i had was it was staticky when i first took it out of the package but other than that they are wonderfull, and with a low heat setting can be alterd if they are to strait</li>
            <li>They are thin but the same as the picture and are more shiny.</li>
            <li>:) My only complaint is that the strand of hair was not very well attached to the clip, so I had to reattach it.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Again my only issue was how long the delivery was, but this wasn&#x27;t a surprise as they told me it would take awhile to get here upfront.</li>
            <li> If I were to use it in her braided pigtails, it would have been too long for my hair (and it&#x27;s not a good idea to trim extensions, but maybe because it&#x27;s such a small extension you might be able to get away with it), so if anyone needs it for something like that, it may not work.</li>
            <li> ALthough the strands were some what loose...</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive, and it is not worth the price for what you get.</li>
            <li> It was slightly kinked up when I took it out of the package.</li>
            <li> It came with a little bit less hair than in the picture, and also after a while the hair extension came off the clip.</li>
            <li> The coronation style is not easy, but I didn&#x27;t want to buy a wig.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s my bad for not being better educated in these things, but no where did it say in the description that this is FAKE hair.</li>
            <li> Usually, depending on the extensions you buy, you have to tease your roots of your hair and clip the extension where it is teased in order for them to stay in.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard to do though</li>
            <li> they cannot be dyed, they cannot be straightened, they cannot be curled, they cannot be toned (in order to make blue/purple/gray, as I have &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; hair) to look like naturally gray hair, they tangle horribly, cannot be brushed without breaking...</li>
            <li> So long as you pay attention to the shipping dates you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> This ships from China so it won&#x27;t be at your apartment the next day unless you live in China. So long as you pay attention to the shipping dates you won&#x27;t be disappointed. It came well within the shipping dates ranges. It looked exactly like the picture. It&#x27;s very easy to attach. It&#x27;s a great little clip in!</li>

            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m debating dying a whit streak in my hair. It was slightly kinked up when I took it out of the package. By the hair is really smooth and I don&#x27;t regret buying it. Worked fin for Rogue from xmen cosplay</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s my bad for not being better educated in these things, but no where did it say in the description that this is FAKE hair. I assumed it was real, because these cost so much $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got them home and tried working with them- they cannot be dyed, they cannot be straightened, they cannot be curled, they cannot be toned (in order to make blue/purple/gray, as I have &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; hair) to look like naturally gray hair, they tangle horribly, cannot be brushed without breaking...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;Good for one-time use on Halloween, maybe. But would not ever use in any instance I would mind looking like trash. D:</li>
            <li> But it was worth the wait. Its as described and it was incredibly affordable.&lt;br /&gt;When purchased i was curious as to how good the quality would be but it was just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Again my only issue was how long the delivery was, but this wasn&#x27;t a surprise as they told me it would take awhile to get here upfront.</li>
            <li> I wear a full set of blue clip in hair extensions, but I wanted another piece to spice things up a bit. I absolutely love it. It is very silky and smooth and tangle free. The clips are amazing! Usually, depending on the extensions you buy, you have to tease your roots of your hair and clip the extension where it is teased in order for them to stay in. I do not have to do that with this product. It&#x27;s very cute and stylish. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who wants to had a little awesome to their hair. :D Five stars is my rating. I love it! :D</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for her sixth birthday so she could look like Princess Anna. She got compliments everywhere she went and was recognized by many strangers as Anna! So she was quite pleased, and so was I. :) My only complaint is that the strand of hair was not very well attached to the clip, so I had to reattach it. It wasn&#x27;t hard to do though (I just used thread to sew it on).</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive, and it is not worth the price for what you get.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product for what I paid for it. I will be using it in my daughters hair for a Frozen Theme party. It will be perfect! The hair is very silky and blends well with her hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is. Takes a while to get to the USA.</li>
            <li> Adding this to a wig for Halloween and it looks great! Easy to sew in. Would buy again if I needed to.</li>
            <li> It came with a little bit less hair than in the picture, and also after a while the hair extension came off the clip.</li>
            <li> Great quality - the hair was softer and nicer than I expected considering how cheap these were.</li>
            <li> It arrived ahead of schedule and is perfect!  It was super long which was good because then we were able to trim it to the exact length we needed it to be.  We got this for my daughter to use in her hair to be Anna for Halloween.  Great value!</li>
            <li> Did not arrive in time for Halloween. Product good.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a Rogue from X-Men cosplay I did. ALthough the strands were some what loose...</li>
            <li> Perfect for the white streaks in my Bride of Frankenstein hair for Halloween! Nice long length for the zig-zag pattern :)</li>
            <li> perfect for my Bonnie</li>
            <li> They are thin but the same as the picture and are more shiny.</li>
