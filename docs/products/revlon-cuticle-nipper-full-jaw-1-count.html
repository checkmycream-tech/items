            <li>They work okay but not as &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; as I thought they were going to be.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love these cuticle trimmers.</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite manicure item.</li>
            <li>I have bought this before and love it, but this one came damaged.</li>
            <li>situation as to hands and nails has been dire for many years.  </li>
            <li>My hands and nails look and feel better than they have for years.  </li>
            <li>No complaints! :)</li>
            <li>Glad I did cause</li>
            <li>They work great, reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I love Revlon tools.  </li>
            <li>I got a melody susy brand instead that I like a lot better.</li>
            <li>Best ones I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li>Most ones in the stores are cheap junk.</li>
            <li>handle has a nice curvature, and the blades are just the right size.  </li>
            <li>I tried other brands but Revlon is the best.</li>
            <li>The handle isn&#x27;t as easy to hold on to either.  </li>
            <li>These full jaw are my favorite and not always easy to find.  </li>
            <li>But this one does the job fine.  </li>
            <li>They are really strong, have a spring action which opens them up ready to cut again, very good for cuticles also..</li>
            <li>Just can&#x27;t be precise.</li>
            <li>CHEAPLY MADE/</li>
            <li>The return spring is smooth.</li>
            <li>DONT GO WITH SOMETHING CHEAP</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>VERY USEFUL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I wanted a smooth pair like the original revlons ones I had.</li>
            <li>This cuts cuticles cleanly without tearing.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp and cut beautifully.</li>
            <li>They are shaped right and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It has precision crafted blades to trim hangnails and excess cuticles safely, and its full jaw will cover a large cuticle area.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s called full jaw</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>Firtsly, she is so good, which can meet what i need ,however ,If you wanna cut off throughly the toenail beside growing into the flesh, I strongly recommend the half Jaw</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a pretty sharp pair of cuticle nippers, and for that they&#x27;re very effective.</li>
            <li>It is possible to learn to use them effectively without.</li>
            <li>Clearly, this is a durable item, so I was very excited to learn that Revlon still produces</li>
            <li>It came right away.</li>
            <li>When I ordered these I was a bit worried because the Revlon brand isn&#x27;t usually all that great and has gotten very cheap in the last 10 years</li>
            <li>The price is great, so I don&#x27;t see any need to buy more expensive nippers to use on finger nails.</li>
            <li>but at this price it is hardly worth the expense of returning, so i removed the spring from the new ones and put it on the old ones and they work much better.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see the exact shape in the picture</li>
            <li>These are &amp;#34;knock-offs.&amp;#34; Most likely somewhere in Pakistan, they copied these and are selling them as &amp;#34;authentic.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Now we replaced them with the exact model.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten them over the years and they never fail me.</li>
            <li>I love Revlon products because they last forever!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry, modern design and manufacture isn&#x27;t better, just cheap ... bring back the old, quality stuff.</li>
            <li>My old ones are better, even though they are 10 years old.</li>
            <li>The ones she suggested wore 35 dollar salon style nippers, but these work just as good as her more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Wow, these are so sharp and precise, I love them.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints with how the product works; I compulsively use these and a nail file as my fidgets, leading to fabulous nails (most of the time) and excessive use of these tools.</li>
            <li>perfect blend of not slicing your fingers off but also not having such a dull blade that you&#x27;re doing no better than you could with your own teeth.</li>
            <li>Super sharp, so they don&#x27;t tug and comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling it will rust if exposed to too much moisture.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product as described.  </li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>they cost 3 times as much</li>
            <li>The price was much lower than in the drug store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy-to-operate spring action mechanism generally gives a clean cut without the need to pull or tug at the skin.</li>
            <li>And they do, particularly if I can use them as soon as I notice the problem.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those looking for a high quality cuticle nipper for home use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharp and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, so far it has cut very well, which is why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this same brand many years ago and it lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li>The spring is probably the weakest part, but whatever, they&#x27;re not so pricey that I can&#x27;t afford a new one every year.</li>
            <li>Broke the spring and it was replaced with new clipper under warranty.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold on both hands and very sharp.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp, easy to use with grip.  </li>
            <li>It is well made, has sharp blades, and will last a long time with good care.</li>
            <li>I like this particular one because it feels more solid than ones I&#x27;ve used...and the head...or cutting part..is a little longer than most which allows me to get better angles when attacking my cuticles.  </li>
            <li>My original clippers broke in 2010, and only because I tried to use it to cut my big toenail.  </li>
            <li>Revlon is, of course, an old and well-established company as cosmetics companies go, though I generally avoid their products as they are too highly perfumed for me - no worries about that here, with this one.  </li>
            <li>The handles have small depressions for a better grip but will be harder to clean later.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp enough and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Its country of origin was marked as \\&quot;West Germany\\&quot;, which ceased to exist in 1990.  </li>
            <li>And, yes, I know that every professional manicurist uses this sort of implement, but I don&#x27;t know what brand they use, probably a professional one.</li>
            <li>Probably&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: sharp teeth, comfortable textured grip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: inner springbar is already wearing away the brace point&lt;br</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo3W52WEUGNMPPC]]I was disapointed when I received this item, even though is stainless steel and looks good, it is very bad quality because it is not sharp and wobbly, therefore I can not cut my cutticle precisely.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp but not dangerously so--</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The old ones were sturdy, weighing twice as much, with a hinge pivot that doesn&#x27;t get loose and wobbly after a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The REVLON CUTICLE NIPPER is a popularly-priced, widely-available useful little implement that helps keep nails and</li>
            <li>I have several of these REVLON nippers that are 10-25 years old, and they are still sharper than these after a couple months use.  </li>
            <li>This cutical nipper is a different metal than the old Revlon ones.</li>
            <li>but it is the same cuticle clipper from Revlon, and bought it brand new from a local store.  </li>
            <li>I will use for cutting my nails because any nipper is good enough for that.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the thin but strong blades of the old German made Revlon nipper, this is not it.  </li>
            <li>I had the same experience that another reviewer spoke of; the spring that keeps the handle open broke right in half</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 2nd half jaw nipper only because the first was lost......</li>

            <li> but it is the same cuticle clipper from Revlon, and bought it brand new from a local store.  </li>
            <li> I will use for cutting my nails because any nipper is good enough for that.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the thin but strong blades of the old German made Revlon nipper, this is not it.  </li>
            <li> I had the same experience that another reviewer spoke of; the spring that keeps the handle open broke right in half</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd half jaw nipper only because the first was lost......</li>
            <li> I cannot recall the manufacturer of my previous and only other pair, although I know it was not Revlon, but they lasted for 8+ YEARS and needed to be replaced because the edge grew dull and did not do a good job of clipping anymore, not because it broke in half!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the quality was not as good as Revlon clippers</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper after my old pair broke--it was at least 20 years old.  </li>
            <li> however all nippers get dull after time and this certainly did.</li>
            <li> Packaging looks similar, but not exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I expected wear and tear over time, but my last pair lasted over 5 years and this pair is already showing signs of damage.</li>
            <li> These cuticle clippers are sharp and do the job as needed without the bother of constant trips to a nail salon.</li>
            <li> It has a different &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; than the other ones did.  </li>
            <li> It seems that the jaws aren&#x27;t sharp enough and I&#x27;m planning to take the device to some place to sharpen it.</li>
            <li> and I did not use it in any way other than its intended purpose; only to clip the cuticles on my fingernails.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect to need to replace it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My hands and nails have been too dry; they have itched, cracked,</li>
            <li> However, recently, I seem to have found products that have helped actually lubricate my hands and strengthen my nails, and I decided to give these nippers a try, on the theory that they would do a cleaner, less injurious job on hangnails or rough skin than my pulling or tearing at them.  </li>
            <li> Last week, the spring broke which as noted elsewhere makes them very hard to use, so I ordered a new pair.  </li>
            <li> and I get less tears because I nip it earlier.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t had any effect on the nippers yet, but in my (considerable) experience this usually means they will become harder and harder to squeeze as the scratch deepens.</li>
            <li> Have a pair that is 12 years old, but broke them trying to cut plastic (duh).  </li>
            <li> and this nipper must be AT LEAST 15 years old now.  </li>
            <li> Product is durable and works as expected.  </li>
            <li> This pair of cuticle clippers is a heavy but solid clipper.</li>
            <li> had problems with roughly trimmed cuticles..</li>
            <li> Whenever I had hangnails or excess cuticle, or rough cuticles, I have torn at them, often drawing blood.  </li>
            <li> It worked as expected but was unimpressive.  </li>
            <li> The center spring broke off after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Some other (and cheaper) brands such as Trim or Burmax Stainless  do a lousy job and cause bleeding.</li>
            <li> the machining was inconsistent and very sloppy and they wouldn&#x27;t cut worth a flip.  </li>
            <li> The spring that keeps the handle open snapped in half after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> Not too pointy yet sharp.</li>
            <li> It is quite sharp and performs well.</li>
            <li> I forgot how sharp they once were.  </li>
            <li> Really sharp.  </li>
            <li> One says 38210 and the other is 82108.  </li>
            <li> These are sharp and work well.</li>
            <li> In the video I move the handle up and down (while it is closed)</li>
            <li> Very sharp so be careful and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that Revlon would have such a poor item for sale on Amazon !  </li>
            <li> It did get wet and started rusting a little bit over time at the joint area.</li>
            <li> That will certainly dull out the blade sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li> They get dull faster for my mom, who also uses them, but still last probably half a year for her.</li>
            <li> When I say sharp, I mean seriously sharp, I think they&#x27;ll stay that way for a long time.</li>
            <li> However, after just a few weeks of owning these, they are already developing a scratch on the inside of the grip where the springy piece of metal from one side of the grip contacts the other side.</li>
            <li> It is sharp and comes to a narrow point.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> i Have had previously.  </li>
            <li> Typical drugstore fare-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super nipper afterall.</li>
            <li> I am finding that my cuticles get less irritated when I use these</li>
            <li> My sample hardly works at cutting cuticles, it just bites them, but without a clean cut.</li>
            <li> so you can see what I am talking about, the blades moves up and down as well which causes very unprecise/bad cutting of cutticle</li>
            <li> One looks like the usual revlon one, but the other has some &#x27;X&#x27; design on the handle.  </li>
            <li> My mother is a nail artist and she suggested that I buy a pair of these to cut the skin back instead of pulling it and making the tear worse.</li>
            <li> It feels like it has been sitting around for years;  a little stiff, not polished tool</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update from Jan 2014&lt;br /&gt;These wore out after less than 6 months!</li>
            <li> Manicurists have been known to count the number of injured fingers as they worked: only small injuries sure, but messy and ugly, and sometimes a bit painful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering buying a back up since they are expensive at the pharmacy stores.</li>
            <li> Small victory, but fewer blood drops on my pillow cases.</li>
            <li> I thought I wanted one with &amp;#34;grippers&amp;#34; but this works as well, if not better, than ones I&#x27;ve used with grippers on them.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These cuticle clippers are sharp and do the job as needed without the bother of constant trips to a nail salon. I would but these again and plan on giving as gifts.</li>
            <li> Wow, these are so sharp and precise, I love them. When I say sharp, I mean seriously sharp, I think they&#x27;ll stay that way for a long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent for removing hang nails and frayed cuticles. Hard to find in stores in my area. My last pair lasted over 10 years ...  one of the kids broke the jaws trying to cut a hard piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> They work okay but not as &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; as I thought they were going to be.</li>
            <li> Cuts well. Revlon cuticle clippers are great quality.  I&#x27;m considering buying a back up since they are expensive at the pharmacy stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one I had for 40 years.  I couldn&#x27;t see the exact shape in the picture but it looked like mine.  It is differently shaped.  It&#x27;s called full jaw and I wanted half-jaw.  It feels a bit awkward but works okay so I kept it.</li>
            <li> I love these cuticle trimmers. They last for a while for me (I have 3 and I think I finally broke the spring on one after a year). They get dull faster for my mom, who also uses them, but still last probably half a year for her. They&#x27;re sharp but not dangerously so--perfect blend of not slicing your fingers off but also not having such a dull blade that you&#x27;re doing no better than you could with your own teeth. The spring is probably the weakest part, but whatever, they&#x27;re not so pricey that I can&#x27;t afford a new one every year.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. It was exactly what I expected. Not too pointy yet sharp. I have purchased this same brand many years ago and it lasted for a long time. I hope this one does too. No problem with delivery either. It came right away.</li>
            <li> Decided to start doing my manicures/pedicures at home versus having them done at a salon.  This works great on removing my cuticles and is easy to use. Highly recommended for those looking for a high quality cuticle nipper for home use.</li>
            <li> Product is durable and works as expected.  Arrived in good working condition.</li>
            <li> Used this clipper for 20 plus years and never had a problem. Broke the spring and it was replaced with new clipper under warranty. Great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper after my old pair broke--it was at least 20 years old.  How do I know?  Its country of origin was marked as \\&quot;West Germany\\&quot;, which ceased to exist in 1990.  My original clippers broke in 2010, and only because I tried to use it to cut my big toenail.  Clearly, this is a durable item, so I was very excited to learn that Revlon still produces it.&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a nice curvature, and the blades are just the right size.  Excellent clippers.  Probably my favorite manicure item.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands but Revlon is the best. They are sharp and cut beautifully. They are shaped right and easy to hold. i have three of these and have used them for years. They are made so well you can get them resharpened if you need to.</li>
            <li> I have several of these REVLON nippers that are 10-25 years old, and they are still sharper than these after a couple months use.  The old ones were sturdy, weighing twice as much, with a hinge pivot that doesn&#x27;t get loose and wobbly after a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, modern design and manufacture isn&#x27;t better, just cheap ... bring back the old, quality stuff.</li>
            <li> This pair of cuticle clippers is a heavy but solid clipper. It is quite sharp and performs well. I don&#x27;t expect to need to replace it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Should you buy it? Probably&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: sharp teeth, comfortable textured grip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: inner springbar is already wearing away the brace point&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a pretty sharp pair of cuticle nippers, and for that they&#x27;re very effective. I have no complaints with how the product works; I compulsively use these and a nail file as my fidgets, leading to fabulous nails (most of the time) and excessive use of these tools. However, after just a few weeks of owning these, they are already developing a scratch on the inside of the grip where the springy piece of metal from one side of the grip contacts the other side. It hasn&#x27;t had any effect on the nippers yet, but in my (considerable) experience this usually means they will become harder and harder to squeeze as the scratch deepens. I expected wear and tear over time, but my last pair lasted over 5 years and this pair is already showing signs of damage.</li>
            <li> Very nice and good quality.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the thin but strong blades of the old German made Revlon nipper, this is not it.  The handle isn&#x27;t as easy to hold on to either.  But they do a passable job. Just can&#x27;t be precise.</li>
            <li> I have bought this before and love it, but this one came damaged. The tip of the cutting part bent so it was useless.</li>
            <li> very good quallity product and it&#x27;s percision as well. recommended to all the ladies that they want their manicure perf!!</li>
            <li> This cutical nipper is a different metal than the old Revlon ones. It has a different &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; than the other ones did.  It feels like tin.  I have a feeling it will rust if exposed to too much moisture.  However, so far it has cut very well, which is why I purchased it.  That is why I gave it the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> My husband loves using this, and it gets a lot of wear, so was happy to find it at a discount price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It feels like it has been sitting around for years;  a little stiff, not polished tool</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the quality was not as good as Revlon clippers i Have had previously.  I even wondered if it was a counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Horrible! They did not work at all!</li>
            <li> had problems with roughly trimmed cuticles.. this did the job along with CND cuticle remover. man, my toenails look good!</li>
            <li> The REVLON CUTICLE NIPPER is a popularly-priced, widely-available useful little implement that helps keep nails and hands well-groomed. Revlon is, of course, an old and well-established company as cosmetics companies go, though I generally avoid their products as they are too highly perfumed for me - no worries about that here, with this one.  And, yes, I know that every professional manicurist uses this sort of implement, but I don&#x27;t know what brand they use, probably a professional one. But this one does the job fine.  It has precision crafted blades to trim hangnails and excess cuticles safely, and its full jaw will cover a large cuticle area.  It&#x27;s easy-to-operate spring action mechanism generally gives a clean cut without the need to pull or tug at the skin. And its non-slip grip handles should enable the user to hold and control the implement in either hand, and work with accuracy and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My situation as to hands and nails has been dire for many years.  My hands and nails have been too dry; they have itched, cracked, etc.  I have scratched.  Whenever I had hangnails or excess cuticle, or rough cuticles, I have torn at them, often drawing blood.  Manicurists have been known to count the number of injured fingers as they worked: only small injuries sure, but messy and ugly, and sometimes a bit painful.  However, recently, I seem to have found products that have helped actually lubricate my hands and strengthen my nails, and I decided to give these nippers a try, on the theory that they would do a cleaner, less injurious job on hangnails or rough skin than my pulling or tearing at them.  And they do, particularly if I can use them as soon as I notice the problem.  My hands and nails look and feel better than they have for years.  Small victory, but fewer blood drops on my pillow cases.</li>
            <li> These clippers have saved me from some very painful hang nails! They are great quality and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> This pair has ridges on the handles. They bothered me.  I wanted a smooth pair like the original revlons ones I had.</li>
            <li> I ordered the brand Revlon because I trust the brand. I was happy with it but it could have been wee bit sharper.</li>
            <li> I thought I wanted one with &amp;#34;grippers&amp;#34; but this works as well, if not better, than ones I&#x27;ve used with grippers on them. It&#x27;s sharp and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these on myself only, for at-home manicures. No complaints! :)</li>
            <li> My sample hardly works at cutting cuticles, it just bites them, but without a clean cut. It seems that the jaws aren&#x27;t sharp enough and I&#x27;m planning to take the device to some place to sharpen it.</li>
            <li> Have a pair that is 12 years old, but broke them trying to cut plastic (duh).  Glad I did cause I forgot how sharp they once were.  I use them on my nails too, and they held up for 12 years.  Not bad.  And who cares if the spring breaks.  It is possible to learn to use them effectively without.</li>
            <li> These are &amp;#34;knock-offs.&amp;#34; Most likely somewhere in Pakistan, they copied these and are selling them as &amp;#34;authentic.&amp;#34; Dull blades.&lt;br /&gt;Most likely someone is making money off you folks (and me) by playing us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to a local store pay a couple of extra bucks and buy the &amp;#34;real deal.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> we had a pair of these ten years ago...but they died.  Now we replaced them with the exact model.  They are really strong, have a spring action which opens them up ready to cut again, very good for cuticles also..</li>
            <li> FLIMSEY/CHEAPLY MADE/DULL/DON&#x27;T CUT CUTICLE/CUMBERSOME/HORRIBLE QUALITY/I am surprised that Revlon would have such a poor item for sale on Amazon !  DO NOT RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction.  Fast shipping, product as described.  Tops!</li>
            <li> great prices, speedy service!</li>
            <li> These full jaw are my favorite and not always easy to find.  Thank You - its a great product!</li>
            <li> They work great, reasonably priced.  Best ones I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> YES...THATZ HOW WELL THESE NIPPERS WORKED&lt;br /&gt;FOR ALL THAT TIME...!!!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T HESITATE TO HAVE THEM  AT THE READY&lt;br /&gt;FOR THOSE NaSTY HANGNAIlS, ETC.&lt;br /&gt;REVLON HAS THIS  PRODUCT  &amp;#34;NAILED&amp;#34;...hahaha</li>
            <li> These are nicely polish and the cutting edges actually match and meet properly.  Works perfectly.  The handles have small depressions for a better grip but will be harder to clean later.  The return spring is smooth.</li>
            <li> I like this particular one because it feels more solid than ones I&#x27;ve used...and the head...or cutting part..is a little longer than most which allows me to get better angles when attacking my cuticles.  I&#x27;d recommend this one if you already have one.</li>
            <li> Well-made tool.  Works great, no complaints</li>
            <li> When I ordered these I was a bit worried because the Revlon brand isn&#x27;t usually all that great and has gotten very cheap in the last 10 years but I thought I would take a chance. They are awesome, VERY sharp and easy to use, no grinding and just wonderful....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update from Jan 2014&lt;br /&gt;These wore out after less than 6 months!</li>
            <li> Easy to hold on both hands and very sharp.  Gets close enough to get all the hang nails.  I use it all the time when I do at home mani/pedi!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Really sharp.  I ordered two and I received two different kinds.  Packaging looks similar, but not exactly the same. The nipper inside are totally different.  One looks like the usual revlon one, but the other has some &#x27;X&#x27; design on the handle.  I wonder if it&#x27;s the fake one coz I never saw a Revlon that has design on handle. Just checked the model. One says 38210 and the other is 82108.  I haven&#x27;t tried the 38210 yet since that&#x27;s like for backup as we always lose these.</li>
            <li> Too dull. My old ones are better, even though they are 10 years old.</li>
            <li> I bought these when my more expensive Tweezerman nippers finally stopped working well.  I don&#x27;t have much to say about nippers, but these are perfect for my needs.  They are sharp enough and easy to use.  The price is great, so I don&#x27;t see any need to buy more expensive nippers to use on finger nails.</li>
            <li> I love Revlon tools.  These nippers are great.  Super sharp, so they don&#x27;t tug and comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and work well. I have gotten them over the years and they never fail me. They do get dull as the years go on but what doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Threw these away after two uses. They are dull and awkward to use. Typical drugstore fare- you get what  you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have a thing about nippers. Most ones in the stores are cheap junk. So to get this good one for this price I was very happy. This model is twice the price in my local drugstores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd half jaw nipper only because the first was lost......and this nipper must be AT LEAST 15 years old now.  I love Revlon products because they last forever!</li>
            <li> Cuticle nippers work well to do away with hangnails, etc. -- keep cuticles looking neat and keeps me from fiddling around with &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> This is the quality that I would expect from revlon. It is sharp and comes to a narrow point. It seems like a quality piece and has some weight to it so it feels nice in your hands.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these several months ago.  It worked as expected but was unimpressive.  Last week, the spring broke which as noted elsewhere makes them very hard to use, so I ordered a new pair.  The workmanship on the new pair was horrible.  The cutting edges didn&#x27;t line up.  the machining was inconsistent and very sloppy and they wouldn&#x27;t cut worth a flip.  but at this price it is hardly worth the expense of returning, so i removed the spring from the new ones and put it on the old ones and they work much better.  Then i ordered a set of tweezerman.  they cost 3 times as much but OH WHAT A DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li> This cuts cuticles cleanly without tearing.  Mine grow rapidly and need to be trimmed weekly.  Some other (and cheaper) brands such as Trim or Burmax Stainless  do a lousy job and cause bleeding.</li>
            <li> This is a great item at a very good price. It is well made, has sharp blades, and will last a long time with good care.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for with this item. The center spring broke off after a couple of months. Spend the extra ten bucks and get a tweezerman.</li>
            <li> The spring that keeps the handle open snapped in half after a few months of use.  Without that spring, these are almost impossible to use.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to upgrade to a pair of Tweezermans.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, easy to use with grip.  The price was much lower than in the drug store. I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and gets the job done. It did get wet and started rusting a little bit over time at the joint area.</li>
            <li> I definately got alot of use out this this cuticle nipper however all nippers get dull after time and this certainly did. It&#x27;s not a super nipper afterall. I just tossed it and bought another one. These things don&#x27;t last forever if used weekly or used to cut nails not just cuticles. That will certainly dull out the blade sooner rather than later. I really loved the price however. I&#x27;d rather buy this one at $10 and replace it than buying a $26 one at Walgreens and have to toss it after 3 months.</li>
            <li> Firtsly, she is so good, which can meet what i need ,however ,If you wanna cut off throughly the toenail beside growing into the flesh, I strongly recommend the half Jaw , that would be much better!</li>
            <li> My cuticles are always peeling, tearing, and cracked. My mother is a nail artist and she suggested that I buy a pair of these to cut the skin back instead of pulling it and making the tear worse. The ones she suggested wore 35 dollar salon style nippers, but these work just as good as her more expensive ones. I am finding that my cuticles get less irritated when I use these and I get less tears because I nip it earlier.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this products on Amazon but it is the same cuticle clipper from Revlon, and bought it brand new from a local store.  I had the same experience that another reviewer spoke of; the spring that keeps the handle open broke right in half and I had JUST picked it up to use it. It is not like it had gotten extensive use in one sitting and I did not use it in any way other than its intended purpose; only to clip the cuticles on my fingernails. I cannot recall the manufacturer of my previous and only other pair, although I know it was not Revlon, but they lasted for 8+ YEARS and needed to be replaced because the edge grew dull and did not do a good job of clipping anymore, not because it broke in half!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3W52WEUGNMPPC]]I was disapointed when I received this item, even though is stainless steel and looks good, it is very bad quality because it is not sharp and wobbly, therefore I can not cut my cutticle precisely. I will use for cutting my nails because any nipper is good enough for that. I missed the return window so I am stuck with this. I got a melody susy brand instead that I like a lot better. In the video I move the handle up and down (while it is closed) so you can see what I am talking about, the blades moves up and down as well which causes very unprecise/bad cutting of cutticle</li>
            <li> VERY USEFUL PRODUCT. I USE IT TO TRIM MY SMALL PUFFERFISH TEETH . GREAT PRICE GREAT NAME BRAND . DONT GO WITH SOMETHING CHEAP</li>
            <li> Very sharp so be careful and it gets the job done. You just have to get use to using it, very different from using regular clippers.</li>
