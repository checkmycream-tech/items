            <li>I thought firming would be great since my skin micro-wrinkles when the weather gets</li>
            <li>I suppose if I were 15 having gold sparkly skin would be great.  </li>

            <li>Its amazing!</li>
            <li>I searched it online and amazon was selling it at a good price for two, so I bought it.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells so good, that I don&#x27;t have to use body sprays.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good buy</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any firming happening, but it&#x27;s good lotion.</li>

            <li>Good moisteriser</li>
            <li>This is good buy.</li>
            <li>feels good on the skin and is not greasy</li>
            <li>A delight of a product with an exceptionally good price from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This lotion is so good.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Lotion and the scent and texture are great.</li>
            <li>Pretty glittery sheen and excellent moisture.</li>
            <li>And the fragrance is lovely!  </li>
            <li>First: awesome fragrances.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and it gives my skin moisture and a unobtrusive shimmer that makes it look very healthy.</li>
            <li>Love the lotion!</li>
            <li>So glad I can get it here!</li>
            <li>Really, these are excellent lotions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;ve since found a better, cheaper one.</li>
            <li>It is a nice scented lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a musky smell.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that I have seen an improvement in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still nice for lotion</li>
            <li>She liked it and uses it every day</li>
            <li>nice scent ..</li>
            <li>Smells great but dries too quickly and doesn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did because I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and smells good.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best body lotion I have ever used, I just wish I had tried Olay sooner.</li>
            <li>I am surprised but this is a great body lotion!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The Olay Quench Firming Body lotion is by far the BEST moisturiser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Although I ordered Olay Quench, but received Olay body Firming Reviver I must say that this product is very good and does basically the same good job as the quench.</li>
            <li>This is great over-the-counter lotion for your entire body at a great price.</li>
            <li>Smells good, soothing and  absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion...</li>
            <li>It is, in my opinion, way better than Aveeno body lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was still available in stores!</li>
            <li>very happy with it and would definitely recommend buying it.  </li>
            <li>I fear it is on the way out as with all of my favorite Olay products.</li>
            <li>I use to be able to buy it in the stores, but one by one it has been disappearing.</li>
            <li>Which is why I&#x27;ve stayed away from lotions for so many years.</li>
            <li>I get so many complements on</li>
            <li>Maybe more time</li>
            <li>I am extremly pleased with the way this two products have improved my skin texture to an youthful, healthy appearance.</li>
            <li>Ok no difference in time</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Well, I found this lotion by accident and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Was glad when I could find it again.</li>
            <li>I truly love this product and will order more today</li>
            <li>I think it just leaves particles on TOP of your skin that dries and fills in the micro-wrinkles</li>
            <li>I just love the smell and how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>BUT, I will be reordering this for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like something that has a better &amp;#34;after-taste&amp;#34; than this, and has a fresher feel.</li>
            <li>I will buy more after I finished existing ones.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite body lotion for years</li>
            <li>I love love love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>but since I found it I have much better skin.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and texture of this lotion its not over powering so as not to bother my sinuses</li>
            <li>There is a glitter in it though which I didn&#x27;t expect but love.</li>
            <li>but I love the smell.</li>
            <li>yr old daughter thought so; and she loved the shimmer in the sunlight!</li>
            <li>Love this product - not disappointed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- strong perfume smell, which I&#x27;m not terribly fond on&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is becoming dryer as I age</li>
            <li>Olay brand, so great on sensitive skin like mine</li>
            <li>A nice lotion that is easily absorbed by my skin.  </li>
            <li>container has easy pump ,  the 2 pack lasts for over 1 month (using twice a day)</li>
            <li>The scent is too strong and also leaves a greasy feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>After using this again only two times I noticed my skin was not itching ALL the time, it no longer had that dry, crackly appearance, and best of all I was comfortable in my own skin again!</li>
            <li>Not as easy to find as it once was and no longer available on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve always had to use body sprays, so this isn&#x27;t TOOO strong of a smell, but good enough :-)</li>
            <li>But I can say that it has made a huge improvement in my skins texture as well as the appearance.</li>
            <li>i give this 3 only because it is a great light moisturizing lotion.  </li>
            <li>My hands are smooth also just from applying it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soooo smooth after putting it on...its like silk.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my arms feel firmer, my legs are smooth and feel firmer too, also I&#x27;ve see a difference on my elbows.</li>
            <li>BUT, the few times I have used it, my skin feels awesome when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, not available in stores.</li>
            <li>I found this to be sticky and not that comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and leaves a light shimmer on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have fair toned skin, Im getting around to 30 yrs young</li>
            <li>I read a review online saying that this was a very good body lotion compared to other brand name lotions, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I&#x27;d just run out of the lotion</li>
            <li>Absolutely one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about four months now, and I can&#x27;t go to sleep unless I use the lotion right after a warm shower, and I can&#x27;t go out without applying it onto my arms and legs first.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and has a nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent (as I am very sensitive).</li>
            <li>I have the hardest time finding this lotion since I first used it and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Has little moisture sparkles in it and it makes you feel smooth and smell very good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of different kinds of lotion and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for just about everyone who wants soft, beautiful  skin!</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Has all the right ingredients!  </li>
            <li>Great lotion that I have used for years on my VERY dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Not that the hot weather is here, it really comes in handy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon and Olay, I was able to order it on line.</li>
            <li>I love the smoothness and the gentle smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li>and I think it really does smooth out my skin!</li>
            <li>This product works and has a nice, soft scent.</li>
            <li>She wants more.</li>
            <li>The best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used hands down !!!&#x27;</li>
            <li>The scent is quite strong, I can&#x27;t really wear my perfume with it!</li>
            <li>The smell is super strong, it does fade throughout the day but when you first use it, it almost knocks you out.</li>
            <li>The new formulations of OLAY lotion do not smell the same nor do they give my skin the flawless radiance as with this product (thanks to the ingredient Mica).</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin with no oily or sticky residue.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency; not too thick without feeling like water, and the staying power is great.</li>
            <li>This is such a great deal and shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;quenching&amp;#34; part isn&#x27;t good enough for dry climates, better for more humid climates</li>
            <li>Smells great, average lotion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there are too many lotions that live up to their hype.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t absorb easily (gotta really rub it</li>
            <li>I am not sure what more to say about  this product except that it is a good value.</li>
            <li>The lotion leaves a slight shimmer once you have it on, which is very nice.</li>
            <li>It is a great product, has a little bit of shimmer to it but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>This lotion didn&#x27;t seem to firm like some of the others I have tried; however, it smells good and works fine as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Howrver, I did not see any improvements with my skin, other than the pleasant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell for sure.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so many lotions make it itch.</li>
            <li>I still love the lotion and how baby soft</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any particular firming action, but the lotion is still nice to use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for the firming - not that any firming lotion really seems to make a difference, but I do enjoy the scent and the shimmer very much.</li>
            <li>Olay Quench Plus Firming Body Lotion is the right amount of moisture for my skin.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has a nice texture (not sticky or gummy like some are), spreads easily and gives my skin a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; without looking cheesy.  </li>
            <li>I found Olay lotion scent to strong, gave me a headache, but it made my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>has a nice feeling on very dry skin&#x3D;&#x3D;I</li>
            <li>I hope I will be able to find this product in the future.</li>
            <li>When I first started using Olay Quench</li>
            <li>Since I first started using Quench</li>
            <li>I dont notice much firming but the soctness of my skin alone is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I swear it kept me soft and silky smooth until I washed it off AND</li>
            <li>;) J</li>
            <li>Best smelling produc with a subtly shimmer leaves the skin looking and feeling radiant!!</li>
            <li>It feels great; moisturized but not sticky and leaves a subtle sheen.</li>
            <li>Thow this does not really firm up your skin which I really didn&#x27;t expect it to do, it does make your skin feel so soft that you can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and scent wont compete with your favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>With our harsh winter weather I am very pleased to have found this product.</li>
            <li>As far as firming, I really don&#x27;t know if its done that, but its a good daily lotions keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this- after a couple weeks of daily application, makes an obvious difference, my over-50 year old skin looks much healthier and younger.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, leaving skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We can&#x27;t find it locally, and Amazon makes it easy to get.  </li>
            <li>Large bottle for price, plus you get two.</li>
            <li>I switched to using this last summer and have become loyal to it ever since!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She likes the lotion because it has a pleasant scent and has certain ingredients that makes her skin sparkle in the sun, not ostentatiously like glitter, but subtle.</li>
            <li>I do really like the way this product absorbs into skin.</li>
            <li>Makes your hands smooth and younger looking.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much difference</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li>o add, that it leaves traces of glitter on your skin, which really annoys my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and packing Was good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a very reliable body lotion.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do anything really at all....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have been unable to find it in the stores in my area and was delighted to see that it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Does firm dimples,  nice scent.</li>
            <li>When I can&#x27;t find it I buy other lotions which cost more and do not do the job I need it to do.</li>
            <li>Nothing really takes away the dryness completely but of everything I have tried Olay Quench has done the most to relive my dry skin.</li>
            <li>The mica leaves a very slight shimmer and the scent is light and clean.</li>
            <li>I apply as a body lotion, and place special attention to problem&lt;br /&gt;areas, such as \\&quot;knees and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty young, but I&#x27;m all about prevention at this age.  </li>
            <li>like the shimmer my skin has, and I love Olay products, but this one is just your average lotion with the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; as an afterthought.</li>
            <li>and I love the slight glisten it leaves when the sun hits your skin.</li>
            <li>I apply in the morning and my skin is still is still soft and smooth the next morning!</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok as a moisturizer, not really greasy and does keep your skin soft.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a glittery effect that makes your entire body feel so soft and smooth...</li>
            <li>I suffered with dry skin ,  I am nurse and I am constantly washing my hands .I can see results I love this</li>
            <li>I mean the scent is so amazing</li>
            <li>lightly scented Quench Plus goes on smoothly but leaves a slightly tacky sensation until it&#x27;s fully dry.</li>
            <li>This will eventually be discontinued in the coming months as Olay rolls out its new rebranding of Olay Quench where they will no longer have the firming body</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>ive been using it at night and my hands dont feel very soft after using it...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I did not notice any shimmer until I got out in the sunlight, there is a slight shimmer to this, but that&#x27;s fine with me not noticeable indoors.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this lotion forever or as long as they are in business or as long as I am alive:-)</li>
            <li>This is easy a person just rubs it in on the place where you want to firm up that part of your body.</li>
            <li>She is allergic to certain things in cosmetics and lotions especially soy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it, and it should be clearly stated - I won&#x27;t be using this product.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend always comments on how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li>This product makes your skin look young and shinny.</li>
            <li>My 47 yr old eyes can&#x27;t even see it still.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how soft my skin is now.</li>
            <li>I keep this on hand near the bathroom sink, by the bedside, at my desk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a 13 year old girl.</li>
            <li>how insanely soft my hands and arms are now.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for providing this lotion as I can not find it at any of my local stores.</li>
            <li>As far as firming goes can&#x27;t say I have noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>but my skin is soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>As far as firming?</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li>When I was 9 years old I was told by A doctor that I had elephant skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>The firming quench has a unique scent that lingers a little but doesn&#x27;t compete with body mists.</li>
            <li>Also, it adds a nice sparkle to my skin, very subtle but still noticeable.</li>
            <li>It has a slight fragrance, but not unpleasant, and it isn&#x27;t oily or make my skin sticky like Aveeno does.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that it is firming, but I do get compliments on how smooth my skin looks at my age.</li>
            <li>Sinks into skin and stays there, even on hot, humid days.</li>
            <li>I tried this when it first came out and was amazed with not only how well it moisturized but for how long it did.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so soft, has a nice, faint scent</li>
            <li>I have developed high blood pressure and the medication makes my skin very dry</li>
            <li>The pack of 2 is always great and the price isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t get enough of how soft and moisturized it makes my skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not really paying much attention to it.  </li>
            <li>When they stopped selling it in stores I was unhappy, however, turned to Amazon and was delighted to find it.</li>
            <li>If you live in dry climates or have wrinkles, I would suggest Jergen&#x27;s Unscented body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I use olay facial lotion for sensitive skin with spf 15 every day, but recently discovered the quench lotions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this lotion for a few weeks but so far I really can&#x27;t say that I notice a change in the tightness level of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used keri lotion for so many years but it is a little hard to find, now that I have tried this one I am sticking to it.  </li>
            <li>I massage it into my skin until my skin feels soft and supple, and I spend a little more time on my drier spots such as behind my legs, my elbows, and lower back.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy</li>

            <li> feels good on the skin and is not greasy</li>
            <li> A delight of a product with an exceptionally good price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Lotion and the scent and texture are great.</li>
            <li> Pretty glittery sheen and excellent moisture.</li>
            <li> And the fragrance is lovely!  </li>
            <li> First: awesome fragrances.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing and it gives my skin moisture and a unobtrusive shimmer that makes it look very healthy.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion!</li>
            <li> So glad I can get it here!</li>
            <li> Really, these are excellent lotions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;ve since found a better, cheaper one.</li>
            <li> It is a nice scented lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a musky smell.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that I have seen an improvement in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still nice for lotion</li>
            <li> She liked it and uses it every day</li>
            <li> nice scent ..</li>
            <li> Smells great but dries too quickly and doesn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did because I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and smells good.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best body lotion I have ever used, I just wish I had tried Olay sooner.</li>
            <li> I am surprised but this is a great body lotion!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The Olay Quench Firming Body lotion is by far the BEST moisturiser I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Although I ordered Olay Quench, but received Olay body Firming Reviver I must say that this product is very good and does basically the same good job as the quench.</li>
            <li> This is great over-the-counter lotion for your entire body at a great price.</li>
            <li> Smells good, soothing and  absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion...</li>
            <li> It is, in my opinion, way better than Aveeno body lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was still available in stores!</li>
            <li> very happy with it and would definitely recommend buying it.  </li>
            <li> I fear it is on the way out as with all of my favorite Olay products.</li>
            <li> I use to be able to buy it in the stores, but one by one it has been disappearing.</li>
            <li> Which is why I&#x27;ve stayed away from lotions for so many years.</li>
            <li> I get so many complements on</li>
            <li> Maybe more time</li>
            <li> I am extremly pleased with the way this two products have improved my skin texture to an youthful, healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> Ok no difference in time</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Well, I found this lotion by accident and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Was glad when I could find it again.</li>
            <li> I truly love this product and will order more today</li>
            <li> I think it just leaves particles on TOP of your skin that dries and fills in the micro-wrinkles</li>
            <li> I just love the smell and how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> BUT, I will be reordering this for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like something that has a better &amp;#34;after-taste&amp;#34; than this, and has a fresher feel.</li>
            <li> I will buy more after I finished existing ones.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite body lotion for years</li>
            <li> I love love love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> but since I found it I have much better skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture of this lotion its not over powering so as not to bother my sinuses</li>
            <li> There is a glitter in it though which I didn&#x27;t expect but love.</li>
            <li> but I love the smell.</li>
            <li> yr old daughter thought so; and she loved the shimmer in the sunlight!</li>
            <li> Love this product - not disappointed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- strong perfume smell, which I&#x27;m not terribly fond on&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is becoming dryer as I age</li>
            <li> Olay brand, so great on sensitive skin like mine</li>
            <li> A nice lotion that is easily absorbed by my skin.  </li>
            <li> container has easy pump ,  the 2 pack lasts for over 1 month (using twice a day)</li>
            <li> The scent is too strong and also leaves a greasy feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> After using this again only two times I noticed my skin was not itching ALL the time, it no longer had that dry, crackly appearance, and best of all I was comfortable in my own skin again!</li>
            <li> Not as easy to find as it once was and no longer available on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve always had to use body sprays, so this isn&#x27;t TOOO strong of a smell, but good enough :-)</li>
            <li> But I can say that it has made a huge improvement in my skins texture as well as the appearance.</li>
            <li> i give this 3 only because it is a great light moisturizing lotion.  </li>
            <li> My hands are smooth also just from applying it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soooo smooth after putting it on...its like silk.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my arms feel firmer, my legs are smooth and feel firmer too, also I&#x27;ve see a difference on my elbows.</li>
            <li> BUT, the few times I have used it, my skin feels awesome when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, not available in stores.</li>
            <li> I found this to be sticky and not that comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and leaves a light shimmer on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have fair toned skin, Im getting around to 30 yrs young</li>
            <li> I read a review online saying that this was a very good body lotion compared to other brand name lotions, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I&#x27;d just run out of the lotion</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about four months now, and I can&#x27;t go to sleep unless I use the lotion right after a warm shower, and I can&#x27;t go out without applying it onto my arms and legs first.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and has a nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent (as I am very sensitive).</li>
            <li> I have the hardest time finding this lotion since I first used it and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Has little moisture sparkles in it and it makes you feel smooth and smell very good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of different kinds of lotion and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for just about everyone who wants soft, beautiful  skin!</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Has all the right ingredients!  </li>
            <li> Great lotion that I have used for years on my VERY dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Not that the hot weather is here, it really comes in handy.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon and Olay, I was able to order it on line.</li>
            <li> I love the smoothness and the gentle smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li> and I think it really does smooth out my skin!</li>
            <li> This product works and has a nice, soft scent.</li>
            <li> She wants more.</li>
            <li> The best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used hands down !!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> The scent is quite strong, I can&#x27;t really wear my perfume with it!</li>
            <li> The smell is super strong, it does fade throughout the day but when you first use it, it almost knocks you out.</li>
            <li> The new formulations of OLAY lotion do not smell the same nor do they give my skin the flawless radiance as with this product (thanks to the ingredient Mica).</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin with no oily or sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency; not too thick without feeling like water, and the staying power is great.</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal and shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;quenching&amp;#34; part isn&#x27;t good enough for dry climates, better for more humid climates</li>
            <li> Smells great, average lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there are too many lotions that live up to their hype.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t absorb easily (gotta really rub it</li>
            <li> I am not sure what more to say about  this product except that it is a good value.</li>
            <li> The lotion leaves a slight shimmer once you have it on, which is very nice.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, has a little bit of shimmer to it but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This lotion didn&#x27;t seem to firm like some of the others I have tried; however, it smells good and works fine as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Howrver, I did not see any improvements with my skin, other than the pleasant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell for sure.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so many lotions make it itch.</li>
            <li> I still love the lotion and how baby soft</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any particular firming action, but the lotion is still nice to use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the firming - not that any firming lotion really seems to make a difference, but I do enjoy the scent and the shimmer very much.</li>
            <li> Olay Quench Plus Firming Body Lotion is the right amount of moisture for my skin.  </li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice texture (not sticky or gummy like some are), spreads easily and gives my skin a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; without looking cheesy.  </li>
            <li> I found Olay lotion scent to strong, gave me a headache, but it made my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> has a nice feeling on very dry skin&#x3D;&#x3D;I</li>
            <li> I hope I will be able to find this product in the future.</li>
            <li> When I first started using Olay Quench</li>
            <li> Since I first started using Quench</li>
            <li> I dont notice much firming but the soctness of my skin alone is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I swear it kept me soft and silky smooth until I washed it off AND</li>
            <li> ;) J</li>
            <li> Best smelling produc with a subtly shimmer leaves the skin looking and feeling radiant!!</li>
            <li> It feels great; moisturized but not sticky and leaves a subtle sheen.</li>
            <li> Thow this does not really firm up your skin which I really didn&#x27;t expect it to do, it does make your skin feel so soft that you can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and scent wont compete with your favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> With our harsh winter weather I am very pleased to have found this product.</li>
            <li> As far as firming, I really don&#x27;t know if its done that, but its a good daily lotions keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this- after a couple weeks of daily application, makes an obvious difference, my over-50 year old skin looks much healthier and younger.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, leaving skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We can&#x27;t find it locally, and Amazon makes it easy to get.  </li>
            <li> Large bottle for price, plus you get two.</li>
            <li> I switched to using this last summer and have become loyal to it ever since!</li>
            <li> /&gt;She likes the lotion because it has a pleasant scent and has certain ingredients that makes her skin sparkle in the sun, not ostentatiously like glitter, but subtle.</li>
            <li> I do really like the way this product absorbs into skin.</li>
            <li> Makes your hands smooth and younger looking.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> o add, that it leaves traces of glitter on your skin, which really annoys my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and packing Was good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a very reliable body lotion.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do anything really at all....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find it in the stores in my area and was delighted to see that it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does firm dimples,  nice scent.</li>
            <li> When I can&#x27;t find it I buy other lotions which cost more and do not do the job I need it to do.</li>
            <li> Nothing really takes away the dryness completely but of everything I have tried Olay Quench has done the most to relive my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The mica leaves a very slight shimmer and the scent is light and clean.</li>
            <li> I apply as a body lotion, and place special attention to problem&lt;br /&gt;areas, such as \\&quot;knees and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty young, but I&#x27;m all about prevention at this age.  </li>
            <li> like the shimmer my skin has, and I love Olay products, but this one is just your average lotion with the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; as an afterthought.</li>
            <li> and I love the slight glisten it leaves when the sun hits your skin.</li>
            <li> I apply in the morning and my skin is still is still soft and smooth the next morning!</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok as a moisturizer, not really greasy and does keep your skin soft.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a glittery effect that makes your entire body feel so soft and smooth...</li>
            <li> I suffered with dry skin ,  I am nurse and I am constantly washing my hands .I can see results I love this</li>
            <li> I mean the scent is so amazing</li>
            <li> lightly scented Quench Plus goes on smoothly but leaves a slightly tacky sensation until it&#x27;s fully dry.</li>
            <li> This will eventually be discontinued in the coming months as Olay rolls out its new rebranding of Olay Quench where they will no longer have the firming body</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> ive been using it at night and my hands dont feel very soft after using it...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I did not notice any shimmer until I got out in the sunlight, there is a slight shimmer to this, but that&#x27;s fine with me not noticeable indoors.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this lotion forever or as long as they are in business or as long as I am alive:-)</li>
            <li> This is easy a person just rubs it in on the place where you want to firm up that part of your body.</li>
            <li> She is allergic to certain things in cosmetics and lotions especially soy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, and it should be clearly stated - I won&#x27;t be using this product.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend always comments on how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin look young and shinny.</li>
            <li> My 47 yr old eyes can&#x27;t even see it still.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how soft my skin is now.</li>
            <li> I keep this on hand near the bathroom sink, by the bedside, at my desk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a 13 year old girl.</li>
            <li> how insanely soft my hands and arms are now.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for providing this lotion as I can not find it at any of my local stores.</li>
            <li> As far as firming goes can&#x27;t say I have noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> but my skin is soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> As far as firming?</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> When I was 9 years old I was told by A doctor that I had elephant skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> The firming quench has a unique scent that lingers a little but doesn&#x27;t compete with body mists.</li>
            <li> Also, it adds a nice sparkle to my skin, very subtle but still noticeable.</li>
            <li> It has a slight fragrance, but not unpleasant, and it isn&#x27;t oily or make my skin sticky like Aveeno does.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that it is firming, but I do get compliments on how smooth my skin looks at my age.</li>
            <li> Sinks into skin and stays there, even on hot, humid days.</li>
            <li> I tried this when it first came out and was amazed with not only how well it moisturized but for how long it did.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so soft, has a nice, faint scent</li>
            <li> I have developed high blood pressure and the medication makes my skin very dry</li>
            <li> The pack of 2 is always great and the price isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get enough of how soft and moisturized it makes my skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not really paying much attention to it.  </li>
            <li> When they stopped selling it in stores I was unhappy, however, turned to Amazon and was delighted to find it.</li>
            <li> If you live in dry climates or have wrinkles, I would suggest Jergen&#x27;s Unscented body lotion.  </li>
            <li> I use olay facial lotion for sensitive skin with spf 15 every day, but recently discovered the quench lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this lotion for a few weeks but so far I really can&#x27;t say that I notice a change in the tightness level of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used keri lotion for so many years but it is a little hard to find, now that I have tried this one I am sticking to it.  </li>
            <li> I massage it into my skin until my skin feels soft and supple, and I spend a little more time on my drier spots such as behind my legs, my elbows, and lower back.</li>
            <li> It has changed my formerly dry and cracky skin back to the appearance and fell of much younger skin.</li>
            <li> have not seen much of a difference yet, not sure if I will purchase again</li>
            <li> It is my new everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54, and I&#x27;ve tried everything, including Olay body lotions to deal with my overall dry skin</li>
            <li> I have such dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin but with Olay I only have to use it once aday!!</li>
            <li> burns a little on sunburns, sensitive skin, or when my face has wind burns</li>
            <li> As long as my eczema stays under control, I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and firm.  </li>
            <li> I will keep sourcing it for as long as I can, as it is discontinued in Australia.</li>
            <li> That stuff is extremely, extremely moisturizing and the only thing that saves me during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> If you have not tried this product and you struggle with dry skin give it a chance, it may be what you are seeking.</li>
            <li> I purchased it locally, but in the last year I have had trouble finding it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a firming cream to help the loose skin from losing a lot of weight and giving birth.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m dry again in minutes!</li>
            <li> Not only does it give you a little shimmer, but my skin has never felt smoother.  </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed absolutely no shimmer - which I wanted.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not noticeable.</li>
            <li> im guessing it is firming but not very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Other  products I have had to put on a couple times a day for about 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few days to feel the difference!</li>
            <li> I not really sure if it actually firms my skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the firming at first, but after two weeks of use I can see a difference on my arms legs, and stomach.</li>
            <li> Tried other brands none work like this cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- not exactly firming...</li>
            <li> Having said that, it does help dry skin a little.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in them always changing their products and discontinuing the good ones.</li>
            <li> and it does not respond to other lotions no matter how expensive or how often or how much I put on...</li>
            <li> Thick enough to give me the moisture my body craves..</li>
            <li> I usually use cream oil moisturizers as I do have dry skin</li>
            <li> This lotion has a slight shimmer, I have been using it for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see even a slight difference.</li>
            <li> a little pricey&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Has a little bit of a shimmer look to it</li>
            <li> I am not as diligent as needed everyday to truly see the results as others have described but I will continue since I do like it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how firm your skin looks after one use.</li>
            <li> and I will see my skin start to firm?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t firm</li>
            <li> and she claims it keeps her aging skin firm and moist.</li>
            <li> but I can see a difference in my legs after a few days of using it.  </li>
            <li> The scent is rather plain, nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> contains reflective particles (very slight, metallic shimmer on</li>
            <li> After 5 days using on my arms at night my skin was crazy soft!!  </li>
            <li> She has very dry skin and being on dialysis makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> Now all I need is a small lotion bottle to put some in</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this works, i haven&#x27;t felt a difference</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; lotion; my scientific mind can not comprehend how a topical lotion can work</li>
            <li> I also live in a dry climate, so my skin suffers from cold and harsh conditions during the winter.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product, I believe, for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> I stopped using that lotion and have been using Olay lotion for at least a year.  </li>
            <li> As a person with extremely sensitive skin and horrible eczema, the Olay lotion is definitely a winner!</li>
            <li> I have been useing Olay for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> it is thick and glittery though.</li>
            <li> Just started using it so not sure of the&amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; qualities!</li>
            <li> It is very subtle and not over bearing.</li>
            <li> I have plenty of bottles of lotion in my bathroom that I have only used once because I hated them, but this is one I use every day.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> and I was using an expensive lotion for hydration.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!!!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed as I&#x27;m usually a fan of Olay products</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> I hated the smell, it&#x27;s perfume sickening.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in OLAY for its discontinuation.</li>
            <li> But this was horrible.</li>
            <li> Threw out my two bottles because I was so disgusted by the scent.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do really like the way this product absorbs into skin. It goes on smoothly and smells good. I am not as diligent as needed everyday to truly see the results as others have described but I will continue since I do like it.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion...Hard to find in the stores.  My skin feels very soft and has a nice light fragrance.  Just started using it so not sure of the&amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; qualities!</li>
            <li> Pretty glittery sheen and excellent moisture.</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54, and I&#x27;ve tried everything, including Olay body lotions to deal with my overall dry skin&lt;br /&gt;that started when I turned 50... nothing impressed me until I found this!  I noticed such a&lt;br /&gt;dramatic difference in just 1 week.  I apply as a body lotion, and place special attention to problem&lt;br /&gt;areas, such as \\&quot;knees and elbows\\&quot;.  I now have my younger skin I \\&quot;used to have\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve been an&lt;br /&gt;Olay fan since my teens when I noticed my grandmother used Olay, and she had beautiful skin!</li>
            <li> Makes your hands smooth and younger looking. I receive may compliments on the scent.  I have one in the bathroom and one on&lt;br /&gt;my nightstand.</li>
            <li> Olay Quench Plus Firming Body Lotion is the right amount of moisture for my skin.  I am not sure that it is firming, but I do get compliments on how smooth my skin looks at my age.</li>
            <li> I read a review online saying that this was a very good body lotion compared to other brand name lotions, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I&#x27;d just run out of the lotion I kept at home. But I just couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! I searched it online and amazon was selling it at a good price for two, so I bought it. I&#x27;m so glad I did because I love this lotion! It is, in my opinion, way better than Aveeno body lotion. I&#x27;ve been using Olay Quench Plus Firming Body Lotion for a couple of days now and I can&#x27;t get enough of how soft and moisturized it makes my skin. Also, it adds a nice sparkle to my skin, very subtle but still noticeable. It has a slight fragrance, but not unpleasant, and it isn&#x27;t oily or make my skin sticky like Aveeno does. This is by far the best body lotion I have ever used, I just wish I had tried Olay sooner. Now all I need is a small lotion bottle to put some in so I can take it wherever I go.</li>
            <li> I suffered with dry skin ,  I am nurse and I am constantly washing my hands .I can see results I love this I think you would too if you try it.</li>
            <li> I like it. I always have. Always will. My boyfriend always comments on how soft my skin is. I like the scent too.</li>
            <li> The new formulations of OLAY lotion do not smell the same nor do they give my skin the flawless radiance as with this product (thanks to the ingredient Mica). I am very disappointed in OLAY for its discontinuation. I hope I will be able to find this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years and nothing compares.  Just wish I could still get it automatically sent to me.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use several Olay products and this is one of my favorites.  It makes my skin feel like silk and it feels great while you are putting it on.  My hands are smooth also just from applying it.  I highly recommend this product for just about everyone who wants soft, beautiful  skin!</li>
            <li> Wanted an alternative to the more expensive cellulite treatment creams. Haven&#x27;t seen much difference but then I am not diligent so prob my fault.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how firm your skin looks after one use. I didn&#x27;t expect the results I did. This product makes your skin look young and shinny. A great buy!!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but had to for this.  This was recommended by Paula from Beautypedia, so after reading the reviews here I decided to try it.  Unbelievable!!!!  After 5 days using on my arms at night my skin was crazy soft!!  Even my 16 yr old daughter thought so; and she loved the shimmer in the sunlight! LOL! My 47 yr old eyes can&#x27;t even see it still.  And the fragrance is lovely!  I will definitely be keeping this in stock.  Can&#x27;t even imagine how great my skin wil be when I start using a skin exfoliator.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
            <li> I find it rather moisturizing but did not like the way it felt like it stuck to my skin and did not absorb.</li>
            <li> I use this product to control my varicose veins. This is easy a person just rubs it in on the place where you want to firm up that part of your body. It smell great. I have just started using it a week ago. We&#x27;ll see how it helps or not. It&#x27;s too early to tell for sure. Other  products I have had to put on a couple times a day for about 20 to 30 seconds. With Olay quench plus firming body lotion  I apply it once, and it goes on like lotion. The quality of this product is above my expectations.</li>
            <li> Best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!! Smells great, feels wonderful going on and leaves skin silky, not tacky. Wish it was still available in stores!</li>
            <li> I hated the smell, it&#x27;s perfume sickening. This is being returned, gave me a headache. I thought it would be non invasive smell</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the firming - not that any firming lotion really seems to make a difference, but I do enjoy the scent and the shimmer very much.</li>
            <li> When I first started using Olay Quench I purchased it locally, but in the last year I have had trouble finding it. Thanks to Amazon and Olay, I was able to order it on line. I love the smoothness and the gentle smell of the lotion. If you haven&#x27;t tried it---you should!!!!</li>
            <li> I use olay facial lotion for sensitive skin with spf 15 every day, but recently discovered the quench lotions. First: awesome fragrances. Second: greaseless. Sinks into skin and stays there, even on hot, humid days. Third: no rash, breakout or bumps. I have sensitive skin, so many lotions make it itch. Not this. I feel like I finally got what I paid for and if my local drug store stops carrying it, I will order here. Really, these are excellent lotions. The firming quench has a unique scent that lingers a little but doesn&#x27;t compete with body mists. I don&#x27;t think there are too many lotions that live up to their hype. I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I have used keri lotion for so many years but it is a little hard to find, now that I have tried this one I am sticking to it.  Smells great and I think it really does smooth out my skin!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so good, that I don&#x27;t have to use body sprays. I get headaches from perfume so I&#x27;ve always had to use body sprays, so this isn&#x27;t TOOO strong of a smell, but good enough :-) I did not notice any shimmer until I got out in the sunlight, there is a slight shimmer to this, but that&#x27;s fine with me not noticeable indoors. As far as firming, I really don&#x27;t know if its done that, but its a good daily lotions keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this lotion! My skin has never been softer. I don&#x27;t know if it truly has any &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; effects but I don&#x27;t care. That&#x27;s how soft my skin is now.</li>
            <li> I have the hardest time finding this lotion since I first used it and fell in love with it. When I can&#x27;t find it I buy other lotions which cost more and do not do the job I need it to do. Since I first started using Quench I have developed high blood pressure and the medication makes my skin very dry and it does not respond to other lotions no matter how expensive or how often or how much I put on...I have to slather then I &#x27;m dry again in minutes! After using this again only two times I noticed my skin was not itching ALL the time, it no longer had that dry, crackly appearance, and best of all I was comfortable in my own skin again! If you have not tried this product and you struggle with dry skin give it a chance, it may be what you are seeking.</li>
            <li> very happy with it and would definitely recommend buying it.  It replaced the Jergens moisturizer I was using and now I won&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful.  My skin is soooo smooth after putting it on...its like silk.  I apply it immediately after i shower and it stays that way until i shower again.  My husband literally cant keep his hands off me since i started using this.  Best ltion i have ever used.  I dont notice much firming but the soctness of my skin alone is worth it.  Its amazing!</li>
            <li> The BEST. Really does firm up your aging skin. It only takes a few days to feel the difference! Not as easy to find as it once was and no longer available on subscribe and save. I fear it is on the way out as with all of my favorite Olay products. Very disappointed in them always changing their products and discontinuing the good ones.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, I believe, for at least 10 years. I use to be able to buy it in the stores, but one by one it has been disappearing. It has a nice light scent (as I am very sensitive). It absorbs quickly into the skin with no oily or sticky residue. It contains some shimmer, that adds to the glow of your skin. I hope that I can still get this via Amazon for years to come.</li>
            <li> But this was horrible. Threw out my two bottles because I was so disgusted by the scent. Also, I noticed absolutely no shimmer - which I wanted. So disappointed!</li>
            <li> I keep this on hand near the bathroom sink, by the bedside, at my desk. It has changed my formerly dry and cracky skin back to the appearance and fell of much younger skin.</li>
            <li> This is the third brand of lotion I&#x27;ve tried on my quest for a body lotion and it&#x27;s a keeper. I love the consistency; not too thick without feeling like water, and the staying power is great. I&#x27;ve used it for almost a week and am starting to see a noticeable difference in my skin. It feels great; moisturized but not sticky and leaves a subtle sheen. It&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Thow this does not really firm up your skin which I really didn&#x27;t expect it to do, it does make your skin feel so soft that you can&#x27;t stop touching it. Like your running your hand over velvet.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter.  She is allergic to certain things in cosmetics and lotions especially soy.  She loves this lotion! She said this is the best her skin has ever looked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;ve since found a better, cheaper one.</li>
            <li> Smells good, soothing and  absorbs quickly.  Not greasy but it leaves a sparkle (which my girlfriend likes).</li>
            <li> It is a nice scented lotion but I noticed it made my skin feel a bit rubbery after use. I ended up giving it away, my mom did not seem to mind the feel at all but it bothered me a bit. For that reason I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I am surprised but this is a great body lotion!</li>
            <li> Has all the right ingredients!  Gave one for a gift!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Lotion and the scent and texture are great. The price is great too and would reccommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever used. I apply in the morning and my skin is still is still soft and smooth the next morning! The scent is quite strong, I can&#x27;t really wear my perfume with it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok as a moisturizer, not really greasy and does keep your skin soft. My review is because of the smell and sparkle. The smell is super strong, it does fade throughout the day but when you first use it, it almost knocks you out. It&#x27;s kind of a musky smell. Also, this s*** sparkles. I&#x27;m not a 13 year old girl. I do not want to sparkle. It didn&#x27;t say anything in the description (nor does the bottle) about sparkles or shimmer or anything like that. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> have not seen much of a difference yet, not sure if I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Pack of two - arrived packaged as if it was going to go onto a store shelf. Love this product - not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a firming cream to help the loose skin from losing a lot of weight and giving birth. It does have a glitter glow.but the glitter is so micro tiny it&#x27;s really not noticeable. It&#x27;s the perfect lotion for my skin. Thick enough to give me the moisture my body craves..but not cause me to break out! As for the firming part..I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all. It&#x27;s been maybe a month? My skin quality has improved in being softer and my body doesn&#x27;t breakout into pimples or a rash. Which is why I&#x27;ve stayed away from lotions for so many years. I still love the lotion and how baby soft my skin now feels. I get so many complements on how insanely soft my hands and arms are now. It&#x27;s a good buy but it&#x27;s not magic in a bottle. Maybe more time and I will see my skin start to firm? We will see.</li>
            <li> The scent is too strong and also leaves a greasy feeling on my skin. It might be helpfult o add, that it leaves traces of glitter on your skin, which really annoys my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for about 2 months now and I can honestly say that I have seen an improvement in my skin tone. I not really sure if it actually firms my skin. But I can say that it has made a huge improvement in my skins texture as well as the appearance. My skin is a lot softer and smoother now. I have been using this lotion along with the Olay Quench soap. I am extremly pleased with the way this two products have improved my skin texture to an youthful, healthy appearance. I also like the shimmer that it gives. It is very subtle and not over bearing.Thanks Amazon for providing this lotion as I can not find it at any of my local stores.</li>
            <li> I used Olay Anti Aging Body Lotion for a while and loved it! I mistakenly tried this one, and put a tiny bit on my arm.  I immediately saw a red area on my arm, which started to itch and burn, and realized I cannot use this product.  I would have returned it but tossed the receipt and box away.  I gave them away to a friend.  I wish I had exchanged them for the Olay I had been using..the anti aging #7.</li>
            <li> Ok no difference in time tho</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ever find this lotion in stores. It is a great product, has a little bit of shimmer to it but doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. The pack of 2 is always great and the price isn&#x27;t too bad. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Always use it. Has little moisture sparkles in it and it makes you feel smooth and smell very good.  Not that the hot weather is here, it really comes in handy.  I will continue to purchase this lotion forever or as long as they are in business or as long as I am alive:-)</li>
            <li> Very happy with this- after a couple weeks of daily application, makes an obvious difference, my over-50 year old skin looks much healthier and younger.</li>
            <li> I used to use the firming lotion from Bath and body works. However, that one has been discontinued. I switched to using this last summer and have become loyal to it ever since! It makes my skin very soft. There is a noticeable firming effect, but nothing too drastic. The lotion leaves a slight shimmer once you have it on, which is very nice. The scent is rather plain, nothing to brag about. I really do recommend this lotion. It&#x27;s perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li> I have fair toned skin, Im getting around to 30 yrs young and, I was looking for a body lotion that wasn&#x27;t greasy and that kept my skin moisturized all day. Well, I found this lotion by accident and I&#x27;m glad I did. it does keep my skin moisturized but I can also see it firming my skin. I was skeptical about the firming at first, but after two weeks of use I can see a difference on my arms legs, and stomach. I noticed that my arms feel firmer, my legs are smooth and feel firmer too, also I&#x27;ve see a difference on my elbows. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have such dry skin in the winter. Nothing really takes away the dryness completely but of everything I have tried Olay Quench has done the most to relive my dry skin. As far as firming goes can&#x27;t say I have noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> My skin is becoming dryer as I age and I was using an expensive lotion for hydration. I stopped using that lotion and have been using Olay lotion for at least a year.  This product works and has a nice, soft scent. There are several Olay lotions but this one is the one for me.</li>
            <li> This lotion didn&#x27;t seem to firm like some of the others I have tried; however, it smells good and works fine as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> best firming cream .  Used it for years then couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in the stores.  Tried other brands none work like this cream.  Was glad when I could find it again.</li>
            <li> I truly love this product and will order more today</li>
            <li> This lotion has a slight shimmer, I have been using it for about 5 years. When they stopped selling it in stores I was unhappy, however, turned to Amazon and was delighted to find it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty young, but I&#x27;m all about prevention at this age.  I figured the things I do now will affect me in the decades to come.  I also live in a dry climate, so my skin suffers from cold and harsh conditions during the winter.  I thought firming would be great since my skin micro-wrinkles when the weather gets bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- comes in big bottles, so lasts a while&lt;br /&gt;- average moisturing, like normal lotion&lt;br /&gt;- Olay brand, so great on sensitive skin like mine&lt;br /&gt;- contains reflective particles (very slight, metallic shimmer on skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- not exactly firming...I think it just leaves particles on TOP of your skin that dries and fills in the micro-wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;- strong perfume smell, which I&#x27;m not terribly fond on&lt;br /&gt;- burns a little on sunburns, sensitive skin, or when my face has wind burns&lt;br /&gt;- a little pricey&lt;br /&gt;- the &amp;#34;quenching&amp;#34; part isn&#x27;t good enough for dry climates, better for more humid climates&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t absorb easily (gotta really rub it in)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.  If you live in dry climates or have wrinkles, I would suggest Jergen&#x27;s Unscented body lotion.  That stuff is extremely, extremely moisturizing and the only thing that saves me during the winter months.  It absorbs into your skin and lasts all day.  But...for that reason don&#x27;t put it on your face or you&#x27;ll get acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the shimmer my skin has, and I love Olay products, but this one is just your average lotion with the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; as an afterthought.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion! This is such a great deal and shipping is fast. I have 1 bottle upstairs and 1 downstairs! I just love the smell and how my skin feels. I don&#x27;t know about firming effect but my skin is soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so shimmery and sparkly. Shimmer will transfer everywhere, your clothes, bags and face!</li>
            <li> The best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used hands down !!!&#x27; I have dry skin but with Olay I only have to use it once aday!! Love it !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. As far as firming? Don&#x27;t see even a slight difference. BUT, I will be reordering this for sure. The scent is amazing and it gives my skin moisture and a unobtrusive shimmer that makes it look very healthy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any firming happening, but it&#x27;s good lotion.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times. BUT, the few times I have used it, my skin feels awesome when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> Smells great but dries too quickly and doesn&#x27;t moisturize. Very disappointed as I&#x27;m usually a fan of Olay products</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any change to recommend or say its good. it is thick and glittery though. Not sure if this works, i haven&#x27;t felt a difference</li>
            <li> Luv this lotion I mean the scent is so amazing, I don&#x27;t need to put extra perfume on my skin. This lotion does it for me. When I put the lotion on my skin it leaves glitter on the skin but I actually like it gives you a shimmering look.</li>
            <li> I suppose if I were 15 having gold sparkly skin would be great.  I don&#x27;t like it, and it should be clearly stated - I won&#x27;t be using this product.</li>
            <li> Great lotion that I have used for years on my VERY dry skin.  I have been unable to find it in the stores in my area and was delighted to see that it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion! I&#x27;ve been using it for about four months now, and I can&#x27;t go to sleep unless I use the lotion right after a warm shower, and I can&#x27;t go out without applying it onto my arms and legs first. I massage it into my skin until my skin feels soft and supple, and I spend a little more time on my drier spots such as behind my legs, my elbows, and lower back. As a person with extremely sensitive skin and horrible eczema, the Olay lotion is definitely a winner!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for myself but nowhere was it mentioned the lotion had glitter.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t firm but it&#x27;s still nice for lotion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the firming part but it does a great job at moisturizing my skin. Lasts a long time and scent wont compete with your favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> use it daily . Good moisteriser</li>
            <li> I ordered Olay Body Firming Reviver Lotion, but I received Olay Quench Plus Body Firming Lotion. I notified Amazon and they sent a replacement, but it was the same Quench Plus Body Firming Lotion. So, I searched the NDC number online and it appears they both have the same NDC number. I assume this means the Firming Reviver Lotion was renamed \\&quot;Quench Plus Body Firming Lotion.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lightly scented Quench Plus goes on smoothly but leaves a slightly tacky sensation until it&#x27;s fully dry. I have no idea how \\&quot;firming\\&quot; it is, because my skin doesn&#x27;t need firming. I do like how it keeps me from drying out. As long as my eczema stays under control, I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;__________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/13/13: It appears Amazon has amended its listing to the correct product name. I&#x27;m still using this and it works well throughout the day to keep me moisturized.</li>
            <li> Best smelling produc with a subtly shimmer leaves the skin looking and feeling radiant!!</li>
            <li> A nice lotion that is easily absorbed by my skin.  I don&#x27;t notice any particular firming action, but the lotion is still nice to use.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Feels great and does not leave your skin feeling greasy. Has a little bit of a shimmer look to it but I don&#x27;t mind it. I would recommend this product to everyone. I am constantly reordering it.</li>
            <li> Returned it - scent was too overpowering and cloying</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s my standby. The mica leaves a very slight shimmer and the scent is light and clean. Cannot beat Olay for a drug store moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, not available in stores. Dries quickly, leaving skin soft and silky. My wife swears by it!</li>
            <li> I found this to be sticky and not that comfortable to use. I&#x27;d like something that has a better &amp;#34;after-taste&amp;#34; than this, and has a fresher feel.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. It is non greasy and leaves a light shimmer on your skin. The fragrance is very nice and not overpowering. It is my new everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion my Mother will use, if we can find it.  She has very dry skin and being on dialysis makes it worse.  I try to buy eight at a time, because she uses it up so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can&#x27;t find it locally, and Amazon makes it easy to get.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom a couple years back and she claims it keeps her aging skin firm and moist. She wants more. So I guess it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> This is good buy. Cheaper than the store. Suggest to buy this one. I will buy more after I finished existing ones.</li>
            <li> feels good on the skin and is not greasy</li>
            <li> given as a present. She liked it and uses it every day</li>
            <li> It is a great lotion. But does no firming.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my wife loves the Olay Quench plus firming body lotion. This will eventually be discontinued in the coming months as Olay rolls out its new rebranding of Olay Quench where they will no longer have the firming body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes the lotion because it has a pleasant scent and has certain ingredients that makes her skin sparkle in the sun, not ostentatiously like glitter, but subtle. It moisturizes and does not leave a greasy or oily feel on your skin.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite body lotion for years and I was so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  I have 4 bottles stocked up at home.  Makes your skin feel so soft, has a nice, faint scent and I love the slight glisten it leaves when the sun hits your skin.</li>
            <li> This is great over-the-counter lotion for your entire body at a great price. We&#x27;ve been using this for years ,and tried others.. and we keep going back to this product.</li>
            <li> I usually use cream oil moisturizers as I do have dry skin and I&#x27;m not one to reapply throughout the day.  I tried this when it first came out and was amazed with not only how well it moisturized but for how long it did.  I swear it kept me soft and silky smooth until I washed it off AND with no greasiness whatsoever.  A delight of a product with an exceptionally good price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and firm.  My daughter noticed within 1 week of use on legs and arms.  container has easy pump ,  the 2 pack lasts for over 1 month (using twice a day)</li>
            <li> Feels and smells great.  Really moisturizes.  I am not sure what more to say about  this product except that it is a good value.</li>
            <li> has a nice feeling on very dry skin&#x3D;&#x3D;I don&#x27;t know about the firming feature as to what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I love love love this lotion.  Not only does it give you a little shimmer, but my skin has never felt smoother.  I will never use another.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just lotion. Nothing special. Having said that, it does help dry skin a little. I don&#x27;t use it for the firming aspect.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a glittery effect that makes your entire body feel so soft and smooth...I add alittle body oil in it for a great scent.</li>
            <li> nice scent ..im guessing it is firming but not very moisturizing .. ive been using it at night and my hands dont feel very soft after using it...dont think i will b buying this item again..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of different kinds of lotion and this one is by far the best. It keeps my skin soft and moisturized for hours. I won&#x27;t use anything else after this!</li>
            <li> I have been useing Olay for at least 20 years. When I was 9 years old I was told by A doctor that I had elephant skin. At that time I didn&#x27;t know about Olay but since I found it I have much better skin.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and packing Was good.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for last 7 years. The product shipped was the same as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the best moisturizer I have used .</li>
            <li> This is a very reliable body lotion. With our harsh winter weather I am very pleased to have found this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this lotion for a few weeks but so far I really can&#x27;t say that I notice a change in the tightness level of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it and see if that changes...then report back. ;) J</li>
            <li> i give this 3 only because it is a great light moisturizing lotion.  Not that fond of the &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; nor does it smell that great.  I also haven&#x27;t noticed the firming</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion ever!! For some reason my local Walgreens quit carrying it and I was so happy to have found it on Amazon.  This is my second time ordering it and I will order again.</li>
            <li> Does firm dimples,  nice scent. Large bottle for price, plus you get two. Can&#x27;t go wtong with this purchase. Thanks</li>
            <li> I found Olay lotion scent to strong, gave me a headache, but it made my skin feel so soft. I still had to discontinue using it...</li>
            <li> Smells great, average lotion. Howrver, I did not see any improvements with my skin, other than the pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assumed it would help reduce the appearance of cellulite but it didn&#x27;t do anything really at all....</li>
            <li> I used to buy this years ago and all of a sudden, couldn&#x27;t find it! So glad I can get it here!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and texture of this lotion its not over powering so as not to bother my sinuses it has micro glitter that makes your skin shinny.</li>
            <li> Although I ordered Olay Quench, but received Olay body Firming Reviver I must say that this product is very good and does basically the same good job as the quench.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed firming but I&#x27;m not really paying much attention to it.  The smell is great. There is a glitter in it though which I didn&#x27;t expect but love.</li>
            <li> The Olay Quench Firming Body lotion is by far the BEST moisturiser I have ever used. I don&#x27;t know if my skin is visibly firmer, but it feels like baby&#x27;s skin to the touch. I will keep sourcing it for as long as I can, as it is discontinued in Australia.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so good. It&#x27;s perfect for ethnic women like me. This lotion kept my skin moisturizes until all day and all night.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes your skin feel so soft. I have very sensitive skin and it works great for me. There is a scent to it but I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about a &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; lotion; my scientific mind can not comprehend how a topical lotion can work but I can see a difference in my legs after a few days of using it.  This lotion has a nice texture (not sticky or gummy like some are), spreads easily and gives my skin a nice &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; without looking cheesy.  I have plenty of bottles of lotion in my bathroom that I have only used once because I hated them, but this is one I use every day.  I highly recommend!</li>
