            <li>This is a good precision tool.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for these to be a bit sharper, they take a fair amount of pressure to make a cut.</li>

            <li>Magic!  </li>

            <li>These are the absolute BEST.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled I did.  </li>
            <li>They are a nice quality product.</li>
            <li>A cover or locking handle would have been nice.  </li>
            <li>These are really handy and they work well for nipping the curved edges of nails.</li>
            <li>Very nice and comfortable nail cutter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a comfortable, easily controled handle with a very good</li>
            <li>new clippers worked just perfect for my toenails.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and good cutters.</li>
            <li>good product,sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>THis is a very strong, well made clipper...</li>
            <li>I kind of baulked when I saw the price, but I&#x27;ve discovered with many things (like kitchen knives)</li>
            <li>These things are just great and priced about right.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend!</li>
            <li>This nail nipper is high quality, sturdy, easy to use, looks good, and just all around great.</li>
            <li>Most used purchase ever ..</li>
            <li>Couldn t be better.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t find a better nipper at any price.</li>
            <li>Nothing better on the market.</li>
            <li>enables me to keep my toenails in healthy condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t have to purchase another ever, since it looks to be a heavy-duty item.</li>
            <li>and I have bought and discarded many.  </li>
            <li>I have used so many nail clippers that just bend and don&#x27;t cut, that I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
            <li>it is worth paying more for good quality steel.</li>
            <li>Arrived in package, works great, allows much finer cuts.</li>
            <li>Better off use scissors.</li>
            <li>I thought this one might be better than a toe clipper.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love the Seki Edge Nail Nipper.  </li>
            <li>am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Most Nail  Nippers slip in my hand and then grind to a halt as they try to cut threw the nail..</li>
            <li>This is a a top tier nail nipper.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I think given some more time, I&#x27;ll like them more.</li>
            <li>and he said is the perfect tool to do it, I believe the same, so thank you to let us have it.</li>
            <li>Certainly better that what you would find in a drug store for those of us who have to deal with fungus in our toenails.</li>
            <li>this is OK quality and works</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>but they do come with a tip cover to store safely</li>
            <li>They work much better than toe nail clippers.</li>
            <li>sure you turn the curve of the blade to match the toenail.</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t sure if i should return or not</li>
            <li>excellent quality, the steel has a flawless finish and seems to be super tough.</li>
            <li>The cut is very smooth and the force needed to perform the cut is easy on the hand.</li>
            <li>while the Erbe fit perfectly in my hand ( I have medium sized male hands )</li>
            <li>/&gt;Of note, I looked at the other choices of clippers and these are the best of what I was able to find.</li>
            <li>Controlling how far they fly is a bit of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality, nicely machined, very easy to use, allow for safe, accurate trimming.</li>
            <li>Perfect for thick nails and good size for the smaller hand to hold, really happy with them.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and sharp; it does a great job!</li>
            <li>Pretty close to salon quality or Better!</li>
            <li>This excellent product is so sharp it make nail trimming easy on both fingers and toes.</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate and easy to cut.</li>
            <li>It is too easy to cut into the corners of a toenail and cause problems for people.</li>
            <li>These Seki Edge clippers, while not inexpensive, are well-constructed, made in Japan, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nobody found them easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and the storage cover for the blades is a&lt;br /&gt;plus to avoid damage when not being used for nail grooming.</li>
            <li>: nail clippings are ejected with a strong snap and go flying away from the toe.</li>
            <li>Well made, good value, and highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp edges and the edges line up perfectly for a very clean and smooth</li>
            <li>I can get a very good grip on them and they are comfortable to use, even for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>It works fine.  </li>
            <li>Now it seems fine.</li>
            <li>play guitar fingerpicking style and nail length on one hand is important.  </li>
            <li>After trimming my fingernail&#x27;s I no longer need to file the edges to smooth them.</li>
            <li>This device is--as others here have keenly observed--a genuine precision instrument.</li>
            <li>My nail cuticles are fabulous now.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Cut, neat and smooth</li>
            <li>While the design of this nail clipper is great, the craftsmanship and warranty is a completely different story.</li>
            <li>The feel is comfortable to your hands.</li>
            <li>cheap, buy twice&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Seki Edge will cut cleanly and easily through the thickest toe nails.</li>
            <li>but if you expect precision - namely, the blades meeting precisely</li>
            <li>Whether that&#x27;s important or not, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Accurate and precise each time without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li>but then it IS cheap ( for a nipper )</li>
            <li>The latter is both better designed and the quality of steel is clearly superior.</li>
            <li>Time will tell but thus far this item seems to be of very good quality, has a good &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; in its use and works extremely well.</li>
            <li>They do come with a rubber cap to put over the blades while not using them which is very useful.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied - does exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>but, trust me, they are worth it!  </li>
            <li>The Seki Edge Ss-202 Professional Nail Nipper is the best personal &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; I have acquired.  </li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;d have to have the flexibility of a yoga master to do so safely with positive results.</li>
            <li>this nipper though the quality is not so great - it&#x27;s sharp but it still feels cheap -</li>
            <li>Fine quality, but didn&#x27;t deliver exciting results.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not as large as most toenail clippers I&#x27;ve seen or used</li>
            <li>Wow, these are really nice.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and I am able to cut my toenails now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for clipping very short (once you get the hang of it) I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months</li>
            <li>It cuts quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>I had mine professionally sharpened and now they&#x27;re a pretty good clipper.</li>
            <li>Theses clippers was totally awesome , they work great on my thick toe nails due to fungus on them .</li>
            <li>This is the first toenail clipper I have found that works, and it works fine.</li>
            <li>The older I get the more rigid my nails become.  </li>
            <li>After many purchases of nail cutters for toenails from stores including visits to podiatrists , I went through the Amazon list and especially the Members grading and star rating to find the better nail cutters available.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s probably descent quick home protection.</li>
            <li>Although it is a small appliance, it has great leverage and is easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>They are nice and sharp work great, much better than my previous one I had from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>So, slight annoyance but still love this much more!    </li>
            <li>New clippers have arrived, and while they are an industrial work of art, I&#x27;m not getting any better at using them.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and very versatile.</li>
            <li>These clippers are very sharp and just the right curve to give great results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to get my own clippers</li>
            <li>Although it is made as a quality product, it&#x27;s not as useful as a toe clipper.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>I liked what I read about this Seki product, so I decided to spend the extra money and take a chance.</li>
            <li>may be this gives it a good grip when he hand is wet.</li>
            <li>They are a quality product and worth the price.</li>
            <li>more inclined to cut good tissue rather than thick nail.</li>
            <li>This clipper is nicely made, only wished it were larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does take a little more effort to cut the toenails since they&#x27;re more thick and had to learn how to angle it the right way to get the best cut.</li>
            <li>I suppose this clipper together with their straight edge would be a very useful pair.</li>
            <li>Sharp with good edge holding capability.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp, which is good.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to be able to cut my toenails easily, without the usual effort and without having to soak my feet first.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for a good pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li>It was  priced right</li>
            <li>The spring has just the right amount of resistance.</li>
            <li>Right size.  </li>
            <li>They are very sharp and precise and make my toes much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this side-cutter design, and it seems to be more practical than the old, oversized fingernail clipper type clippers.</li>
            <li>Could use slightly longer handles for increased leverage, but overall excellent.</li>
            <li>finally found a great pair of clippers for hubby&#x27;s extra thick toe nails - does a great job and worth every penny</li>
            <li>The finish is brushed stainless and has a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed and what I ordered.</li>
            <li>OK not my big toenails with ease</li>
            <li>Cuts even the first time&lt;</li>
            <li>This is a truly outstanding product and will probably last years to boot.</li>
            <li>Just received and used for the first time...</li>
            <li>I use it regularly and I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>A toe clipper with larger opening should be better, which I am still searching for.</li>
            <li>am pretty dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Screw holding the spring popped out on my first usage.</li>
            <li>Based on the claims for this product as a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; nipper, I assumed it would cut the toenails like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>Strong, sharp, easy to use.</li>
            <li>these nippers work perfectly... have to be careful with them as they are very sharp</li>
            <li>I am right handed yet found this clipper easy to operate with my left hand</li>
            <li>Could be better with larger handles, but I do have rather large hands.</li>
            <li>The grip is firm and the product looks like it will last many years, very pleased I bought it</li>
            <li>Those with big hands might be more comfortable handling a slightly larger clipper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are just too small for my purposes but should be fine for people with more flexibility bending over than i have.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, very sharp.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp edge nice feel in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bade is too short to reach across the toenails on the big toe of the foot and the curve causes a deeper cut on one edge instead of being able to cut cleanly across the toenail.</li>
            <li>you would think the Seki is some kind of a joke compared to the Erbe - half the size, about 1/4 of the weight - however for some reason</li>
            <li>it took enough strength to cut them that I thought the clipper was going to break, and I am really strong.</li>
            <li>This nail nipper is of very high quality.</li>
            <li>These cutters are very well-made from Japan, very sharp and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>the cutting edge alignment is perfect and very well horned.</li>
            <li>Very sharp-works well</li>
            <li>but they work really well</li>
            <li>I may have been expecting too much.</li>
            <li>I have nerve damage in one hand and this makes the job of trimming nails a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li>these work really well.</li>
            <li>I did not like how much curve there is in the blade.  </li>
            <li>The moon shaped blades are very convenient.</li>
            <li>He said that it has made it so much easier for him clip his nails and his toe nails.</li>
            <li>The head is curved meaning you cannot get a straight cut of the tow nail.</li>
            <li>These nail cutters work very well.</li>
            <li>all stainless steel.</li>
            <li>and these really did the job.  </li>
            <li>I feel it is much easier to cut and shape your nails and finish quicker with these.</li>
            <li>which is very painful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Need something with much longer handles.</li>
            <li>you can go to the local supermarket and get one of those cheaply made versions in the beauty supply aisle, but as my grandfather once told me, &amp;#34;buy</li>
            <li>it cannot cut straight across nails,  you have to keep moving it.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful not to cut more than you intend.</li>
            <li>Much difficulty controlling bleeding....</li>
            <li>Do not recommend especially for diabetic whose foot condition is so important.</li>
            <li>These worked very well.</li>
            <li>needed a good unit because I have thick nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nicely curved, they do not need a powerful grip to do their job on thick nails.</li>
            <li>nippers are just the right size, they are sharp and easy to use on both fingers and toes.  </li>
            <li>As long as they stay sharp for a decent lenght of time I am extremely happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It does fine with the other nails, but at this money it should also be able to handle the big toenails.</li>
            <li>This nail clipper is great, it is very sharp and cuts nails easily that others had a hard time to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works better than other nail nippers I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Japanese steel at its best, watch out when you cut your toenails, it was difficult for me to get used to it at first.</li>
            <li>i have both the small and the big one, and i prefer the big one - but the quality in excellent on both.  </li>
            <li>Superb design; blades are perfectly smooth, perfectly sharp, meet exactly, with narrow sharp tips and are curved so that the back of the blade doesn&#x27;t get in the way of the cut like cheaper nippers do.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp, I am glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>Particularly in grown toenails.</li>
            <li>The tool would not cut even with considerable effort was applied, I expected my wife to be able to use the clipper on my feet.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>- I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these nippers.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the purchase of this clipper.</li>
            <li>High quality.....made in Japan.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why there were so many positive</li>
            <li>These nail nippers are fine except they don&#x27;t have a plastic tip to keep the blades closed.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to hold and sharp.  </li>
            <li>They are quite sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is strong and sharp.  </li>
            <li>Heavy duty clippers and works like I thought they would even better.</li>
            <li>I like a fresh pair of nail nippers for my constant hang nails.  </li>
            <li>They are also effective at trimming thick toenails.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they are fine.</li>
            <li>Other than that they work fine.</li>
            <li>Sharp as a pin, and quite adequate to do my rather hardened toe nails!</li>
            <li>Its easy to use on someone else, but more difficult to use on yourself.</li>
            <li>You can probably see 10 different sellers for this item on Amazon, right?</li>
            <li>The springs provide the right feel and it seems that they will last forever.</li>
            <li>Used in combination with the Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper makes a good combination for old tough toe nails.</li>
            <li>This one is very sharp and well designed and cut my toenails easily.  </li>
            <li>Very sharply and easy cut.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These nail nippers are high quality professional grade and the quality shows.  </li>
            <li>Also, be careful with the sharp&lt;br /&gt;points, can easily stab you if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I suffer from ingrown toenails and needed a sharp clipper to keep them maintained and these fit the bill so far.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not careful you&#x27;ll cut you&#x27;re whole toe off.</li>
            <li>Professional equipment!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, high quality, large enough to grip and use.</li>
            <li>This clipper is really, really sharp and cleanly cuts through the toughest nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you&#x27;re tired of &#x27;hacking&#x27; at your troublesome nails or would be delighted to simply fine-tune your regular manicure or pedicure to a tee, these clippers are worth the money.</li>
            <li>I had the impression that my previous purchase of the same product (which eventually wore out) was better.</li>
            <li>ordered the Seki and they were fabulous- cutting easily with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every dollar and more.</li>
            <li>Someone with large toenails would probably want something larger.</li>
            <li>The handle should be a little larger so that you can get better leverage.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, cuts cleanly, even on the toughest toenails.  </li>
            <li>WOW, what a difference these have made.  </li>
            <li>They are a brushed stainless steel with a curved head.</li>
            <li>I finally ordered these, hoping they are of surgical steel strength -- ready to return them if they weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Nothing &#x27;Professional&#x27; about this Nail Nipper.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let you&#x27;re kids anywhere near this thing.</li>
            <li>It works very well and saves regular trips to the podiatrist.</li>
            <li>I am a diabetic, healthcare Nurse Practitioner professional.</li>
            <li>the blades, though sharp, have much too much curvature for toenails, and the handles are much too short to get any leverage.</li>
            <li>A few quick strokes with a nail file and they feel like normal toenails.  </li>
            <li>There is not enough leverage to EASILY cut toe nails of average thickness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is small and if you have big hands or thick nails, this might now be ideal.</li>
            <li>One thing you can count on with this nipper, is that its very sharp and makes quick work clipping your nails, both finger and toes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much gone back to conventional right-angle nippers.</li>
            <li>my toe nails are big &amp; hard and i needed a better quality nail clipper to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp!!  </li>
            <li>I bought this because the normal my normal toe clipper does not do a good job on my big toe nails, which are thick and hard.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are easy to use and can make delicate adjustments to nail length with them.....</li>
            <li>Good, sharp cut; (be careful) and one of the few made nowadays that has a nice wide and long clipper, as opposed to the short cutting ends of so many others.  </li>
            <li>Clipper is not strong enough to clip toe nails, which is my primary reason for the purchase.</li>
            <li>I found this clipper handles to bee on the small side and the mechanism doesn&#x27;t give enough leverage to easily cut thicker nails.</li>
            <li>This is a safe and would be very hard to cut your self.</li>
            <li>The size is just right, certainly not too big.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the curvature of the blade to steep to be useful for anything other than middle of the nail clips.</li>
            <li>Better than other few I&#x27;ve seen before.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as easy to use as smaller, lighter versions of the same thing but, for some reason, I cannot find the smaller, lighter versions any more.</li>
            <li>It is sharp, precise, not a large one.</li>
            <li>Works fine on small toe nails, not so well on the big toe nails.  </li>
            <li>These clippers work so much better in older hands, sorry I didn&#x27;t get them sooner.</li>
            <li>I was underwhelmed before the break-- not that easy to control, particularly &#x27;other handed&#x27;, unlike conventional clippers.  </li>
            <li>After years of struggling with not-sharp-enough toe nail clippers purchased at local drug stores or supermarkets - finally, I&#x27;ve found ones that are sharp enough to work without huge effort, struggle and difficulty.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick toenails and these work better</li>
            <li>I noticed that the &#x27;&#x27;Seki Edge&#x27;&#x27; stamped on the nippers is different than the one on the old pair.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful and really take your time.</li>
            <li>I find it difficult to get a good grip on the handles--too narrow of a diameter and very slippery.  </li>
            <li>It is also not very sharp.</li>
            <li>A couple other brands I&#x27;ve bought online claimed to be professional, but, like drugstore brands, only chew toenails, and some don&#x27;t even do that much.</li>
            <li>It was sharp, but way to small for most adults.  </li>
            <li>Using this to trim nails at the long-term care facility where I work; some are thick with fungus and it can cut through them; as other reviewers have noted, if it can cut through nails it can slice fingers easily, so I do exercise caution!</li>
            <li>Extremely sharp, fits hands perfectly,  stainless steel,.  </li>
            <li>This his sturdy, sharp and very efficient.  </li>
            <li>, the cheap little plastic cap it comes with is supposed to keep it closed for storage, but it just pops off.</li>
            <li>The nail nipper is extremely well built and cuts very neatly.</li>
            <li>I gave this item four stars and not five only because it did not cut my&lt;br /&gt;thick toe nails &amp;#34;like butter&amp;#34; (as described), BUT they do cut these tough nails better than</li>
            <li>These nippers are very sharp and easy to use-I only hope that they will maintain their cutting edge for many years.</li>
            <li>What a relief to finally have nail clippers that are effective for my very tough nails.  </li>
            <li>I have used several other brands of nail nippers/trimmers to try and care for her feet, but none of them worked very well.  </li>
            <li>If you have arthritis or hand problems, it might pose a problem, but it&#x27;s not much harder than using your standard nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Made well-sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;However to small to do any good.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth spending money on.&lt;br /&gt;Common nail clipper works as well.</li>
            <li>Cuts thick nails better than any other clipper I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It comes very sharp and clips off heavy toenails quite easily.  </li>
            <li>these are very high quality, very sharp clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a small handled unit and &#x27;might&#x27; work a little better if the two handles were a bit</li>
            <li>- i returned the Erbe because it was a lot of money and kept the Seki because it was cheap, but it is definitely not a good product - the only thing it has going for it is its sharpness.  </li>
            <li>but it is a much sharper curve than on typical clippers.</li>
            <li>They work fine on tough toe nails.</li>
            <li>this clipped is very sharp and overall, it is very well made.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t expect to trim large heavy toenails in one clip.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still sharp as new</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I kind of baulked when I saw the price, but I&#x27;ve discovered with many things (like kitchen knives)</li>
            <li> These things are just great and priced about right.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> This nail nipper is high quality, sturdy, easy to use, looks good, and just all around great.</li>
            <li> Most used purchase ever ..</li>
            <li> Couldn t be better.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t find a better nipper at any price.</li>
            <li> Nothing better on the market.</li>
            <li> enables me to keep my toenails in healthy condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t have to purchase another ever, since it looks to be a heavy-duty item.</li>
            <li> and I have bought and discarded many.  </li>
            <li> I have used so many nail clippers that just bend and don&#x27;t cut, that I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
            <li> it is worth paying more for good quality steel.</li>
            <li> Arrived in package, works great, allows much finer cuts.</li>
            <li> Better off use scissors.</li>
            <li> I thought this one might be better than a toe clipper.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the Seki Edge Nail Nipper.  </li>
            <li> am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Most Nail  Nippers slip in my hand and then grind to a halt as they try to cut threw the nail..</li>
            <li> This is a a top tier nail nipper.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I think given some more time, I&#x27;ll like them more.</li>
            <li> and he said is the perfect tool to do it, I believe the same, so thank you to let us have it.</li>
            <li> Certainly better that what you would find in a drug store for those of us who have to deal with fungus in our toenails.</li>
            <li> this is OK quality and works</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> but they do come with a tip cover to store safely</li>
            <li> They work much better than toe nail clippers.</li>
            <li> sure you turn the curve of the blade to match the toenail.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t sure if i should return or not</li>
            <li> excellent quality, the steel has a flawless finish and seems to be super tough.</li>
            <li> The cut is very smooth and the force needed to perform the cut is easy on the hand.</li>
            <li> while the Erbe fit perfectly in my hand ( I have medium sized male hands )</li>
            <li> /&gt;Of note, I looked at the other choices of clippers and these are the best of what I was able to find.</li>
            <li> Controlling how far they fly is a bit of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality, nicely machined, very easy to use, allow for safe, accurate trimming.</li>
            <li> Perfect for thick nails and good size for the smaller hand to hold, really happy with them.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and sharp; it does a great job!</li>
            <li> Pretty close to salon quality or Better!</li>
            <li> This excellent product is so sharp it make nail trimming easy on both fingers and toes.</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate and easy to cut.</li>
            <li> It is too easy to cut into the corners of a toenail and cause problems for people.</li>
            <li> These Seki Edge clippers, while not inexpensive, are well-constructed, made in Japan, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nobody found them easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and the storage cover for the blades is a&lt;br /&gt;plus to avoid damage when not being used for nail grooming.</li>
            <li> : nail clippings are ejected with a strong snap and go flying away from the toe.</li>
            <li> Well made, good value, and highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp edges and the edges line up perfectly for a very clean and smooth</li>
            <li> I can get a very good grip on them and they are comfortable to use, even for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> It works fine.  </li>
            <li> Now it seems fine.</li>
            <li> play guitar fingerpicking style and nail length on one hand is important.  </li>
            <li> After trimming my fingernail&#x27;s I no longer need to file the edges to smooth them.</li>
            <li> This device is--as others here have keenly observed--a genuine precision instrument.</li>
            <li> My nail cuticles are fabulous now.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Cut, neat and smooth</li>
            <li> While the design of this nail clipper is great, the craftsmanship and warranty is a completely different story.</li>
            <li> The feel is comfortable to your hands.</li>
            <li> cheap, buy twice&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Seki Edge will cut cleanly and easily through the thickest toe nails.</li>
            <li> but if you expect precision - namely, the blades meeting precisely</li>
            <li> Whether that&#x27;s important or not, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Accurate and precise each time without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li> but then it IS cheap ( for a nipper )</li>
            <li> The latter is both better designed and the quality of steel is clearly superior.</li>
            <li> Time will tell but thus far this item seems to be of very good quality, has a good &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; in its use and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> They do come with a rubber cap to put over the blades while not using them which is very useful.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied - does exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> but, trust me, they are worth it!  </li>
            <li> The Seki Edge Ss-202 Professional Nail Nipper is the best personal &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; I have acquired.  </li>
            <li> and I think you&#x27;d have to have the flexibility of a yoga master to do so safely with positive results.</li>
            <li> this nipper though the quality is not so great - it&#x27;s sharp but it still feels cheap -</li>
            <li> Fine quality, but didn&#x27;t deliver exciting results.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as large as most toenail clippers I&#x27;ve seen or used</li>
            <li> Wow, these are really nice.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and I am able to cut my toenails now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for clipping very short (once you get the hang of it) I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months</li>
            <li> It cuts quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> I had mine professionally sharpened and now they&#x27;re a pretty good clipper.</li>
            <li> Theses clippers was totally awesome , they work great on my thick toe nails due to fungus on them .</li>
            <li> This is the first toenail clipper I have found that works, and it works fine.</li>
            <li> The older I get the more rigid my nails become.  </li>
            <li> After many purchases of nail cutters for toenails from stores including visits to podiatrists , I went through the Amazon list and especially the Members grading and star rating to find the better nail cutters available.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s probably descent quick home protection.</li>
            <li> Although it is a small appliance, it has great leverage and is easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> They are nice and sharp work great, much better than my previous one I had from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> So, slight annoyance but still love this much more!    </li>
            <li> New clippers have arrived, and while they are an industrial work of art, I&#x27;m not getting any better at using them.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and very versatile.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and just the right curve to give great results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to get my own clippers</li>
            <li> Although it is made as a quality product, it&#x27;s not as useful as a toe clipper.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> I liked what I read about this Seki product, so I decided to spend the extra money and take a chance.</li>
            <li> may be this gives it a good grip when he hand is wet.</li>
            <li> They are a quality product and worth the price.</li>
            <li> more inclined to cut good tissue rather than thick nail.</li>
            <li> This clipper is nicely made, only wished it were larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take a little more effort to cut the toenails since they&#x27;re more thick and had to learn how to angle it the right way to get the best cut.</li>
            <li> I suppose this clipper together with their straight edge would be a very useful pair.</li>
            <li> Sharp with good edge holding capability.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, which is good.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to be able to cut my toenails easily, without the usual effort and without having to soak my feet first.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a good pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li> It was  priced right</li>
            <li> The spring has just the right amount of resistance.</li>
            <li> Right size.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp and precise and make my toes much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this side-cutter design, and it seems to be more practical than the old, oversized fingernail clipper type clippers.</li>
            <li> Could use slightly longer handles for increased leverage, but overall excellent.</li>
            <li> finally found a great pair of clippers for hubby&#x27;s extra thick toe nails - does a great job and worth every penny</li>
            <li> The finish is brushed stainless and has a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed and what I ordered.</li>
            <li> OK not my big toenails with ease</li>
            <li> Cuts even the first time&lt;</li>
            <li> This is a truly outstanding product and will probably last years to boot.</li>
            <li> Just received and used for the first time...</li>
            <li> I use it regularly and I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> A toe clipper with larger opening should be better, which I am still searching for.</li>
            <li> am pretty dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Screw holding the spring popped out on my first usage.</li>
            <li> Based on the claims for this product as a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; nipper, I assumed it would cut the toenails like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> Strong, sharp, easy to use.</li>
            <li> these nippers work perfectly... have to be careful with them as they are very sharp</li>
            <li> I am right handed yet found this clipper easy to operate with my left hand</li>
            <li> Could be better with larger handles, but I do have rather large hands.</li>
            <li> The grip is firm and the product looks like it will last many years, very pleased I bought it</li>
            <li> Those with big hands might be more comfortable handling a slightly larger clipper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are just too small for my purposes but should be fine for people with more flexibility bending over than i have.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp edge nice feel in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bade is too short to reach across the toenails on the big toe of the foot and the curve causes a deeper cut on one edge instead of being able to cut cleanly across the toenail.</li>
            <li> you would think the Seki is some kind of a joke compared to the Erbe - half the size, about 1/4 of the weight - however for some reason</li>
            <li> it took enough strength to cut them that I thought the clipper was going to break, and I am really strong.</li>
            <li> This nail nipper is of very high quality.</li>
            <li> These cutters are very well-made from Japan, very sharp and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> the cutting edge alignment is perfect and very well horned.</li>
            <li> Very sharp-works well</li>
            <li> but they work really well</li>
            <li> I may have been expecting too much.</li>
            <li> I have nerve damage in one hand and this makes the job of trimming nails a whole lot easier.</li>
            <li> these work really well.</li>
            <li> I did not like how much curve there is in the blade.  </li>
            <li> The moon shaped blades are very convenient.</li>
            <li> He said that it has made it so much easier for him clip his nails and his toe nails.</li>
            <li> The head is curved meaning you cannot get a straight cut of the tow nail.</li>
            <li> These nail cutters work very well.</li>
            <li> all stainless steel.</li>
            <li> and these really did the job.  </li>
            <li> I feel it is much easier to cut and shape your nails and finish quicker with these.</li>
            <li> which is very painful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Need something with much longer handles.</li>
            <li> you can go to the local supermarket and get one of those cheaply made versions in the beauty supply aisle, but as my grandfather once told me, &amp;#34;buy</li>
            <li> it cannot cut straight across nails,  you have to keep moving it.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to cut more than you intend.</li>
            <li> Much difficulty controlling bleeding....</li>
            <li> Do not recommend especially for diabetic whose foot condition is so important.</li>
            <li> These worked very well.</li>
            <li> needed a good unit because I have thick nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nicely curved, they do not need a powerful grip to do their job on thick nails.</li>
            <li> nippers are just the right size, they are sharp and easy to use on both fingers and toes.  </li>
            <li> As long as they stay sharp for a decent lenght of time I am extremely happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It does fine with the other nails, but at this money it should also be able to handle the big toenails.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is great, it is very sharp and cuts nails easily that others had a hard time to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works better than other nail nippers I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Japanese steel at its best, watch out when you cut your toenails, it was difficult for me to get used to it at first.</li>
            <li> i have both the small and the big one, and i prefer the big one - but the quality in excellent on both.  </li>
            <li> Superb design; blades are perfectly smooth, perfectly sharp, meet exactly, with narrow sharp tips and are curved so that the back of the blade doesn&#x27;t get in the way of the cut like cheaper nippers do.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, I am glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> Particularly in grown toenails.</li>
            <li> The tool would not cut even with considerable effort was applied, I expected my wife to be able to use the clipper on my feet.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> - I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these nippers.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the purchase of this clipper.</li>
            <li> High quality.....made in Japan.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there were so many positive</li>
            <li> These nail nippers are fine except they don&#x27;t have a plastic tip to keep the blades closed.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to hold and sharp.  </li>
            <li> They are quite sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is strong and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Heavy duty clippers and works like I thought they would even better.</li>
            <li> I like a fresh pair of nail nippers for my constant hang nails.  </li>
            <li> They are also effective at trimming thick toenails.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they are fine.</li>
            <li> Other than that they work fine.</li>
            <li> Sharp as a pin, and quite adequate to do my rather hardened toe nails!</li>
            <li> Its easy to use on someone else, but more difficult to use on yourself.</li>
            <li> You can probably see 10 different sellers for this item on Amazon, right?</li>
            <li> The springs provide the right feel and it seems that they will last forever.</li>
            <li> Used in combination with the Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper makes a good combination for old tough toe nails.</li>
            <li> This one is very sharp and well designed and cut my toenails easily.  </li>
            <li> Very sharply and easy cut.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These nail nippers are high quality professional grade and the quality shows.  </li>
            <li> Also, be careful with the sharp&lt;br /&gt;points, can easily stab you if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I suffer from ingrown toenails and needed a sharp clipper to keep them maintained and these fit the bill so far.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful you&#x27;ll cut you&#x27;re whole toe off.</li>
            <li> Professional equipment!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, high quality, large enough to grip and use.</li>
            <li> This clipper is really, really sharp and cleanly cuts through the toughest nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you&#x27;re tired of &#x27;hacking&#x27; at your troublesome nails or would be delighted to simply fine-tune your regular manicure or pedicure to a tee, these clippers are worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had the impression that my previous purchase of the same product (which eventually wore out) was better.</li>
            <li> ordered the Seki and they were fabulous- cutting easily with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every dollar and more.</li>
            <li> Someone with large toenails would probably want something larger.</li>
            <li> The handle should be a little larger so that you can get better leverage.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, cuts cleanly, even on the toughest toenails.  </li>
            <li> WOW, what a difference these have made.  </li>
            <li> They are a brushed stainless steel with a curved head.</li>
            <li> I finally ordered these, hoping they are of surgical steel strength -- ready to return them if they weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Nothing &#x27;Professional&#x27; about this Nail Nipper.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let you&#x27;re kids anywhere near this thing.</li>
            <li> It works very well and saves regular trips to the podiatrist.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic, healthcare Nurse Practitioner professional.</li>
            <li> the blades, though sharp, have much too much curvature for toenails, and the handles are much too short to get any leverage.</li>
            <li> A few quick strokes with a nail file and they feel like normal toenails.  </li>
            <li> There is not enough leverage to EASILY cut toe nails of average thickness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is small and if you have big hands or thick nails, this might now be ideal.</li>
            <li> One thing you can count on with this nipper, is that its very sharp and makes quick work clipping your nails, both finger and toes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much gone back to conventional right-angle nippers.</li>
            <li> my toe nails are big &amp; hard and i needed a better quality nail clipper to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp!!  </li>
            <li> I bought this because the normal my normal toe clipper does not do a good job on my big toe nails, which are thick and hard.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are easy to use and can make delicate adjustments to nail length with them.....</li>
            <li> Good, sharp cut; (be careful) and one of the few made nowadays that has a nice wide and long clipper, as opposed to the short cutting ends of so many others.  </li>
            <li> Clipper is not strong enough to clip toe nails, which is my primary reason for the purchase.</li>
            <li> I found this clipper handles to bee on the small side and the mechanism doesn&#x27;t give enough leverage to easily cut thicker nails.</li>
            <li> This is a safe and would be very hard to cut your self.</li>
            <li> The size is just right, certainly not too big.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the curvature of the blade to steep to be useful for anything other than middle of the nail clips.</li>
            <li> Better than other few I&#x27;ve seen before.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as easy to use as smaller, lighter versions of the same thing but, for some reason, I cannot find the smaller, lighter versions any more.</li>
            <li> It is sharp, precise, not a large one.</li>
            <li> Works fine on small toe nails, not so well on the big toe nails.  </li>
            <li> These clippers work so much better in older hands, sorry I didn&#x27;t get them sooner.</li>
            <li> I was underwhelmed before the break-- not that easy to control, particularly &#x27;other handed&#x27;, unlike conventional clippers.  </li>
            <li> After years of struggling with not-sharp-enough toe nail clippers purchased at local drug stores or supermarkets - finally, I&#x27;ve found ones that are sharp enough to work without huge effort, struggle and difficulty.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick toenails and these work better</li>
            <li> I noticed that the &#x27;&#x27;Seki Edge&#x27;&#x27; stamped on the nippers is different than the one on the old pair.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful and really take your time.</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to get a good grip on the handles--too narrow of a diameter and very slippery.  </li>
            <li> It is also not very sharp.</li>
            <li> A couple other brands I&#x27;ve bought online claimed to be professional, but, like drugstore brands, only chew toenails, and some don&#x27;t even do that much.</li>
            <li> It was sharp, but way to small for most adults.  </li>
            <li> Using this to trim nails at the long-term care facility where I work; some are thick with fungus and it can cut through them; as other reviewers have noted, if it can cut through nails it can slice fingers easily, so I do exercise caution!</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp, fits hands perfectly,  stainless steel,.  </li>
            <li> This his sturdy, sharp and very efficient.  </li>
            <li> , the cheap little plastic cap it comes with is supposed to keep it closed for storage, but it just pops off.</li>
            <li> The nail nipper is extremely well built and cuts very neatly.</li>
            <li> I gave this item four stars and not five only because it did not cut my&lt;br /&gt;thick toe nails &amp;#34;like butter&amp;#34; (as described), BUT they do cut these tough nails better than</li>
            <li> These nippers are very sharp and easy to use-I only hope that they will maintain their cutting edge for many years.</li>
            <li> What a relief to finally have nail clippers that are effective for my very tough nails.  </li>
            <li> I have used several other brands of nail nippers/trimmers to try and care for her feet, but none of them worked very well.  </li>
            <li> If you have arthritis or hand problems, it might pose a problem, but it&#x27;s not much harder than using your standard nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Made well-sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;However to small to do any good.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth spending money on.&lt;br /&gt;Common nail clipper works as well.</li>
            <li> Cuts thick nails better than any other clipper I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It comes very sharp and clips off heavy toenails quite easily.  </li>
            <li> these are very high quality, very sharp clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a small handled unit and &#x27;might&#x27; work a little better if the two handles were a bit</li>
            <li> - i returned the Erbe because it was a lot of money and kept the Seki because it was cheap, but it is definitely not a good product - the only thing it has going for it is its sharpness.  </li>
            <li> but it is a much sharper curve than on typical clippers.</li>
            <li> They work fine on tough toe nails.</li>
            <li> this clipped is very sharp and overall, it is very well made.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t expect to trim large heavy toenails in one clip.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still sharp as new</li>
            <li> Within 2 minutes, I had trimmed all of her toenails down to where they were nearly normal looking.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would cut through a very thick toenail, but my old one, which doesn&#x27;t open very wide, is much sharper and doesn&#x27;t require as much strength to squeeze.</li>
            <li> The absence of a locking feature does not take anything away from how the nippers perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Handles are small for a large person.</li>
            <li> Not very wide but wide enough so that it doesn&#x27;t cut at all.&lt;br /&gt;Several</li>
            <li> also the finish is a little rough to the touch but not irritating.</li>
            <li> So far, he likes them, but they are very sharp.</li>
            <li> good value and very sharp cuts my very stiff and tough nails with ease.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Biggest complaint: the jaws have to much curvature (too short a radius of cut).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lightweight stainless steel&lt;br /&gt;Ability to cut thick and regular toenails</li>
            <li> Now,  if they could just make super sharp, clean cutting 1/4 jaw cuticle nippers!</li>
            <li> This is inconvenient when you would prefer a wide flat cut across the top of your big toe.</li>
            <li> Beyond not being precise, there&#x27;s nothing really wrong with them.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> I cant believe I have lived without them this long.</li>
            <li> clip, nip, all day long.</li>
            <li> They are also somewhat smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not entirely clear from the pictures</li>
            <li> The toes that are not too thick are much easier</li>
            <li> This does very well on clipping thick nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these for a couple of months, but I&#x27;m hoping they will stay sharp for a long long time.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, they cut well, and they look and feel like they will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Only time will tell how long they remain sharp.</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s even cheaper than some other German steel options).</li>
            <li> The nippers are extremely sharp and made very short work out of trimming her nails.  </li>
            <li> This clipper doesn&#x27;t seem sharp enough and requires quite a bit of hand strength .  </li>
            <li> (No longer have to worry about long toe nails protruding through my socks!</li>
            <li> enough the Seki is sharp -</li>
            <li> The Seki Edge Ss-202 professional nail clippers are quite sharp but cut only a small area.  </li>
            <li> After only about 4 uses, the one of the nipper handles broke cleanly where the cutting edges hinge.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Typical Japanese quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for years in vain for a truly usable finger- and toenail clipper and have spent a pretty penny on several mediocre items, the ones you&#x27;ll find in higher-end drugstores and beauty shops.</li>
            <li> An Ordinary nail clipper didn&#x27;t open wide enough</li>
            <li> These are not very strong and really cannot be used for any thick nails.</li>
            <li> SMALLER WAS A LITTLE BULKY USING IT.</li>
            <li> Would have given it 5 stars if they were a little larger.  </li>
            <li> i first ordered a toe nail nipper by Erbe for more than 3 times the cost of this one, and shockingly the Erbe wasn&#x27;t sharp.  </li>
            <li> Good for cutting the ends of the tough curved nails.  </li>
            <li> have developed very thick toenails for some reason recently and put on weight.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> But with me it&#x27;s not really an issue.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> So be careful when you buy this.</li>
            <li> At my age my nails are rather thick, and several double over into a horseshoe shape.</li>
            <li> as soon as i tried it i sent the Erbe back for refund - but here is the deal - the Seki is HALF THE SIZE of the Erbe !  </li>
            <li> Just be careful because they are sharp.</li>
            <li> nice sharp cutter which works well on thick nails; Only downside is small length of cut; one has to step into cutting toenails.</li>
            <li> They seem stiff and not as sharp (the old pair still remain sharp after 2 yrs of heavy use).</li>
            <li> i now use this every other day to trim or clip hangnails.  </li>
            <li> I needed a sharp and maneuverable toenail clipper and that is what I got from Seki.</li>
            <li> Finally, a really sharp nail clipper.</li>
            <li> This means I cut the nails on my fretting hand every other</li>
            <li> Stays sharp so you can keep your&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a year it is still as sharp as it was when we bought it.</li>
            <li> These clippers are sharp, and either my toe nails are made of titanium or......</li>
            <li> However, they are sharp and cut neatly.</li>
            <li> These clippers are razor sharp and appear to be durible.</li>
            <li> Really sharp but the screw on the &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; came out so after you clip</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was as dangerously sharp as some people had mentioned.</li>
            <li> These clippers are surgically sharp and will cut through seemingly anything.</li>
            <li> they are kinda small in my big hands which I like.</li>
            <li> Well done Seki and well done other purchasers on Amazon for helping me!,&lt;br /&gt;Manna</li>
            <li> Too small for my big hands.</li>
            <li> It is really sharp, so once you get it aligned, it will cut.  </li>
            <li> These are quite sharp.</li>
            <li> These were not as sharp as I thought they would be.  </li>
            <li> so i ordered the Seki to compare the quality because everybody was raving how sharp the Seki was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the other hand Erbe had everything going for it EXCEPT the sharpness -</li>
            <li> I would have not given the nippers five stars because they can&#x27;t be locked down (closed) when not in use, but I knew that when I bought them</li>
            <li> Do be careful not to let children play with them because, as I said before, they are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> However, I found that you have to have a really steady hand while using them because the fact that they are harder to manipulate than the 202 while also cutting with that definite surgical manner meant that you had to be very careful while using them.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, though, the Seki brand nail trimmers are more expensive then your everyday clippers</li>
            <li> happen to have thick big toe nails and needed sharp cutters.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a big disappointment and they were not properly described The cost was enough to have made a well designed product.</li>
            <li> They really worked well with extra thick nails at difficult angles.</li>
            <li> No frazzled, uneven, or off center blade cuts.</li>
            <li> Before spending a lot of money on a product that was less than satisfactory, I read several reviews of nail clippers / nippers that were supposed to work well on thick toenails.</li>
            <li> I would pay about $100 every time I would go to the podiatriast and have them trim down the nail.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li> Because of a bad back, I can barely reach my toes, the clippers gave me an extra reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp curved cutters.</li>
            <li> They were very sharp.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, this is a very sharp implement -</li>
            <li> VERY SHARP does the job</li>
            <li> Very sharp so care is needed but that is one of the benefits.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> These nippers are very sharp and work well.</li>
            <li> After trying half a dozen &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; nail clippers that didn&#x27;t work, this Seki Edge clipper was a revelation.  </li>
            <li> I previously used the Tweezerman barrel toenail clipper and found it rather hit-or-miss in its intended function.  </li>
            <li> Tried another clipper that cost less and gave up.</li>
            <li> the only reason i didn&#x27;t return the Seki is because i knew it would be this way when i was ordering it - i only ordered it to test the sharpness - so it would have been unfair to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The do an OK job, but it is difficult for the blades to cut through thick, tough toenails.  </li>
            <li> Same thing happened again after I reattached the screw and spring.&lt;br /&gt;Though the nipper is very sharp it does not hold up on tough toenails.</li>
            <li> I just wish the handles were a little longer for us &amp;#34;seniors.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> They do come with a small plastic storage sleeve that goes over the sharp, cutter tip to protect them from dulling, and</li>
            <li> Brand new out of the box, I noticed there&#x27;s a gap in between the cutting blades, about 0.5mm wide.</li>
            <li> This clipper makes short work of my very thick toe nails with little effort.</li>
            <li> Even the finger nails clippers are tough enough to use for toe nails.</li>
            <li> Because of the difficulty I have bending over I should have selected one with a much longer blade and/or handle and have had to buy another one because this one is too short.&lt;br /&gt;There is no problem with them being dangerous or too</li>
            <li> A waste of time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of trouble cutting my toenails, but these clippers have made the job much easier.  </li>
            <li> but I had to put a drop of sewing lubricating oil on the hinge since it was a little rigid and stiff when using the nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Be careful with these as they mean business.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is intended for for small delicate hands (read : if you have large hand, skip over).</li>
            <li> I like this clipper as it does the job with my toe nails, some of which are thick due to fungus.</li>
            <li> This clipper is blunt and not easy to use.</li>
            <li> No nail is too tough, and they have a narrow enough point to nip tough to cut corners of your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether I perhaps got a defective product, but I could not cut through my toe nails.</li>
            <li> After several failed attempt, the nipper ended in our recycling bin.</li>
            <li> This time, I noticed that it was difficult to use on my big toenail.  </li>
            <li> No better tool at any price</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still not sure it works all that well...</li>
            <li> It keeps slipping out of it&#x27;s position and it becomes frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> Handles too small for leverage.</li>
            <li> But if you want to cut through lightweight sheet metal or small fishing hooks, bolts, nut or screws</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not cheap but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> It comes with a small piece of plastic that keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> I have broken other toe nail cutters trying to cut my nails.  </li>
            <li> the cutting area was a little bigger.  </li>
            <li> It has a real problem cutting my very thick toe nails</li>
            <li> My hard toe nails have met their match.  </li>
            <li> My husband has hard nails.</li>
            <li> I had to clip really really hard to clip the nail off.</li>
            <li> Go for it, i have hard nails</li>
            <li> Hard to cut nails evenly.</li>
            <li> I shoud have made this purchase years ago instead of living with dull obsolete tools.</li>
            <li> the Erbe was dull - maybe i got a lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WILL LOOK FOR SOMETHING SMALLER IN CUTTING EDGE HEAD AREA</li>
            <li> For cutting toe nails, they seem a bit fragile.  </li>
            <li> I bought these nail clippers for my father, who is in his 80&#x27;s and has thick toe nails.</li>
            <li> The device crushes rather than cuts thick nails.</li>
            <li> and my nails get really thick.</li>
            <li> Solves the problem of stiff hands and tough toenails.</li>
            <li> It does not come with a cover which is a little disappointing since it is really sharp and needs something to protect from accidental cuts.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp but a little awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Impossible to cut with regular nippers.</li>
            <li> I have very hard and gnarly toe nails that are hard to cut.  </li>
            <li> and my husband has very thick hard nails</li>
            <li> After cutting my toe with the conventional clipper, had to try this instrument.  </li>
            <li> the end both Seki and Erbe turned out to be pretty terrible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dull.</li>
            <li> It is very dull....</li>
            <li> I have very hard toe nails</li>
            <li> Tough toenails?</li>
            <li> I have tough nails</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis under my toenails which is very thick.</li>
            <li> They cut through very thick nails.</li>
            <li> My elderly mother has some toenails that have a bad fungus problem and the nails have become very hard, thick and uneven.  </li>
            <li> The Seki Edge 202 has a much smaller cutting head but makes up for it in its almost clinical surgical cutting precision.  </li>
            <li> Been using the the compound lever style, but not really happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a professional grade tool you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Also the handles are so small they are awkward to use at all.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with my Seki Edge Ss-202 professional nail nipper.  </li>
            <li> Someone failed to engineer this product.&lt;br /&gt;Poor</li>
            <li> Would not cut either my finger or toe nails, merely bent them around the nippers.  </li>
            <li> However, having said that, they haven&#x27;t failed us yet after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> I have arthritic hands and use these on my boyfriend&#x27;s toenails, which are difficult to cut.</li>
            <li> If you buy the product with wrong packaging (not from seki usa)</li>
            <li> But, alas, here I am!  </li>
            <li> They are curved the wrong way for fingernail cuticles.</li>
            <li> It is now totally useless to me.</li>
            <li> If you have difficult nails to cut give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Yes, they&#x27;re sharp--possibly a danger to you if you yourself tend to be too casual when trimming your nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed - these nippers cut through my thick toenails without a problem.</li>
            <li> sharp &amp; inexpensive, but terrible ergonomics.</li>
            <li> It solves the nail cutting problem.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> This device is dangerous...</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> Being a senior person and diabetic, I have been struggling with terrible thick and ugly toenails.  </li>
            <li> Never have ingrown toenails or ugly feet again.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Get them  you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed with this Made in Japan quality, not to mention the premium price tag for it.&lt;br /&gt;(See pictures)</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> But it is annoying,  </li>
            <li> Bad design of the hinges!</li>
            <li> Terrible policy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy to use and good cutters.</li>
            <li> It works better than other nail nippers I have purchased.</li>
            <li> It works fine.  I would recommend trying out this product for your nails.  It is easy to operate and easy to cut.</li>
            <li> Wow, these are really nice.  They are sharp, they cut well, and they look and feel like they will last a long time.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Using this to trim nails at the long-term care facility where I work; some are thick with fungus and it can cut through them; as other reviewers have noted, if it can cut through nails it can slice fingers easily, so I do exercise caution!</li>
            <li> These clippers work so much better in older hands, sorry I didn&#x27;t get them sooner.</li>
            <li> High quality, nicely machined, very easy to use, allow for safe, accurate trimming.</li>
            <li> Great for mens think toe nails</li>
            <li> Very sharp.  Cuts thick nails better than any other clipper I have tried.  Only time will tell how long they remain sharp.</li>
            <li> Perfect for thick nails and good size for the smaller hand to hold, really happy with them.</li>
            <li> Really a good product.  Reordered another for a gift.</li>
            <li> these are very high quality, very sharp clippers. I&#x27;ve found the curvature of the blade to steep to be useful for anything other than middle of the nail clips. it&#x27;s not entirely clear from the pictures but it is a much sharper curve than on typical clippers. I suppose this clipper together with their straight edge would be a very useful pair.</li>
            <li> excellent equipment very haappy with product and service</li>
            <li> i now use this every other day to trim or clip hangnails.  Most used purchase ever ..</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether I perhaps got a defective product, but I could not cut through my toe nails. After several failed attempt, the nipper ended in our recycling bin.</li>
            <li> I needed a sharp and maneuverable toenail clipper and that is what I got from Seki. Excellent value!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Smaller than I expected but I like that now that I am used to it.  Someone with large toenails would probably want something larger.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, I am glad I bought them. I would recommend them to anyone. I cant believe I have lived without them this long.</li>
            <li> great nail trimmer. especially useful for the corners of nails. Can&#x27;t do my big toenail though. It&#x27;s one of 4 tools I always keep now for my nails.</li>
            <li> High quality product. It is sharp, precise, not a large one. Works for feet.  Better than other few I&#x27;ve seen before.</li>
            <li> Very sharp-works well</li>
            <li> Had a good Seki nail clipper but this nipper beats them all.  The clipper didn&#x27;t work well with the feet but it was good for the hands.  This Seki Edge Ss-202 is wonderful for both.  I recommend it highly.  It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to be able to cut my toenails easily, without the usual effort and without having to soak my feet first. These nippers are very sharp and easy to use-I only hope that they will maintain their cutting edge for many years.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed and what I ordered. Quality seems excellent too. I can recommend this to others who like me have claw-like nails.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a nail clipper?  It does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do. Couldn t be better.</li>
            <li> Finally, a really sharp nail clipper. Be careful with these as they mean business. They&#x27;re not as large as most toenail clippers I&#x27;ve seen or used but they work really well and I know would be excellent for finger nails as well. They are sized mid-way between those two uses. They feel sturdy and well-made. Now,  if they could just make super sharp, clean cutting 1/4 jaw cuticle nippers!</li>
            <li> the blades, though sharp, have much too much curvature for toenails, and the handles are much too short to get any leverage.</li>
            <li> The clippers are easy to use and can make delicate adjustments to nail length with them.....play guitar fingerpicking style and nail length on one hand is important.  These clippers allow me to make adjustments to length of picking finger nails....</li>
            <li> I bought this nail nipper to replace one that had dulled.  This one is very sharp and well designed and cut my toenails easily.  It has a quality feel and weight.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality nipper.  It does not come with a cover which is a little disappointing since it is really sharp and needs something to protect from accidental cuts.  The customer service was superb - prompt and courteous.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best nail clippers one can own!!! Extremely sharp, fits hands perfectly,  stainless steel,.  Just be careful because they are sharp.</li>
            <li> It has a real problem cutting my very thick toe nails The toes that are not too thick are much easier</li>
            <li> These are the absolute BEST.  Being a senior person and diabetic, I have been struggling with terrible thick and ugly toenails.  WOW, what a difference these have made.  Super sharp!!  In a matter of minutes my nails were trimmed and thickness thinned......without incident.  You will NOT be disappointed.  Money well spent.</li>
            <li> Sharp with good edge holding capability. Unfortunately it is intended for for small delicate hands (read : if you have large hand, skip over).</li>
            <li> Someone failed to engineer this product.&lt;br /&gt;Poor design, no room for the nail clipping to go.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cut the nail, it crushes the nail between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;Junk...</li>
            <li> I play guitar. This means I cut the nails on my fretting hand every other day.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t find a better nipper at any price. Stays sharp so you can keep your&lt;br /&gt;nails as short as possible. Nothing better on the market.</li>
            <li> Seki Edge makes great tools. You can tell they are well-made plus they are very stylish. These nippers are no exception. They are a brushed stainless steel with a curved head. I can get a very good grip on them and they are comfortable to use, even for a long period of time. I use them on my fingernails too and they work wonderfully with the curved blades. They are also effective at trimming thick toenails.</li>
            <li> good value and very sharp cuts my very stiff and tough nails with ease. OK not my big toenails with ease but it does cut them.</li>
            <li> new clippers worked just perfect for my toenails. good product,sharp and easy to use. enables me to keep my toenails in healthy condition. good delivery on time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the difference between nippers and clippers but these had images so that I knew what I was purchasing.  I came with a cap for the blades that I like a lot.  They work great.  My hard toe nails have met their match.  As long as they stay sharp for a decent lenght of time I am extremely happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Fine quality, but didn&#x27;t deliver exciting results.  I may have been expecting too much.</li>
            <li> The clipper worker as stated.</li>
            <li> After 3 usage, the middle hinges began to stick, so after every snip, I had to pull apart the clipping arms. Bad design of the hinges! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to friends or family</li>
            <li> Great product meets my expectations. Heavy duty clippers and works like I thought they would even better. Would suggest to anybody needing a pair.</li>
            <li> These nail nippers are fine except they don&#x27;t have a plastic tip to keep the blades closed.  It is a bit of a bother to try to close the clippers the way it is shown.  Other than that, they are fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, perfect cut, perfect tool.</li>
            <li> Theses clippers was totally awesome , they work great on my thick toe nails due to fungus on them . Precision tool !</li>
            <li> Would not cut either my finger or toe nails, merely bent them around the nippers.  Would not reccommend to anyone not to mention being over priced.</li>
            <li> I have nerve damage in one hand and this makes the job of trimming nails a whole lot easier. these are well made and solid.</li>
            <li> It works.  It was  priced right and it is very good quality.  I would definitely recommend it - I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t have to purchase another ever, since it looks to be a heavy-duty item.</li>
            <li> I gave this item four stars and not five only because it did not cut my&lt;br /&gt;thick toe nails &amp;#34;like butter&amp;#34; (as described), BUT they do cut these tough nails better than&lt;br /&gt;another nail clippers I have tried.</li>
            <li> These nail nippers are high quality professional grade and the quality shows.  I would have not given the nippers five stars because they can&#x27;t be locked down (closed) when not in use, but I knew that when I bought them so I figure I can&#x27;t complain.  The absence of a locking feature does not take anything away from how the nippers perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nippers are just the right size, they are sharp and easy to use on both fingers and toes.  They are &#x27;nippers&#x27; and not cutters so don&#x27;t expect to trim large heavy toenails in one clip.  However, A nip at a time will remove the toughest toenail.  I don&#x27;t consider that a drawback--just a suggestion for how to use them. These things are just great and priced about right.</li>
            <li> my toe nails are big &amp; hard and i needed a better quality nail clipper to do the job.  these work really well.</li>
            <li> After trying half a dozen &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; nail clippers that didn&#x27;t work, this Seki Edge clipper was a revelation.  It comes very sharp and clips off heavy toenails quite easily.  The quality is superb, and I&#x27;m planning on purchasing additional mani/pedi clippers from this line.</li>
            <li> I had the impression that my previous purchase of the same product (which eventually wore out) was better. This time, I noticed that it was difficult to use on my big toenail.  Hopefully, it may improve with use.</li>
            <li> Though I liked the cutting ability and sturdiness of this clipper I did not like how much curve there is in the blade.  It is too easy to cut into the corners of a toenail and cause problems for people. Particularly in grown toenails. The bade is too short to reach across the toenails on the big toe of the foot and the curve causes a deeper cut on one edge instead of being able to cut cleanly across the toenail.</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR THE  PURPOSE BUT NEED SOMETHING SMALLER WAS A LITTLE BULKY USING IT. WILL LOOK FOR SOMETHING SMALLER IN CUTTING EDGE HEAD AREA</li>
            <li> Very sharp curved cutters. After trimming my fingernail&#x27;s I no longer need to file the edges to smooth them. Cuts even the first time&lt;br /&gt;with fewer cuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for years in vain for a truly usable finger- and toenail clipper and have spent a pretty penny on several mediocre items, the ones you&#x27;ll find in higher-end drugstores and beauty shops. I scanned Amazon yet again and discovered the well-regarded Seki and can tell you that my longtime search is done. Whew! This device is--as others here have keenly observed--a genuine precision instrument. Surgical quality and utility. Yes, they&#x27;re sharp--possibly a danger to you if you yourself tend to be too casual when trimming your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re tired of &#x27;hacking&#x27; at your troublesome nails or would be delighted to simply fine-tune your regular manicure or pedicure to a tee, these clippers are worth the money. Like me, you can stop looking in the drugstore racks for something that isn&#x27;t sold there. This is a truly outstanding product and will probably last years to boot.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist uses this type of instrament, this works great for my needs. It&#x27;s a professional grade tool you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Made well-sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;However to small to do any good.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth spending money on.&lt;br /&gt;Common nail clipper works as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have nail psoriasis that causes my big toenails to become ingrown.  I would pay about $100 every time I would go to the podiatriast and have them trim down the nail.  I finally decided to get my own clippers and I&#x27;m thrilled I did.  They are very sharp and precise and make my toes much more comfortable.  I can do the same thing the podiatrist does and this was waaaaaay cheaper.  Good quality tool.</li>
            <li> Handles are small for a large person.</li>
            <li> Tough toenails? Superb design; blades are perfectly smooth, perfectly sharp, meet exactly, with narrow sharp tips and are curved so that the back of the blade doesn&#x27;t get in the way of the cut like cheaper nippers do.  No better tool at any price and I have bought and discarded many.  Well recommended.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis in my nail and my husband has very thick hard nails and this works for both of us. After a year it is still as sharp as it was when we bought it.</li>
            <li> finally found a great pair of clippers for hubby&#x27;s extra thick toe nails - does a great job and worth every penny</li>
            <li> These clippers are sharp, and either my toe nails are made of titanium or...... it took enough strength to cut them that I thought the clipper was going to break, and I am really strong.</li>
            <li> Solves the problem of stiff hands and tough toenails.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as easy to use as smaller, lighter versions of the same thing but, for some reason, I cannot find the smaller, lighter versions any more.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers! I have very thick toenails and these work better then anything I have ever tried! I would recommend this brand to my friends!</li>
            <li> Japanese steel at its best, watch out when you cut your toenails, it was difficult for me to get used to it at first. The grip is firm and the product looks like it will last many years, very pleased I bought it (and it&#x27;s even cheaper than some other German steel options). The moon shaped blades are very convenient.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these nippers in 2012. They were very sharp. I bought another pair recently, but the quality is not quite the same. They seem stiff and not as sharp (the old pair still remain sharp after 2 yrs of heavy use). I noticed that the &#x27;&#x27;Seki Edge&#x27;&#x27; stamped on the nippers is different than the one on the old pair. I also wish they made the nippers bigger.</li>
            <li> I have used so many nail clippers that just bend and don&#x27;t cut, that I&#x27;ve lost count. I finally ordered these, hoping they are of surgical steel strength -- ready to return them if they weren&#x27;t. I was not disappointed. I&#x27;ll bet I could cut metal with these. Get them  you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My nail cuticles are fabulous now. What else could ever hope to achieve in life. clip, nip, all day long.</li>
            <li> Good, sharp cut; (be careful) and one of the few made nowadays that has a nice wide and long clipper, as opposed to the short cutting ends of so many others.  Excellent product, and my husband loves it to!</li>
            <li> Handles are too short to get enough leverage when clipping toenails. Also the handles are so small they are awkward to use at all. This is a big disappointment and they were not properly described The cost was enough to have made a well designed product.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, which is good.  I just wish the handles were a little longer for us &amp;#34;seniors.&amp;#34;  Basically, it is a good tool.</li>
            <li> My husband has hard nails. He loves this clipper! He said that it has made it so much easier for him clip his nails and his toe nails. It&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li> This is a good precision tool.  It is strong and sharp.  I would give 5 stars if it were not so curved.  Works fine on small toe nails, not so well on the big toe nails.  Maybe they should make 2 models, one with current curve and one a shallower curve.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described.  They are nice and sharp work great, much better than my previous one I had from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> This clipper is blunt and not easy to use. The head is curved meaning you cannot get a straight cut of the tow nail. It results in jagged buts. It is also not very sharp.</li>
            <li> Toe nails no longer a problem.  Very sharp and simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most clippers do not cup my husbands toe nails -- this was great!</li>
            <li> Yes, I know. These clippers were made for smaller hands and it makes a difference. However, they are sharp and cut neatly.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a good pair of clippers.  Been using the the compound lever style, but not really happy with the results.  Then I took a friend to a podiatrist and saw him use something similar to these. They really worked well with extra thick nails at difficult angles. I kind of baulked when I saw the price, but I&#x27;ve discovered with many things (like kitchen knives) it is worth paying more for good quality steel. I&#x27;ve only had these for a couple of months, but I&#x27;m hoping they will stay sharp for a long long time.</li>
            <li> This does very well on clipping thick nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: excellent quality, the steel has a flawless finish and seems to be super tough. The spring has just the right amount of resistance. No nail is too tough, and they have a narrow enough point to nip tough to cut corners of your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: nail clippings are ejected with a strong snap and go flying away from the toe. Because the two jaws close perfectly parallel, the entire span of nail is cut at one instant, and the clipping is released with quite a bit of energy. Controlling how far they fly is a bit of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest complaint: the jaws have to much curvature (too short a radius of cut). This is inconvenient when you would prefer a wide flat cut across the top of your big toe. Not possible!</li>
            <li> Just received and used for the first time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight stainless steel&lt;br /&gt;Ability to cut thick and regular toenails&lt;br /&gt;Safe cut, no worries about clipping skin&lt;br /&gt;Cut, neat and smooth&lt;br /&gt;Protective tip for nipper a plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nipper will take some getting used to if you have never used a nipper before...how to place, angles etc.&lt;br /&gt;It is a small handled unit and &#x27;might&#x27; work a little better if the two handles were a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell if the Seki Edge deserves its fifth star. This will be determined by continued use.</li>
            <li> These clippers are razor sharp and appear to be durible. They work fine on tough toe nails. I just wish that the blades did not have such a pronounced curve .</li>
            <li> I was hoping for these to be a bit sharper, they take a fair amount of pressure to make a cut. But they&#x27;re well made and have a solid feel. I had mine professionally sharpened and now they&#x27;re a pretty good clipper.</li>
            <li> I bought these nail clippers for my father, who is in his 80&#x27;s and has thick toe nails. He had taken to using tools from his garage in an attempt to cut his toe nails, as the regular clippers were not doing the job. These Seki Edge clippers, while not inexpensive, are well-constructed, made in Japan, and easy to use. So far, he likes them, but they are very sharp. They do come with a small plastic storage sleeve that goes over the sharp, cutter tip to protect them from dulling, and you from getting hurt!</li>
            <li> Purchased these to replace a pair I broke.  The do an OK job, but it is difficult for the blades to cut through thick, tough toenails.  I find it difficult to get a good grip on the handles--too narrow of a diameter and very slippery.  A rubber coating on the handles would be a big improvement</li>
            <li> I have very hard and gnarly toe nails that are hard to cut.  I have broken other toe nail cutters trying to cut my nails.  These nail cutters work very well.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller. Easy to use and very versatile. I recommend it to everyone. I use it regularly and I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis under my toenails which is very thick. An Ordinary nail clipper didn&#x27;t open wide enough which is why I bought the Seki.  It works very well and I am able to cut my toenails now. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and just the right curve to give great results. I would recomend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> After cutting my toe with the conventional clipper, had to try this instrument.  This is a safe and would be very hard to cut your self.</li>
            <li> Great quality nippers.  Would have given it 5 stars if they were a little larger.  For cutting toe nails, they seem a bit fragile.  However, having said that, they haven&#x27;t failed us yet after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> Over rated. Nothing &#x27;Professional&#x27; about this Nail Nipper. Leaves jagged edge on nails. A waste of time &amp; money. I won&#x27;t buy their products again.</li>
            <li> Arrived in package, works great, allows much finer cuts.</li>
            <li> Clipper is not strong enough to clip toe nails, which is my primary reason for the purchase. I had to clip really really hard to clip the nail off. Better off use scissors.</li>
            <li> The older I get the more rigid my nails become.  Before the Seki I actually broke a clipper!  This his sturdy, sharp and very efficient.  I strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works well. Does what it is suppose to do.  This is the best product of this type I&#x27;ve purchased, and would buy it again if stolen.</li>
            <li> ...tried it as soon as I rec&#x27;d it. Because of a bad back, I can barely reach my toes, the clippers gave me an extra reach.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do dot recommend it for toenails. The device crushes rather than cuts thick nails. Also, be careful with the sharp&lt;br /&gt;points, can easily stab you if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. I wish I would have had one of these 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> delivery as predicted - product excellent value.</li>
            <li> I thought this one might be better than a toe clipper. Although it is made as a quality product, it&#x27;s not as useful as a toe clipper.  And it&#x27;s pricy. A toe clipper with larger opening should be better, which I am still searching for.</li>
            <li> I am happy to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Very nicely contured blade cuts like a surgical snips. No frazzled, uneven, or off center blade cuts. It has the feel of a quality tool in my hands. It&#x27;s a comfortable, easily controled handle with a very good blade.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I chose the Seki Edge!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time &amp; was as described.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, very sharp.  Highly recommended.  Works well.  I&#x27;m a nurse, and would use these on diabetic patients as well.  I have arthritic hands and use these on my boyfriend&#x27;s toenails, which are difficult to cut.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned. The Seki Edge Ss-202 is wonderful for both feet and hands.  It has a great shape and is precision made.  Worth the price - I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Seki is quality....the cutter is great. Correct shape. Right size.  Buy this cutter...all stainless steel.</li>
            <li> This excellent product is so sharp it make nail trimming easy on both fingers and toes. I am right handed yet found this clipper easy to operate with my left hand</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this item. Really sharp but the screw on the &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; came out so after you clip you have to manually open the item. I can&#x27;t return it because 30 days have passed. Terrible policy. I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the Seki Edge Nail Nipper.  My elderly mother has some toenails that have a bad fungus problem and the nails have become very hard, thick and uneven.  I have used several other brands of nail nippers/trimmers to try and care for her feet, but none of them worked very well.  I finally decided to try the Seki Edge and boy am I glad I did.  The nippers are extremely sharp and made very short work out of trimming her nails.  Within 2 minutes, I had trimmed all of her toenails down to where they were nearly normal looking.  A few quick strokes with a nail file and they feel like normal toenails.  She is so happy about this and so am I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these nippers.  Do be careful not to let children play with them because, as I said before, they are very sharp.  They do come with a rubber cap to put over the blades while not using them which is very useful.</li>
            <li> Most Nail  Nippers slip in my hand and then grind to a halt as they try to cut threw the nail..not these...nip, nip, clip, clip...job done!  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this nail nipper as a cuticle clipper. What an improvement over the one from the drugstore I had been using. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I like a fresh pair of nail nippers for my constant hang nails.  These are over engineered over sized and over unecessary.  I tried to give them to my parents, my kids and my unknowing hubby.  Nobody found them easy to use.  They are like surgery quality it design but they are to big for &amp;#34;nippers.&amp;#34;  I sent them back.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, cuts cleanly, even on the toughest toenails.  Well made, good value, and highly recommended.  It solves the nail cutting problem.</li>
            <li> I have tough nails and these really did the job.  My hope is that they will maintain the sharpness over time.</li>
            <li> These work so well! Wish I was using these instead of the standard nail clipper all these years. I feel it is much easier to cut and shape your nails and finish quicker with these. This nail nipper is high quality, sturdy, easy to use, looks good, and just all around great. Also noticed that it produces a cleaner cut and does not leave my nail edge as jagged/sharp as it does with regular nail clippers. One thing I do notice, the nail clippings will go flying off further than with a regular nail clipper probably would. So, slight annoyance but still love this much more!    UPDATE 09/12/14 I&#x27;ve used this a few times now and still really like it. However, when it comes to the toenails, there was some getting used to it. It does take a little more effort to cut the toenails since they&#x27;re more thick and had to learn how to angle it the right way to get the best cut. But with me it&#x27;s not really an issue. If you have arthritis or hand problems, it might pose a problem, but it&#x27;s not much harder than using your standard nail clipper. I definitely still prefer this nail nipper any day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut through my toe nails. It&#x27;s very dull. I&#x27;m not sure why there were so many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cheap little plastic cap it comes with is supposed to keep it closed for storage, but it just pops off. So the blades and handles just stay open all the time when you store them.</li>
            <li> Go for it, i have hard nails and it is the best cutter i came across</li>
            <li> Very nice and comfortable nail cutter.</li>
            <li> This product is just like the one my parents had (c. 1950). Sturdy and sharp; it does a great job!</li>
            <li> Before spending a lot of money on a product that was less than satisfactory, I read several reviews of nail clippers / nippers that were supposed to work well on thick toenails. I liked what I read about this Seki product, so I decided to spend the extra money and take a chance. I have not been disappointed - these nippers cut through my thick toenails without a problem. As others have noted, this is a very sharp implement - but that&#x27;s why it works so well! Just be careful, and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> What a relief to finally have nail clippers that are effective for my very tough nails.  After years of struggling with not-sharp-enough toe nail clippers purchased at local drug stores or supermarkets - finally, I&#x27;ve found ones that are sharp enough to work without huge effort, struggle and difficulty.  This honestly is a big relief - one, two, three!</li>
            <li> Well made product BUT the handles are too short. There is not enough leverage to EASILY cut toe nails of average thickness.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper, easy to use and does a great job.  I highly recommend the purchase of this clipper.</li>
            <li> Good for cutting the ends of the tough curved nails.  Used in combination with the Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper makes a good combination for old tough toe nails.</li>
            <li> I would have given it five stars it the cutting area was a little bigger.  But then I am a big person so it might be just what a smaller person needs.</li>
            <li> this clipped is very sharp and overall, it is very well made. it is small and if you have big hands or thick nails, this might now be ideal. also the finish is a little rough to the touch but not irritating. may be this gives it a good grip when he hand is wet. the cutting edge alignment is perfect and very well horned.</li>
            <li> Quality Item,5 Stars.</li>
            <li> These are not very strong and really cannot be used for any thick nails. The metal handles will bend or break.</li>
            <li> This is a a top tier nail nipper. Toe nails can be tricky to cut and this does a wonderful job. This  is especially important if you are (as I am, diabetic) Anyway, this is well made and will last for years. I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this side-cutter design, and it seems to be more practical than the old, oversized fingernail clipper type clippers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was as dangerously sharp as some people had mentioned. Its pointy and you don&#x27;t want to pock yourself. The handle should be a little larger so that you can get better leverage. Other than that they work fine.</li>
            <li> VERY SHARP does the job</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, exactly as described.  I suffer from ingrown toenails and needed a sharp clipper to keep them maintained and these fit the bill so far.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, high quality, large enough to grip and use. Very sharp so care is needed but that is one of the benefits. Would recommend this item to my friends.</li>
            <li> After receiving these I now know why the lady gave them one stars for being \\&quot;dangerous\\&quot;. These clippers are surgically sharp and will cut through seemingly anything. You have to be careful and really take your time. The size is just right, certainly not too big. they are kinda small in my big hands which I like.</li>
            <li> While the design of this nail clipper is great, the craftsmanship and warranty is a completely different story. You can probably see 10 different sellers for this item on Amazon, right? I went with one and the order was shipped by Amazon. Received it in 2 days. Brand new out of the box, I noticed there&#x27;s a gap in between the cutting blades, about 0.5mm wide. Not very wide but wide enough so that it doesn&#x27;t cut at all.&lt;br /&gt;Several times I thought the cuticle is cut off, and when I pull I end up pulling the cuticle off which is very painful.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Seki USA for &amp;#34;Life Time Warranty&amp;#34;. They say it&#x27;s not their product and hence they can&#x27;t provide refund nor replacement, nothing they could do. So be careful when you buy this. If you buy the product with wrong packaging (not from seki usa) then no warranty.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning this to Amazon. Quite disappointed with this Made in Japan quality, not to mention the premium price tag for it.&lt;br /&gt;(See pictures)</li>
            <li> After many purchases of nail cutters for toenails from stores including visits to podiatrists , I went through the Amazon list and especially the Members grading and star rating to find the better nail cutters available.&lt;br /&gt;I happen to have thick big toe nails and needed sharp cutters.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Seki and they were fabulous- cutting easily with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every dollar and more. Well done Seki and well done other purchasers on Amazon for helping me!,&lt;br /&gt;Manna</li>
            <li> After only about 4 uses, the one of the nipper handles broke cleanly where the cutting edges hinge.  I was underwhelmed before the break-- not that easy to control, particularly &#x27;other handed&#x27;, unlike conventional clippers.  Give this a pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seki will honor its guarantee, and another nipper is on its way-- but I&#x27;m still not sure it works all that well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.  New clippers have arrived, and while they are an industrial work of art, I&#x27;m not getting any better at using them.  I&#x27;ve pretty much gone back to conventional right-angle nippers.</li>
            <li> They are a nice quality product. They are sharp but a little awkward to use. Its easy to use on someone else, but more difficult to use on yourself. Its taking some time to learn how to manipulate them to use on my self. I think given some more time, I&#x27;ll like them more.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment.  It was sharp, but way to small for most adults.  Also the mechanism for automatically 0penng after you make a cut is not well thought out. It keeps slipping out of it&#x27;s position and it becomes frustrating to use. Keep looking.</li>
            <li> All of the seki products I have bought have been great.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Too small for my big hands. Could not apply enough leverage to cut my toenails. Need something with much longer handles.</li>
            <li> My husband use to cut my toes nails and he said is the perfect tool to do it, I believe the same, so thank you to let us have it.</li>
            <li> This clipper doesn&#x27;t seem sharp enough and requires quite a bit of hand strength .  I was hoping this would cut through a very thick toenail, but my old one, which doesn&#x27;t open very wide, is much sharper and doesn&#x27;t require as much strength to squeeze.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this nail nipper.  My Podiatrist used something like these when she was working on my toes and recommended I get one as well so if you have problems with your nails this may well be for you.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful you&#x27;ll cut you&#x27;re whole toe off. Very sharp. Handles too small for leverage. Hard to cut nails evenly. But if you want to cut through lightweight sheet metal or small fishing hooks, bolts, nut or screws this might do the trick. Don&#x27;t let you&#x27;re kids anywhere near this thing. It doesn&#x27;t cut nails the way I would like and I think you&#x27;d have to have the flexibility of a yoga master to do so safely with positive results. But it&#x27;s probably descent quick home protection. If I only knew how to throw it like a ninja would!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with my Seki Edge Ss-202 professional nail nipper.  It is very dull....I don&#x27;t think it could cut butter !</li>
            <li> The nail nipper is extremely well built and cuts very neatly. The springs provide the right feel and it seems that they will last forever. I have a Korean nipper that cuts well, but its spring broke after about two years of use.</li>
            <li> The nippers I ordered were from a Vet store and I can see why. These cut through nails without any problem. I have toe fungus and my nails get really thick. These trimmed them up with no problem. Great tool!</li>
            <li> nice sharp cutter which works well on thick nails; Only downside is small length of cut; one has to step into cutting toenails.</li>
            <li> The Seki Edge Ss-202 Professional Nail Nipper is the best personal &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; I have acquired.  It works very well and saves regular trips to the podiatrist.</li>
            <li> These clippers are good for finger nails or toe nails.  They are easy to hold and sharp.  The feel is comfortable to your hands.</li>
            <li> This nail nipper is of very high quality. The cut is very smooth and the force needed to perform the cut is easy on the hand.The finish is brushed stainless and has a nice feel to it. Very sharp edges and the edges line up perfectly for a very clean and smooth cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure you can go to the local supermarket and get one of those cheaply made versions in the beauty supply aisle, but as my grandfather once told me, &amp;#34;buy cheap, buy twice&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah it&#x27;s not cheap but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Very sharply and easy cut. I had serval nipper this is the best.  I would like to recommend it. I hope to get a size bigger than I got.</li>
            <li> I previously used the Tweezerman barrel toenail clipper and found it rather hit-or-miss in its intended function.  The Seki Edge 202 has a much smaller cutting head but makes up for it in its almost clinical surgical cutting precision.  Also, I have the Seki Edge fingernail clippers.  However, I found that you have to have a really steady hand while using them because the fact that they are harder to manipulate than the 202 while also cutting with that definite surgical manner meant that you had to be very careful while using them.  I found that the 202 is ideal for finger and toenails.  Although it is a small appliance, it has great leverage and is easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> This nail nipper is too short,  it cannot cut straight across nails,  you have to keep moving it.  It is really sharp, so once you get it aligned, it will cut.  But it is annoying,  that&#x27;s why I sent it back.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied - does exactly what I needed.  (No longer have to worry about long toe nails protruding through my socks!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for clipping very short (once you get the hang of it) I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months and it&#x27;s still sharp as new</li>
            <li> I ordered this Seki toe nail clipper to replace a German one that dulled over the years. This clipper is really, really sharp and cleanly cuts through the toughest nails. Over the years I have switched from Germany cutlery to Japanese cutlery. The latter is both better designed and the quality of steel is clearly superior. My German kitchen knives have all been replaced by Japanese Shun knives. Once you try Japanese cutlery, you will never go back to German ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I bought these clippers.  I used to have a lot of trouble cutting my toenails, but these clippers have made the job much easier.  They are quite sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The Seki Edge Ss-202 professional nail clippers are quite sharp but cut only a small area.  So they do the job--if you have the patience.  Certainly better that what you would find in a drug store for those of us who have to deal with fungus in our toenails.</li>
            <li> The Seki Edge will cut cleanly and easily through the thickest toe nails. Easy to use and the storage cover for the blades is a&lt;br /&gt;plus to avoid damage when not being used for nail grooming.</li>
            <li> This clipper makes short work of my very thick toe nails with little effort. It cuts quickly and cleanly. Just be careful not to cut more than you intend. These are quite sharp.</li>
            <li> The tool would not cut even with considerable effort was applied, I expected my wife to be able to use the clipper on my feet.</li>
            <li> I got the item without the informational packaging; it was just in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be of good quality but I had to put a drop of sewing lubricating oil on the hinge since it was a little rigid and stiff when using the nail clipper. Now it seems fine.</li>
            <li> this is OK quality and works OK but if you expect precision - namely, the blades meeting precisely - this is not your tool. Whether that&#x27;s important or not, I don&#x27;t know. Beyond not being precise, there&#x27;s nothing really wrong with them.</li>
            <li> Perfect in every way. Typical Japanese quality. Well made and excellent for trimming nails to prevent ingrown nails,</li>
            <li> These nippers are very sharp and work well. They are a quality product and worth the price. The only improvement might be if they had a rubber grip of some sort on the handles as they can get slippery. They cut through very thick nails.</li>
            <li> High quality.....made in Japan.....yeah, you know this is a good grooming tool</li>
            <li> Tried another clipper that cost less and gave up. Ordered this clipper and now I can cut my toe toenails with ease</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to use. I shoud have made this purchase years ago instead of living with dull obsolete tools.</li>
            <li> If you would have asked me if I would ever be writing a review on nail clippers in my future I would have thought you were nuts.  But, alas, here I am!  I am doing so because I am compelled to express how great these are!  They cut through my nails with ease and even my toe nails.  They even can bang through my husband&#x27;s ham hock toe nails!  Magic!  Seriously, though, the Seki brand nail trimmers are more expensive then your everyday clippers but, trust me, they are worth it!  You get what you pay for and in this case you are paying for quality and construction - both which are top notch!</li>
            <li> I did not realize these were bulky, and for toenails. They are curved the wrong way for fingernail cuticles.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is great, it is very sharp and cuts nails easily that others had a hard time to do.&lt;br /&gt;If I have to buy again, this would be the one.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic, healthcare Nurse Practitioner professional. This device is dangerous...more inclined to cut good tissue rather than thick nail. I used once. Bled all over my room. Much difficulty controlling bleeding....lots of pain. Do not recommend especially for diabetic whose foot condition is so important. I will never use again. I will now require watching my foot healing and pray for no infection. Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> Very sharp edge nice feel in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;I needed a good unit because I have thick nails.&lt;br /&gt;So from reading the reviews my pick was the Seki and I am very happy that I did.&lt;br /&gt;My Brand from now on...</li>
            <li> Screw holding the spring popped out on my first usage. Same thing happened again after I reattached the screw and spring.&lt;br /&gt;Though the nipper is very sharp it does not hold up on tough toenails. It is now totally useless to me.</li>
            <li> This is the first toenail clipper I have found that works, and it works fine. It clips the nails without any chewing or tearing. A couple other brands I&#x27;ve bought online claimed to be professional, but, like drugstore brands, only chew toenails, and some don&#x27;t even do that much.</li>
            <li> Definitely a quality tool.Accurate and precise each time without a lot of effort. Those with big hands might be more comfortable handling a slightly larger clipper.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, exactly what you&#x27;d expect from Seki.</li>
            <li> THis is a very strong, well made clipper... the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. I hope the sharpness holds up. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> these nippers work perfectly... have to be careful with them as they are very sharp but they do come with a tip cover to store safely</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest toenail clippers I have ever used. Nicely curved, they do not need a powerful grip to do their job on thick nails.</li>
            <li> These were not as sharp as I thought they would be.  They are also somewhat smaller than I expected.  A cover or locking handle would have been nice.  It comes with a small piece of plastic that keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> One thing you can count on with this nipper, is that its very sharp and makes quick work clipping your nails, both finger and toes. It&#x27;s excellent quality and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> These are really handy and they work well for nipping the curved edges of nails. Could be better with larger handles, but I do have rather large hands.</li>
            <li> Professional equipment!</li>
            <li> They work much better than toe nail clippers. Sturdy construction. I have very hard toe nails and this product performed well.</li>
            <li> At my age my nails are rather thick, and several double over into a horseshoe shape. Impossible to cut with regular nippers. These worked very well. Strong, sharp, easy to use. Could use slightly longer handles for increased leverage, but overall excellent.</li>
            <li> Seems solid and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you turn the curve of the blade to match the toenail. It will just chip off corners if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I have developed very thick toenails for some reason recently and put on weight.&lt;br /&gt;They both may have to do with inactivity I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn&#x27;t gauge is that this one is only 4&amp;#34;. Because of the difficulty I have bending over I should have selected one with a much longer blade and/or handle and have had to buy another one because this one is too short.&lt;br /&gt;There is no problem with them being dangerous or too sharp.&lt;br /&gt;They are just too small for my purposes but should be fine for people with more flexibility bending over than i have.</li>
            <li> I like this clipper as it does the job with my toe nails, some of which are thick due to fungus. I found this clipper handles to bee on the small side and the mechanism doesn&#x27;t give enough leverage to easily cut thicker nails. This clipper is nicely made, only wished it were larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, I looked at the other choices of clippers and these are the best of what I was able to find.</li>
            <li> These cutters are very well-made from Japan, very sharp and very easy to use.  If you have difficult nails to cut give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  I bought this because the normal my normal toe clipper does not do a good job on my big toe nails, which are thick and hard.  Based on the claims for this product as a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; nipper, I assumed it would cut the toenails like a hot knife through butter.  Wrong!  It does worse on the big toenails than my cheap store-bought clipper.  It does fine with the other nails, but at this money it should also be able to handle the big toenails.</li>
            <li> Time will tell but thus far this item seems to be of very good quality, has a good &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; in its use and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Love it! Never have ingrown toenails or ugly feet again.</li>
            <li> Sharp as a pin, and quite adequate to do my rather hardened toe nails! I would recommend this anytime. Good quality workmanship.</li>
            <li> i first ordered a toe nail nipper by Erbe for more than 3 times the cost of this one, and shockingly the Erbe wasn&#x27;t sharp.  i wasn&#x27;t sure if i should return or not so i ordered the Seki to compare the quality because everybody was raving how sharp the Seki was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sure enough the Seki is sharp - as soon as i tried it i sent the Erbe back for refund - but here is the deal - the Seki is HALF THE SIZE of the Erbe !  while the Erbe fit perfectly in my hand ( I have medium sized male hands ) the Seki i could only hold with 3 fingers.  the only reason i didn&#x27;t return the Seki is because i knew it would be this way when i was ordering it - i only ordered it to test the sharpness - so it would have been unfair to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you held the Seki and the Erbe in your hands you would think the Seki is some kind of a joke compared to the Erbe - half the size, about 1/4 of the weight - however for some reason the Erbe was dull - maybe i got a lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the end both Seki and Erbe turned out to be pretty terrible - i returned the Erbe because it was a lot of money and kept the Seki because it was cheap, but it is definitely not a good product - the only thing it has going for it is its sharpness.  On the other hand Erbe had everything going for it EXCEPT the sharpness - i don&#x27;t understand why it has to be this way !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i briefly considered getting a Malteser which is about 2X the price of Erbe and about 8X the price of Seki but then i realized that i&#x27;m not Donald Trump !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Seki nail clippers though are very nice - i have both the small and the big one, and i prefer the big one - but the quality in excellent on both.  this nipper though the quality is not so great - it&#x27;s sharp but it still feels cheap - but then it IS cheap ( for a nipper ) so you know ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars.  sharp &amp; inexpensive, but terrible ergonomics.</li>
            <li> Are you tired of cheap drug store clippers? Then buy Seki branded clippers. Even the finger nails clippers are tough enough to use for toe nails. The metal doesn&#x27;t bend and they seem perfectly balanced. Pretty close to salon quality or Better!</li>
