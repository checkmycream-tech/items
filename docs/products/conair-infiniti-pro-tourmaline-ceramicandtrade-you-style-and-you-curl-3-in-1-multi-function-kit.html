            <li>The straightener takes a while to heat up, but it works great!</li>
            <li>This is probably best used if if you have some help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Hoping the replacement doesnt break as this did give her the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>This item is awesome!</li>

            <li>The curling tool is really great</li>
            <li>And the price on Amazon was great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>I can even brush my hair and re-wind the curls with my fingers, which is amazing for my hair!</li>
            <li>but, both worked amazing!</li>
            <li>the hand thing is great also because it reduces my chances at getting burned! :)</li>
            <li>It makes AMAZING, beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Although this product looked like a good two for one buy, I returned this and bought something else.</li>
            <li>The curling wand is good though.</li>
            <li>and I loved the style of their hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my partner, she loved it before it was even plugged in.</li>
            <li>Wand created beautiful spiral curls that lasted for many hours.</li>
            <li>It was a very good deal and I was excited to order.</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>Its great... Easy to use n</li>
            <li>and I think it works amazing.</li>
            <li>When I straighten my hair, it comes out nice and not poofy, along with a nice shine to it.</li>
            <li>dont sell this kind of stuff</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to get it for as good as a price, but glad to have found it.</li>
            <li>Pretty impressed with the flat iron worked perfectly like hair salon and much better than others that I used before.</li>
            <li>and I just wanted some more defined waves, have to try again</li>
            <li>Better learn how to wind your hair without it and without burning yourself.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>great if you have straight hair--</li>
            <li>I love this styling tool.</li>
            <li>and if it does curl, it leaves a kink in your hair where you started at the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my girls&#x27; favorite hair tool.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>Satisfied with merchandise.</li>
            <li>i love using my curling wand</li>
            <li>does not hep me at all but love the wand.</li>
            <li>Pleased with price of curling , paid $20 and some change.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay curling iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried the straightener, since I have another one made just for straightening, but the wand... Makes fantastic waves!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that people with thinner hair will have better luck with this size curling wand.</li>
            <li>I just received it :)</li>
            <li>The wand is great, but the other straightening/curling attachment just doesn&#x27;t curl great.</li>
            <li>very good product, works well and is very cheap, is very favorable for value is a very functional device.</li>
            <li>But thanks to amazon, their return service too good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to switch between the straightener (which doesn&#x27;t pull my hair) and the curling rod.  </li>
            <li>It heats up to 350 degrees easy within 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>The curler gets hot pretty fast which is nice and curls beautifully.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly ðŸ˜Š , they get very hot so be careful</li>
            <li>It does not stay hot, very easy to turn off without knowing when using it.</li>
            <li>The Conair Infinit Pro is a good product for me so far.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I have never had such a good curling iron/wand.</li>
            <li>My hair never held a curl before and i have only tried the straightener so far and it works great!</li>
            <li>She loved the concept as she wanted a wand and flat iron for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>It comes with finger protectors, but I found I couldn&#x27;t hold the hair right when I wore them.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for myself,I absolutely love it,heats up quick,gives me lasting curls &amp; super straight tresses,plan on buying another for my sister!</li>
            <li>stuff inside the original box where al messed up and the box was definitely manipulated by someone else.&lt;br /&gt;The product although is good for making different hair styles.</li>
            <li>I have two daughters who were fighting daily over being able to use this styling tool.</li>
            <li>I noticed that if I got it at my local drugstore it would have been much more expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, power button broke on first use.</li>
            <li>First one I have ever used that works.</li>
            <li>part is good, but makes small curls, not waves</li>
            <li>curling iron didn&#x27;t really work for me, my hair is already curly</li>
            <li>It is much faster than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Now I can have it any way I like - straight, wavy, curly, and air</li>
            <li>However, I should mention that it really does take practice, as the manual says.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smooth out hair like flat irons should.</li>
            <li>Also, it is quite easy to burn yourself if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t adequately protect your hand and increases the chance of burning your hang since it only covers two fingers.  </li>
            <li>Ok so I love the product but the package and the way sender delivered was just wrong...</li>
            <li>I Love this product definitely recommend it to every female  &amp;#34</li>
            <li>Using it is not as straightforward as a hair dryer,  Left handed curls for the right handed, and so forth; the different diameters obtained.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly and has an auto shutoff for the forgetful among us who tend to leave their appliances turned on.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conair item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats very fast, gets very hot and cools down quite fast as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>going to order more for a few of my girls</li>
            <li>Love this but wish the flat iron attachment closed with a lock of some sort.</li>
            <li>I purchased the first one at Costco and then looked and looked for another, but none came back into stock.</li>
            <li>It doesnt leave any creases in my hair and it gets hot enough also.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t exactly care for the curved part of the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>The curlers heat up fast and the curls last longer.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>Flat iron portion did snag her hair a little however with a little heat protectant spray she was able to eliminate the snagging.&lt;br /&gt;Protective heat glove is made strictly for right handed people.</li>
            <li>So I gave it only four stars because while it works, I got the same results with a normal curler.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this little gadget gets pretty hot and WILL burn you, so be careful!</li>
            <li>Wand heated up quick and got hot enough to curl her stubborn, thin hair.</li>
            <li>Normally her hair will let a curl loose within the hour.</li>
            <li>Using this correctly so that you get pretty curls or waves does take a little practice.  </li>
            <li>I can add a little curl to the ends with just the straightner ;)</li>

            <li> I can add a little curl to the ends with just the straightner ;)</li>
            <li> The rubber glove thing is a little cumbersome and awkward  to put on, should really be a full glove, one could easily touch the barrel with the exposed fingers .  </li>
            <li> Goodbye to fine, thin, flat hair.</li>
            <li> The shutoff comes a little quickly for a beginner like me, so I had to turn it back on and wait a few minutes for it to heat back up a couple of times on my first few tries.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It sets curls very tight and fast.  </li>
            <li> gives me long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> My hair catches on the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because it turns off after 30 minutes, which for some people is great, but for me since it takes an hr and a half to straighten my hair, having to turn it back on every 30 minutes it annoying.</li>
            <li> but i guess i expected as much on the count of my small fingers</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 14 yr old daughter for christmas, it Did not give clear instructions regarding how to disconnect /connect the 2 different pieces,  we had to fiddle with it for a while , was a little frustrating.  </li>
            <li> From the reviews that I had read, I was expecting the curler to work amazing and the straightener to be a piece of crap</li>
            <li> dry(style wet and go).</li>
            <li> dont buy this item its turn on but after 1 sec offf</li>
            <li> this expected.</li>
            <li> It does the job but wish the other model hadn&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Additionally, styling one side of my hair was easier than the other.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and I should mention I have not used the other attachment.  </li>
            <li> That one just makes my hair look extremely weird/not curled.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this as she lives in another state and now have to hassle with returning the product then order a new one to have delivered to her home.</li>
            <li> for the heck of it, I then tried one of my traditional curing irons that had approximately the same barrel width</li>
            <li> Iron is not good for thick, African American Hair.</li>
            <li> it seemed to be previously used and repacked by somebody else,</li>
            <li> Just what the pre-teen ordered and reasonably enough priced for her little sister to gift it to her!!!</li>
            <li> On the downside, the little glove it comes with, don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> and I use it nearly everyday.</li>
            <li> I got this after a few of my friends got one</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble curling my hair-</li>
            <li> the little doo-dad they include with the product is weird and doesn&#x27;t cover nearly enough skin</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not sure if I just fried my hair</li>
            <li> I returned this curling wand because I have too thick of hair for the small barrel size.  </li>
            <li> but the glove it sucks</li>
            <li> the straightener part probably won&#x27;t work so well on someone with thick and/or curly hair</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know why they included the ridiculous glove.  </li>
            <li> sadly the glove does not fit my hand</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the straightener part is junk, which is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I was so angry.</li>
            <li> I used it the wrong way</li>
            <li> therefore was completely useless for her.</li>

            <li> Love this but wish the flat iron attachment closed with a lock of some sort. Got this to replace another that broke when dropped and was discontinued. It does the job but wish the other model hadn&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Pretty impressed with the flat iron worked perfectly like hair salon and much better than others that I used before. Although I&#x27;m not sure if I just fried my hair today!&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron didn&#x27;t really work for me, my hair is already curly and I just wanted some more defined waves, have to try again maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> The Conair Infinit Pro is a good product for me so far.  It gets hot quickly and has an auto shutoff for the forgetful among us who tend to leave their appliances turned on.  The shutoff comes a little quickly for a beginner like me, so I had to turn it back on and wait a few minutes for it to heat back up a couple of times on my first few tries.  Using this correctly so that you get pretty curls or waves does take a little practice.  Do get a separate heat resistant glove...the little doo-dad they include with the product is weird and doesn&#x27;t cover nearly enough skin and this little gadget gets pretty hot and WILL burn you, so be careful!</li>
            <li> When I straighten my hair, it comes out nice and not poofy, along with a nice shine to it. The wand is also great! gives me long lasting curls! the hand thing is great also because it reduces my chances at getting burned! :)</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is my husbands and my amazon account...my name is not Joshua...lol! Okay, I have never had such a good curling iron/wand. The curls stay all day with no product. I can even brush my hair and re-wind the curls with my fingers, which is amazing for my hair! On the downside, the little glove it comes with, don&#x27;t waste your time. It gets in the way of trying to wrap your hair. Better learn how to wind your hair without it and without burning yourself. I say learn, because it takes practice to not burn yourself. Unfortunately, the straightener part is junk, which is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. Good luck and happy curling!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Just as good as the expensive ones.  This is the third one I bought for people.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this with no problems.  She said she would recommend it to anyone looking to straighten their hair.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this she was wanting one for Christmas last year for we got it for her and she loves how it works on her hair</li>
            <li> great if you have straight hair-- the straightener part probably won&#x27;t work so well on someone with thick and/or curly hair&lt;br /&gt;curler part is good, but makes small curls, not waves</li>
            <li> Just what the pre-teen ordered and reasonably enough priced for her little sister to gift it to her!!!</li>
            <li> This item came used. I was so angry. I could not believe it was used when I opened the box. In addition, the item was not working properly.</li>
            <li> Came in on time. No problems.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 14 yr old daughter for christmas, it Did not give clear instructions regarding how to disconnect /connect the 2 different pieces,  we had to fiddle with it for a while , was a little frustrating.  The rubber glove thing is a little cumbersome and awkward  to put on, should really be a full glove, one could easily touch the barrel with the exposed fingers .  I may buy her one of those gloves at harmon, they sell them there.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself,I absolutely love it,heats up quick,gives me lasting curls &amp; super straight tresses,plan on buying another for my sister!</li>
            <li> I love this styling tool. The curling tool is really great and I use it nearly everyday. I have very thin hair and it adds fullness, body and shine that lasts all day. It is much faster than using a curling iron. It totally replaced my Instyler.</li>
            <li> This is not salon quality but for the price it works well. It takes a bit to get used to.</li>
            <li> Now I can have it any way I like - straight, wavy, curly, and air dry(style wet and go). Goodbye to fine, thin, flat hair.</li>
            <li> The wand is great, but the other straightening/curling attachment just doesn&#x27;t curl great. and if it does curl, it leaves a kink in your hair where you started at the top. Not great.</li>
            <li> I have two daughters who were fighting daily over being able to use this styling tool. I purchased the first one at Costco and then looked and looked for another, but none came back into stock. After several months, I found it here on Amazon. I wasn&#x27;t able to get it for as good as a price, but glad to have found it. It&#x27;s my girls&#x27; favorite hair tool.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> i got this for my girlfriend for christmas and she loved it. must have if you like styling hair or weave</li>
            <li> I love it ! My hair never held a curl before and i have only tried the straightener so far and it works great! I can add a little curl to the ends with just the straightner ;)</li>
            <li> Satisfied with merchandise.</li>
            <li> My hair catches on the flat iron.  I didn&#x27;t exactly care for the curved part of the flat iron.  I used it the wrong way and it put dents in my hair.  Maybe I&#x27;m just uncoordinated?  I didn&#x27;t use the curling function and I don&#x27;t know why they included the ridiculous glove.  It doesn&#x27;t adequately protect your hand and increases the chance of burning your hang since it only covers two fingers.  :(  Although this product looked like a good two for one buy, I returned this and bought something else.</li>
            <li> From the reviews that I had read, I was expecting the curler to work amazing and the straightener to be a piece of crap but, both worked amazing! The curler gets hot pretty fast which is nice and curls beautifully. The straightener takes a while to heat up, but it works great! It doesnt leave any creases in my hair and it gets hot enough also. I am African American and I think it works amazing. I only gave 4 stars because it turns off after 30 minutes, which for some people is great, but for me since it takes an hr and a half to straighten my hair, having to turn it back on every 30 minutes it annoying.</li>
            <li> The flat iron doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair well I&#x27;m not to fond of it. The curling wand is good though.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly ðŸ˜Š , they get very hot so be careful</li>
            <li> work only 2day dont buy this item its turn on but after 1 sec offf so pls don&#x27;t buy pls dont sell this kind of stuff</li>
            <li> sadly the glove does not fit my hand but i guess i expected as much on the count of my small fingers but over all i like the product.</li>
            <li> Ok so I love the product but the package and the way sender delivered was just wrong... it seemed to be previously used and repacked by somebody else, stuff inside the original box where al messed up and the box was definitely manipulated by someone else.&lt;br /&gt;The product although is good for making different hair styles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work. This is a awful shopping experience I have never had. I don&#x27;t recommend this item. I total used twice only. It&#x27;s stop working.</li>
            <li> I Love this product definitely recommend it to every female  &amp;#34; It&#x27;s a must have &amp;#34;  going to order more for a few of my girls</li>
            <li> I got this item for my daugther(15) and she loves it. I item came sooner this expected. The curlers heat up fast and the curls last longer.</li>
            <li> yes yes yes  i love using my curling wand but the glove it sucks it is a left handed glove  does not hep me at all but love the wand.</li>
            <li> I got this after a few of my friends got one and I loved the style of their hair.  And the price on Amazon was great.  I noticed that if I got it at my local drugstore it would have been much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sets curls very tight and fast.  However, I should mention that it really does take practice, as the manual says.  Also, it is quite easy to burn yourself if you aren&#x27;t careful.  It comes with finger protectors, but I found I couldn&#x27;t hold the hair right when I wore them.  Additionally, styling one side of my hair was easier than the other.  This is probably best used if if you have some help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for the heck of it, I then tried one of my traditional curing irons that had approximately the same barrel width but of course had a clamp.  I found I could get the same results with this and without the learning curve and burned fingers.  So I gave it only four stars because while it works, I got the same results with a normal curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I should mention I have not used the other attachment.  I&#x27;ll update this review when I do.</li>
            <li> Pleased with price of curling , paid $20 and some change. Why? Because if I paid anymore I would be pissed. Iron is not good for thick, African American Hair. It does not stay hot, very easy to turn off without knowing when using it. It doesn&#x27;t smooth out hair like flat irons should. It&#x27;s an okay curling iron. Like the concept, just didn&#x27;t perform to my standards!</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my daughter for christmas while she was home visiting for the holidays.  Wand heated up quick and got hot enough to curl her stubborn, thin hair. Wand created beautiful spiral curls that lasted for many hours. Normally her hair will let a curl loose within the hour. However, power button broke on first use. Was not happy with this as she lives in another state and now have to hassle with returning the product then order a new one to have delivered to her home. Flat iron portion did snag her hair a little however with a little heat protectant spray she was able to eliminate the snagging.&lt;br /&gt;Protective heat glove is made strictly for right handed people. therefore was completely useless for her. She loved the concept as she wanted a wand and flat iron for Christmas.  Hoping the replacement doesnt break as this did give her the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> very good product, works well and is very cheap, is very favorable for value is a very functional device. thanks</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have always had trouble curling my hair- I have another curling iron that I&#x27;ve tried to use. That one just makes my hair look extremely weird/not curled. This curling iron? First one I have ever used that works. It makes AMAZING, beautiful waves. I highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve never tried the straightener, since I have another one made just for straightening, but the wand... Makes fantastic waves!</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist. I used the product once and the curls were beautiful, when I attempted to use it again it wouldn&#x27;t power on.  Idk, not for me I guess</li>
            <li> It was a very good deal and I was excited to order. When it arrived it didn&#x27;t work. It made me disappointed and I returned immediately. But thanks to amazon, their return service too good.</li>
            <li> This item is awesome! This is the only tool I use now.  It&#x27;s so easy to switch between the straightener (which doesn&#x27;t pull my hair) and the curling rod.  This is a must buy!</li>
            <li> Using it is not as straightforward as a hair dryer,  Left handed curls for the right handed, and so forth; the different diameters obtained.  Thus sayeth my wife.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my partner, she loved it before it was even plugged in. A couple of her friends tried it, they all want one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats very fast, gets very hot and cools down quite fast as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can straighten and within minutes have curls, all with the same device.</li>
            <li> I returned this curling wand because I have too thick of hair for the small barrel size.  I&#x27;m sure that people with thinner hair will have better luck with this size curling wand.</li>
            <li> Its great... Easy to use n quite what I wanted durability still to be known cos I just received it :)</li>
            <li> This is wonderfully awesome. It heats up to 350 degrees easy within 30 seconds. I highly recommend this conair item.</li>
