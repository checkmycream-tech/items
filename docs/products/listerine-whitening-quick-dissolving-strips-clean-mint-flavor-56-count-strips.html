    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These are the very best.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the best thing is that you can talk without impediment while they&#x27;re dissolving.  </li>
            <li>Also, they are easier to apply than the Crest whitestrips, and you can bend/break or cut them up to a size that best fits your teeth/desired bleaching area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recommend, great price too!</li>
            <li>Listerine&#x27;s strips were the BEST strips on the market, why in the world did they get discontinued???</li>
            <li>These were the best whitening strips I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have tried others, but these work the best for me.  </li>
            <li>OMG this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>The $15 non-dissolving whitening strips by Listerine, Crest, and Equate actually do a very good job, considering the price.</li>
            <li>The good news is they work!  </li>
            <li>The combination with the two products are great.</li>
            <li>Although the idea is a great one, in reality it doesn&#x27;t quite work so well.</li>
            <li>All in all, a great product</li>
            <li>Love these strips, just wish I could find them in stores!!  </li>
            <li>This product is wonderful and I have tried many whitening products.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and these work great!</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find this Listerine product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>they taste good as they dissolve (mint flavor)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really loved this product.  </li>
            <li>this would have made a good comedy</li>
            <li>This does a slightly good job whitening your teeth, but the dissolving strips doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
            <li>Really!!&lt;br /&gt;Taste is good.  </li>
            <li>Dissolving is good.</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions though!</li>
            <li>My teeeth KIND OF look whiter..</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- very easy to apply</li>
            <li>The dissolving isn&#x27;t perfect, but just a couple of strokes of the toothbrush will clear any remaining bits here and there.  </li>
            <li>Its so easy!</li>
            <li>Now, after just a week, my teeth look great in pictures, and upon examination in the mirror, the yellowish-ness is much reduced!    </li>
            <li>, they whitened super easy and great.</li>
            <li>They taste fresh and minty, which was pleasant.</li>
            <li>Heaven knows I have a huge supply of them!</li>
            <li>and Im pleased to say I haven&#x27;t had any side effects with it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you&#x27;re putting them in correctly.</li>
            <li>I had tried many stores and pharmacies in San Diego and could not find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>I have thrown away most of the box of strips.  </li>
            <li>the gum of one of my canine teeth is irritated for about one minute when I overlay the strip on top of it.</li>
            <li>But, I love Tide...</li>
            <li>It also tasted much better and didn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt.  </li>
            <li>and youve got a strip on top and bottom.</li>
            <li>The answer is they worked OK, but not as well as I would like.</li>
            <li>Ideally, though, I would have liked even more white.</li>
            <li>In most cases the strip will stick to my fingers when trying to get them to stick to my teeth when I pull my fingers away from my teeth</li>
            <li>theyre ok.</li>
            <li>more bleaching with trays for 1 hour, just apply to teeth they melt into the teeth like a mint,</li>
            <li>I love the flavor</li>
            <li>and I love that is dissolves.  </li>
            <li>And I took the advice of another reviewer and used one for both top and bottom.</li>
            <li>They are handy for a clean mouth but not as a whitener.</li>
            <li>Here is a trick for the cheap - use one strip for the top AND bottom.</li>
            <li>The description makes it sound like the strips magically \\&quot;dissolve\\&quot; on your teeth...</li>
            <li>Despite what other users have written, I think this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m so happy with this, I&#x27;ve come back for more.</li>
            <li>These are very cheap and very effective white strips!</li>
            <li>The strips that I was able to salvage were fairly easy to apply and dissolved quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a cheap easy way to whiten your teeth at home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if one would see such great results if they were young and had good dentition.</li>
            <li>Then I tried Rite-Aid&#x27;s version which I couldn&#x27;t get to peel off the paper backing and which would not stay on the teeth securely.</li>
            <li>Just look in the mirror, smile with teeth touching and stick one on.  </li>
            <li>Definately not you need to brush your mouth out before feeling comfortable after using these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried crest whitestrips, crest whitestrips advanced seal, off brand styrofoam stuff that goes around your teeth with whitener, plastic things that you mold around your teeth</li>
            <li>I like the kinds with the styrofoam guards that go over your teeth, and the crest whitestrips with the advanced seal.</li>
            <li>dissolves in your mouth - no messy strips to take out  good price    </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does make for fresh breath!My</li>
            <li>the positive side, they do freshen up your mouth pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be more convenient since you don&#x27;t have to take them out after a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li>Then take special care when attaching the strips to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is right up there with them!      </li>
            <li>This product acts more as a stain remover and does make one&#x27;s teeth look shiny and clean, but doesn&#x27;t whiten much.</li>
            <li>I would much rather just leave something on my teeth and be able to take it off when it&#x27;s done working.</li>
            <li>And they really do freshen your mouth, better than mouthwash, even.</li>
            <li>anyway, I was looking for something more gentle and convenient.  </li>
            <li>Good thing there are plenty of extra strips included as well to continue the treatment.</li>
            <li>Still looks good and I have plenty to last.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is excellent; on sale they&#x27;re usually $19.99 at Walgreen&#x27;s or Target -- plus tax!  </li>
            <li>First of all, they are EASY to put on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, moderately effective (although dental trays are better than anything), good tasting, sweetens the breath, and only a little sticky-icky.</li>
            <li>With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]]</li>
            <li>Probably will work a lot better for someone who has more yellow teeth than whiter ones.</li>
            <li>and you pour the whitener into it, and Listerine whitening quick dissolving strips.    </li>
            <li>I decided to try the Listerine Whitening strips, since they looked like a tempting new product, plus they were more competitively priced.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WHITENS!!</li>
            <li>If you do decide to tries these, the most effective way I found to get these to stick to my teeth was to lick the strip first making it kind of sticky and then licking the inside and outside of the lip to minimize the strip from sticking to my lip.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, they are just as effective as similar products, (Crest Whitestrips), but I would recommend brushing after the time is up!</li>
            <li>It also gives you fresh breath.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably just spend $300-500 to get it done right.  </li>
            <li>The stick right to your teeth.</li>
            <li>They adhere to your teeth right away.  </li>
            <li>The price was definitely right on these.</li>
            <li>it comes right off.</li>
            <li>Listerine Strips melt right on the teeth and whiten in minutes*****No</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very easy to use, dissolve with some residue left</li>
            <li>First 1 in 3 strips don&#x27;t come out of the package right.  </li>
            <li>I tried Listerine Quick Dissolving Whitening Strips and found they worked really well.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply with dry fingers, and they are fairly comfortable.</li>
            <li>My daughter suggested teeth whitening from the dentist, but I thought I would try something over-the-counter first.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what the final results will be, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve gotten in just 3 days.</li>
            <li>However I was very dissatisfied with how not-so-quickly they dissolve in your mouth!</li>
            <li>Try creative writing 101 at your local community college.</li>
            <li>This is the first time i&#x27;ve been moved to write a comment on amazon</li>
            <li>I have tried many white strip products and none compare to these.</li>
            <li>The cleaning material is only on one side of the strip, so make sure you align the notch correctly when applying the strip.    </li>
            <li>Or, more likely, did they work so well that Crest threatened Listerine and bought them out?  </li>
            <li>I did break the first strip getting it out of the package as they stick to the sides of the package.  </li>
            <li>The first couple also got stuck to the side of my lower lip</li>
            <li>As someone who drinks too much coffee, and has more yellow stains on my teeth then I care to admit, I decided to give these strips a try.</li>
            <li>However I could not get most of these applied properly to see the desired effects of the product as a whole.</li>
            <li>They last for a long time 2-3 month&#x27;s, and i alway&#x27;s have a white beautiful smile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive products and these are the best value around.</li>
            <li>-Individually wrapped, easy to apply and don&#x27;t fall off.  </li>
            <li>The strips are individually wrapped, and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>As for putting on your teeth, as the instructions say, make sure your hands are dry.</li>
            <li>So the most powerful Crest strips do as much as the least powerful Crest strips, and THOSE do almost nothing!</li>
            <li>I have used many different types of Whitening strips in the past and when I saw the packaging that these ones dissolve on their own</li>
            <li>This product was easy to use, and fast acting</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Listerine touch up pen with no problem and find the Crest strips to work quite well, but I can&#x27;t keep these on as there is NO minty taste, just a very strong sour chemical taste.</li>
            <li>The cheaper crest whitestrips don&#x27;t stay on your teeth very well either.</li>
            <li>Alot of people wonder how well or fast they work as compared to the Crest version.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really figured anything out for how to prevent or reduce the strips from sticking to my fingers.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t really say.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience that much pain either.</li>
            <li>I hope these strips would really whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>They do absolutely nothing and the company jacks up the price with no visible difference between dosages (</li>
            <li>It worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>(and i suspect first two reviews written by Pfizer new product relations/marketing.  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, though not completely dissolving.</li>
            <li>My wife was the first to notice how white my teeth were after the very first week of using this product.</li>
            <li>This product is the best to remove cigarette yellow stains from teeth - too bad it is no longer available on market.</li>
            <li>pretty well so far.      </li>
            <li>I was a smoker for 15 years and drink a lot of coffee and diet colas, so I have had a decent amount of staining on my teeth.</li>
            <li>teeth aren&#x27;t super yellow</li>
            <li>They do not make your teeth sensitive and they really do whiten them.  </li>
            <li>I sent for a box of Listerine Strips and most of them were dried up.</li>
            <li>I have wasted so many just trying to avoid the thing sticking to my lower lips, fingers, etc.</li>
            <li>In the few cases that I was able to get them to stick to my teeth I could see a whitening effect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read and seen that many people have trouble using opening and putting the strip on their teeth.</li>
            <li>Now that I have to use another brand my teeth just are not as white and my teeth are super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have tried Rembrant whitening strips which are similar but less effective.</li>
            <li>They are fast to dissolve and leave no mess.</li>
            <li>I have pretty high standards as I&#x27;ve been whitening my teeth for ten years.  </li>
            <li>I could also live with the price.  </li>
            <li>They are gentle enough for me to finish a whole box</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>The generic Rite Aid brand is the same of this stuff, so it takes FOREVER if you actually want to see results (but the form-fitting blue treys are nice).  </li>
            <li>strip are a huge improvement over the previous strips I tried.</li>
            <li>the only positive I have is that they taste like mint, but so does chewing gum.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re OK on the gums, but if you get a little bit on your fingertips, it&#x27;ll feel like a million tiny pin</li>
            <li>I bought the 56-pack of Listerine Whitening strips and have used 42 of them so far.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the ONE AND ONLY product that worked!!!  </li>
            <li>do it professionally..</li>
            <li>Being a college student and not having much money, I saved up enough money to buy the cheapest whitening product at my drugstore (this) and was dissapointed in the results.</li>
            <li>However, they make my teeth really sensitive</li>
            <li>otherwise my teeth get to sensitive to eat and they ache.</li>
            <li>If you tear the package down the long side and then put your finger in to widen the ends of the pocket where the strip is situated you should be able to retrieve it in one piece.  </li>
            <li>While they taste great and make your breath fresh, I was overall disappointed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well they whiten because I&#x27;m not sure if I want to purchase enough to be able to follow the directions after my experience.</li>
            <li>I have not tried any other whitening product to compare these too, so maybe they are actually better than the other brands.</li>
            <li>The main question is did they actually work?</li>
            <li>My teeth were super white(I used to get compliments all the time), the price was under $20 for a 56 count box, I never felt tooth sensitivity, &amp; they dissolved on your teeth in about a half an hour.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why this was ever discontinued, but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s back (at least on Amazon--still not seeing it at CVS).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do use the Crest Vivid tooth paste with my Oral-B Triumph power tooth brush on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>They feel a bit icky while they are dissolving but after 15 minutes I cleaned my teeth again and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Once you develop the knack for getting these strips out of the package (peel down far when opening), they are easy to apply, &amp; you can use one strip for both upper &amp; lower teeth, holding your teeth closed for 10 or 15 seconds.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try Crest 3D White Professional Effects</li>
            <li>I have tried Crest White Strips and home kits of professional bleaching gel.  </li>
            <li>The only con for this product is that, each night, when I place them before bedtime, they will not dissolve completely.</li>
            <li>Amazon was the only place I found it, but I was surprised by the inflated pricing.  </li>
            <li>I have used the professional strength whitening trays and gel from my dentist for the last 12 years.  </li>
            <li>I guess if you consider having gobs of gunk on top of as well as behind your teeth \\&quot;dissolved\\&quot;, then you&#x27;re in luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was too much fuss finding the right sides of strips, positioning them on teeth, and to make the matter worse, they did not dissolve completely.</li>
            <li>I will try Crest Professional Effects White Strips next</li>
            <li>The first time I bought these I thought some of the little packages didn&#x27;t have anything in them.  </li>
            <li>The other main issue I came across while trying to apply these is that the strip will stick to my lip (inside and/or outside) and not my teeth.</li>
            <li>Also, the whitening itself didn&#x27;t really seem noticeable as it typically does with the standard white strips.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> These are the very best.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the best thing is that you can talk without impediment while they&#x27;re dissolving.  </li>
            <li> Also, they are easier to apply than the Crest whitestrips, and you can bend/break or cut them up to a size that best fits your teeth/desired bleaching area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recommend, great price too!</li>
            <li> Listerine&#x27;s strips were the BEST strips on the market, why in the world did they get discontinued???</li>
            <li> These were the best whitening strips I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have tried others, but these work the best for me.  </li>
            <li> OMG this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> The $15 non-dissolving whitening strips by Listerine, Crest, and Equate actually do a very good job, considering the price.</li>
            <li> The good news is they work!  </li>
            <li> The combination with the two products are great.</li>
            <li> Although the idea is a great one, in reality it doesn&#x27;t quite work so well.</li>
            <li> All in all, a great product</li>
            <li> Love these strips, just wish I could find them in stores!!  </li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and I have tried many whitening products.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and these work great!</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find this Listerine product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> they taste good as they dissolve (mint flavor)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really loved this product.  </li>
            <li> this would have made a good comedy</li>
            <li> This does a slightly good job whitening your teeth, but the dissolving strips doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
            <li> Really!!&lt;br /&gt;Taste is good.  </li>
            <li> Dissolving is good.</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the directions though!</li>
            <li> My teeeth KIND OF look whiter..</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- very easy to apply</li>
            <li> The dissolving isn&#x27;t perfect, but just a couple of strokes of the toothbrush will clear any remaining bits here and there.  </li>
            <li> Its so easy!</li>
            <li> Now, after just a week, my teeth look great in pictures, and upon examination in the mirror, the yellowish-ness is much reduced!    </li>
            <li> , they whitened super easy and great.</li>
            <li> They taste fresh and minty, which was pleasant.</li>
            <li> Heaven knows I have a huge supply of them!</li>
            <li> and Im pleased to say I haven&#x27;t had any side effects with it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you&#x27;re putting them in correctly.</li>
            <li> I had tried many stores and pharmacies in San Diego and could not find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have thrown away most of the box of strips.  </li>
            <li> the gum of one of my canine teeth is irritated for about one minute when I overlay the strip on top of it.</li>
            <li> But, I love Tide...</li>
            <li> It also tasted much better and didn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt.  </li>
            <li> and youve got a strip on top and bottom.</li>
            <li> The answer is they worked OK, but not as well as I would like.</li>
            <li> Ideally, though, I would have liked even more white.</li>
            <li> In most cases the strip will stick to my fingers when trying to get them to stick to my teeth when I pull my fingers away from my teeth</li>
            <li> theyre ok.</li>
            <li> more bleaching with trays for 1 hour, just apply to teeth they melt into the teeth like a mint,</li>
            <li> I love the flavor</li>
            <li> and I love that is dissolves.  </li>
            <li> And I took the advice of another reviewer and used one for both top and bottom.</li>
            <li> They are handy for a clean mouth but not as a whitener.</li>
            <li> Here is a trick for the cheap - use one strip for the top AND bottom.</li>
            <li> The description makes it sound like the strips magically \\&quot;dissolve\\&quot; on your teeth...</li>
            <li> Despite what other users have written, I think this product is perfect.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m so happy with this, I&#x27;ve come back for more.</li>
            <li> These are very cheap and very effective white strips!</li>
            <li> The strips that I was able to salvage were fairly easy to apply and dissolved quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a cheap easy way to whiten your teeth at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if one would see such great results if they were young and had good dentition.</li>
            <li> Then I tried Rite-Aid&#x27;s version which I couldn&#x27;t get to peel off the paper backing and which would not stay on the teeth securely.</li>
            <li> Just look in the mirror, smile with teeth touching and stick one on.  </li>
            <li> Definately not you need to brush your mouth out before feeling comfortable after using these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried crest whitestrips, crest whitestrips advanced seal, off brand styrofoam stuff that goes around your teeth with whitener, plastic things that you mold around your teeth</li>
            <li> I like the kinds with the styrofoam guards that go over your teeth, and the crest whitestrips with the advanced seal.</li>
            <li> dissolves in your mouth - no messy strips to take out  good price    </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does make for fresh breath!My</li>
            <li> the positive side, they do freshen up your mouth pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be more convenient since you don&#x27;t have to take them out after a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li> Then take special care when attaching the strips to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is right up there with them!      </li>
            <li> This product acts more as a stain remover and does make one&#x27;s teeth look shiny and clean, but doesn&#x27;t whiten much.</li>
            <li> I would much rather just leave something on my teeth and be able to take it off when it&#x27;s done working.</li>
            <li> And they really do freshen your mouth, better than mouthwash, even.</li>
            <li> anyway, I was looking for something more gentle and convenient.  </li>
            <li> Good thing there are plenty of extra strips included as well to continue the treatment.</li>
            <li> Still looks good and I have plenty to last.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is excellent; on sale they&#x27;re usually $19.99 at Walgreen&#x27;s or Target -- plus tax!  </li>
            <li> First of all, they are EASY to put on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, moderately effective (although dental trays are better than anything), good tasting, sweetens the breath, and only a little sticky-icky.</li>
            <li> With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]]</li>
            <li> Probably will work a lot better for someone who has more yellow teeth than whiter ones.</li>
            <li> and you pour the whitener into it, and Listerine whitening quick dissolving strips.    </li>
            <li> I decided to try the Listerine Whitening strips, since they looked like a tempting new product, plus they were more competitively priced.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WHITENS!!</li>
            <li> If you do decide to tries these, the most effective way I found to get these to stick to my teeth was to lick the strip first making it kind of sticky and then licking the inside and outside of the lip to minimize the strip from sticking to my lip.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, they are just as effective as similar products, (Crest Whitestrips), but I would recommend brushing after the time is up!</li>
            <li> It also gives you fresh breath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably just spend $300-500 to get it done right.  </li>
            <li> The stick right to your teeth.</li>
            <li> They adhere to your teeth right away.  </li>
            <li> The price was definitely right on these.</li>
            <li> it comes right off.</li>
            <li> Listerine Strips melt right on the teeth and whiten in minutes*****No</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very easy to use, dissolve with some residue left</li>
            <li> First 1 in 3 strips don&#x27;t come out of the package right.  </li>
            <li> I tried Listerine Quick Dissolving Whitening Strips and found they worked really well.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply with dry fingers, and they are fairly comfortable.</li>
            <li> My daughter suggested teeth whitening from the dentist, but I thought I would try something over-the-counter first.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what the final results will be, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve gotten in just 3 days.</li>
            <li> However I was very dissatisfied with how not-so-quickly they dissolve in your mouth!</li>
            <li> Try creative writing 101 at your local community college.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i&#x27;ve been moved to write a comment on amazon</li>
            <li> I have tried many white strip products and none compare to these.</li>
            <li> The cleaning material is only on one side of the strip, so make sure you align the notch correctly when applying the strip.    </li>
            <li> Or, more likely, did they work so well that Crest threatened Listerine and bought them out?  </li>
            <li> I did break the first strip getting it out of the package as they stick to the sides of the package.  </li>
            <li> The first couple also got stuck to the side of my lower lip</li>
            <li> As someone who drinks too much coffee, and has more yellow stains on my teeth then I care to admit, I decided to give these strips a try.</li>
            <li> However I could not get most of these applied properly to see the desired effects of the product as a whole.</li>
            <li> They last for a long time 2-3 month&#x27;s, and i alway&#x27;s have a white beautiful smile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive products and these are the best value around.</li>
            <li> -Individually wrapped, easy to apply and don&#x27;t fall off.  </li>
            <li> The strips are individually wrapped, and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> As for putting on your teeth, as the instructions say, make sure your hands are dry.</li>
            <li> So the most powerful Crest strips do as much as the least powerful Crest strips, and THOSE do almost nothing!</li>
            <li> I have used many different types of Whitening strips in the past and when I saw the packaging that these ones dissolve on their own</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use, and fast acting</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Listerine touch up pen with no problem and find the Crest strips to work quite well, but I can&#x27;t keep these on as there is NO minty taste, just a very strong sour chemical taste.</li>
            <li> The cheaper crest whitestrips don&#x27;t stay on your teeth very well either.</li>
            <li> Alot of people wonder how well or fast they work as compared to the Crest version.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really figured anything out for how to prevent or reduce the strips from sticking to my fingers.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t really say.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience that much pain either.</li>
            <li> I hope these strips would really whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> They do absolutely nothing and the company jacks up the price with no visible difference between dosages (</li>
            <li> It worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> (and i suspect first two reviews written by Pfizer new product relations/marketing.  </li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, though not completely dissolving.</li>
            <li> My wife was the first to notice how white my teeth were after the very first week of using this product.</li>
            <li> This product is the best to remove cigarette yellow stains from teeth - too bad it is no longer available on market.</li>
            <li> pretty well so far.      </li>
            <li> I was a smoker for 15 years and drink a lot of coffee and diet colas, so I have had a decent amount of staining on my teeth.</li>
            <li> teeth aren&#x27;t super yellow</li>
            <li> They do not make your teeth sensitive and they really do whiten them.  </li>
            <li> I sent for a box of Listerine Strips and most of them were dried up.</li>
            <li> I have wasted so many just trying to avoid the thing sticking to my lower lips, fingers, etc.</li>
            <li> In the few cases that I was able to get them to stick to my teeth I could see a whitening effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read and seen that many people have trouble using opening and putting the strip on their teeth.</li>
            <li> Now that I have to use another brand my teeth just are not as white and my teeth are super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have tried Rembrant whitening strips which are similar but less effective.</li>
            <li> They are fast to dissolve and leave no mess.</li>
            <li> I have pretty high standards as I&#x27;ve been whitening my teeth for ten years.  </li>
            <li> I could also live with the price.  </li>
            <li> They are gentle enough for me to finish a whole box</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> The generic Rite Aid brand is the same of this stuff, so it takes FOREVER if you actually want to see results (but the form-fitting blue treys are nice).  </li>
            <li> strip are a huge improvement over the previous strips I tried.</li>
            <li> the only positive I have is that they taste like mint, but so does chewing gum.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re OK on the gums, but if you get a little bit on your fingertips, it&#x27;ll feel like a million tiny pin</li>
            <li> I bought the 56-pack of Listerine Whitening strips and have used 42 of them so far.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the ONE AND ONLY product that worked!!!  </li>
            <li> do it professionally..</li>
            <li> Being a college student and not having much money, I saved up enough money to buy the cheapest whitening product at my drugstore (this) and was dissapointed in the results.</li>
            <li> However, they make my teeth really sensitive</li>
            <li> otherwise my teeth get to sensitive to eat and they ache.</li>
            <li> If you tear the package down the long side and then put your finger in to widen the ends of the pocket where the strip is situated you should be able to retrieve it in one piece.  </li>
            <li> While they taste great and make your breath fresh, I was overall disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well they whiten because I&#x27;m not sure if I want to purchase enough to be able to follow the directions after my experience.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other whitening product to compare these too, so maybe they are actually better than the other brands.</li>
            <li> The main question is did they actually work?</li>
            <li> My teeth were super white(I used to get compliments all the time), the price was under $20 for a 56 count box, I never felt tooth sensitivity, &amp; they dissolved on your teeth in about a half an hour.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why this was ever discontinued, but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s back (at least on Amazon--still not seeing it at CVS).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do use the Crest Vivid tooth paste with my Oral-B Triumph power tooth brush on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> They feel a bit icky while they are dissolving but after 15 minutes I cleaned my teeth again and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Once you develop the knack for getting these strips out of the package (peel down far when opening), they are easy to apply, &amp; you can use one strip for both upper &amp; lower teeth, holding your teeth closed for 10 or 15 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try Crest 3D White Professional Effects</li>
            <li> I have tried Crest White Strips and home kits of professional bleaching gel.  </li>
            <li> The only con for this product is that, each night, when I place them before bedtime, they will not dissolve completely.</li>
            <li> Amazon was the only place I found it, but I was surprised by the inflated pricing.  </li>
            <li> I have used the professional strength whitening trays and gel from my dentist for the last 12 years.  </li>
            <li> I guess if you consider having gobs of gunk on top of as well as behind your teeth \\&quot;dissolved\\&quot;, then you&#x27;re in luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was too much fuss finding the right sides of strips, positioning them on teeth, and to make the matter worse, they did not dissolve completely.</li>
            <li> I will try Crest Professional Effects White Strips next</li>
            <li> The first time I bought these I thought some of the little packages didn&#x27;t have anything in them.  </li>
            <li> The other main issue I came across while trying to apply these is that the strip will stick to my lip (inside and/or outside) and not my teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, the whitening itself didn&#x27;t really seem noticeable as it typically does with the standard white strips.  </li>
            <li> Listerine Strips do not stay long enough nor do they have enough whitener in them to be of any help.</li>
            <li> I felt it worked just as well as Crest, if not better, and was much easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> I saw instant results that lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> So far I can see a little difference in my teeth, but the thing is my teeth were not \\&quot;yellow yellow\\</li>
            <li> some people think theyre hard to put on, but i dont have an issue with that....just always do the bottom first and try to have dry teeth when you do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually whitens your teeth as I can only really get it to stay on my teeth about half the times.</li>
            <li> I used the strips for two days and so far I think my teeth get whiten just a little.</li>
            <li> I used these strips as directed for two weeks and only noticed minimal improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, I found that they do not completely dissolve.</li>
            <li> Open your mouth as wide as you can and put it on.    </li>
            <li> I brushed my teeth before each treatment, but still achieved only slight whitening results after 28 days of use.  </li>
            <li> It only stung my teeth once for half a second</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is due to bleaching my teeth for so long, or if it from drinking Diet Coke then brushing my teeth -too much acid maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, again, I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other products, but what I can say is that I&#x27;ve only used them for three days</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews on the product and others have similar sentiments.</li>
            <li> anywhere there is a somewhat dry area that substance seems to attach to and it is diffiuclt to remove.  </li>
            <li> This product did not live up to it&#x27;s claims.  </li>
            <li> For me personally, it was not worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> It is not suitable for some people like me with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit and in the process you&#x27;re left with a pasty-dry-sticky feeling on your teeth and tongue.</li>
            <li> Could be a little stronger, after finishing the box teeth are still not as white as I would like.</li>
            <li> I even started with just the upper teeth to make a comparison between the two and found that there was little to no difference.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They can burn gums so be careful to \\&quot;outline\\&quot; your teeth after applying a strip.</li>
            <li> Follow the opening instructions carefully and then look closely to see the strips themselves.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only been a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of this product because most of the packets were either empty or the strip was so badly stuck to the foil that I couldn&#x27;t remove it without destroying it.</li>
            <li> I have used whitening products in the past but not for several years.</li>
            <li> and I have only used them for two days, and I&#x27;m a heavy coffee/tea drinker!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if they dissolve slower with age, but the instructions do say that you can brush your teeth after ten minutes of use.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed not to be able to find this product anywhere.</li>
            <li> I use one about every other day.  </li>
            <li> needless top and bottom teeth packaging, have to read instructions each time, ends up sticking to gums anyway, tastes horrible, kids love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hydrogen peroxide contents of these are, but initially I did have some of the associated tooth/gum pain.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m losing out on the entire whitening power because it usually dissolves oddly</li>
            <li> This product is so hard to put on your teeth, and almost instantly slips off and sticks together like a piece of tape.</li>
            <li> As for the negative remarks about this product, thank you Proctor and Gamble employees for being so obvious.</li>
            <li> They dissolve in a few minutes, making them easier to deal with then some of the other strips which stay on for 30 minutes and then have to be removed.</li>
            <li> but they have always been slightly cream colored, so</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in about a week and a half after using this product.</li>
            <li> All I did are using the scissors to cut it off and ripping the package in half to the side and voila, it&#x27;s there for you to take.</li>
            <li> They either stick to my fingers or to my lip, and end up in a balled up mess.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I just wanted them to be a little whiter.  </li>
            <li> And I have felt little to no sensitivity.</li>
            <li> So I stopped treatment, and did the treatment a little slower.</li>
            <li> Secondly, for me it was near impossible to get any strips to get in my mouth without the strip grabbing on to another part of my mouth, lip, etc.</li>
            <li> I was not very impressed by the Listerine white strips.</li>
            <li> might waste a couple of the strips while you learn how to apply them.</li>
            <li> For $17 you get 2wks supply that gradually whitens your teeth a few shades.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a heavy coffee drinker before this, so</li>
            <li> My husband says that after a few days, he can see my teeth getting whiter.</li>
            <li> I tried to brush them off after a few minutes, but it was like glue...</li>
            <li> After the first time I used these strips, I got annoying, dull pain deep in my teeth for longer than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> noticeable results after just a few days  minty taste as opposed to the usual bleachy taste  </li>
            <li> I usually whiten my teeth at least once a year, or even sometimes twice, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few whitening products.</li>
            <li> So sad to see such a status.</li>
            <li> I have been using these strips twice a year for the past two years.  </li>
            <li> I used to be lazy when it came to caring for my teeth.</li>
            <li> These things are hard to get on my lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> All you have to do is apply and not eat or drink anything for a half-hour to an hour while they work and slowly dissolve.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years but then was unable to find it.</li>
            <li> In about 35% of the tries of applying these to my teeth the strip will stick to either my lip or fingers or both so bad that the strip is ruined.</li>
            <li> -Some of the packages can be annoying to open.    </li>
            <li> It felt like pain associated with a cavity, but worse.</li>
            <li> But given the fact that these strips are around half the cost of some others, it wasn&#x27;t a bad deal.</li>
            <li> My teeth became sensitive and I felt miserable because of the pain.     </li>
            <li> lousy product...</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t vouch for the effectiveness of Crest Whitestrips because they&#x27;re just too difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m afraid i won&#x27;t even get to the chance of trying this for 2 weeks to even see if it works becuase</li>
            <li> As I said, my teeth were in bad shape to begin with, so</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t cause pain and the taste wasn&#x27;t too bad, although I wouldn&#x27;t agree that it freshens breath.  </li>
            <li> Extremely frustrated.</li>
            <li> plus is that whitestrips make my teeth painfully sensitive....but not these.</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> FML :((</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so unhappy they are not on the market any longer!  </li>
            <li> my teeth just had some yellowish-ness around the base of the teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth have seen the worst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is the worst whitening product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that the product has been discontinued, but have managed to stockpile a supply!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was worried about the whitening hurting my gums, making them sensative as lots of people said these products do. This product was easy to use, and fast acting and Im pleased to say I haven&#x27;t had any side effects with it. They are fast to dissolve and leave no mess. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 and have never used any type of whitening on my teeth. I am a coffee and soda drinker, and smoked up until 8 years ago. My teeth have seen the worst. My daughter suggested teeth whitening from the dentist, but I thought I would try something over-the-counter first. I scoured the internet for all the reviews on different products and I settled on this. Now, again, I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other products, but what I can say is that I&#x27;ve only used them for three days and I look in the mirror and see teeth I don&#x27;t even recognize. As I said, my teeth were in bad shape to begin with, so I don&#x27;t know if one would see such great results if they were young and had good dentition. But I&#x27;m so happy with this, I&#x27;ve come back for more. Don&#x27;t know what the final results will be, but I&#x27;m satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve gotten in just 3 days.</li>
            <li> I was a smoker for 15 years and drink a lot of coffee and diet colas, so I have had a decent amount of staining on my teeth. I have used whitening products in the past but not for several years. I bought the 56-pack of Listerine Whitening strips and have used 42 of them so far. All I can say is WOW! These have already made my teeth noticeably whiter. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the end result will be. Presently, my teeth look like those of someone who never smoked. It&#x27;s fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might waste a couple of the strips while you learn how to apply them. I kept getting them stuck on my lower lip as I applied the lower strip. It just takes practice. Also, to reiterate what a lot of others have said, pay attention to the orientation of the strip. There&#x27;s a picture on the back of every pouch. Make sure you&#x27;re putting them in correctly.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find this Listerine product on Amazon. I have been using it for a few years but then was unable to find it. I had tried many stores and pharmacies in San Diego and could not find it anywhere. I ordered and received the product when it was promised. Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li> Once you develop the knack for getting these strips out of the package (peel down far when opening), they are easy to apply, &amp; you can use one strip for both upper &amp; lower teeth, holding your teeth closed for 10 or 15 seconds.  I brushed my teeth before each treatment, but still achieved only slight whitening results after 28 days of use.  I am going to try Crest 3D White Professional Effects instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3D White Whitestrips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]]</li>
            <li> Extremely frustrated. I have thrown away most of the box of strips.  They either stick to my fingers or to my lip, and end up in a balled up mess.  Probably for every one I have applied, I have thrown away 4.</li>
            <li> Pros:   noticeable results after just a few days  minty taste as opposed to the usual bleachy taste  dissolves in your mouth - no messy strips to take out  good price    I have tried Crest White Strips and home kits of professional bleaching gel.  This is right up there with them!      I&#x27;m trying to think of some cons but can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Review after one using these strips for one week:&lt;br /&gt;- my teeth are definitely whiter&lt;br /&gt;- very easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;- they stick perfectly&lt;br /&gt;- they taste good as they dissolve (mint flavor)&lt;br /&gt;- the gum of one of my canine teeth is irritated for about one minute when I overlay the strip on top of it. I can prevent the gum irritation if I avoid overlaying the strip by chipping a corner of the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strip are a huge improvement over the previous strips I tried. I will use them twice a year for teeth maintenance.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of this product because most of the packets were either empty or the strip was so badly stuck to the foil that I couldn&#x27;t remove it without destroying it. The strips that I was able to salvage were fairly easy to apply and dissolved quickly.  They didn&#x27;t cause pain and the taste wasn&#x27;t too bad, although I wouldn&#x27;t agree that it freshens breath.  I don&#x27;t know how well they whiten because I&#x27;m not sure if I want to purchase enough to be able to follow the directions after my experience. I suppose it&#x27;s possible that I received a box that had been improperly stored.</li>
            <li> After the first time I used these strips, I got annoying, dull pain deep in my teeth for longer than 24 hours. My teeth became sensitive and I felt miserable because of the pain.     The only product I can use without any problem is CVS brand&#x27;s dissolving strips. They are gentle enough for me to finish a whole box and I can see the whitening effect. I just do not like its vanilla mint taste...but I should stick with it.    I cannot say if this Listerine whitening strip works or not because I used it only once. It is not suitable for some people like me with sensitive teeth. I am too traumatized by the pain to use the remaining strips. Such a waste of money. It was too much fuss finding the right sides of strips, positioning them on teeth, and to make the matter worse, they did not dissolve completely. I had to use toothbrush to get the sticky gunk off my teeth.</li>
            <li> These are very cheap and very effective white strips! They have made my teeth whiter and I have only used them for two days, and I&#x27;m a heavy coffee/tea drinker! They are easy to apply with dry fingers, and they are fairly comfortable. The only con for this product is that, each night, when I place them before bedtime, they will not dissolve completely. Sometimes I will wake up in the middle of the night and there will still be gunk between my teeth from the strips!    I bought this product on clearance and I&#x27;m not sure if they dissolve slower with age, but the instructions do say that you can brush your teeth after ten minutes of use. Otherwise, they are just as effective as similar products, (Crest Whitestrips), but I would recommend brushing after the time is up!</li>
            <li> This product acts more as a stain remover and does make one&#x27;s teeth look shiny and clean, but doesn&#x27;t whiten much. My teeth got maybe 1 shade whiter, if even that. It is easy to use and does make for fresh breath!My teeth aren&#x27;t super yellow but they have always been slightly cream colored, so I was hoping these strips would work. They can burn gums so be careful to \\&quot;outline\\&quot; your teeth after applying a strip. They are handy for a clean mouth but not as a whitener.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using these for 2 weeks yet, I am at 6 days.  So far I can see a little difference in my teeth, but the thing is my teeth were not \\&quot;yellow yellow\\&quot; I just wanted them to be a little whiter.  Probably will work a lot better for someone who has more yellow teeth than whiter ones.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed not to be able to find this product anywhere. Even here, it&#x27;s still advertised, but not \\&quot;in stock.\\&quot;  What is going on?  This is absolutely the ONE AND ONLY product that worked!!!  Bring Listerine Strips back!  I refuse to spend $65-100.00 on ebay for them.  It&#x27;s highway robbery!  Does anyone know anything about this or where to find Listerine Strips? If so, please write and let me know: hawthornewood@embarqmail.com. Thank you! P.S. Beware strips sold on ebay.  I sent for a box of Listerine Strips and most of them were dried up.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be more convenient since you don&#x27;t have to take them out after a certain amount of time. However I was very dissatisfied with how not-so-quickly they dissolve in your mouth! It does take a little bit and in the process you&#x27;re left with a pasty-dry-sticky feeling on your teeth and tongue. I tried to use them a second time and could not get through it. I would much rather just leave something on my teeth and be able to take it off when it&#x27;s done working.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness it&#x27;s back. I&#x27;ve used this product for between two and three years and suddenly it was pulled from the shelves. Out of necessity I went to the Vanilla Mint CVS dissolving strip which turns into a global oral gel-blob within about a minute of application. Then I tried Rite-Aid&#x27;s version which I couldn&#x27;t get to peel off the paper backing and which would not stay on the teeth securely. Listerine blows them all away. It&#x27;s easy to apply, moderately effective (although dental trays are better than anything), good tasting, sweetens the breath, and only a little sticky-icky. As for the negative remarks about this product, thank you Proctor and Gamble employees for being so obvious. Try creative writing 101 at your local community college. But, I love Tide... so whatever.</li>
            <li> These are the very best. My teeth are sparkling white.  I use one about every other day.  You place them on your teeth and go on your way.  They disolve in about 10-15 minutes.  Love them!</li>
            <li> I really loved this product.  I felt it worked just as well as Crest, if not better, and was much easier to apply.  It also tasted much better and didn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt.  When I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore, I went to Listerine&#x27;s website.  They still show this product and claim you can get it from several stores/websites (Amazon being one of them).  Amazon was the only place I found it, but I was surprised by the inflated pricing.  I sent an email to Listerine, asking them, \\&quot;what&#x27;s up with this?\\&quot;  They responded that the product has been discontinued.  Oh well, now I&#x27;m going to try Colgate&#x27;s Optic White toothpaste - we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> in about a week i started seeing my teeth getting whiter. a bit tricky to use on the lower teeth though</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and I have tried many whitening products.  It also gives you fresh breath. Here is a trick for the cheap - use one strip for the top AND bottom. Just look in the mirror, smile with teeth touching and stick one on.  In about 10 seconds, open your mouth and youve got a strip on top and bottom.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve used these whitening strips and I have no complaints.  They do not make your teeth sensitive and they really do whiten them.  I did use these in combination with the Crest 3D whitening mouthwash as well and think that might have helped.</li>
            <li> These things are hard to get on my lower teeth.  I have wasted so many just trying to avoid the thing sticking to my lower lips, fingers, etc.</li>
            <li> Sticks to your fingers and doesn&#x27;t stick to your teeth. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually whitens your teeth as I can only really get it to stay on my teeth about half the times.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, though not completely dissolving. I felt like I had wax stuck inbetween my teeth after every session, and had to rebrush. Could be a little stronger, after finishing the box teeth are still not as white as I would like.</li>
            <li> lousy product...needless top and bottom teeth packaging, have to read instructions each time, ends up sticking to gums anyway, tastes horrible, kids love it</li>
            <li> This is the first time i&#x27;ve been moved to write a comment on amazon and i&#x27;ve been shopping here for 5 years.   First 1 in 3 strips don&#x27;t come out of the package right.  Secondly, for me it was near impossible to get any strips to get in my mouth without the strip grabbing on to another part of my mouth, lip, etc. while it starts to dissolve.  this would have made a good comedy but i&#x27;m afraid i won&#x27;t even get to the chance of trying this for 2 weeks to even see if it works becuase the application is HORRENDOUS!!!!  Save your money..do it professionally..I&#x27;ll probably just spend $300-500 to get it done right.  This is a bogus product.  (and i suspect first two reviews written by Pfizer new product relations/marketing.  Booooooooh.</li>
            <li> The whitening stripes that I decided to get from listerine are these quixk dissolving strips.  Since I didn&#x27;t see it in the reviews I am going to mention about the stickynesss that it leaves on the creases of your mouth.  anywhere there is a somewhat dry area that substance seems to attach to and it is diffiuclt to remove.  So no I do not think it is a thing you put on your mouth and go out to dinner with.  Definately not you need to brush your mouth out before feeling comfortable after using these.  For whitening it gets 2/5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried crest whitestrips, crest whitestrips advanced seal, off brand styrofoam stuff that goes around your teeth with whitener, plastic things that you mold around your teeth and you pour the whitener into it, and Listerine whitening quick dissolving strips.    This product is so hard to put on your teeth, and almost instantly slips off and sticks together like a piece of tape. And when it becomes all bunched up, it takes forever to dissolve and I have to just spit it out.    I&#x27;d say this is the worst whitening product I have ever used. The cheaper crest whitestrips don&#x27;t stay on your teeth very well either.I like the kinds with the styrofoam guards that go over your teeth, and the crest whitestrips with the advanced seal.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time using these strips and yes they do work. For $17 you get 2wks supply that gradually whitens your teeth a few shades. I wanted to try the Crest version but I do not want to pay $40 for them so I stuck with this brand. I do use the Crest Vivid tooth paste with my Oral-B Triumph power tooth brush on a daily basis. The combination with the two products are great. I will continue to use whitening strips every 2-4 months. My wife was the first to notice how white my teeth were after the very first week of using this product. Alot of people wonder how well or fast they work as compared to the Crest version. If I get the courage to pay the extra $20, I try the Crest version and hit you with a review.</li>
            <li> I used these strips as directed for two weeks and only noticed minimal improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. For me personally, it was not worth the price I paid. While they taste great and make your breath fresh, I was overall disappointed. I have not tried any other whitening product to compare these too, so maybe they are actually better than the other brands.</li>
            <li> As someone who drinks too much coffee, and has more yellow stains on my teeth then I care to admit, I decided to give these strips a try. First of all, they are EASY to put on. The stick right to your teeth. They taste fresh and minty, which was pleasant. They dissolve in a few minutes, making them easier to deal with then some of the other strips which stay on for 30 minutes and then have to be removed. I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity to my teeth, something I did experience with the Crest whiteners. The main question is did they actually work? The answer is they worked OK, but not as well as I would like. I did notice a difference, and my teeth were definitely whiter then when I started. Ideally, though, I would have liked even more white. But given the fact that these strips are around half the cost of some others, it wasn&#x27;t a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed by this product. The \\&quot;dissolving\\&quot; strips never truly dissolve, and rather leave a sticky film on your teeth. After every use I had to brush my teeth. Also, the whitening itself didn&#x27;t really seem noticeable as it typically does with the standard white strips.  Overall the only positive I have is that they taste like mint, but so does chewing gum.  Stick with the regular whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and these work great!</li>
            <li> This does a slightly good job whitening your teeth, but the dissolving strips doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. I usually whiten my teeth at least once a year, or even sometimes twice, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few whitening products. I would say the dissolving strips are quite a hassle to remove because not the entire strip dissolves equally. I feel like I&#x27;m losing out on the entire whitening power because it usually dissolves oddly and I tend to lick it off. I would prefer using the strips where you remove them yourselves. The $15 non-dissolving whitening strips by Listerine, Crest, and Equate actually do a very good job, considering the price. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but they have worked pretty well for me in the past.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why this was ever discontinued, but I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s back (at least on Amazon--still not seeing it at CVS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t vouch for the effectiveness of Crest Whitestrips because they&#x27;re just too difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;1. They won&#x27;t stick to your teeth.  Unless you take a Shopvac to your mouth and suck out all the water molecules, they&#x27;ll just slide around.&lt;br /&gt;2. They&#x27;re OK on the gums, but if you get a little bit on your fingertips, it&#x27;ll feel like a million tiny pin pricks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no such complaints when it comes to Listerine Whitening.  They adhere to your teeth right away.  The dissolving isn&#x27;t perfect, but just a couple of strokes of the toothbrush will clear any remaining bits here and there.  And they really do freshen your mouth, better than mouthwash, even.</li>
            <li> I have used many different types of Whitening strips in the past and when I saw the packaging that these ones dissolve on their own I thought it was about time someone came up with these. Well, I was wrong. Although the idea is a great one, in reality it doesn&#x27;t quite work so well. The problem I found while using these is I cannot get them to stick to my teeth. In most cases the strip will stick to my fingers when trying to get them to stick to my teeth when I pull my fingers away from my teeth part of the strip comes with it and then the strip tears and no longer sticks to my teeth. The other main issue I came across while trying to apply these is that the strip will stick to my lip (inside and/or outside) and not my teeth. In about 35% of the tries of applying these to my teeth the strip will stick to either my lip or fingers or both so bad that the strip is ruined. In the few cases that I was able to get them to stick to my teeth I could see a whitening effect. However I could not get most of these applied properly to see the desired effects of the product as a whole. Also, I found that they do not completely dissolve. In the cases where I could get them to stick to my teeth after about 10 or 15 minutes I would need to brush my teeth to get some of the remaining strip off my teeth. If you do decide to tries these, the most effective way I found to get these to stick to my teeth was to lick the strip first making it kind of sticky and then licking the inside and outside of the lip to minimize the strip from sticking to my lip. I haven&#x27;t really figured anything out for how to prevent or reduce the strips from sticking to my fingers.</li>
            <li> I was not very impressed by the Listerine white strips. Being a college student and not having much money, I saved up enough money to buy the cheapest whitening product at my drugstore (this) and was dissapointed in the results. I don&#x27;t have damaged or yellow teeth, so maybe it would work for those with stains/discoloration, but I didn&#x27;t see any actual whitening at all. I even started with just the upper teeth to make a comparison between the two and found that there was little to no difference. I would not reccomend this product. Buy something that is not in strip form so that it will get the discoloration between your teeth instead of just the front area.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought these I thought some of the little packages didn&#x27;t have anything in them.  Follow the opening instructions carefully and then look closely to see the strips themselves.  Then take special care when attaching the strips to your teeth.  The good news is they work!  And your breath is noticeably fresher afterwards.  Perhaps the best thing is that you can talk without impediment while they&#x27;re dissolving.  Amazon&#x27;s price is excellent; on sale they&#x27;re usually $19.99 at Walgreen&#x27;s or Target -- plus tax!  I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive products and these are the best value around.</li>
            <li> theyre ok. they&#x27;re cheaper than the crest white strips for a reason, they dont work as well, but they do work. one plus is that whitestrips make my teeth painfully sensitive....but not these. some people think theyre hard to put on, but i dont have an issue with that....just always do the bottom first and try to have dry teeth when you do.</li>
            <li> I have used the professional strength whitening trays and gel from my dentist for the last 12 years.  However, they make my teeth really sensitive and I don&#x27;t have the tolerance for it anymore.  I also have some enamel loss - you know, where you can sort of see through your tooth? I am not sure if this is due to bleaching my teeth for so long, or if it from drinking Diet Coke then brushing my teeth -too much acid maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I was looking for something more gentle and convenient.  The price was definitely right on these. I see why now..they don&#x27;t work! The description makes it sound like the strips magically \\&quot;dissolve\\&quot; on your teeth...I guess if you consider having gobs of gunk on top of as well as behind your teeth \\&quot;dissolved\\&quot;, then you&#x27;re in luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, they do freshen up your mouth pretty nice. I have to remove the gobs of gunk then I brush afterward. And I have felt little to no sensitivity. Also, they are easier to apply than the Crest whitestrips, and you can bend/break or cut them up to a size that best fits your teeth/desired bleaching area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use them, maybe the will have a cumulative effect. Heaven knows I have a huge supply of them!</li>
            <li> Love these strips, just wish I could find them in stores!!  They&#x27;re very easy to use, dissolve with some residue left but I just floss or rinse &amp; it comes right off.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap easy way to whiten your teeth at home. I saw instant results that lasted for a long time. I have purchased these twice. They last for a long time 2-3 month&#x27;s, and i alway&#x27;s have a white beautiful smile.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in about a week and a half after using this product. I def. Recommend, great price too! And it didnt hurt my teeth like crest did</li>
            <li> I have tried many white strip products and none compare to these. Listerine&#x27;s strips were the BEST strips on the market, why in the world did they get discontinued??? My teeth were super white(I used to get compliments all the time), the price was under $20 for a 56 count box, I never felt tooth sensitivity, &amp; they dissolved on your teeth in about a half an hour. I would apply them just before getting into the shower and then brush my teeth after about 30mins of wearing them. Now that I have to use another brand my teeth just are not as white and my teeth are super sensitive. FML :((</li>
            <li> Pros:    -Comes with 56 strips.  -Individually wrapped, easy to apply and don&#x27;t fall off.  -Works pretty well so far.      Cons:    -Initially some tooth/gum related pain.  -Some of the packages can be annoying to open.    I decided to try the Listerine Whitening strips, since they looked like a tempting new product, plus they were more competitively priced. I&#x27;m not sure what the hydrogen peroxide contents of these are, but initially I did have some of the associated tooth/gum pain. It felt like pain associated with a cavity, but worse. So I stopped treatment, and did the treatment a little slower. The pain only happened once, and I&#x27;ve since upped the treatment back two twice a day without problems.    The strips are individually wrapped, and are easy to apply. Make sure you follow the directions though! The cleaning material is only on one side of the strip, so make sure you align the notch correctly when applying the strip.    You leave it on for about 10 minutes, and afterwards, brush off the excess. I wasn&#x27;t a heavy coffee drinker before this, so my teeth just had some yellowish-ness around the base of the teeth. Now, after just a week, my teeth look great in pictures, and upon examination in the mirror, the yellowish-ness is much reduced!    Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 2 weeks. Good thing there are plenty of extra strips included as well to continue the treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read and seen that many people have trouble using opening and putting the strip on their teeth. I didn&#x27;t have these problems. All I did are using the scissors to cut it off and ripping the package in half to the side and voila, it&#x27;s there for you to take. As for putting on your teeth, as the instructions say, make sure your hands are dry. Open your mouth as wide as you can and put it on.    I used the strips for two days and so far I think my teeth get whiten just a little. But it&#x27;s only two days so I couldn&#x27;t really say. I didn&#x27;t experience that much pain either. It only stung my teeth once for half a second and that&#x27;s it. I hope these strips would really whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> Listerine Strips melt right on the teeth and whiten in minutes*****No more bleaching with trays for 1 hour, just apply to teeth they melt into the teeth like a mint, no rinsing just drive away and your teeth are White*****Better than gels, and no mess****You can even use them AT WORK*****</li>
            <li> These were the best whitening strips I have ever used. No fuss. They stayed on well, they whitened super easy and great. I have pretty high standards as I&#x27;ve been whitening my teeth for ten years.  Where did they go? Did someone die after using these or something? Or, more likely, did they work so well that Crest threatened Listerine and bought them out?  I have tried Crest whitening strips on those flimsy plastic sheets. They do absolutely nothing and the company jacks up the price with no visible difference between dosages (no matter what the box advertises!). So the most powerful Crest strips do as much as the least powerful Crest strips, and THOSE do almost nothing! The generic Rite Aid brand is the same of this stuff, so it takes FOREVER if you actually want to see results (but the form-fitting blue treys are nice).  So sad to see such a status. Listerine, please bring these back!</li>
            <li> I tried Listerine Quick Dissolving Whitening Strips and found they worked really well.  Even after using them for a week night and morning, I could see the difference.  I could also live with the price.  They feel a bit icky while they are dissolving but after 15 minutes I cleaned my teeth again and it was fine. (I also cleaned my teeth before applying the strips).  I did break the first strip getting it out of the package as they stick to the sides of the package.  The first couple also got stuck to the side of my lower lip but I soon got the hang of it.  If you tear the package down the long side and then put your finger in to widen the ends of the pocket where the strip is situated you should be able to retrieve it in one piece.  All in all, a great product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the flavor and I love that is dissolves.  My teeeth KIND OF look whiter..but it&#x27;s only been a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using these strips twice a year for the past two years.  I have tried others, but these work the best for me.  My husband says that after a few days, he can see my teeth getting whiter.</li>
            <li> This product is the best to remove cigarette yellow stains from teeth - too bad it is no longer available on market.</li>
            <li> The taste of these strips is unbearable!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Listerine touch up pen with no problem and find the Crest strips to work quite well, but I can&#x27;t keep these on as there is NO minty taste, just a very strong sour chemical taste. I tried to brush them off after a few minutes, but it was like glue...</li>
            <li> I like the listerine whitening strips. I use once or twice a week otherwise my teeth get to sensitive to eat and they ache. But they do whiten my teeth!</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to it&#x27;s claims.  I saw no whitening results. I have read other reviews on the product and others have similar sentiments. I will try Crest Professional Effects White Strips next, I have read a lot of possitive reviews of their product.  Listerine Strips do not stay long enough nor do they have enough whitener in them to be of any help.</li>
            <li> Despite what other users have written, I think this product is perfect. Not only is it relatively inexpensive, it is also the easiest to use tooth whitener I&#x27;ve found. All you have to do is apply and not eat or drink anything for a half-hour to an hour while they work and slowly dissolve. I am very disappointed that the product has been discontinued, but have managed to stockpile a supply!</li>
            <li> I picked these strips up from WalMart every month or two.  They worked excellently!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so unhappy they are not on the market any longer!  Really!!&lt;br /&gt;Taste is good.  Dissolving is good. Teeth whiter with each use.</li>
            <li> They take forever to dissolve, but they do whiten.</li>
            <li> I wish they did not stop making this product. It worked really well for me. I have tried Rembrant whitening strips which are similar but less effective.</li>
            <li> OMG this product is awesome. For years I have been looking for a product to whiten my teeth. I used to be lazy when it came to caring for my teeth. Since buying this, I have gotten into a habit of putting the strips on and brushing my teeth. IT REALLY WHITENS!! My parents even noticed! Its so easy! And I took the advice of another reviewer and used one for both top and bottom. I only use the product once a day though. Still looks good and I have plenty to last. As for people feeling sensitivity in their gums, I have no idea why. I&#x27;m just fine. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
