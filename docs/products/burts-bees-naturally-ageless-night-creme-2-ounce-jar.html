    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for the night.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin!</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with the BB ageless eye creme, and am very happy with both products.</li>
            <li>One of the best &amp;#34;go Bert&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Ageless Night Creme for about 3 years, and it WAS the best night creme I had used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>Wonderful night creme!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent night cream.</li>
            <li>a good moisturizer, great for the winter!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also greatly reduced the break outs that I get.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great night cream.</li>
            <li>It is a great product for my skin (olive toned, combination type).</li>
            <li>The price is great, but my skin did not think so.</li>
            <li>This product feels great when you put it on.</li>
            <li>After using both products, I have noticed a great difference in the softness of my skin and firmness.</li>
            <li>Would probably be great for any skin type.</li>
            <li>This is a great cream.</li>
            <li>This one had great reviews at another website so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product because it absorbs, it works and it has ingredients we can feel good about using on our skin.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about a great product that works!</li>
            <li>This smells really good and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li>Well, this is a pleasant shopping.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have always loved and trusted Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>While it smells good, it feels greasy..</li>
            <li>I have become a skeptic of this brand ever since it was bought out by Clorox, and now I see that this was with good reason.    </li>
            <li>Nice smell, feels great on skin - moisturizing but not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>i mistakingly wrote a good reveiw for this seller thinking it was another seller who sent me the correct product</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; make really good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a good complexion.</li>
            <li>I use this with a Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Serum and they work good together.  </li>
            <li>good stuff, good price.</li>
            <li>so I need a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absorbs quickly and moisturizes perfectly.  </li>
            <li>this product is so good to my face, I love it!</li>
            <li>Nice and creamy, settles in fast, smells great, and my face looks wonderful in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about six weeks now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>In the winter, that is especially important and I make sure to apply some sort of night cream every night.</li>
            <li>This creme spreads on nicely, smells good and appears to moisturize my skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and would recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this change!  </li>
            <li>Will not hesitate to order more of this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this night cream!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This night cream has a nice smell, texture and has a light-feeling after you apply it.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I think the thing I am most impressed with is when I used this cream to treat a fresh burn mark.</li>
            <li>Nice feel.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>Although I liked that one as well (and the scent was nicer), it didn&#x27;t work as well  as the Pomegranate Night Cream and my face began to flare up again.</li>
            <li>What I liked:  </li>
            <li>they come in handy and look nice for reuse.  </li>
            <li>In the winter though, it worked nicely, but it clogged my pores and I broke out a lot.  </li>
            <li>I was going through all those good hormone changes yet again and my face became much more oily, and along with that oil, came breakouts too so once again</li>
            <li>and it did not smell as nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been loving the Ageless serum and thought I&#x27;d try the cream as well.</li>
            <li>With antioxidants, it helps to heal my sun exposed skin and absorbs nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have even noticed a nice glow to my skin when I wake up in the morning - and it lasts through the day.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Night creme is the best.  </li>
            <li>I use all of Burt&#x27;s Bee products it seems to work the best for me, and I like it because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>the price, this product is a great moisturizer and from a great company that does not test on animals and uses more natural, safer ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>There is nothing more worthy than buy their favorite things people happy.</li>
            <li>I like a very light scent and this is stronger than I prefer.  </li>
            <li>Very safe, and natural, and just make great products.</li>
            <li>It helps in making the face more radiant as well as helping with anti-aging.</li>
            <li>I saw this recommended in many places</li>
            <li>It works fast, smells great</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This cream is replacing my Oil of Olay night cream which  I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>as much as i love burt&#x27;s products, this one might should be skipped</li>
            <li>I doubt most people would consider that a problem, however.</li>
            <li>Love this night lotion</li>
            <li>(although it&#x27;s not part of the NA line) and love it.  </li>
            <li>Most of all, I am saddened to discover that a product I have grown to love no longer seems to exist, without warning.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>This is my second jar of this wonderful face cream!</li>
            <li>The product is great and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees Ageless night cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Just love the Burt&#x27;s Bees line of products.</li>
            <li>Have used it for more than 2 years now.</li>
            <li>All I can say now is that I love my skin again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this is thicker and creamer than anything I&#x27;ve used before, it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li>cream feels very soothing, refreshing and smells great.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>My skin fares significantly better in more humid areas of the country to the point</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on okay</li>
            <li>I REALLY love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>LOVE this cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love their lip balm, so I thought I would try this night cream.</li>
            <li>I was glad I could return it and did so.</li>
            <li>So Cal, I need a bit more moisturizer than this product.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this line.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fresh and creamy, and the smell is just so good (and I&#x27;m a person who prefers products without perfume).  </li>
            <li>Its for my girl,I think she will love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>so I felt like it was time to start caring more for my face/neck skin to prevent premature aging.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees and this is another one of their great products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost completely natural, smells great, feels wonderful on my skin and gets absorbed completely without any residue.  </li>
            <li>All three of us are pleased with the results in skin tone and fine lines.</li>
            <li>:) It is thick and wonderful and smells nice and fruity to me.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and herbal which is nice.  </li>
            <li>The whole ageless (pomegranate) line from BB smells SO good.</li>
            <li>This creme is a nice, medium-thick consistency, goes on smoothly, and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>rich and best for dry skin-- made my medium/combination skin greasy&lt;</li>
            <li>The Burt&#x27;s Bees products are far superior to the line I was using for so many years.  </li>
            <li>got this one after trying the Radiance night cream and being turned off by its strong fragrance and stickiness.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Radiance line of Burt&#x27;s Bees and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh scent and my face feels squeaky clean after using it.  </li>
            <li>But thats fine for a night cream, as i&#x27;m sleeping anyways.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect if it were slightly cheaper though.</li>
            <li>You can have great skin without the chemicals, and I will never go back.</li>
            <li>I can already tell a difference in the how smooth my face feels and looks.  </li>
            <li>it feels cheap.</li>
            <li>this is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I would not re-purchase and it has not dine anything to smooth any lines on my skin.</li>
            <li>so light and creamy</li>
            <li>I put it on before going to bed, and the next day my skin felt great.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re natural, and good value for the money.</li>
            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>It beats all the high cost products in all the stores and works even better because I&#x27;ve tried most.</li>
            <li>I am 45 and live in the dryness of Arizona and it has already made me look younger using this (and eliminating some stresses from my life -lol!)</li>
            <li>I thought that was quite impressive, as I don&#x27;t have large pores at all, but I do have better than perfect vision up close, and that usually allows me to see fine details of everyone&#x27;s face with the detail of a small magnifying glass.</li>
            <li>I believe the newest one is from 2012, which would have been a review of the original formula.    </li>
            <li>I love it and use the whole line!</li>
            <li>I found a better deal here on Amazon, but I would be willing to pay 24.99 if I had to.</li>
            <li>i used collagen hydrating cream from talgo for $62.00 for years, tried this one and not disappointed.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m using it and honestly I didn&#x27;t get the chance to notice the changes, but someting that I could not neglect is it smell.</li>
            <li>My mother has amazing skin without any wrinkles from starting an early age, so I thought it would be wise to follow in her footsteps.</li>
            <li>Really wish it had worked better on my face-</li>
            <li>Clean fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I expected this cream to be perfect for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Have noticed mild decrease in wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Super hydrating.</li>
            <li>Like others mentioned, the cream is absorbed fairly quickly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid forties and my skin has never felt better!  </li>
            <li>Despite the initial smell, this product is amazing and my skin is no longer peeling</li>
            <li>Anyway I love the results, including the unexpected one, from using this Burts Bees product.</li>
            <li>I totally makes me look younger, smells just faintly and just delightful, and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>Being 24 years old and having acne-prone skin, I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, facewashes, and night creams.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>I think the fragrance is really nice - very warm, fruity and reminiscent of a cozy house out in the country.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and goes on smoothly, but I have noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as moist when I get up as it did with my other cream.</li>
            <li>After I run out of this jar I will be trying Burt&#x27;s Bees other night creams that may moisturize my skin better and hopefully even smell better.</li>
            <li>The price nice, too, as so many more expensive creams do not work as well.</li>
            <li>Purchased this in couple of months ago and can tell a huge difference in fine lines and overall clarity of my skin!  </li>
            <li>will purchase again for certain!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and it diminishes my pores.</li>
            <li>I did not see any huge difference with my skin other than it being slightly more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually allergic to most fruits(pomegranate being one of them)</li>
            <li>I work at a restaurant and burned myself pretty well.</li>
            <li>This was such a welcomed surprise that this night creme prevented the scarring, I can not even express how pleased I am with this product.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have bought many items from Amazon; this time was totally unaccaptable!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really speak to the ageless claim since I am 24, but I am planning to continue using this line of skin care!</li>
            <li>Checked most of the ingredients - this product contains denatured alcohol which has a moderate hazard rating according to the cosmeticsdatabase.com website.  </li>
            <li>everything is different from the product that I know and love.</li>
            <li>It really does help tighten wrinkles!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY different products from drugstores, department stores, and even MK products, but nothing has had favorable long-term effects.</li>
            <li>That proves that you dont need those expensive products to attain the best results: It really is knockout of a product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d spent a lot of time researching making my own products when I stumbled across the Burt&#x27;s Bees line.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my skin felt like it lost years.  </li>
            <li>It feels so soft &amp; smooth, no greasy feeling, no drying out or stinging feeling.</li>
            <li>understand how the first product shipped got dammaged.</li>
            <li>No fake fragrance in this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this is has not caused any issues - light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t used this product consistently...</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my hands when they need an extra kick of moisture - love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the Burts Bees line, but I really dont like the way my skin looks when using this product especially in the morning</li>
            <li>I researched more natural products and found the Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless</li>
            <li>Light, quickly absorbed, natural, no bad smell, white birch bark is supposed to help against skin damage from the sun (I did a lot of research on this - you can look it up also on the internet...)</li>
            <li>One of the things I like most about it is that it lasts a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I chose this face cream because it has natural ingredients; it is gentle on the ageing skin; it is a competitive price; I use it as morning face cream too; it is better than the designer name brands for my face - far fewer chemicals.</li>
            <li>boyfriend who has more oily skin and HATES any remotely greasy or heavy moisturizer LOVED this.</li>
            <li>I like this night creme better than many I&#x27;ve tried, such as Elizabeth Arden, Peter Thomas Roth, other Burt&#x27;s Bees creams and some that I can&#x27;t remember.  </li>
            <li>Continued use has improved the overall condition of my skin a great deal, reducing pore size as well as dark spots.</li>
            <li>In the morning, my face feels smooth, not oily, not dry.  </li>
            <li>I wash with a soap with salicylic acid that keeps those great hormone breakouts down a bit, but this cream and the day cream has actually changed the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I opened it, it was not filled up to the top with night creme!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any skin tightening or slowing of aging, but I also currently don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, just fine lines.</li>
            <li>The cream is just an average cream but has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think that this cream will make a big difference in fine lines, but it will keep skin from drying out.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower or linger and the cream is very emollient and it stays on the face a little heavier than yes to carrots.</li>
            <li>Very thick and takes a while to sink into skin, but overall very happy with product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a night cream!</li>
            <li>It reminds me so much to the lipton tea smell.</li>
            <li>However, I am now getting used to it and can say it works really well.  </li>
            <li>Very sneaky, Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>fast shipping thank you.</li>
            <li>you can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin so soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need</li>
            <li>I can use as much of it as I want and it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
            <li>I generally really like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products, across the board.</li>
            <li>I see a real difference in how my face looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I really like how my skin feels after using this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell and consistency of this product.</li>
            <li>but this really irritates my eyes</li>
            <li>It might work for some people but it really hurts my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have used the eye cream from the same Naturally Ageless line and was much better without the string smell.</li>
            <li>Very moist, peak honey flavor, sweet smell, very suitable for winter, summer may not suitable for long-term use, do not know the future will not have effect.</li>
            <li>but I am sure that was due to the Xmas time of year.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t hurt any that it made my skin even softer than usual, and the product smells nice.    </li>
            <li>However, this is no longer true, because it is not the same product anymore.    </li>
            <li>It actually soaks in to my skin - it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top like many slimy thick creams.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the burn was healing great compared to other burns I previously had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than bad, it&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like my skin got any better or worse, but I really don&#x27;t enjoy the sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>one in particular I use at night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more expensive products and get a better result from this creme.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent moisturizer</li>
            <li>When you first put it on, it has a strong fragrance that dissipates within a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anything from their line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 yrs old now and even though my skin is not as oily as it used to be, I still have large pores.</li>
            <li>and after an application (usually immediately after shower or washing) my skin feels soft in most areas but the most dry areas like my cheeks and forehead</li>
            <li>I heard they really aren&#x27;t all natural like they claim</li>
            <li>I will say that I really like it thus far.  </li>
            <li>and they all left nice dark brown scars.</li>
            <li>Immediately after using this cream, my skin looked rather glowing compared to normal.</li>
            <li>I just received the BB NA Night Creme a few days ago and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I put this cream on the night of the burn because I figured it was more or less a natural product</li>
            <li>, my right eye actually swelled up a lot for two days, I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li>The new formula is not a product I would recommend.    </li>
            <li>I wanted to note that I live in the desert, and I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the cream can be very greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li>Creme seems to brighten and makes skin very soft by the morning.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit weird, but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li>I was so excited about finally getting away from all the chemicals used in facial products.</li>
            <li>first intention was to ship it back as soon as i recieved it, but decided that  these products are expesive so i ll keep them.</li>
            <li>The cap of the product broke, got leaking product , the box of the product is really old, and no expiration Date !</li>
            <li>Since I would love to be &amp;#34;Ageless&amp;#34; I decided to try this new line--at least new to me.  </li>
            <li>It seems they screen reviews and only publish positive ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and definitely see a positive improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I dab dots all over my face (using a total amount of about the size of my thumbnail), and then start gently rubbing it in starting from my neck up (as we learn that pulling down on our faces tends to stretch the skin more).</li>
            <li>: Never dilute beauty products in large quantities because you will also be diluting preservatives/antibacterial/antifungal additives, which could lead to really gross rancid products.</li>
            <li>* can be diluted with a little water just before using, to make a light airy cream that applies well and is not too oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I find dabbing a little more to those areas after the initial application.</li>
            <li>but my skin is clear and well-moisturized.</li>
            <li>The only real con I noticed is that the airbrushing effect makes me feel a bit teenaged looking.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I do like the Naturally Ageless.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and supple, and also improves imperfections when they occur.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Night Creme based on the reviews I read here on Amazon as well as on the company&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised to see Burt&#x27;s Bees products listed on Macy&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is classified among the Natural beauty products.  </li>
            <li>And another big bonus is that this night creme is much cheaper than anything else I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried department store as well as discount/drug store</li>
            <li>i swtiched to an all natural product with spf tho b/c</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Night Creme for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li>bees &#x3D; natural products.  </li>
            <li>I chose the Burt&#x27;s bees brand because it has some natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals or mineral oil (which is an ingredient I do NOT want going on my face).</li>
            <li>, I relied on the natural oils in my face to moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I slather on a finger-full of this cream and my face feels soft, supple and dewy.  </li>
            <li>No heavy residue afterwards.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin, look for another product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li>I will be using this as a day cream too because the Naturally Ageless Day Cream also contains denatured alcohol but also contains sodium borate, which has a moderate to high hazard rating.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed a subtle change in the freckles on the top of my cheek bones from sun exposure-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything for fine lines</li>
            <li>After experiencing breakouts with several products from high end lines, I have found the one</li>
            <li>I also liked the smell, and used this cream for a few months before I found something less greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an acne problem, but my skin tends to get so dry that it &#x27;flakes&#x27; off in certain areas of my face esp.</li>
            <li>It doesnt dry in my skin, so I go to sleep with this very oily sensation.</li>
            <li>I should begin this review by saying that my skin doesn&#x27;t actually show any signs of aging to begin with, but I decided to start early, as I would like to keep it that way.</li>
            <li>By the morning, it looked airbrushed, and I could barely find evidence of my pores.</li>
            <li>I studied the WHITE CAP container detailly, it has BB copyright 2010 WITHOUT skin firming, which means that is a 2010 old version.   </li>
            <li>I have contacted Customer Service in hopes for a replacement product (I&#x27;d like them to send me the old formula I thought I purchased), or if that is not possible, a refund.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly have dry skin, but  living in</li>
            <li>Loves Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this made my skin break out and after a 3 weeks its finally getting back to normal.</li>
            <li>The problem isn&#x27;t the cream, but that the top came broken.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may work well for those who don&#x27;t live in an extremely dry climate like I do.</li>
            <li>I found it a little too greasy for night use, but sparingly when I&#x27;m going to be home for a while, it really moisturizes!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for use by any age group- I am aged 60+</li>
            <li>I tried using this for a few weeks and at first I thought I had allergies</li>
            <li>Not for dry mature skin.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling slightly oily the next morning, and while it did moisturize very well, it was not suited to my skin type.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t waste it, I end up diluting it with pure Moroccan rosewater</li>
            <li>Very like this little bee, brought beauty to our family.</li>
            <li>My skin is also very sensitive  Every other moisturizer and night cream</li>
    </ol>

            <li> One of the best &amp;#34;go Bert&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Ageless Night Creme for about 3 years, and it WAS the best night creme I had used.  </li>

            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great night cream.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for my skin (olive toned, combination type).</li>
            <li> The price is great, but my skin did not think so.</li>
            <li> This product feels great when you put it on.</li>
            <li> After using both products, I have noticed a great difference in the softness of my skin and firmness.</li>

            <li> This is a great cream.</li>
            <li> This one had great reviews at another website so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product because it absorbs, it works and it has ingredients we can feel good about using on our skin.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about a great product that works!</li>
            <li> This smells really good and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> Well, this is a pleasant shopping.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have always loved and trusted Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> While it smells good, it feels greasy..</li>
            <li> I have become a skeptic of this brand ever since it was bought out by Clorox, and now I see that this was with good reason.    </li>
            <li> Nice smell, feels great on skin - moisturizing but not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> i mistakingly wrote a good reveiw for this seller thinking it was another seller who sent me the correct product</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; make really good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a good complexion.</li>
            <li> I use this with a Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Serum and they work good together.  </li>
            <li> good stuff, good price.</li>
            <li> so I need a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absorbs quickly and moisturizes perfectly.  </li>
            <li> this product is so good to my face, I love it!</li>
            <li> Nice and creamy, settles in fast, smells great, and my face looks wonderful in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about six weeks now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> In the winter, that is especially important and I make sure to apply some sort of night cream every night.</li>
            <li> This creme spreads on nicely, smells good and appears to moisturize my skin nicely.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made this change!  </li>
            <li> Will not hesitate to order more of this!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this night cream!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This night cream has a nice smell, texture and has a light-feeling after you apply it.</li>
            <li> It also smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I think the thing I am most impressed with is when I used this cream to treat a fresh burn mark.</li>
            <li> Nice feel.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> Although I liked that one as well (and the scent was nicer), it didn&#x27;t work as well  as the Pomegranate Night Cream and my face began to flare up again.</li>
            <li> What I liked:  </li>
            <li> they come in handy and look nice for reuse.  </li>
            <li> In the winter though, it worked nicely, but it clogged my pores and I broke out a lot.  </li>
            <li> I was going through all those good hormone changes yet again and my face became much more oily, and along with that oil, came breakouts too so once again</li>
            <li> and it did not smell as nice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving the Ageless serum and thought I&#x27;d try the cream as well.</li>
            <li> With antioxidants, it helps to heal my sun exposed skin and absorbs nicely.  </li>
            <li> I have even noticed a nice glow to my skin when I wake up in the morning - and it lasts through the day.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Night creme is the best.  </li>
            <li> I use all of Burt&#x27;s Bee products it seems to work the best for me, and I like it because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> the price, this product is a great moisturizer and from a great company that does not test on animals and uses more natural, safer ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> There is nothing more worthy than buy their favorite things people happy.</li>
            <li> I like a very light scent and this is stronger than I prefer.  </li>
            <li> Very safe, and natural, and just make great products.</li>
            <li> It helps in making the face more radiant as well as helping with anti-aging.</li>
            <li> I saw this recommended in many places</li>
            <li> It works fast, smells great</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This cream is replacing my Oil of Olay night cream which  I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> as much as i love burt&#x27;s products, this one might should be skipped</li>
            <li> I doubt most people would consider that a problem, however.</li>
            <li> Love this night lotion</li>
            <li> (although it&#x27;s not part of the NA line) and love it.  </li>
            <li> Most of all, I am saddened to discover that a product I have grown to love no longer seems to exist, without warning.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> This is my second jar of this wonderful face cream!</li>
            <li> The product is great and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees Ageless night cream.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Just love the Burt&#x27;s Bees line of products.</li>
            <li> Have used it for more than 2 years now.</li>
            <li> All I can say now is that I love my skin again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this is thicker and creamer than anything I&#x27;ve used before, it&#x27;s fantastic!  </li>
            <li> cream feels very soothing, refreshing and smells great.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> My skin fares significantly better in more humid areas of the country to the point</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on okay</li>
            <li> I REALLY love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> LOVE this cream.  </li>
            <li> I love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love their lip balm, so I thought I would try this night cream.</li>
            <li> I was glad I could return it and did so.</li>
            <li> So Cal, I need a bit more moisturizer than this product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this line.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fresh and creamy, and the smell is just so good (and I&#x27;m a person who prefers products without perfume).  </li>
            <li> Its for my girl,I think she will love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> so I felt like it was time to start caring more for my face/neck skin to prevent premature aging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees and this is another one of their great products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost completely natural, smells great, feels wonderful on my skin and gets absorbed completely without any residue.  </li>
            <li> All three of us are pleased with the results in skin tone and fine lines.</li>
            <li> :) It is thick and wonderful and smells nice and fruity to me.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and herbal which is nice.  </li>
            <li> The whole ageless (pomegranate) line from BB smells SO good.</li>
            <li> This creme is a nice, medium-thick consistency, goes on smoothly, and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> rich and best for dry skin-- made my medium/combination skin greasy&lt;</li>
            <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees products are far superior to the line I was using for so many years.  </li>
            <li> got this one after trying the Radiance night cream and being turned off by its strong fragrance and stickiness.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Radiance line of Burt&#x27;s Bees and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice fresh scent and my face feels squeaky clean after using it.  </li>
            <li> But thats fine for a night cream, as i&#x27;m sleeping anyways.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect if it were slightly cheaper though.</li>
            <li> You can have great skin without the chemicals, and I will never go back.</li>
            <li> I can already tell a difference in the how smooth my face feels and looks.  </li>
            <li> it feels cheap.</li>
            <li> this is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I would not re-purchase and it has not dine anything to smooth any lines on my skin.</li>
            <li> so light and creamy</li>
            <li> I put it on before going to bed, and the next day my skin felt great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re natural, and good value for the money.</li>
            <li> so far so good</li>
            <li> It beats all the high cost products in all the stores and works even better because I&#x27;ve tried most.</li>
            <li> I am 45 and live in the dryness of Arizona and it has already made me look younger using this (and eliminating some stresses from my life -lol!)</li>
            <li> I thought that was quite impressive, as I don&#x27;t have large pores at all, but I do have better than perfect vision up close, and that usually allows me to see fine details of everyone&#x27;s face with the detail of a small magnifying glass.</li>
            <li> I believe the newest one is from 2012, which would have been a review of the original formula.    </li>
            <li> I love it and use the whole line!</li>
            <li> I found a better deal here on Amazon, but I would be willing to pay 24.99 if I had to.</li>
            <li> i used collagen hydrating cream from talgo for $62.00 for years, tried this one and not disappointed.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m using it and honestly I didn&#x27;t get the chance to notice the changes, but someting that I could not neglect is it smell.</li>
            <li> My mother has amazing skin without any wrinkles from starting an early age, so I thought it would be wise to follow in her footsteps.</li>
            <li> Really wish it had worked better on my face-</li>
            <li> Clean fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I expected this cream to be perfect for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Have noticed mild decrease in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Super hydrating.</li>
            <li> Like others mentioned, the cream is absorbed fairly quickly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid forties and my skin has never felt better!  </li>
            <li> Despite the initial smell, this product is amazing and my skin is no longer peeling</li>
            <li> Anyway I love the results, including the unexpected one, from using this Burts Bees product.</li>
            <li> I totally makes me look younger, smells just faintly and just delightful, and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Being 24 years old and having acne-prone skin, I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, facewashes, and night creams.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I think the fragrance is really nice - very warm, fruity and reminiscent of a cozy house out in the country.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and goes on smoothly, but I have noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as moist when I get up as it did with my other cream.</li>
            <li> After I run out of this jar I will be trying Burt&#x27;s Bees other night creams that may moisturize my skin better and hopefully even smell better.</li>
            <li> The price nice, too, as so many more expensive creams do not work as well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this in couple of months ago and can tell a huge difference in fine lines and overall clarity of my skin!  </li>
            <li> will purchase again for certain!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and it diminishes my pores.</li>
            <li> I did not see any huge difference with my skin other than it being slightly more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually allergic to most fruits(pomegranate being one of them)</li>
            <li> I work at a restaurant and burned myself pretty well.</li>
            <li> This was such a welcomed surprise that this night creme prevented the scarring, I can not even express how pleased I am with this product.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have bought many items from Amazon; this time was totally unaccaptable!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really speak to the ageless claim since I am 24, but I am planning to continue using this line of skin care!</li>
            <li> Checked most of the ingredients - this product contains denatured alcohol which has a moderate hazard rating according to the cosmeticsdatabase.com website.  </li>
            <li> everything is different from the product that I know and love.</li>
            <li> It really does help tighten wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY different products from drugstores, department stores, and even MK products, but nothing has had favorable long-term effects.</li>
            <li> That proves that you dont need those expensive products to attain the best results: It really is knockout of a product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d spent a lot of time researching making my own products when I stumbled across the Burt&#x27;s Bees line.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my skin felt like it lost years.  </li>
            <li> It feels so soft &amp; smooth, no greasy feeling, no drying out or stinging feeling.</li>
            <li> understand how the first product shipped got dammaged.</li>
            <li> No fake fragrance in this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is has not caused any issues - light and non greasy.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used this product consistently...</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my hands when they need an extra kick of moisture - love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the Burts Bees line, but I really dont like the way my skin looks when using this product especially in the morning</li>
            <li> I researched more natural products and found the Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless</li>
            <li> Light, quickly absorbed, natural, no bad smell, white birch bark is supposed to help against skin damage from the sun (I did a lot of research on this - you can look it up also on the internet...)</li>
            <li> One of the things I like most about it is that it lasts a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I chose this face cream because it has natural ingredients; it is gentle on the ageing skin; it is a competitive price; I use it as morning face cream too; it is better than the designer name brands for my face - far fewer chemicals.</li>
            <li> boyfriend who has more oily skin and HATES any remotely greasy or heavy moisturizer LOVED this.</li>
            <li> I like this night creme better than many I&#x27;ve tried, such as Elizabeth Arden, Peter Thomas Roth, other Burt&#x27;s Bees creams and some that I can&#x27;t remember.  </li>
            <li> Continued use has improved the overall condition of my skin a great deal, reducing pore size as well as dark spots.</li>
            <li> In the morning, my face feels smooth, not oily, not dry.  </li>
            <li> I wash with a soap with salicylic acid that keeps those great hormone breakouts down a bit, but this cream and the day cream has actually changed the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I opened it, it was not filled up to the top with night creme!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any skin tightening or slowing of aging, but I also currently don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, just fine lines.</li>
            <li> The cream is just an average cream but has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think that this cream will make a big difference in fine lines, but it will keep skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower or linger and the cream is very emollient and it stays on the face a little heavier than yes to carrots.</li>
            <li> Very thick and takes a while to sink into skin, but overall very happy with product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a night cream!</li>
            <li> It reminds me so much to the lipton tea smell.</li>
            <li> However, I am now getting used to it and can say it works really well.  </li>
            <li> Very sneaky, Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> fast shipping thank you.</li>
            <li> you can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin so soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need</li>
            <li> I can use as much of it as I want and it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
            <li> I generally really like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products, across the board.</li>
            <li> I see a real difference in how my face looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I really like how my skin feels after using this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and consistency of this product.</li>
            <li> but this really irritates my eyes</li>
            <li> It might work for some people but it really hurts my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used the eye cream from the same Naturally Ageless line and was much better without the string smell.</li>
            <li> Very moist, peak honey flavor, sweet smell, very suitable for winter, summer may not suitable for long-term use, do not know the future will not have effect.</li>
            <li> but I am sure that was due to the Xmas time of year.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t hurt any that it made my skin even softer than usual, and the product smells nice.    </li>
            <li> However, this is no longer true, because it is not the same product anymore.    </li>
            <li> It actually soaks in to my skin - it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top like many slimy thick creams.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the burn was healing great compared to other burns I previously had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than bad, it&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like my skin got any better or worse, but I really don&#x27;t enjoy the sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> one in particular I use at night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive products and get a better result from this creme.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent moisturizer</li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it has a strong fragrance that dissipates within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anything from their line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 yrs old now and even though my skin is not as oily as it used to be, I still have large pores.</li>
            <li> and after an application (usually immediately after shower or washing) my skin feels soft in most areas but the most dry areas like my cheeks and forehead</li>
            <li> I heard they really aren&#x27;t all natural like they claim</li>
            <li> I will say that I really like it thus far.  </li>
            <li> and they all left nice dark brown scars.</li>
            <li> Immediately after using this cream, my skin looked rather glowing compared to normal.</li>
            <li> I just received the BB NA Night Creme a few days ago and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I put this cream on the night of the burn because I figured it was more or less a natural product</li>
            <li> , my right eye actually swelled up a lot for two days, I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> The new formula is not a product I would recommend.    </li>
            <li> I wanted to note that I live in the desert, and I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the cream can be very greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li> Creme seems to brighten and makes skin very soft by the morning.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit weird, but other than that it is great!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about finally getting away from all the chemicals used in facial products.</li>
            <li> first intention was to ship it back as soon as i recieved it, but decided that  these products are expesive so i ll keep them.</li>
            <li> The cap of the product broke, got leaking product , the box of the product is really old, and no expiration Date !</li>
            <li> Since I would love to be &amp;#34;Ageless&amp;#34; I decided to try this new line--at least new to me.  </li>
            <li> It seems they screen reviews and only publish positive ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and definitely see a positive improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I dab dots all over my face (using a total amount of about the size of my thumbnail), and then start gently rubbing it in starting from my neck up (as we learn that pulling down on our faces tends to stretch the skin more).</li>
            <li> : Never dilute beauty products in large quantities because you will also be diluting preservatives/antibacterial/antifungal additives, which could lead to really gross rancid products.</li>
            <li> * can be diluted with a little water just before using, to make a light airy cream that applies well and is not too oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I find dabbing a little more to those areas after the initial application.</li>
            <li> but my skin is clear and well-moisturized.</li>
            <li> The only real con I noticed is that the airbrushing effect makes me feel a bit teenaged looking.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I do like the Naturally Ageless.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and supple, and also improves imperfections when they occur.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Night Creme based on the reviews I read here on Amazon as well as on the company&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised to see Burt&#x27;s Bees products listed on Macy&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is classified among the Natural beauty products.  </li>
            <li> And another big bonus is that this night creme is much cheaper than anything else I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried department store as well as discount/drug store</li>
            <li> i swtiched to an all natural product with spf tho b/c</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Night Creme for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li> bees &#x3D; natural products.  </li>
            <li> I chose the Burt&#x27;s bees brand because it has some natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals or mineral oil (which is an ingredient I do NOT want going on my face).</li>
            <li> , I relied on the natural oils in my face to moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I slather on a finger-full of this cream and my face feels soft, supple and dewy.  </li>
            <li> No heavy residue afterwards.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin, look for another product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li> I will be using this as a day cream too because the Naturally Ageless Day Cream also contains denatured alcohol but also contains sodium borate, which has a moderate to high hazard rating.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a subtle change in the freckles on the top of my cheek bones from sun exposure-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything for fine lines</li>
            <li> After experiencing breakouts with several products from high end lines, I have found the one</li>
            <li> I also liked the smell, and used this cream for a few months before I found something less greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an acne problem, but my skin tends to get so dry that it &#x27;flakes&#x27; off in certain areas of my face esp.</li>
            <li> It doesnt dry in my skin, so I go to sleep with this very oily sensation.</li>
            <li> I should begin this review by saying that my skin doesn&#x27;t actually show any signs of aging to begin with, but I decided to start early, as I would like to keep it that way.</li>
            <li> By the morning, it looked airbrushed, and I could barely find evidence of my pores.</li>
            <li> I studied the WHITE CAP container detailly, it has BB copyright 2010 WITHOUT skin firming, which means that is a 2010 old version.   </li>
            <li> I have contacted Customer Service in hopes for a replacement product (I&#x27;d like them to send me the old formula I thought I purchased), or if that is not possible, a refund.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly have dry skin, but  living in</li>
            <li> Loves Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this made my skin break out and after a 3 weeks its finally getting back to normal.</li>
            <li> The problem isn&#x27;t the cream, but that the top came broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may work well for those who don&#x27;t live in an extremely dry climate like I do.</li>
            <li> I found it a little too greasy for night use, but sparingly when I&#x27;m going to be home for a while, it really moisturizes!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for use by any age group- I am aged 60+</li>
            <li> I tried using this for a few weeks and at first I thought I had allergies</li>
            <li> Not for dry mature skin.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling slightly oily the next morning, and while it did moisturize very well, it was not suited to my skin type.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t waste it, I end up diluting it with pure Moroccan rosewater</li>
            <li> Very like this little bee, brought beauty to our family.</li>
            <li> My skin is also very sensitive  Every other moisturizer and night cream</li>
            <li> was a little skeptical at first because my skin tends to be very oily in the T-zone area (prone to breakouts), have sensitive skin, in my early 40&#x27;s, and beginning to show signs of aging.</li>
            <li> The downside is that the bottles are pretty small and don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I have normal to some what little oil skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dry skin especially my face.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this product again and recommend it to those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also use the Day Lotion, which as the same smell for a few minutes than is completely gone.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of replacing an expensive retinol night cream I purchased at a spa, but I found my skin starting to break out more and my dark spots looking darker.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better than pond&#x27;s cold creme, which was also recommended as an inexpensive moisturizer in lieu of all these pricey designer moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> then upon opening package the products were missing origional boxs and looked faded and old and one of the pump covers was not sealed with a safety plastic which would show that it had not been opend ,but it had been because there was dryed up seapage around the lid.i was dicusted with product and seller and returned item</li>
            <li> My face feels soft yet firm.  </li>
            <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Night Creme, but I perhaps need something a little stronger for my ultra dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It has taken me several weeks to adapt to this lotion due to the scent.  </li>
            <li> Other places had the same product going for 24.99.</li>
            <li> they sent me two other prodcts made by same manufactuere but</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that&#x27;s also oily and acne prone.  </li>
            <li> However if I rubbed my fingers over my face the dry parts are still not as moist and supple as I&#x27;d like them to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I compared it with my current one, which was bought at the local drug store few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne issues, or dry skin, and my skin is only ever slightly oily in the morning.    </li>
            <li> i could handle that, but i dont see that it does any good for me, if anything making my skin look bad!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what effect it is having on my skin other than keeping it soft and supple.</li>
            <li> So you have to use only a little and spread it over your face, neck, and hands.     </li>
            <li> I tried the cheap stuff and it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slightly red, but then that disappears after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am curious why this product has changed, but I have a feeling that if I knew the reasons, it would be upsetting--since I doubt the goal of Burts Bee&#x27;s was to make the customer happier with this change.</li>
            <li> I am also curious to see if this review will be posted on their company website,</li>
            <li> For reference, I have normal skin and live in Michigan (meaning cold, dry autumns &amp; winters that are harsh on the skin).</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as the night creams I&#x27;ve used in the past, Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless leaves my skin well hydrated.</li>
            <li> Little goes long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After washing my face feels a bit tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> Me, and two other women I know just started using this.</li>
            <li> Bye Bye Other brand that are heavily perfumed and NOT natural.</li>
            <li> It was okay for the two days that I used it, a little bit greasy, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive for how little you get.</li>
            <li> only problem i found is that it&#x27;s rather heavy, so I have to use very little of it else</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this creme as I was having extremely dry skin during this past winter.</li>
            <li> I am developing a couple of small age spots, and dry patches.  </li>
            <li> (Previously I&#x27;d moisturized nightly but with a lighter face lotion.)</li>
            <li> In less than a week, the results were already undeniable</li>
            <li> comes in a shallow glass jar with a white plastic lid.</li>
            <li> smell is a lot less stronger than the Radiance.</li>
            <li> Not cool at all.  </li>
            <li> So not cool.  .</li>
            <li> ... doesn&#x27;t make me breakout like a lot of other night creams I have used in the past</li>
            <li> -the smell takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> $20, it&#x27;s a little pricier than what I&#x27;m used to...</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t notice any heavy smell or anything.</li>
            <li> Does nothing to hydrate and felt it dried my skin.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks of using this cream, my face cleared up a lot.</li>
            <li> After finishing the jar I purchased, I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Royal Jelly cream, since it was a few dollars cheaper</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically money wasted.</li>
            <li> When I added this cream to my skin regimen, I saw a dramatic different in my skin.</li>
            <li> upon receiving the product the first bad thing was that these products are in glass jars and this person shipped them in a padded envelope wrapped in plasic shopping bags..</li>
            <li> I found that if I put a dime-sized amount in my palm and diluted with a few drops of tap water, it applied like a dream and did not turn my face into an oil slick.</li>
            <li> I tried this new product as I was having issues with dry skin (peeling on my face) with breakouts (blasted combination skin!).</li>
            <li> I could not get past the product&#x27;s smell or consistancy.  </li>
            <li> I was rather skeptical that this cream was going to do anything, considering that my skin isn&#x27;t especially problematic to begin with.</li>
            <li> , maybe i have a small reaction to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly in love with the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I had to go back to the expensive stuff, but use this on my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> Recently, I purchased a new jar through Amazon, and was very disappointed to discover that the product has changed.</li>
            <li> If it were a little less expensive, I&#x27;d probably use it for the scent alone for touch up moisturizing during the day at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So sneaky, so dishonest.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees actually 4 times the cost as Pond&#x27;s Cold Creme from the 50&#x27;s, and still sold in some stores.</li>
            <li> It was a bit slow getting here</li>
            <li> I have been using this night cream for 2 years and it is thick, creamy and soaks in without any oily residue.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to moisturize well without being thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin, and usually thick products work best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product seemed a bit thick and after on awhile it seems to make the face feel greasy</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now. I have always loved and trusted Burt&#x27;s Bees products. This night cream has a nice smell, texture and has a light-feeling after you apply it. Perfect for the night. It helps in making the face more radiant as well as helping with anti-aging. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a night cream!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m using it and honestly I didn&#x27;t get the chance to notice the changes, but someting that I could not neglect is it smell. It reminds me so much to the lipton tea smell.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that&#x27;s also oily and acne prone.  I was looking for a moisturizer that would help with those conditions.  I saw this recommended in many places so I decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s absorbs quickly and moisturizes perfectly.  It&#x27;s also greatly reduced the break outs that I get.  I love this stuff and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> It was okay for the two days that I used it, a little bit greasy, but not too bad. After those two days I noticed that my face was breaking out. I ended up getting an allergic reaction on my face and neck. I immediately stopped using it and already see my face improving. Will not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It works fast, smells great and I have noticed improvements in my skin quality!</li>
            <li> I use this as my night cream. I love it, I don&#x27;t notice any heavy smell or anything. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin! I&#x27;m actually allergic to most fruits(pomegranate being one of them) if i eat them, so I didn&#x27;t know if this would make me break out or not. But thankfully it doesn&#x27;t cause any bother to my skin, if ANYTHING it&#x27;s slightly red, but then that disappears after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only problem i found is that it&#x27;s rather heavy, so I have to use very little of it else I just feel covered in the stuff. But thats fine for a night cream, as i&#x27;m sleeping anyways.</li>
            <li> This cream is replacing my Oil of Olay night cream which  I have used for many years. Nice and creamy, settles in fast, smells great, and my face looks wonderful in the morning. I alternate this (for the skin tightening effect) with the Burts Bees Radiance night cream (for the ultra moisture). I also use the Burts Beeswax moisture cream on weekends. I found it a little too greasy for night use, but sparingly when I&#x27;m going to be home for a while, it really moisturizes! Yup, I am now a believer!!! You can have great skin without the chemicals, and I will never go back.</li>
            <li> I bought this creme as I was having extremely dry skin during this past winter. Started using it and it&#x27;s amazing. It has improved my skin tone and stopped the dryness. It also smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I like this night creme better than many I&#x27;ve tried, such as Elizabeth Arden, Peter Thomas Roth, other Burt&#x27;s Bees creams and some that I can&#x27;t remember.  This creme spreads on nicely, smells good and appears to moisturize my skin nicely.  The price nice, too, as so many more expensive creams do not work as well.</li>
            <li> I could not get past the product&#x27;s smell or consistancy.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a rotten expired product or not because there was no expiration date on it!  I just will not be using this creme at all.  It smells awful and the consistency is gooey and watery.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as the night creams I&#x27;ve used in the past, Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless leaves my skin well hydrated. Continued use has improved the overall condition of my skin a great deal, reducing pore size as well as dark spots. I love it :)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for me and it is tough to rub in.  as much as i love burt&#x27;s products, this one might should be skipped</li>
            <li> The problem isn&#x27;t the cream, but that the top came broken.</li>
            <li> This is a great night cream. In the morning I wake up with almost a glow. It is a great product for my skin (olive toned, combination type). I have also noticed a subtle change in the freckles on the top of my cheek bones from sun exposure- they have become lighter and more faint. I will continue to use this product because I see results. The only downside is that the cream can be very greasy if you use too much. So you have to use only a little and spread it over your face, neck, and hands.     I think the thing I am most impressed with is when I used this cream to treat a fresh burn mark. I work at a restaurant and burned myself pretty well. I knew it would scar because I have burn marks on my arms and hand that all happened the same way and they all left nice dark brown scars. I put this cream on the night of the burn because I figured it was more or less a natural product and since it was an \\&quot;ageless night creme\\&quot; that it would help renew the cells that were burnt so that it would heal faster. Well it instantly helped relieve some of the stinging from the burn and after using it for a couple days (once or twice a day) I noticed that the burn was healing great compared to other burns I previously had. Well to make this short, after using this product continuously until the burn was healed, the burn DID NOT EVEN leave a scar!!! This was such a welcomed surprise that this night creme prevented the scarring, I can not even express how pleased I am with this product.  (Side note: I would be careful using this as a burn treater if you have sensitive skin).    Anyway I love the results, including the unexpected one, from using this Burts Bees product. I will definitely be repurchasing!!</li>
            <li> I should begin this review by saying that my skin doesn&#x27;t actually show any signs of aging to begin with, but I decided to start early, as I would like to keep it that way. My mother has amazing skin without any wrinkles from starting an early age, so I thought it would be wise to follow in her footsteps. I was rather skeptical that this cream was going to do anything, considering that my skin isn&#x27;t especially problematic to begin with. I don&#x27;t have acne issues, or dry skin, and my skin is only ever slightly oily in the morning.    Immediately after using this cream, my skin looked rather glowing compared to normal. By the morning, it looked airbrushed, and I could barely find evidence of my pores. I thought that was quite impressive, as I don&#x27;t have large pores at all, but I do have better than perfect vision up close, and that usually allows me to see fine details of everyone&#x27;s face with the detail of a small magnifying glass. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt any that it made my skin even softer than usual, and the product smells nice.    The only real con I noticed is that the airbrushing effect makes me feel a bit teenaged looking. I doubt most people would consider that a problem, however.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about six weeks now and am very pleased. For reference, I have normal skin and live in Michigan (meaning cold, dry autumns &amp; winters that are harsh on the skin). This creme is a nice, medium-thick consistency, goes on smoothly, and absorbs fairly quickly. It leaves my skin soft and smooth. I use it in conjunction with the BB ageless eye creme, and am very happy with both products. They&#x27;re natural, and good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I love the Burts Bees line, but I really dont like the way my skin looks when using this product especially in the morning, maybe i have a small reaction to it but i dont think so. It is a lill greasy and smells funky i could handle that, but i dont see that it does any good for me, if anything making my skin look bad! Ive been using it on my hands until its gone but i wont be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love BB&#x27;s Ageless Night Creme, which is my 2nd one that I recently bought via Amazon&#x27;s Saved &amp; Subscribed program to save only $3.16.  I am so regret to do so after I opened the mailing box, in which is an unboxed BB Ageless Night creme in a WHITE cap container.  Since, I have been using it, and I know that there&#x27;s something wrong, so I compared it with my current one, which was bought at the local drug store few months ago.  The current one is SILVER cap with the SKIN FIRMING on the container, just like what is shown on the box.  I studied the WHITE CAP container detailly, it has BB copyright 2010 WITHOUT skin firming, which means that is a 2010 old version.   I also have checked with the BB website to ensure the current packing is SILVER cap.  Simply it is used on my face; I don&#x27;t want to put something is over an year+.  Therefore, I returned it and cancelled the subscription and won&#x27;t trust Amazon&#x27;s saved &amp; subscripted again.     If I can put negative rating, I will do for Amazon&#x27;s BAD services to the Subscribers.      I have bought many items from Amazon; this time was totally unaccaptable!!</li>
            <li> While it smells good, it feels greasy.. I don&#x27;t feel like my skin got any better or worse, but I really don&#x27;t enjoy the sticky feeling. So I don&#x27;t waste it, I end up diluting it with pure Moroccan rosewater</li>
            <li> I expected this cream to be perfect for my sensitive skin.  Instead it brought on a severe outbreak of eczema on my chin.</li>
            <li> Love this night lotion :) It is thick and wonderful and smells nice and fruity to me. If you have the Burt&#x27;s Bees pomegranate chapstick this lotion smells just like that. Def. a good moisturizer, great for the winter! Have now also bought the day lotion (which is a bit thin for my taste, but obviously it is meant to be for the day). Can&#x27;t really speak to the ageless claim since I am 24, but I am planning to continue using this line of skin care!</li>
            <li> this product is so good to my face, I love it! feels softer and healthier, every woman should give a chance</li>
            <li> Checked most of the ingredients - this product contains denatured alcohol which has a moderate hazard rating according to the cosmeticsdatabase.com website.  The remaining ingredients \\&quot;that I checked\\&quot; don&#x27;t seem too bad.  I will be using this as a day cream too because the Naturally Ageless Day Cream also contains denatured alcohol but also contains sodium borate, which has a moderate to high hazard rating.</li>
            <li> Not for dry mature skin. Does nothing to hydrate and felt it dried my skin. Absolutely worthless and a bunch of hype!</li>
            <li> I just converted from Mary Kay to Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  I used Mary Kay for 15 years and just recently began investigating the ingredients.  It was very scary to see the ingredients in the products I was using.  I researched more natural products and found the Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless (\\&quot;BB NA\\&quot;) line and thought I&#x27;d try it.  I&#x27;m using the BB Orange Essence Facial Cleanser (although it&#x27;s not part of the NA line) and love it.  It has a nice fresh scent and my face feels squeaky clean after using it.  I am also using the BB NA Day Lotion.  It has taken me several weeks to adapt to this lotion due to the scent.  I like a very light scent and this is stronger than I prefer.  However, I am now getting used to it and can say it works really well.  I just received the BB NA Night Creme a few days ago and absolutely love it.  I can already tell a difference in the how smooth my face feels and looks.  The Burt&#x27;s Bees products are far superior to the line I was using for so many years.  I&#x27;m glad I made this change!  (I&#x27;m going to order the BB NA Eye Creme and Intensive Repairing Serum and then I&#x27;ll be set!)</li>
            <li> One of the best &amp;#34;go Bert&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Ageless Night Creme for about 3 years, and it WAS the best night creme I had used.  However, this is no longer true, because it is not the same product anymore.    Recently, I purchased a new jar through Amazon, and was very disappointed to discover that the product has changed. The feel of it, the smell-- everything is different from the product that I know and love. It is greasy, it smells bad-- it feels cheap. I no longer wake up with my skin feeling improved. The new formula is not a product I would recommend.    Most of all, I am saddened to discover that a product I have grown to love no longer seems to exist, without warning. But I also feel I was tricked into buying a product that is nothing like the product it was packaged to look like.    I am curious why this product has changed, but I have a feeling that if I knew the reasons, it would be upsetting--since I doubt the goal of Burts Bee&#x27;s was to make the customer happier with this change. I have become a skeptic of this brand ever since it was bought out by Clorox, and now I see that this was with good reason.    I have contacted Customer Service in hopes for a replacement product (I&#x27;d like them to send me the old formula I thought I purchased), or if that is not possible, a refund. If I experience satisfactory customer service, I will update my review.    I am also curious to see if this review will be posted on their company website, since I noticed there are no reviews of the Ageless Night Cream currently listed that are recent. I believe the newest one is from 2012, which would have been a review of the original formula.    Very sneaky, Burt&#x27;s Bees. Not cool at all.  ----  2/10/14 Update-- After emailing Burt&#x27;s Bees, they did issue me a refund.  ----  3/24/14 Update-- I just want to point out that my review submitted to the Burt&#x27;s Bees website was never made public. It seems they screen reviews and only publish positive ones. So sneaky, so dishonest. Look for yourself. [...]</li>
            <li> Wow. The price keeps jumping up on this. I got it for little over $16 using subscribe and save a mere three weeks ago. I have been using this product but alternating with yes to carrots night cream. I do like the Naturally Ageless. It has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower or linger and the cream is very emollient and it stays on the face a little heavier than yes to carrots. I am not sure what effect it is having on my skin other than keeping it soft and supple. I don&#x27;t see a big difference in lines around my eyes, but then again, I don&#x27;t use it every day. I really don&#x27;t think that this cream will make a big difference in fine lines, but it will keep skin from drying out. In the winter, that is especially important and I make sure to apply some sort of night cream every night.</li>
            <li> this is fantastic. I totally makes me look younger, smells just faintly and just delightful, and feels wonderful. I highly recommend. I am 45 and live in the dryness of Arizona and it has already made me look younger using this (and eliminating some stresses from my life -lol!)</li>
            <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees brand products and this one is no different.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  I love the product.  It was a bit slow getting here but I am sure that was due to the Xmas time of year.  I would shop with you again.</li>
            <li> My skin did not like this cream, it did not absorb it at all. The price is great, but my skin did not think so. I won&#x27;t buy it again. I am giving 2 stars for the price.</li>
            <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Night Creme, but I perhaps need something a little stronger for my ultra dry skin.  It smells nice and goes on smoothly, but I have noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as moist when I get up as it did with my other cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It leaves my skin soft and supple, and also improves imperfections when they occur.  I love it and use the whole line!</li>
            <li> This item has been discontinued by Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s.  It will cause your skin to break out; leaves a greasy appearance.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar of this wonderful face cream! It really does help tighten wrinkles!  It is not greasy feeling either! Will not hesitate to order more of this!</li>
            <li> This night cream is heavier than I would like. It left my face feeling slightly oily the next morning, and while it did moisturize very well, it was not suited to my skin type. I found that if I put a dime-sized amount in my palm and diluted with a few drops of tap water, it applied like a dream and did not turn my face into an oil slick. I also liked the smell, and used this cream for a few months before I found something less greasy. I did not see any huge difference with my skin other than it being slightly more hydrated. (Previously I&#x27;d moisturized nightly but with a lighter face lotion.) Also, it never broke me out which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Hydrating&lt;br /&gt;Did not cause breakouts&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent (in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very rich and best for dry skin-- made my medium/combination skin greasy&lt;br /&gt;* can be diluted with a little water just before using, to make a light airy cream that applies well and is not too oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Never dilute beauty products in large quantities because you will also be diluting preservatives/antibacterial/antifungal additives, which could lead to really gross rancid products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dry skin especially my face. I don&#x27;t have an acne problem, but my skin tends to get so dry that it &#x27;flakes&#x27; off in certain areas of my face esp. my nose and cheeks. I&#x27;ve tried MANY different products from drugstores, department stores, and even MK products, but nothing has had favorable long-term effects. I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Night Creme based on the reviews I read here on Amazon as well as on the company&#x27;s website. I was also surprised to see Burt&#x27;s Bees products listed on Macy&#x27;s website. I&#x27;m very happy I decided to try this product. My face looks and feels hydrated. Like others mentioned, the cream is absorbed fairly quickly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. The smell is a bit weird, but other than that it is great! I recently ordered the day cream and can&#x27;t wait to start using that too.    I will definitely purchase this product again and recommend it to those with dry skin. The product is great and the price is reasonable. Other places had the same product going for 24.99. I found a better deal here on Amazon, but I would be willing to pay 24.99 if I had to.</li>
            <li> Loves Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this made my skin break out and after a 3 weeks its finally getting back to normal. I have normal to some what little oil skin and I still broke out.</li>
            <li> This product feels great when you put it on. A small amount goes a long way. The one downside is the initial smell. When you first put it on, it has a strong fragrance that dissipates within a few minutes. I also use the Day Lotion, which as the same smell for a few minutes than is completely gone. After using both products, I have noticed a great difference in the softness of my skin and firmness. I tried this new product as I was having issues with dry skin (peeling on my face) with breakouts (blasted combination skin!). Despite the initial smell, this product is amazing and my skin is no longer peeling and I notice that my breakouts are decreasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again for certain!</li>
            <li> Me, and two other women I know just started using this. All three of us are pleased with the results in skin tone and fine lines. I&#x27;ll be making an order for my sister soon. Great product because it absorbs, it works and it has ingredients we can feel good about using on our skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better than pond&#x27;s cold creme, which was also recommended as an inexpensive moisturizer in lieu of all these pricey designer moisturizers.  Burt&#x27;s Bees actually 4 times the cost as Pond&#x27;s Cold Creme from the 50&#x27;s, and still sold in some stores.</li>
            <li> Wonderful night creme! Not oily at all. Would probably be great for any skin type.</li>
            <li> I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees Ageless night cream.  One of the things I like most about it is that it lasts a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Kahn</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and definitely see a positive improvement in my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many expensive night creams and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> The cream is just an average cream but has a very strong smell. I have used the eye cream from the same Naturally Ageless line and was much better without the string smell. I would not re-purchase and it has not dine anything to smooth any lines on my skin.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about a great product that works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than bad, it&#x27;s good... made of Log, although I would not run over my neighbor&#x27;s dog with this.</li>
            <li> This smells really good and feels great on your skin. It would be perfect if it were slightly cheaper though.</li>
            <li> I chose this face cream because it has natural ingredients; it is gentle on the ageing skin; it is a competitive price; I use it as morning face cream too; it is better than the designer name brands for my face - far fewer chemicals. I would highly recommend it for use by any age group- I am aged 60+</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is classified among the Natural beauty products.  That proves that you dont need those expensive products to attain the best results: It really is knockout of a product.  In less than a week, the results were already undeniable</li>
            <li> Nice feel. Absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in a short time. Just love the Burt&#x27;s Bees line of products.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream. Little goes long way.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin and I do not breakout after using this. Have used it for more than 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about finally getting away from all the chemicals used in facial products. I&#x27;d spent a lot of time researching making my own products when I stumbled across the Burt&#x27;s Bees line. Being from NC, I&#x27;d heard of them some time ago, but for some reason had never tried it before. All I can say now is that I love my skin again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical at first because my skin tends to be very oily in the T-zone area (prone to breakouts), have sensitive skin, in my early 40&#x27;s, and beginning to show signs of aging. I thought some of these women that claimed to be in the same boat had found something that worked; so, I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is thicker and creamer than anything I&#x27;ve used before, it&#x27;s fantastic!  It takes very little too! I dab dots all over my face (using a total amount of about the size of my thumbnail), and then start gently rubbing it in starting from my neck up (as we learn that pulling down on our faces tends to stretch the skin more). The first time I used it my skin felt like it lost years.  It feels so soft &amp; smooth, no greasy feeling, no drying out or stinging feeling. And another big bonus is that this night creme is much cheaper than anything else I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried department store as well as discount/drug store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend and have recommended this product line to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and so far so good... doesn&#x27;t make me breakout like a lot of other night creams I have used in the past</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. Moisturizes very well. i swtiched to an all natural product with spf tho b/c I&#x27;m moving aay from Burt&#x27;s bees products. I heard they really aren&#x27;t all natural like they claim</li>
            <li> This is an excellent night cream. The Burt&#x27;s Bees AGELESS line of products are all excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream feels very soothing, refreshing and smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Night Creme for a couple of years now.  It&#x27;s almost completely natural, smells great, feels wonderful on my skin and gets absorbed completely without any residue.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Well, this is a pleasant shopping. I will often come to patronize! There is nothing more worthy than buy their favorite things people happy.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, feels great on skin - moisturizing but not oily or greasy. I can&#x27;t say whether or not it actually decreases wrinkles, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and I look forward to applying it every night.</li>
            <li> i mistakingly wrote a good reveiw for this seller thinking it was another seller who sent me the correct product .what i meant to say about this seller is that they shipped out my origional product and was returned to them damaged from ups,so without notifying me they sent me two other prodcts made by same manufactuere but not what i wanted , they notified me after they shipped it of what had happened,now if i wanted this product i would have orderd  it.my first intention was to ship it back as soon as i recieved it, but decided that  these products are expesive so i ll keep them. upon receiving the product the first bad thing was that these products are in glass jars and this person shipped them in a padded envelope wrapped in plasic shopping bags..understand how the first product shipped got dammaged. then upon opening package the products were missing origional boxs and looked faded and old and one of the pump covers was not sealed with a safety plastic which would show that it had not been opend ,but it had been because there was dryed up seapage around the lid.i was dicusted with product and seller and returned item .i will keep this sellers name on file to ensure not to order from them again ,obviously this seller does not care about customer satisfaction ,..just getting the money.</li>
            <li> Light, quickly absorbed, natural, no bad smell, white birch bark is supposed to help against skin damage from the sun (I did a lot of research on this - you can look it up also on the internet...) together with the pomegranate .</li>
            <li> love it. fast shipping thank you. you can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream! Within a few weeks of using this cream, my face cleared up a lot. Being 24 years old and having acne-prone skin, I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, facewashes, and night creams. When I added this cream to my skin regimen, I saw a dramatic different in my skin. After finishing the jar I purchased, I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Royal Jelly cream, since it was a few dollars cheaper and I figured it would be similar. Although I liked that one as well (and the scent was nicer), it didn&#x27;t work as well  as the Pomegranate Night Cream and my face began to flare up again. Now I&#x27;m back to using this skin cream!  What I liked:  -cleared up my skin  -it comes in a shallow glass jar with a white plastic lid. they come in handy and look nice for reuse.  -burt&#x27;s bees &#x3D; natural products.  What I didn&#x27;t like:  -the smell takes a little getting used to. I found it kinda medicinal.  -around $20, it&#x27;s a little pricier than what I&#x27;m used to...I&#x27;m a drugstore-shopping kinda girl.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Night creme is the best.  It keeps my skin so soft and fresh.  I use all of Burt&#x27;s Bee products it seems to work the best for me, and I like it because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I chose the Burt&#x27;s bees brand because it has some natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals or mineral oil (which is an ingredient I do NOT want going on my face). I tried the cheap stuff and it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me. I wanted to note that I live in the desert, and I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and my skin has become drier since moving to the desert. My skin fares significantly better in more humid areas of the country to the point I don&#x27;t really need lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this one after trying the Radiance night cream and being turned off by its strong fragrance and stickiness. This one had great reviews at another website so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a lot less stronger than the Radiance. I&#x27;m not exactly in love with the fragrance. It&#x27;s tolerable, especially since it seems to fade soon after application.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on okay and after an application (usually immediately after shower or washing) my skin feels soft in most areas but the most dry areas like my cheeks and forehead I find dabbing a little more to those areas after the initial application. However if I rubbed my fingers over my face the dry parts are still not as moist and supple as I&#x27;d like them to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work well for those who don&#x27;t live in an extremely dry climate like I do. After I run out of this jar I will be trying Burt&#x27;s Bees other night creams that may moisturize my skin better and hopefully even smell better. But I don&#x27;t think I will come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this night cream for 2 years and it is thick, creamy and soaks in without any oily residue.  I REALLY love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;In my 20&#x27;s I used to use Clinique. You know that yellow hydrating cream - which I didn&#x27;t need, because I had youth on my side and my face was a bit oily.  In the winter though, it worked nicely, but it clogged my pores and I broke out a lot.  So I went a lot of my teens and 20&#x27;s sans moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my 30&#x27;s I was going through all those good hormone changes yet again and my face became much more oily, and along with that oil, came breakouts too so once again, I relied on the natural oils in my face to moisturize.  Sans moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have turned 40, I have noticed a change in my skin.  I am developing a couple of small age spots, and dry patches.  I wash with a soap with salicylic acid that keeps those great hormone breakouts down a bit, but this cream and the day cream has actually changed the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one in particular I use at night.  After washing my face feels a bit tight and dry.  I slather on a finger-full of this cream and my face feels soft, supple and dewy.  Never oily.  It actually soaks in to my skin - it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top like many slimy thick creams.  It smells fresh and herbal which is nice.  No fake fragrance in this stuff.  In the morning, my face feels smooth, not oily, not dry.  My wrinkles have diminished a bit, and the freshness has returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this cream.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Creme seems to brighten and makes skin very soft by the morning. Have noticed mild decrease in wrinkles. Very thick and takes a while to sink into skin, but overall very happy with product!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; make really good product. I highly recommend anything from their line. Very safe, and natural, and just make great products.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh feeling. No heavy residue afterwards. No need to buy expensive &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands. I use in conjunction with Burt&#x27;s Bee day cream and Bury&#x27;s bee Radiance facial wash. I can see my a glow to my face. I love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Burt&#x27;s bee after having severe chapped lips. I tried everything. So I decided to try Burt&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Bee. Their Chapstick worked so well I wanted to try facial&lt;br /&gt;Products. I just wished I started using Burt&#x27;s Bee years ago. My kids and babies use Burt&#x27;s Bee. Bye Bye Other brand that are heavily perfumed and NOT natural.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, it was not filled up to the top with night creme! I hope nothing was added to the product like water to dilute it.  So not cool.  .</li>
            <li> I am a repeat user of Burt&#x27;s Bees. My face feels soft yet firm.  I&#x27;m 66 and get compliments on my skin texture.</li>
            <li> Very like this little bee, brought beauty to our family.</li>
            <li> Especial para pieles que necesiten hidratación y que sean mixtas. Tengo la piel más luminosa y menos arrugas! La recomiendo a ojos cerrados.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a good complexion. I&#x27;m 60 yrs old now and even though my skin is not as oily as it used to be, I still have large pores. My skin is also very sensitive  Every other moisturizer and night cream I&#x27;ve used always made my skin and hair greasy, not to mention the irritation. I love their lip balm, so I thought I would try this night cream. As soon as I put it on it absorbs into my skin. I can use as much of it as I want and it&#x27;s not oily. It makes my skin very soft and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and it diminishes my pores. I even use it as an eye cream. The scent is also subtle.  I use it during the day. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of replacing an expensive retinol night cream I purchased at a spa, but I found my skin starting to break out more and my dark spots looking darker. I had to go back to the expensive stuff, but use this on my neck and chest. It does seem to moisturize well without being thick or greasy. The smell is pleasant. Really wish it had worked better on my face- my checkbook would be happier.</li>
            <li> I got my package yesterday and I was really disappointed ! The cap of the product broke, got leaking product , the box of the product is really old, and no expiration Date !</li>
            <li> I had been using the Radiance line of Burt&#x27;s Bees and liked it very much.  Since I would love to be &amp;#34;Ageless&amp;#34; I decided to try this new line--at least new to me.  It actually didn&#x27;t seem to be as moisturizing and it did not smell as nice.  I was glad I could return it and did so.</li>
            <li> Very moist, peak honey flavor, sweet smell, very suitable for winter, summer may not suitable for long-term use, do not know the future will not have effect.</li>
            <li> I dont find this absorbs well into my skin. I generally really like Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products, across the board. This one leaves me cold. And wishing it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its thick, difficult to apply thinly. My forehead breaks out when I use it. I have delicate skin, and usually thick products work best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone want a half-used jar?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly have dry skin, but  living in So Cal, I need a bit more moisturizer than this product. I went back to using Oil of Olay after using this product for a couple of months, and I immediately felt the difference; not so when I switched to this product.</li>
            <li> I use this with a Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Serum and they work good together.  I see a real difference in how my face looks and feels.</li>
            <li> good stuff, good price. Not poisonous&lt;br /&gt;.. . ...... . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and I like it, but do I see any difference, no.....</li>
            <li> outdated products, poor quality, going to return it</li>
            <li> Better than department store brands, and its not that expensive. so light and creamy it soaks in to your skin</li>
            <li> I am in love with this line.  It&#x27;s so fresh and creamy, and the smell is just so good (and I&#x27;m a person who prefers products without perfume).  After experiencing breakouts with several products from high end lines, I have found the one</li>
            <li> Purchased this in couple of months ago and can tell a huge difference in fine lines and overall clarity of my skin!  I am in my mid forties and my skin has never felt better!  It moisturizes well through the night and into the next day!  I strongly recommend this product!  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Super hydrating. I have to use it sparingly or else I break out in the morning :(</li>
            <li> This product seemed a bit thick and after on awhile it seems to make the face feel greasy</li>
            <li> Its for my girl,I think she will love it</li>
            <li> I really like how my skin feels after using this stuff. I put it on before going to bed, and the next day my skin felt great. The downside is that the bottles are pretty small and don&#x27;t last long at all. It&#x27;s pretty expensive for how little you get. Therefore, I quit using it. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving the Ageless serum and thought I&#x27;d try the cream as well. Bad idea. This creme smells aweful. It&#x27;s basically money wasted.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and consistency of this product. I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything for fine lines but my skin is clear and well-moisturized.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It beats all the high cost products in all the stores and works even better because I&#x27;ve tried most.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is has not caused any issues - light and non greasy.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream and it made  my skin break out in a rash. So if you have sensitive skin, look for another product.</li>
            <li> i used collagen hydrating cream from talgo for $62.00 for years, tried this one and not disappointed. The skin feels hydrated and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Got a compliment from Chanel sales person at the local mall while buying makeup. She asked what do i use because my skin looked  nourished and hydrated. I am 46 y.o.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now and feel that my skin tone has definitely improved.  I receive comments about my skin all the time.  I&#x27;ve used more expensive products and get a better result from this creme.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> The product doesnt seem bad (it doesnt irritate my skin or makes me unconfortable), but it is sticky! It doesnt dry in my skin, so I go to sleep with this very oily sensation. Because of this, I havent been using it every night, so I didnt see any result yet. I gonna keep trying.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas one year as a gift. The whole ageless (pomegranate) line from BB smells SO good. It&#x27;s a decent moisturizer but I have really dry skin. For a night cream, it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me. I didn&#x27;t notice any skin tightening or slowing of aging, but I also currently don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, just fine lines. If it were a little less expensive, I&#x27;d probably use it for the scent alone for touch up moisturizing during the day at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend who has more oily skin and HATES any remotely greasy or heavy moisturizer LOVED this.</li>
            <li> I tried using this for a few weeks and at first I thought I had allergies but this really irritates my eyes, my right eye actually swelled up a lot for two days, I can&#x27;t use it anymore. It might work for some people but it really hurts my eyes.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used this product consistently...yet...I will say that I really like it thus far.  I think the fragrance is really nice - very warm, fruity and reminiscent of a cozy house out in the country.  I don&#x27;t find it to be overpowering and after about 20 minutes, the fragrance fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30s so I felt like it was time to start caring more for my face/neck skin to prevent premature aging.  I am in the sun and our chlorinated pool a lot so I need a good moisturizer.  This one does the trick.  With antioxidants, it helps to heal my sun exposed skin and absorbs nicely.  I have even noticed a nice glow to my skin when I wake up in the morning - and it lasts through the day.  I have also used it on my hands when they need an extra kick of moisture - love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this product is a great moisturizer and from a great company that does not test on animals and uses more natural, safer ingredients.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees and this is another one of their great products!</li>
