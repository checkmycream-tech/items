    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>One thing that I loved about this product it that there is no salicylic acid!!!</li>
            <li>Great scrub!</li>
            <li>and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li>Great face wash designed for men.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent was not that strong, and that&#x27;s one of the best reasons to use Axe.</li>
            <li>Good price and does the job.</li>
            <li>Axe makes surprisingly good products.</li>
            <li>and it worked good for me.</li>
            <li>But no one is asking the question … How in the world did you ever think these microbeads would be a good thing?</li>
            <li>This did a good job at removing excess oil from my face.</li>
            <li>Good scent, good feel, good amount.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for oily skin, I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li>I am buying more!</li>
            <li>He really liked it and it smells nice to me and him.</li>
            <li>It is ok as a cleanser and does a good job of cleansing the skin and somewhat controlling the oil, but it is not preferred as a scrub.</li>
            <li>Works to get dirt off the face and smells nice.</li>
            <li>but I think it would work great for any guy wanting a clean face.</li>
            <li>It keeps them smelling good which is always important.</li>
            <li>Has a great smell that is just right.</li>
            <li>which&lt;br /&gt;Is not too strong!</li>
            <li>Ok first of all this is actually a great product that would get rid of acne.</li>
            <li>As a nursing student I understand the many areas styes can be contracted</li>
            <li>I have found teatree oil soap to do a much better job of face cleansing.</li>
            <li>Both my son and my husband love Axe and all their products.</li>
            <li>I generally love Axe products, but this one was just okay.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used so many face wash out in the market</li>
            <li>When I use face wash with salicylic acid, I tend to break out more.</li>
            <li>Many companies, including L’Oreal, The Body Shop, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble have agreed to phase out them out.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask?</li>
            <li>My idea of a scrub is something a bit more \\&quot;scrubby\\&quot; than this Axe Scrub.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t that great for things like helping with ingrown hairs and really exfoliating the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, I think I&#x27;ll buy it again, though I do wish for a lemon scent, I find it refreshing.</li>
            <li>The smell is also VERY strong and distinct and kind of off putting.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well and has a nice pleasant masculine fragrance.</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing without being too strong, and it leaves your face feeling revitalized.</li>
            <li>It also leaves you clean without dryness or sticky feeling!</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product for men with oily skin.  </li>
            <li>This one works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>The scrub did seem to work well, and my face felt smooth afterward.</li>
            <li>Feels good, controls oil, leaves skin soft and clean, not too stinky.</li>
            <li>While I had no problem, and I&#x27;m sure most won&#x27;t, it is something to consider for those with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It pulls out oils from my face and keep it clean, which suits my purpose.  </li>
            <li>He says it makes his skin feel clean and controls the acne, but that it also makes his skin feel</li>
            <li>notice that when he does use it his face look clean and oil-free.  </li>
            <li>Beats st.ives and has a clean manly scent</li>
            <li>Axe face scrub has a nice citrus-like scent that leaves your face feeling fresh and ready to face the world.  </li>
            <li>Face feels clean and fresh after usage.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop saying how much I love this product, I would definitely get more when I run out.</li>
            <li>His acne problem is fairly mild.  </li>
            <li>In a plus side to this is that it removes the oil in my face and with the beads it makes my face pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does however seem to clean very very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Axe Controil for oily skin proves to be a nice facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>it is more \\&quot;scrubby,\\&quot; gritty and really makes your skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Fish who swallow them are not getting the nutrition they need to live a healthy life, thus impacting the whole food chain.</li>
            <li>If I consistently clean my face with this, it pretty much guarantees no break outs.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and have been trying different products and this was one more I believe is a cleaner and not a control.</li>
            <li>&quot; so it is very likely that someone else may like this product better.</li>
            <li>They both loved the face scrub and both found it cleaned well without any harsh reactions.</li>
            <li>Also don&#x27;t be alarmed that this tube is kind of small, you don&#x27;t really need to put that much on, about a size of a dime would do perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says, it made my skin smoother than ever, and my acne has gotten much better (even though its not really acne treatment).</li>
            <li>A this rate it may last me a total of 2 months, which is great considering the benefits and its low price.</li>
            <li>It also controls the oil very well.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t really work as it is advertised.</li>
            <li>You can really feel it working as you wash your face.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Granted, if I shower in the morning then I can get until the evening before feeling the need to wash my face again, but if I don&#x27;t have the time to shower then this product doesn&#x27;t really do the trick.  </li>
            <li>Besides all that it leaves face feeling clean, refreshed and never dry.</li>
            <li>I know that it is labeled as a scrub, so I&#x27;m not complaining too much.  </li>
            <li>give it 3 stars, but I am very picky with my idea of a \\&quot;scrub,\\</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a strong antibacterial and there isn&#x27;t very much grit to it (think like crushed apricot seeds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and my oily skin is clean and free from detriments and oil.</li>
            <li>There are much better choices out there for less money.</li>
            <li>scrub is more like a gel cleanser with softer and less beads in it.</li>
            <li>This Axe face wash is called &#x60;Controil&#x27; and is targeted at that particular problem.  </li>
            <li>For further information, simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve only used it over a handful of days, it&#x27;s been useful for helping my oily skin; however, be aware that it does dry your face out depending on how oily your skin</li>
            <li>Works really well gets in and cleans down deep and leaves you feeling clean after</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t too much of a scent to it, which I like, and it&#x27;s been lasting quite a while.</li>
            <li>but I cleaned, washed and took extra preventive measures to mitigate as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, this was what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I like this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skit.</li>
            <li>(I did not buy this from Amazon, I bought it at a store near my house,  </li>
            <li>Oxy is really in this last category...</li>
            <li>B001ET6XNO Oxy Maximum Action Face Wash, 6 Fl-Ounce (177 ml)</li>
            <li>You can remove the reside by washing a second time with a separate face towel, and I can understand how for some people this may be too much of a hassle to bother.</li>
            <li>out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for people with very sensitive skin, be aware this is a scrub with those rough exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and have tried variety of facial cleanser including more expensive ones (neutrogena, kiehl, clean and clear).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many face washes claim to have the little beads, but often there aren&#x27;t enough, or they aren&#x27;t abrasive enough, or they settle to the bottom of the bottle and they never come out.</li>
            <li>The wash is not really rough that it can damage your skin but not too soft that it won&#x27;t the job.</li>
            <li>it can makes my face dry in a whole day .</li>
            <li>I would much rather call this a oil cleaner because this product would leave me with very smooth skin after a long day at work but wouldn&#x27;t do anything that would prevent or slow my oily skin down.</li>
            <li>It does have a very nice manly scent and it isn&#x27;t bad, it just isn&#x27;t lemon.</li>
            <li>particular product a bit lower down the scale, which might be what you&#x27;re looking for if you have sensitive</li>
            <li>Also if you not going to completely rinse it off, it will sting your eyes, so multiple rinses could be necessary.  </li>
            <li>Did not dry his skin out either.</li>

            <li> Did not dry his skin out either.</li>
            <li> I tend to rank things from most effective to least effective:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I tried two times with the oil control to rub a small amount (as much that could fall by accident) and both times ended up with a swollen eye lid.</li>
            <li> I noticed that long term use also improves overall complexion and reduces pore inflammation.</li>
            <li> The skin feels clean, but nothing like when Jack Black, or a few other preferred brands are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> there might be some wierd ingredients like &#x27;Bambusa Arundinacea Stem Extract&#x27; but unless there&#x27;s scientific evidence, it&#x27;s hard to really know what you are paying for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I been having acne break out for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I always use moisturizer afterwards so that my skin stays not too dry.  </li>
            <li> It also helps a lot with the ingrown hairs from shaving and gets rid of any dry skin by exfoliating it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands recently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it three times and it already has caused my skin to dry!</li>

            <li> This stuff won&#x27;t dry out your face like other products do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend using a facial lotion afterwards so that you don&#x27;t feel too dried</li>
            <li> If you want something exfoliating, go for this, if not, try one of the other Axe face washes.</li>
            <li> These micro-particle polyethylene beads, which are less than 1mm in diameter and designed to be washed down the drain, are polluting lakes and the oceans.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Additionally it has little exfoliating bits in it.</li>

            <li> Because of that, I usually look for products that claim to handle that issue.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t work that wonderfully, or at least for that long.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this an oil control, at least for me.</li>
            <li> While it does the job, I found it a bit too messy, as it would often get in the hair, which made it difficult to rinse out.  </li>

            <li> I like it  .  it can makes my face dry in a whole day .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not helpful in anyway! I&#x27;ve used it three times and it already has caused my skin to dry! My skin is also falling off because of the dryness. Also when I used it, it seemed to not take any oil off my face! Useless product!</li>
            <li> I bought this because Amazon ran out of Neutrogena&#x27;s invigorating scrub. Looking elsewhere, I found this for even cheaper, and in a bigger size. This stuff is great! It does exactly what it says, it made my skin smoother than ever, and my acne has gotten much better (even though its not really acne treatment). This stuff won&#x27;t dry out your face like other products do. There isn&#x27;t too much of a scent to it, which I like, and it&#x27;s been lasting quite a while. A this rate it may last me a total of 2 months, which is great considering the benefits and its low price. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this an oil control, at least for me. I would much rather call this a oil cleaner because this product would leave me with very smooth skin after a long day at work but wouldn&#x27;t do anything that would prevent or slow my oily skin down. I have oily skin and have been trying different products and this was one more I believe is a cleaner and not a control. I had an issue with this product as well, when I would scrub my face I noticed that when I would accidentally get some on my eye lips, they would form an almost looking stye the next day. I think this product is clogging up the ducts around my eyes and tried an experiment to try to put some on an eye and see if this was the case and it did happen. As a nursing student I understand the many areas styes can be contracted but I cleaned, washed and took extra preventive measures to mitigate as much. I tried two times with the oil control to rub a small amount (as much that could fall by accident) and both times ended up with a swollen eye lid. This product just wasn&#x27;t for me but if you need a oil cleaner this might work for you. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have tried variety of facial cleanser including more expensive ones (neutrogena, kiehl, clean and clear).&lt;br /&gt;So far, this was what I was looking for.  It pulls out oils from my face and keep it clean, which suits my purpose.  I always use moisturizer afterwards so that my skin stays not too dry.  I would strongly recommend this product for men with oily skin.  Good price and does the job.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skit. It also controls the oil very well. I use this everyday and my oily skin is clean and free from detriments and oil. Not too abrasive on the skin either.</li>
            <li> I have found teatree oil soap to do a much better job of face cleansing. There are much better choices out there for less money.</li>
            <li> Not the best and not the worst</li>
            <li> I got this for my 20 something son, and this is what he has to say about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe Controil for oily skin proves to be a nice facial cleanser. The scent is refreshing without being too strong, and it leaves your face feeling revitalized. While I&#x27;ve only used it over a handful of days, it&#x27;s been useful for helping my oily skin; however, be aware that it does dry your face out depending on how oily your skin is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using a facial lotion afterwards so that you don&#x27;t feel too dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for people with very sensitive skin, be aware this is a scrub with those rough exfoliating beads. While I had no problem, and I&#x27;m sure most won&#x27;t, it is something to consider for those with very sensitive skin. Overall, I would recommend this product for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Both my son and my husband love Axe and all their products. It keeps them smelling good which is always important. They both loved the face scrub and both found it cleaned well without any harsh reactions. A+</li>
            <li> I generally love Axe products, but this one was just okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was not that strong, and that&#x27;s one of the best reasons to use Axe. The scrub did seem to work well, and my face felt smooth afterward.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all this is actually a great product that would get rid of acne. I been having acne break out for as long as I can remember. I used so many face wash out in the market and they don&#x27;t really work as it is advertised. One thing that I loved about this product it that there is no salicylic acid!!! When I use face wash with salicylic acid, I tend to break out more. In a plus side to this is that it removes the oil in my face and with the beads it makes my face pretty smooth. The wash is not really rough that it can damage your skin but not too soft that it won&#x27;t the job. Also don&#x27;t be alarmed that this tube is kind of small, you don&#x27;t really need to put that much on, about a size of a dime would do perfectly fine. I can&#x27;t stop saying how much I love this product, I would definitely get more when I run out. (I did not buy this from Amazon, I bought it at a store near my house,  it was cheaper than the one online).</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 15 year-old son, who is obsessed with all things Axe, and who has a mild acne problem.  He uses it daily in the shower, and loves it.  He says it makes his skin feel clean and controls the acne, but that it also makes his skin feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that when he does use it his face look clean and oil-free.  And I REALLY notice that it isn&#x27;t nasty and over-stinky like some Axe products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: His acne problem is fairly mild.  I can&#x27;t speak to how it would work on severe acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Feels good, controls oil, leaves skin soft and clean, not too stinky.</li>
            <li> Great face wash designed for men. You can really feel it working as you wash your face. Has a great smell that is just right. This wash is created to help those with oily skin but I think it would work great for any guy wanting a clean face.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin.  It&#x27;s a curse, I know.  Because of that, I usually look for products that claim to handle that issue.  This Axe face wash is called &#x60;Controil&#x27; and is targeted at that particular problem.  Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t work that wonderfully, or at least for that long.  Granted, if I shower in the morning then I can get until the evening before feeling the need to wash my face again, but if I don&#x27;t have the time to shower then this product doesn&#x27;t really do the trick.  Washing my face in the morning gets me till about lunchtime or there abouts before I&#x27;m feeling the need to wash my face again.  The smell is also VERY strong and distinct and kind of off putting.  It has a very artificial smell.  I won&#x27;t be reaching for this product again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband, he always picks it up at the store but never actually buys it for himself. He really liked it and it smells nice to me and him. I think after using this, if he ran out he would actually buy this himself now! It cleans well and has a nice pleasant masculine fragrance. Did not dry his skin out either. Axe makes surprisingly good products.</li>
            <li> Axe face scrub has a nice citrus-like scent that leaves your face feeling fresh and ready to face the world.  While it does the job, I found it a bit too messy, as it would often get in the hair, which made it difficult to rinse out.  However, if you&#x27;re going to do this in the shower, than that is not an issue, but for me it was a messy product to use while on the run.  Also if you not going to completely rinse it off, it will sting your eyes, so multiple rinses could be necessary.  Besides all that it leaves face feeling clean, refreshed and never dry.</li>
            <li> I used the scrub to slough off dead skin after shaving or waxing to avoid in grown hairs. I had the teen in my house try it on their face for two weeks. I saw some improvement, however, that person has cystic acne so realistically I didn&#x27;t expect the Axe Oily Face scrub to do miracles.</li>
            <li> I like Axe face washes and I use them all the time for my oily face.  This one works just fine for me.  The only downside is that I don&#x27;t know if I like the scrubbing beads.  I know that it is labeled as a scrub, so I&#x27;m not complaining too much.  I just had hoped that the material would dissolve in water (like some do) but these do not.  If you want something exfoliating, go for this, if not, try one of the other Axe face washes.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly mediocre combination of ingredients. There isn&#x27;t a strong antibacterial and there isn&#x27;t very much grit to it (think like crushed apricot seeds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of ingredient power I tend to rank things from most effective to least effective:&lt;br /&gt;1. Benzoyl Peroxide 10%&lt;br /&gt;2. Benzoyl Peroxide 5%&lt;br /&gt;3. Salicylic Acid 2%&lt;br /&gt;4. Salicylic Acid 1%&lt;br /&gt;5. Sodium Laureth Sulfate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oxy is really in this last category... there might be some wierd ingredients like &#x27;Bambusa Arundinacea Stem Extract&#x27; but unless there&#x27;s scientific evidence, it&#x27;s hard to really know what you are paying for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product a bit lower down the scale, which might be what you&#x27;re looking for if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re struggling with outbreaks, then I can&#x27;t recommend Oxy enough [[ASIN:B001ET6XNO Oxy Maximum Action Face Wash, 6 Fl-Ounce (177 ml) (Pack of 4)]].</li>
            <li> i ordered this for myself just to try it out and it worked good for me. i know everyone is different but i would recommend this to friends and family</li>
            <li> Shame on you for allowing microbeads in your product(s). And don’t insult my intelligence by stating that you didn’t know they would be a danger to the environment. Where did you think these microbeads would end up? These micro-particle polyethylene beads, which are less than 1mm in diameter and designed to be washed down the drain, are polluting lakes and the oceans. Fish who swallow them are not getting the nutrition they need to live a healthy life, thus impacting the whole food chain. Many companies, including L’Oreal, The Body Shop, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble have agreed to phase out them out. But no one is asking the question … How in the world did you ever think these microbeads would be a good thing? It’s shameful. Avoid products with polyethylene as one of its ingredients. Microbeads have been put in facial scrub products, bath gels and toothpastes. For further information, simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li> This did a good job at removing excess oil from my face. My only complaint is that it left a thin residue in its place. You can remove the reside by washing a second time with a separate face towel, and I can understand how for some people this may be too much of a hassle to bother.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for about a year before ordering it on amazon because the local stores stopped carrying it. This stuff works great for oily skin, I haven&#x27;t found anything better. If I consistently clean my face with this, it pretty much guarantees no break outs. As soon as I skip a cleaning I can expect something to pop up, so it definitely works. I noticed that long term use also improves overall complexion and reduces pore inflammation.</li>
            <li> Good scent, good feel, good amount. Face feels clean and fresh after usage. What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> My idea of a scrub is something a bit more \\&quot;scrubby\\&quot; than this Axe Scrub. This one isn&#x27;t that great for things like helping with ingrown hairs and really exfoliating the skin. I usually buy Jack Black Face Buff - it is more \\&quot;scrubby,\\&quot; gritty and really makes your skin feel smooth and clean. It also helps a lot with the ingrown hairs from shaving and gets rid of any dry skin by exfoliating it. This Axe cannot do all of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe scrub is more like a gel cleanser with softer and less beads in it. It is ok as a cleanser and does a good job of cleansing the skin and somewhat controlling the oil, but it is not preferred as a scrub. The skin feels clean, but nothing like when Jack Black, or a few other preferred brands are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 stars, but I am very picky with my idea of a \\&quot;scrub,\\&quot; so it is very likely that someone else may like this product better.</li>
            <li> Great scrub! Works to get dirt off the face and smells nice. It also leaves you clean without dryness or sticky feeling! I am buying more! Beats st.ives and has a clean manly scent which&lt;br /&gt;Is not too strong!</li>
            <li> Works really well gets in and cleans down deep and leaves you feeling clean after</li>
            <li> This does not have a lemon scent. I like lemon scents, and I always think when I see yellow it&#x27;ll be lemon, this isn&#x27;t. It does have a very nice manly scent and it isn&#x27;t bad, it just isn&#x27;t lemon. So if you think it is lemon because it is dyed yellow, it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does however seem to clean very very well. I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands recently and I like this one the best. I have very oily skin and it cleans it very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally it has little exfoliating bits in it. Many face washes claim to have the little beads, but often there aren&#x27;t enough, or they aren&#x27;t abrasive enough, or they settle to the bottom of the bottle and they never come out. This bottle is designed to dispense from the bottom, so the latter problem is not encountered. Additionally it has plenty of beads and they&#x27;re quite abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, I think I&#x27;ll buy it again, though I do wish for a lemon scent, I find it refreshing.</li>
