            <li>Again, the best cleaner I ever used and this also is being discontinued.  </li>

            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>They loved it!</li>
            <li>So happy I can get this at a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great customer service.</li>
            <li>Great product, I have used it for years</li>
            <li>I have used MD Forte for years and at 56 my skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be a happy camper.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT..</li>
            <li>GREAT</li>
            <li>Been using for 20 years and have great skin at 45</li>
            <li>But otherwise, I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>My skin looks great....</li>
            <li>People often tell me how great my skin looks</li>
            <li>so good.  </li>
            <li>IT IS A SUPERIOR PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>Always loved this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li>It does not instruct you to do this on the bottle, but I&#x27;ve found this to be the best method, in addition to not diluting the glycolic acid with water right off the bat!  </li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is that it has a higher glycolic content which is really good for the skin.</li>
            <li>My products were delivered as scheduled and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have used most of the MD Forte III products and have had great results.  </li>
            <li>and it is one of the best and worth the cost to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I find that after I shave in the shower and then use MD Forte 3 right afterwards I get the best results.</li>
            <li>i love this cleanser!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best used if makeup is wiped or washed off first</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, does exactly what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;Years</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Very effective product where you can easily see results over time.  </li>
            <li>I think this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I did use level II for a year and really liked that as well.  </li>
            <li>Glad you had it and at a good price.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the greatest face wash on the planet!</li>
            <li>I also have the MD Forte cream for which nicely plumps up my skin by the morning.</li>
            <li>It just makes my face feel great being clean.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect with the Clarasonic as it isn&#x27;t high foaming.  </li>
            <li>Despite my extremely sensitive skin, it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The company is replacing it with something that will cost more and is not as effective as MD Forte.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, however, this is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>so the prescription cream is more effective.    </li>
            <li>wonderful cleanser for mature skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a must for young and aging skin it with make it look wonderful.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>Decided to see if level III would be better for discoloration, etc.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product many years ago..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Many people find M.D. Forte I sufficient for their needs.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>But yes, love love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is better than this and its off the market.</li>
            <li>In my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s, the oiliness reduced, but was rewarded with a lot more clogged pores.  </li>
            <li>Ever since, and we are talking many many years, I have used this line of products.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the moisturizers or &amp;#34;toners&amp;#34; but I LOVE the cleansers....</li>
            <li>so I felt confident I would like it.</li>
            <li>I find it effective as a light wash that gets the oil off the skin and keeps it off.</li>
            <li>Love this glycolic cleanser.</li>
            <li>the top portion of it falls out whenever I squeeze the bottle.</li>
            <li>The price is better on line than in the dermatologist&#x27;s office and it arrived soon than projected.</li>
            <li>MD Forte cleanser also better prepares my skin for prescription Renova</li>
            <li>I have been using it for many years</li>
            <li>Perfect for low grade glycol in peel too!</li>
            <li>I love M.D. Forte and worked myself up to level III.</li>
            <li>I bought this cleanser as a gift for two people at Christmas and they both love it.</li>
            <li>But it works so much better than my cleanser alone.</li>
            <li>Works even better with a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to see it being sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li>Much more convenient than going to my dermatologist office to purchase.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 4 years</li>
            <li>This product has done more for my acne-prone skin than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>This is just ok.  </li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t look better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results using the Cor Silver bar and even Walmarts Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>love it, it works.</li>
            <li>I am so glad the&lt;br /&gt;dermatology suggested it.</li>
            <li>Very nice product for really making a difference.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind: this cleanser works best on dry skin!  </li>
            <li>It does not irritate my sensitive skin but does a great job.</li>
            <li>I used the other two levels but like the III best!</li>
            <li>So far so good, I am pleased with the product</li>
            <li>The product is strong.  </li>
            <li>Also remember to use a strong SPF moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Wonderfully effective, very gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>Hands down, one of the best cleansers on the market.</li>
            <li>It has also helped diminish fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It also helps with fine lines and brightening the skin.  </li>
            <li>This product just seems to have skipped the fancy packaging and put the value in the product, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>I love this hard to find product, it works great and doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li>I used to get huge cycstic acne along my jawline</li>
            <li>The is a creamy facial cleanser that is great on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Still a great product and the same formula.</li>
            <li>I sent them an email and the owner called and apologized about the mix up and sent me the product free of charge.  </li>
            <li>Love this facial cleanser, by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Following this routine has greatly reduced the break-outs.  </li>
            <li>With free shipping on Amazon, I find the price to be unbeatable.</li>
            <li>Do not use it if it is given to you for free.</li>
            <li>I use it both a.m. and p.m and follow up with a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Just a great product that actually does make a difference have used it for years.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is Soap Free and Alcohol Free</li>
            <li>My skin really looks pretty good, no wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I had originally got this from my dermatologist who gave me the II then the III.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist originally started me on this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I feel like it gets my face clean in the evening without soap.</li>
            <li>Tried this product years ago under care of a dermatologist to clean and brighten my complexion.</li>
            <li>this cleanser leaves your skin feeling extremely clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face clean as a whistle.</li>
            <li>and it gets rid of them quickly makes my skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li>My skin gets really clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I am 75 yrs old and get many compliments on my smooth and wrinkle free skin.</li>
            <li>I am trying to find out if there is some kind of class action lawsuit against this company.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for years, however on this particular bottle</li>
            <li>, I cannot be without it, it keeps my skin clear, soft, and has a great impact keeping my skin to glow.</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin soft which is great because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and break out very easily.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I love that it prevents break outs and helps my skin look clear.  </li>
            <li>I have tried thousands of dollars worth of products in my life to treat my problematic skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used the MD formulations products for years and this cleanser is by far my favorite thing that I cannot do without.</li>
            <li>My blackheads aren&#x27;t complete gone, but they are so much better than they used to be.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about trying it, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>These products are worth every dime.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and quick service</li>
            <li>I love MD Forte III because it&#x27;s a strong exfoliant but doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I get positive comments all the time from people who don&#x27;t even know me!  </li>
            <li>I have used for the past year and my skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li>As a teenager, my skin was fair, sensitive, prone to breakouts, an occasional cystic acne flare up.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years and if I am diligent in it&#x27;s use,I can see a real difference in my 53 year old,</li>
            <li>Ladies, I have been told my skin is fabulous by professional facialists!  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love the MD forte facial cleanser III.</li>
            <li>It has glycolic acid as an ingredient, so if you have never used it, start slowly at first.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is terrific cleanser that does so much more than cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li>You must be consistent with this product, as any product, and follow up with the MD Forte moistuizer.</li>
            <li>I discontinue it&#x27;s use in the summer when I am outside a lot since it causes you to sunburn more readily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels tingly and the first week</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better and this is a big part of the reason.</li>
            <li>No breakout since first bottle.</li>
            <li>Other cleansers in the product line contain NO glycolic acid and may work better for more sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>They tell me their face feels so clean and the cleanser is helping to keep their skin clear.</li>
            <li>After washing my face with this product my skin feels clean and soft.    </li>
            <li>The other day my husband&#x27;s co-workers were surprised to find out how old I am because my skin looks so great</li>
            <li>I still have large pores, breakouts and excess oil.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT go straight to III, follow directions and start with I.  </li>
            <li>Both products have been discontinued by the manufacturer, much to my dismay.</li>
            <li>I really like the M.D. product&#x27;s with the glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>After you&#x27;re done, gentle rub your face to remove residue.</li>
            <li>It does not remove eye makeup very well (and it isn&#x27;t meant for that, it will sting the eyes).</li>
            <li>Really smooths the skin.</li>
            <li>It just cleans and exfoliates very well.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin prone to break-outs.  </li>
            <li>now they thought I was much younger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
            <li>and I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Even on back of my hands which have far fewer age spots rhan most of my friends.</li>
            <li>It is my all-time favorite cleanser - along with the other products: lotion, moisturizer, etc.</li>
            <li>This controles my acne riddles aging skin better than any other product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>For anyone who wants to use this product, check with your dermatologist first what level of MD Forte Facial Cleanser is right for your skin.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend to others with very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser,my skin is smoother and lines are less visable.</li>
            <li>I am particularly amazed at how it literally shrunk the bags under my eyes--to the point that my mother asked if I had had surgery.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if individuals with sensitivities would want to try something so strong, but it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all of the MD products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It really worked, and I had baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>It has kept my skin very clear</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that has always been prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin, I would begin with MD Forte I or II.</li>
            <li>I would recomend starting with the M.D. 2 first before going onto the 3 to allow your skin to adjust.</li>
            <li>I get better results from this than any other facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>MD Forte is the ONLY product that has consistently cleared up acne/blackheads.  </li>
            <li>It cleans effectively without drying my skin, and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my sensitive, congested combination skin clear of debris!</li>
            <li>This caused zero breakouts and my face is always clear with this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Only once a day, but really like the softness of my skin after I use it.  </li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter uses the level 2.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but this cleanser has not irritated it.</li>
            <li>Also helped with some of my old acne scars.</li>
            <li>When my face feels too sensitive I do switch over to Cetaphil sensitive skin wash.</li>
            <li>I am now 57 years old, going on 58.  </li>
            <li>Within a month, my skin had completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seventy years old.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money spent</li>
            <li>You can even find better prices for the same things they sell with less hassle!</li>
            <li>I love this product but not willing pay the close out extreme prices.  </li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ve returned to M.D. Forte for the same thing as I get older.</li>
            <li>I have at least one person per week tell me that I have nice skin, which is great, because I was stupid about the sun when I was young.</li>
            <li>Most think I am much younger because I have very few wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used glycolic acid products before, I would highly recommend starting with the I or II.  </li>
            <li>These are some of the products I use that promotes peeling but also will leave the skin pretty sensitive: other glycolic acid products, salicylic acid, Rx tazorac, retinAs, benzol peroxide 10%, clindamycin 1%.</li>
            <li>This product seems to clean my skin thoroughly, yet also calms down the redness at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I only use at bedtime and just rinse in morning with clear water.</li>
            <li>Used MD Forte 2 in the past, expected better results with this product, but it didn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li>This has kept my adult moderate acne prone skin in check!  </li>
            <li>No matter how tired at night I make sure to cleanse my face..</li>
            <li>I love this product as it helps sloth off dead skin, especially whenever Im using other products that promote peeling.</li>
            <li>My skin looks less dull and more clear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 29 year old male and have used several brands throughout the years trying to get rid of my blackheads.</li>
            <li>so the cleanser does not dry up my face skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is ULTRA sensitive on top of all my other issues and this product works without irritating or drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s less than $5 a month, which really isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and starting to get fine lines, and until I started using this product I had never had a single day without at least one zit.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to the M.D. Forte line of products, it&#x27;s recommended you begin with M.D. Forte Facial Cleanser I before moving on to the II or III versions, to lessen any effects caused by the glycolic acids--I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction using any of their products, but some with more sensitive skin types may.</li>
            <li>I live where is it is extremely humid and</li>

            <li> And use MD Forte &#x27;lotion&#x27; with it, for best results!</li>
            <li> The best skin product I have ever used</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.</li>
            <li> i have been using this stuff for 10 years, it is the best.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a great cleanse!  </li>
            <li> Been using this for years and works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> One of the best cleansers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Gotta love a product that works!!!</li>
            <li> Loved it!</li>
            <li> They loved it!</li>
            <li> So happy I can get this at a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have used it for years</li>
            <li> I have used MD Forte for years and at 56 my skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be a happy camper.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT..</li>
            <li> GREAT</li>
            <li> Been using for 20 years and have great skin at 45</li>
            <li> But otherwise, I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great....</li>
            <li> People often tell me how great my skin looks</li>
            <li> so good.  </li>
            <li> IT IS A SUPERIOR PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> Always loved this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> It does not instruct you to do this on the bottle, but I&#x27;ve found this to be the best method, in addition to not diluting the glycolic acid with water right off the bat!  </li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is that it has a higher glycolic content which is really good for the skin.</li>
            <li> My products were delivered as scheduled and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used most of the MD Forte III products and have had great results.  </li>
            <li> and it is one of the best and worth the cost to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I find that after I shave in the shower and then use MD Forte 3 right afterwards I get the best results.</li>
            <li> i love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best used if makeup is wiped or washed off first</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, does exactly what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;Years</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I Love this product!  </li>
            <li> Very effective product where you can easily see results over time.  </li>
            <li> I think this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I did use level II for a year and really liked that as well.  </li>
            <li> Glad you had it and at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the greatest face wash on the planet!</li>
            <li> I also have the MD Forte cream for which nicely plumps up my skin by the morning.</li>
            <li> It just makes my face feel great being clean.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect with the Clarasonic as it isn&#x27;t high foaming.  </li>
            <li> Despite my extremely sensitive skin, it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The company is replacing it with something that will cost more and is not as effective as MD Forte.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, however, this is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> so the prescription cream is more effective.    </li>
            <li> wonderful cleanser for mature skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a must for young and aging skin it with make it look wonderful.</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> Decided to see if level III would be better for discoloration, etc.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product many years ago..</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Many people find M.D. Forte I sufficient for their needs.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> But yes, love love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is better than this and its off the market.</li>
            <li> In my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s, the oiliness reduced, but was rewarded with a lot more clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> Ever since, and we are talking many many years, I have used this line of products.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the moisturizers or &amp;#34;toners&amp;#34; but I LOVE the cleansers....</li>
            <li> so I felt confident I would like it.</li>
            <li> I find it effective as a light wash that gets the oil off the skin and keeps it off.</li>
            <li> Love this glycolic cleanser.</li>
            <li> the top portion of it falls out whenever I squeeze the bottle.</li>
            <li> The price is better on line than in the dermatologist&#x27;s office and it arrived soon than projected.</li>
            <li> MD Forte cleanser also better prepares my skin for prescription Renova</li>
            <li> I have been using it for many years</li>
            <li> Perfect for low grade glycol in peel too!</li>
            <li> I love M.D. Forte and worked myself up to level III.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser as a gift for two people at Christmas and they both love it.</li>
            <li> But it works so much better than my cleanser alone.</li>
            <li> Works even better with a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to see it being sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Much more convenient than going to my dermatologist office to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 4 years</li>
            <li> This product has done more for my acne-prone skin than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> This is just ok.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t look better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results using the Cor Silver bar and even Walmarts Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> love it, it works.</li>
            <li> I am so glad the&lt;br /&gt;dermatology suggested it.</li>
            <li> Very nice product for really making a difference.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind: this cleanser works best on dry skin!  </li>
            <li> It does not irritate my sensitive skin but does a great job.</li>
            <li> I used the other two levels but like the III best!</li>
            <li> So far so good, I am pleased with the product</li>
            <li> The product is strong.  </li>
            <li> Also remember to use a strong SPF moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Wonderfully effective, very gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> Hands down, one of the best cleansers on the market.</li>
            <li> It has also helped diminish fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It also helps with fine lines and brightening the skin.  </li>
            <li> This product just seems to have skipped the fancy packaging and put the value in the product, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li> I love this hard to find product, it works great and doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> I used to get huge cycstic acne along my jawline</li>
            <li> The is a creamy facial cleanser that is great on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Still a great product and the same formula.</li>
            <li> I sent them an email and the owner called and apologized about the mix up and sent me the product free of charge.  </li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser, by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Following this routine has greatly reduced the break-outs.  </li>
            <li> With free shipping on Amazon, I find the price to be unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Do not use it if it is given to you for free.</li>
            <li> I use it both a.m. and p.m and follow up with a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Just a great product that actually does make a difference have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is Soap Free and Alcohol Free</li>
            <li> My skin really looks pretty good, no wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I had originally got this from my dermatologist who gave me the II then the III.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist originally started me on this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I feel like it gets my face clean in the evening without soap.</li>
            <li> Tried this product years ago under care of a dermatologist to clean and brighten my complexion.</li>
            <li> this cleanser leaves your skin feeling extremely clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face clean as a whistle.</li>
            <li> and it gets rid of them quickly makes my skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li> My skin gets really clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am 75 yrs old and get many compliments on my smooth and wrinkle free skin.</li>
            <li> I am trying to find out if there is some kind of class action lawsuit against this company.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years, however on this particular bottle</li>
            <li> , I cannot be without it, it keeps my skin clear, soft, and has a great impact keeping my skin to glow.</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin soft which is great because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and break out very easily.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I love that it prevents break outs and helps my skin look clear.  </li>
            <li> I have tried thousands of dollars worth of products in my life to treat my problematic skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used the MD formulations products for years and this cleanser is by far my favorite thing that I cannot do without.</li>
            <li> My blackheads aren&#x27;t complete gone, but they are so much better than they used to be.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about trying it, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> These products are worth every dime.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and quick service</li>
            <li> I love MD Forte III because it&#x27;s a strong exfoliant but doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I get positive comments all the time from people who don&#x27;t even know me!  </li>
            <li> I have used for the past year and my skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> As a teenager, my skin was fair, sensitive, prone to breakouts, an occasional cystic acne flare up.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years and if I am diligent in it&#x27;s use,I can see a real difference in my 53 year old,</li>
            <li> Ladies, I have been told my skin is fabulous by professional facialists!  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love the MD forte facial cleanser III.</li>
            <li> It has glycolic acid as an ingredient, so if you have never used it, start slowly at first.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is terrific cleanser that does so much more than cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li> You must be consistent with this product, as any product, and follow up with the MD Forte moistuizer.</li>
            <li> I discontinue it&#x27;s use in the summer when I am outside a lot since it causes you to sunburn more readily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels tingly and the first week</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better and this is a big part of the reason.</li>
            <li> No breakout since first bottle.</li>
            <li> Other cleansers in the product line contain NO glycolic acid and may work better for more sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> They tell me their face feels so clean and the cleanser is helping to keep their skin clear.</li>
            <li> After washing my face with this product my skin feels clean and soft.    </li>
            <li> The other day my husband&#x27;s co-workers were surprised to find out how old I am because my skin looks so great</li>
            <li> I still have large pores, breakouts and excess oil.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT go straight to III, follow directions and start with I.  </li>
            <li> Both products have been discontinued by the manufacturer, much to my dismay.</li>
            <li> I really like the M.D. product&#x27;s with the glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> After you&#x27;re done, gentle rub your face to remove residue.</li>
            <li> It does not remove eye makeup very well (and it isn&#x27;t meant for that, it will sting the eyes).</li>
            <li> Really smooths the skin.</li>
            <li> It just cleans and exfoliates very well.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin prone to break-outs.  </li>
            <li> now they thought I was much younger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
            <li> and I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Even on back of my hands which have far fewer age spots rhan most of my friends.</li>
            <li> It is my all-time favorite cleanser - along with the other products: lotion, moisturizer, etc.</li>
            <li> This controles my acne riddles aging skin better than any other product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants to use this product, check with your dermatologist first what level of MD Forte Facial Cleanser is right for your skin.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend to others with very oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser,my skin is smoother and lines are less visable.</li>
            <li> I am particularly amazed at how it literally shrunk the bags under my eyes--to the point that my mother asked if I had had surgery.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if individuals with sensitivities would want to try something so strong, but it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all of the MD products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It really worked, and I had baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> It has kept my skin very clear</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that has always been prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin, I would begin with MD Forte I or II.</li>
            <li> I would recomend starting with the M.D. 2 first before going onto the 3 to allow your skin to adjust.</li>
            <li> I get better results from this than any other facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> MD Forte is the ONLY product that has consistently cleared up acne/blackheads.  </li>
            <li> It cleans effectively without drying my skin, and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my sensitive, congested combination skin clear of debris!</li>
            <li> This caused zero breakouts and my face is always clear with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Only once a day, but really like the softness of my skin after I use it.  </li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter uses the level 2.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this cleanser has not irritated it.</li>
            <li> Also helped with some of my old acne scars.</li>
            <li> When my face feels too sensitive I do switch over to Cetaphil sensitive skin wash.</li>
            <li> I am now 57 years old, going on 58.  </li>
            <li> Within a month, my skin had completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seventy years old.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money spent</li>
            <li> You can even find better prices for the same things they sell with less hassle!</li>
            <li> I love this product but not willing pay the close out extreme prices.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve returned to M.D. Forte for the same thing as I get older.</li>
            <li> I have at least one person per week tell me that I have nice skin, which is great, because I was stupid about the sun when I was young.</li>
            <li> Most think I am much younger because I have very few wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used glycolic acid products before, I would highly recommend starting with the I or II.  </li>
            <li> These are some of the products I use that promotes peeling but also will leave the skin pretty sensitive: other glycolic acid products, salicylic acid, Rx tazorac, retinAs, benzol peroxide 10%, clindamycin 1%.</li>
            <li> This product seems to clean my skin thoroughly, yet also calms down the redness at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I only use at bedtime and just rinse in morning with clear water.</li>
            <li> Used MD Forte 2 in the past, expected better results with this product, but it didn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> This has kept my adult moderate acne prone skin in check!  </li>
            <li> No matter how tired at night I make sure to cleanse my face..</li>
            <li> I love this product as it helps sloth off dead skin, especially whenever Im using other products that promote peeling.</li>
            <li> My skin looks less dull and more clear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old male and have used several brands throughout the years trying to get rid of my blackheads.</li>
            <li> so the cleanser does not dry up my face skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is ULTRA sensitive on top of all my other issues and this product works without irritating or drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s less than $5 a month, which really isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and starting to get fine lines, and until I started using this product I had never had a single day without at least one zit.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to the M.D. Forte line of products, it&#x27;s recommended you begin with M.D. Forte Facial Cleanser I before moving on to the II or III versions, to lessen any effects caused by the glycolic acids--I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction using any of their products, but some with more sensitive skin types may.</li>
            <li> I live where is it is extremely humid and</li>
            <li> You can also leave it for 10 minutes on dry skin and it doubles as a mini glycolic facial.  </li>
            <li> remember to ALWAYS pay dry only!!!</li>
            <li> Could not live without this facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It goes a long way.    </li>
            <li> If you leave it on too long, it will irritate your face.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> My doctor prescribed multiple medications, creams, and cleansers that all made my acne improve, but never really made it disappear.</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t skip a night washing my face, I never get breakouts anymore either.</li>
            <li> I apply it to dry skin, then add a little water, use circular motion, then wash off completely.  </li>
            <li> If you are new to products with Glycolic Acid start with the 1 (mildest) then eventually after your skin is use to the exfoliation treatment you will get from using Glycolic Acid then slowly move up to the 11 and possibly the 111 (strongest) after some time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff &amp; it is hard to find lately!</li>
            <li> But it just doesn&#x27;t give that tingle the other one does.. or produce the same results.</li>
            <li> I have tried other face products and I keep coming back to MD Forte.  </li>
            <li> The other essential for me is that it is unscented.</li>
            <li> But after testing other products, I am back to this</li>
            <li> Sometimes, my face will look like it&#x27;s getting too dry, so I will skip it for a night or two.</li>
            <li> I have pretty tough skin</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit too.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out or make it flaky the way a lot of other products do.</li>
            <li> This product gives the extra push to remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> I swear my mother is looking younger everyday with this.</li>
            <li> A very small amount goes a long way - face feels clean and I have never experienced any irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> So I ran out and started experimenting with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> ON THE OTHER HAND</li>
            <li> I use it every day, along with other MD Forte products.  </li>
            <li> I use Aveeno Active Naturals moisturizer and the combination works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the MD Forte line is no longer made, so if you can find this at a reasonable price get it now.</li>
            <li> I started with MD facial cleanser I and have slowly moved to III.  </li>
            <li> I ordered an MD Forte masque and face wash a month and a half ago.</li>
            <li> For those of you concerned about the price, a bottle typically lasts me 4 months with twice a day use.</li>
            <li> Level III is a little thicker than level II.  </li>
            <li> Have been using MD Forte III for a few years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on $80 facials for skin peels.</li>
            <li> but it should in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but a few on my chin and forehead every month or so</li>
            <li> I purchased it from my dermatologist office a few years ago and have been trying to fix my skin ever since.  </li>
            <li> Diminishes pore size scuffs off dead skin.</li>
            <li> He was the same derm who realized that I needed accutane when all else failed, when all other doctors kept experimenting.</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for a few minutes to sink into my skin</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be shocked by how much makeup,oil and dirt remained trapped in your pores.     </li>
            <li> I usually use the M.D. Forte moisterizer and face mask too.</li>
            <li> I bought all I could, and am deeply sorry I could not afford to buy out every last bottle of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I had used Forte I and II in the past</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expensive, but the last bottle I bought lasted me almost 8 months.</li>
            <li> I am miserable to know that this product is not going to be available anymore.  </li>
            <li> I use it almost every night &amp; leave it on for at least 5 minutes before washing it off.</li>
            <li> I had a small amount of irritation, but after that I&#x27;ve had no problem!</li>
            <li> During pregnancy, my skin seemed to get even worse.  </li>
            <li> They were unapologetic and could careless if I kept waiting or cancelled my order.</li>
            <li> soooooo sad.</li>
            <li> but after using MD Forte since 2005 I am sorry to see it go.</li>
            <li> And I have purchased a lot of very expensive skin products including prescription pills creams and cleaners.</li>
            <li> It is that bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have been using MD Forte III for a few years. It is my all-time favorite cleanser - along with the other products: lotion, moisturizer, etc. So happy I can get this at a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product but not willing pay the close out extreme prices.  What are suggestions for the III cleanser?</li>
            <li> i love this cleanser! been using it for years and my skin has improved dramatically. i highly recommend to others with very oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for years and I still love it. I feel like it gets my face clean in the evening without soap.</li>
            <li> so good.  I&#x27;ve used this for 3 weeks now.  Only once a day, but really like the softness of my skin after I use it.  I have problem skin (acne) and am over 30.  This has kept my skin in check and I have seen my pores get smaller on my nose.  I did use level II for a year and really liked that as well.  Decided to see if level III would be better for discoloration, etc.</li>
            <li> I was using MD Forte 2 from my dermatologist and decided to step up to 3. So far so good, I am pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Love this stuff &amp; it is hard to find lately! Glad you had it and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I started with MD facial cleanser I and have slowly moved to III.  This product along with the lotion makes my skin just glow!  I love it.  DO NOT go straight to III, follow directions and start with I.  The product is strong.  Definitely worth the money.  After a week, you will definitely notice changes.  Again, follow the directions!</li>
            <li> The is a creamy facial cleanser that is great on the skin.  I have used for the past year and my skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and quick service</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.  A very small amount goes a long way - face feels clean and I have never experienced any irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for twenty years to control acne.  I love that it prevents break outs and helps my skin look clear.  It has also helped diminish fine lines.  I have always used this cleanser with the Facial Lotion.  Both products have been discontinued by the manufacturer, much to my dismay.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist. Despite my extremely sensitive skin, it works wonderfully. I do highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product many years ago..maybe 10?...Loved it! Turned all my girlfriends onto it! They loved it! So I ran out and started experimenting with other cleansers. FINALLY came back and cannot believe the difference. Will never be without it again. Don&#x27;t waste money on $80 facials for skin peels. Don&#x27;t need them!</li>
            <li> I have used MD Forte for several years now. Amazon has the best prices. I have at least one person per week tell me that I have nice skin, which is great, because I was stupid about the sun when I was young. I&#x27;ve been using the level 3 for quite awhile. My 16 year old daughter uses the level 2.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser,my skin is smoother and lines are less visable. I really like the M.D. product&#x27;s with the glycolic acid. I would recomend starting with the M.D. 2 first before going onto the 3 to allow your skin to adjust.</li>
            <li> I ordered an MD Forte masque and face wash a month and a half ago. They sent the masque and not the wash. I finally contacted THEM and they said their order hasn&#x27;t come in yet but it should in a few weeks. They were unapologetic and could careless if I kept waiting or cancelled my order. They sold me an item they never even had and since I decided to wait, I am STILL waiting for it! They should have received their shipment 10days ago. And yet again, I haven&#x27;t heard a word from the company. This  place is fraudulent I would never order from them again and I warn others not to order from  them too! You can even find better prices for the same things they sell with less hassle!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist and is the best cleanser I have ever used.  It makes my face feel soft and smooth.  I use III, but you might want to start out with the milder  version of I or II.  People have noticed how my skin looks.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Tried this product years ago under care of a dermatologist to clean and brighten my complexion. Now, I&#x27;ve returned to M.D. Forte for the same thing as I get older. Still a great product and the same formula. Hands down, one of the best cleansers on the market. Now you can purchase it without a prescription. I usually use the M.D. Forte moisterizer and face mask too. You only need to use a little bit too. It goes a long way.    Don&#x27;t believe me? Try this: after you&#x27;ve cleansed with your usual product, steam your face for ten minutes--easily done by draping a white towel over your head and bending over a pot of hot water on the stove. Set the timer. After you&#x27;re done, gentle rub your face to remove residue. Look at the towel. You&#x27;ll be shocked by how much makeup,oil and dirt remained trapped in your pores.     Do a comparison with M.D. Forte. You&#x27;ll be convinced. If you&#x27;re new to the M.D. Forte line of products, it&#x27;s recommended you begin with M.D. Forte Facial Cleanser I before moving on to the II or III versions, to lessen any effects caused by the glycolic acids--I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction using any of their products, but some with more sensitive skin types may. Many people find M.D. Forte I sufficient for their needs. Other cleansers in the product line contain NO glycolic acid and may work better for more sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> This facial cleansere is for the woman who has worked her way up from MDForte I and then II.  Between RetinaA, and this cleanser, I have a flawless complexion.</li>
            <li> I placed the order in April and there was a delay in getting the product.  I sent them an email and the owner called and apologized about the mix up and sent me the product free of charge.  Great customer service.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  The best thing about this product is that it has a higher glycolic content which is really good for the skin. I started with MD Facial I then II which also have glycolic content and gradually move to III.  My dermatologists bump me to MD FORTE Facial Cleanser III because it is recommended.  I use this cleanser day and night and all you need is about a quarter size to put in the face then use a facial scrub (clairsonic). After washing my face with this product my skin feels clean and soft.    FYI - For anyone who wants to use this product, check with your dermatologist first what level of MD Forte Facial Cleanser is right for your skin.  Everyone has different skin.</li>
            <li> I love the MD forte facial cleanser III. My skin feels softer since I&#x27;ve been using it. I have sensitive skin, but this cleanser has not irritated it. However, if you like a cleanser with suds or foam this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have used it for years</li>
            <li> I have used MD Forte for years and at 56 my skin looks and feels great.  Most think I am much younger because I have very few wrinkles.  I am always looking for deals on all MD Forte products and Amazon had the best.  My products were delivered as scheduled and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser, by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I have sensitive skin and break out very easily. This caused zero breakouts and my face is always clear with this cleanser. LOVE it. Also helped with some of my old acne scars.</li>
            <li> Could not live without this facial cleanser.  I live where is it is extremely humid and this cleanser leaves your skin feeling extremely clean.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it helps sloth off dead skin, especially whenever Im using other products that promote peeling. This product gives the extra push to remove dead skin. This product will sting; however, if you are using an aggressive exfoliating regimen which I tend to so some times, I wouldnt use this product. When my face feels too sensitive I do switch over to Cetaphil sensitive skin wash. These are some of the products I use that promotes peeling but also will leave the skin pretty sensitive: other glycolic acid products, salicylic acid, Rx tazorac, retinAs, benzol peroxide 10%, clindamycin 1%. (of course not all at once)  But yes, love love this stuff.  Oh final note: I had to work myself up to III. I started out at I, then went to II, and now have been at level III for years. My derm put me on to this product and I cant thank him enough. He was the same derm who realized that I needed accutane when all else failed, when all other doctors kept experimenting. He cleared me of pizza face and if I were still in the DC metro area, I would still see him for maintenance. Dr. Thomas Day in Baltimore, MD!</li>
            <li> This controles my acne riddles aging skin better than any other product I have ever purchased. And I have purchased a lot of very expensive skin products including prescription pills creams and cleaners.</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than this and its off the market. soooooo sad. Using it since 2002.</li>
            <li> There was another MDF product I once used that was translucent. It really worked, and I had baby soft skin. That one was 20% glycolic acid. This one is 30% I believe. But it just doesn&#x27;t give that tingle the other one does.. or produce the same results.</li>
            <li> I am now 57 years old, going on 58.  Ladies, I have been told my skin is fabulous by professional facialists!  As a teenager, my skin was fair, sensitive, prone to breakouts, an occasional cystic acne flare up.  In my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s, the oiliness reduced, but was rewarded with a lot more clogged pores.  I have tried thousands of dollars worth of products in my life to treat my problematic skin.  I was told to use this product by a dermatologist in Ohio who knows his stuff.  Ever since, and we are talking many many years, I have used this line of products.  I didn&#x27;t care for the moisturizers or &amp;#34;toners&amp;#34; but I LOVE the cleansers....have used the gel formulation for those oilier years with blessed results, and then changed over to the II creamy cleanser, then changed again to the III creamy cleanser.  I am miserable to know that this product is not going to be available anymore.  I bought all I could, and am deeply sorry I could not afford to buy out every last bottle of this stuff.  My skin is ULTRA sensitive on top of all my other issues and this product works without irritating or drying out my skin.  I have had noticeable improvements in my skin and even my facialist said this product if perfect for my complexion.  I get positive comments all the time from people who don&#x27;t even know me!  Now if I can only get the company to re-think their decision to end production!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 7 or 8 yrs.  I am 75 yrs old and get many compliments on my smooth and wrinkle free skin.</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever used on my face, but discontinued...now I have to find a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have been getting glycolic treatments for years with noticeable improvements of my skin. I had used Forte I and II in the past so I felt confident I would like it. The level of  glycolic in this product feels  like mini treatments every day! I have pretty tough skin so I&#x27;m not sure if individuals with sensitivities would want to try something so strong, but it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for! I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful wash with a hefty dose of glycolic acid. I find it effective as a light wash that gets the oil off the skin and keeps it off. It is not abrasive and does not sting, but if someone hasn&#x27;t used glycolic acid washes before I wouldn&#x27;t start with Level III. There are Levels I and II. It does not remove eye makeup very well (and it isn&#x27;t meant for that, it will sting the eyes). It&#x27;s best used if makeup is wiped or washed off first and then this is used as the second wash. Unfortunately, the MD Forte line is no longer made, so if you can find this at a reasonable price get it now. The closest equivalent that I can find is Glytone, but 20% is the highest concentration of glycolic acid I have found in that line. I will probably switch to Glytone eventually but after using MD Forte since 2005 I am sorry to see it go.</li>
            <li> even at my age, 58 I still get break outs. I find that after I shave in the shower and then use MD Forte 3 right afterwards I get the best results. I have been hooked!!</li>
            <li> Love this glycolic cleanser. Leaves your face clean as a whistle. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend starting with number III to avoid any irritation.  Start with the number one and progress.  I think you&#x27;ll be a happy camper. The price is comparable to what I paid in the &#x27;90s. I only use at bedtime and just rinse in morning with clear water. Really smooths the skin. Made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years, however on this particular bottle the top portion of it falls out whenever I squeeze the bottle. Hopefully the next one won&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li> I have used the MD formulations products for years and this cleanser is by far my favorite thing that I cannot do without.No matter how tired at night I make sure to cleanse my face..It just makes my face feel great being clean.I highly recommend all of the MD products.</li>
            <li> I have tried other face products and I keep coming back to MD Forte.  It just cleans and exfoliates very well.  The price is better on line than in the dermatologist&#x27;s office and it arrived soon than projected.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that has always been prone to breakouts.  This product seems to clean my skin thoroughly, yet also calms down the redness at the same time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. Now that it has been discontinued I don&#x27;t know what I should buy to replace it.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.. I SAW RESULTS IN DAYS. ON THE OTHER HAND MY DAUGHTER DIDN&#x27;T. I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON THE SEVERITY  OF ACNE YOU HAVE</li>
            <li> IT IS A SUPERIOR PRODUCT.  IT DOES WORK AND WORK WELL.  USE IT AS A PRE-SHAVE APPLICATION.  MY LAST THREE WORDS...........GREAT</li>
            <li> Again, the best cleaner I ever used and this also is being discontinued.  The company is replacing it with something that will cost more and is not as effective as MD Forte.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for about 4 years.  If you&#x27;ve never used glycolic acid products before, I would highly recommend starting with the I or II.  This is a cream cleanser that does not foam.  I apply it to dry skin, then add a little water, use circular motion, then wash off completely.  You can also leave it for 10 minutes on dry skin and it doubles as a mini glycolic facial.  It does not instruct you to do this on the bottle, but I&#x27;ve found this to be the best method, in addition to not diluting the glycolic acid with water right off the bat!  I have used most of the MD Forte III products and have had great results.  I used to get huge cycstic acne along my jawline and since I&#x27;ve used these products, I have not had this problem in years.  It also helps with fine lines and brightening the skin.  FYI, I&#x27;m 38, with fair/normal skin.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the greatest face wash on the planet! I have sensitive skin, however, this is perfect for my skin. It has glycolic acid as an ingredient, so if you have never used it, start slowly at first. I use it twice a day, morning and night, I cannot be without it, it keeps my skin clear, soft, and has a great impact keeping my skin to glow. Highly Recommend! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use it every day, along with other MD Forte products.  I get better results from this than any other facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  Keeps my skin younger looking and glowing.</li>
            <li> I have been using MD Forte III cleanser for several years now.  I have very oily skin prone to break-outs.  After I remove makeup with a \\&quot;make-up melt-down\\&quot; type of cleanser I follow up by cleansing/exfoliating with MD Forte. Following this routine has greatly reduced the break-outs.  MD Forte cleanser also better prepares my skin for prescription Renova so the prescription cream is more effective.    I love MD Forte III because it&#x27;s a strong exfoliant but doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, does exactly what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;Years ago my wife used to have to buy it from her doctor.</li>
            <li> A MUST if you want to keep acne away!!!! remember to ALWAYS pay dry only!!! And use MD Forte &#x27;lotion&#x27; with it, for best results!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years...wonderful cleanser for mature skin.  It has kept my skin very clear and I can feel it working.  I usually leave it on for a few minutes to sink into my skin the wash it off.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Always loved this product.  Been using for 20 years and have great skin at 45</li>
            <li> This is a must for young and aging skin it with make it look wonderful. The best skin product I have ever used</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever tried that actually makes my pores look smaller. I use it almost every night &amp; leave it on for at least 5 minutes before washing it off. If you leave it on too long, it will irritate your face. Sometimes, my face will look like it&#x27;s getting too dry, so I will skip it for a night or two. But otherwise, I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have combination, blackhead prone skin.  During pregnancy, my skin seemed to get even worse.  MD Forte is the ONLY product that has consistently cleared up acne/blackheads.  I began with MD Forte I and worked my way to II.  Keep in mind: this cleanser works best on dry skin!  Also remember to use a strong SPF moisturizer.  I use Aveeno Active Naturals moisturizer and the combination works like a charm. I will buy MD Forte over and over again.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. I have been using it for many years and it is one of the best and worth the cost to purchase it. If you are new to products with Glycolic Acid start with the 1 (mildest) then eventually after your skin is use to the exfoliation treatment you will get from using Glycolic Acid then slowly move up to the 11 and possibly the 111 (strongest) after some time.</li>
            <li> I love this hard to find product, it works great and doesn&#x27;t break the bank! Perfect for low grade glycol in peel too!</li>
            <li> My skin looks less dull and more clear.  The bottle lasts a long time.  I&#x27;d recommend it, as did my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;problem skin&amp;#34; until I hit my 30&#x27;s and then had chronic systic acne. My doctor prescribed multiple medications, creams, and cleansers that all made my acne improve, but never really made it disappear. I was getting a facial one day, and the aesthetician recommended MD Forte cleanser, which I purchased that same day. Within a month, my skin had completely cleared up. I have been using this product for over 5 years and have never had an issue with acne. Gotta love a product that works!!! For those of you concerned about the price, a bottle typically lasts me 4 months with twice a day use. I would (and have) recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and like its cleansing effect and the glycolic acid in the product.  The other essential for me is that it is unscented.</li>
            <li> Used MD Forte 2 in the past, expected better results with this product, but it didn&#x27;t happen.  Wish I could exchange it for the MD Forte 2.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.... My skin looks great.... I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old male and have used several brands throughout the years trying to get rid of my blackheads. My blackheads aren&#x27;t complete gone, but they are so much better than they used to be. As long as I don&#x27;t skip a night washing my face, I never get breakouts anymore either. I love M.D. Forte and worked myself up to level III. I started with level I, which is not longer manufactured.  Level III is a little thicker than level II.  With free shipping on Amazon, I find the price to be unbeatable.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser was recommended to me by a dermatologist about 8 years ago. I have used it continuously since then. I am particularly amazed at how it literally shrunk the bags under my eyes--to the point that my mother asked if I had had surgery.  This is terrific cleanser that does so much more than cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years as a cleanser. Even on back of my hands which have far fewer age spots rhan most of my friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser as a gift for two people at Christmas and they both love it. They tell me their face feels so clean and the cleanser is helping to keep their skin clear. I am thinking about ordering it myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had embarrassing problem skin since puberty. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and starting to get fine lines, and until I started using this product I had never had a single day without at least one zit. Not even while taking antibiotics and using dermatologist prescribed creams that cost $200 a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is the only stuff that works for me, and I&#x27;ve been getting a ton of compliments about my skin since I started using it. The other day my husband&#x27;s co-workers were surprised to find out how old I am because my skin looks so great now they thought I was much younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, but the last bottle I bought lasted me almost 8 months. That&#x27;s less than $5 a month, which really isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t remove makeup, so you still have to use another cleanser for that. But it works so much better than my cleanser alone. And it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out or make it flaky the way a lot of other products do.</li>
            <li> Very effective product where you can easily see results over time.  It is well worth the money spent it serves me well</li>
            <li> Keeps my sensitive, congested combination skin clear of debris! Works even better with a Clarisonic. You must be consistent with this product, as any product, and follow up with the MD Forte moistuizer.</li>
            <li> I had originally got this from my dermatologist who gave me the II then the III.  It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my skin.  I don&#x27;t have terrible acne but a few on my chin and forehead every month or so and it gets rid of them quickly makes my skin so smooth.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years and if I am diligent in it&#x27;s use,I can see a real difference in my 53 year old, sun-abused skin.&lt;br /&gt; I purchased an electric powered facial brush which paired with the MD Forte cleanser, perks my skin right up.&lt;br /&gt; I discontinue it&#x27;s use in the summer when I am outside a lot since it causes you to sunburn more readily.&lt;br /&gt; I also have the MD Forte cream for which nicely plumps up my skin by the morning.I can even use it by my eyes after 5 years.&lt;br /&gt; A friend complimented my skin and I told her it was this cleanser. I gave her a bottle for her birthday and now she is a devotee.</li>
            <li> i have been using this stuff for 10 years, it is the best. I daily use this, squalene from olive oil as a moisturizer, and then twice a week I add retain a. My skin really looks pretty good, no wrinkles. I think this stuff is amazing. I put it on, then brush my teeth, then wash it off.</li>
            <li> I Love this product!  It gives my skin a great cleanse!  I used the other two levels but like the III best!</li>
            <li> This product has now been discontinued almost everywhere, as well it should be. I purchased it from my dermatologist office a few years ago and have been trying to fix my skin ever since.  It left my checks scarred. My dermatologist office no longer carries it because it was doing the same thing to everyone they sold it to. I am trying to find out if there is some kind of class action lawsuit against this company. It is that bad. Do not buy this product for any amount of money. Do not use it if it is given to you for free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for ten years.  People often tell me how great my skin looks and I&#x27;m seventy years old.</li>
            <li> My dermo recommended this cleanser and I have used it for several years. It does not irritate my sensitive skin but does a great job.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist originally started me on this cleanser. I was so glad to see it being sold by Amazon. Much more convenient than going to my dermatologist office to purchase.</li>
            <li> My mom and I use it. I don&#x27;t see much improvement but then again I forget to use it sometimes. It does leave my skin soft which is great because I have sensitive skin. I swear my mother is looking younger everyday with this. Everyone&#x27;s has different skin though.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought M.D Forte products from a &#x27;spa&#x27; in town before, but the price was enough to give me nightmares, despite liking the products. This product just seems to have skipped the fancy packaging and put the value in the product, which is fine by me.</li>
            <li> This has kept my adult moderate acne prone skin in check!  It feels tingly and the first week I had a small amount of irritation, but after that I&#x27;ve had no problem!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 4 years and I really like this product. My skin gets really clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect with the Clarasonic as it isn&#x27;t high foaming.  I&#x27;ve used the product for some years.&lt;br /&gt;Mary in VA</li>
            <li> This product has done more for my acne-prone skin than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It cleans effectively without drying my skin, and a little bit goes a long way.  I use it both a.m. and p.m and follow up with a light moisturizer.  My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years. If you have very sensitive skin, I would begin with MD Forte I or II. If you&#x27;re thinking about trying it, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is just ok.  I&#x27;ve used glycolic acid products in the past, so I started off with this higher strength.  I have not noticed any difference; the oil is still there.  My skin doesn&#x27;t look better.  I still have large pores, breakouts and excess oil.  May not purchase this again.  I really didn&#x27;t think it was worth the money.  I&#x27;ve had better results using the Cor Silver bar and even Walmarts Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I had used this product a couple of years ago ( ver II) and stopped. But after testing other products, I am back to this and it is staying for a while</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better and this is a big part of the reason. (And their anti-wrinkle products.) Thumbs up MD Forte!</li>
            <li> love it, it works. Wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else. It&#x27;s a wonderful product.  I am so glad the&lt;br /&gt;dermatology suggested it.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the candida diet, probiotics and tea-tree oil.  This combo is the only thing that&#x27;s helped my cystic acne.  I leave it on my face for 10 minutes each time before I wash off...then I also steam my face for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> One of the best cleansers I have ever used. It helped redness, clogged pores and gave my skin a glow!</li>
            <li> Very nice product for really making a difference. Diminishes pore size scuffs off dead skin. Just a great product that actually does make a difference have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully effective, very gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have used their products for two months. No breakout since first bottle. These products are worth every dime. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is Soap Free and Alcohol Free so the cleanser does not dry up my face skin.</li>
