            <li>This stuff feels amazing and makes my skin feel so clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is hands down the best cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Packaging very nice, authentic, high quality cleanser.</li>
            <li>it smells yummy, feels really good on my dry skin, and does great job removing my BB cream off my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gel that turns foamy and great when you rub it on your face, it smells good, and you actually feel clean after.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and really does feel like it&#x27;s cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li>It rinses off good and leaves skin nice and soft.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s been great at keeping my skin clear and balanced.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin and smells great.</li>
            <li>The seller send me some free sample and a cute hand written note</li>
            <li>Seller is incredibly great at packaging this product and has always shipped early.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much to say about this product rather than it is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Within a week, all of light acne had subsided and I now have beautiful, clear, skin.</li>
            <li>This has been quite gentle on my skin and has a light, pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong, very girly per fumy scent but not in a good way for me.  </li>
            <li>it gets all bubbly which feels really cool!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product , let me face súper clean and fresh, this is the second time that I buy it so much that I liked!</li>
            <li>The cleanser foams up easily and gives me a tingly/cooling sensation  while I am washing.</li>
            <li>like to have a clean face, and I ponder at the fact that some people have a ritualistic regimen that takes more than 8 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels clean, not stripped of moisture and more whiter and brighter after use.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to use and rinse off.  </li>
            <li>Like many who have reviewed this cleanser, I was happy that it not only removed my BB cream</li>
            <li>and I love the way it smells really clean.  </li>
            <li>waterproof mascara, lipstick, are washed off easily.</li>
            <li>it was very gentle on my skin, extremely effective</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, figure out how many pumps you need, pump onto your fingers and apply right away.  </li>
            <li>First I splash some warm water on my face</li>
            <li>The fine lines and wrinkles just seem to disappear and the BB creams DO NOT settle into wrinkles but seems to fill them in so that your end result is fabulous, smooth, radiant, even skin.</li>
            <li>Great for cleansing and facial make up removal purposes.</li>
            <li>fast dilvery and amazing pakging</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>Shipping was hassle free.  </li>
            <li>have had the chance to use the product for a week now and truly enjoy the simplicity of the product.  </li>
            <li>BUT WHEN MIXED WITH A BIT OF WATER MAKE A GREAT FOAM</li>
            <li>Amazing cleanser cleans very well</li>
            <li>it is important to mention).</li>
            <li>This cleanser is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It does a great job taking off regular foundation as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, creamy cleanser</li>
            <li>I just hope the price and free shipping doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li>Thats the only drawback lol</li>
            <li>Enjoy this face wash, but it is not my Holy Grail.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I use this with my Clarisonic Mia, and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>When all the bubbles are rinsed off my skin always feels light and clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I like what to do to the face, but remove makeup is something that needs to be quick and easy as i do it before heading to bed at night.</li>
            <li>It quickly and easily removes your makeup.  </li>
            <li>, it makes it fresh !</li>
            <li>I am very familiar with Korean skincare and never had a problem so this is the first.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll feel really clean and have glowing skin when your done.</li>
            <li>, I wanted a product that would really clean my skin.</li>
            <li>Of course i like more natural or organic based face washes (and i have tried so many)</li>
            <li>This really leaves skin feeling smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>I use to have a oily/medium face but after using this product to clean my bb cream.</li>
            <li>My skin feels throughly clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>After drying with a towel, I used a face wipe to see how clean it made my skin, and there was no trace of BB cream</li>
            <li>Your face feels and is clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face with a nice glow and very soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d likely repurchase this as it is good value for money, unless I discover a better product first.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all afterwards, and overall it just feels very good and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Smells so yummy that I find it as a special treatment to wash my face every evening.</li>
            <li>My pores are quite large around the nose area and are always filled with dirt and oil no matter what product I&#x27;ve applied (and there have been many, many, many products, I could pay graduate school tuition for my children if I could get that money back).</li>
            <li>Light scent and keep my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Feels as if it is cleaning your face good and deep when all the bubbles start on your face.</li>
            <li>My face was super clean and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residues.</li>
            <li>I loved it, would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Not a lot bubbles but good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I have been telling all my friends to get it.</li>
            <li>It smells light and fresh, and I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now, and my skin seems to be nice and clear.</li>
            <li>I have true combination skin</li>
            <li>You dont really feel that your removing makeup but its more like skipping towards cleansing (almost like hit-two-birds-with-one-stone</li>
            <li>The product is much better looking in real life than it is in the picture here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use this at night to wash makeup off and it does a great job and also leaves my face feeling super clean but not too dry!!</li>
            <li>My 27 year old daughter is very fair skinned with Strawberry Blonde hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light, pleasant scent which is a little perfume-y, which I&#x27;m usually not a fan of, but I found it nice with this.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>it is really fresh and clean after wash.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It foams/laters up quickly and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and</li>
            <li>i received super quick.</li>
            <li>I use the SKIN79 Crystal Peeling Gel once weekly, The SKIN79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox every 3 days and the SKIN 79 Super+</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Pacific Islander with naturally super oily skin</li>
            <li>And not to mention the delivery was super fast !!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin squeaky clean and foams up nicely with just a tiny pea sized amount.  </li>
            <li>Good , but make my face feeling dry ....</li>
            <li>I am a big fan for sure!</li>
            <li>that is done, after 1 or 2 minutes as instructed by the bottle, put a little warm water on the hands to rub it which becomes more foamy instead of creamy cleanser.</li>
            <li>I firmly believe this one has helped soften that redness a great deal.</li>
            <li>Great for humid or heavily polluted areas.</li>
            <li>This cleanser comes out in gel form and once applied to the skin truns into a fun fizzy, foamy lather.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that I would use this product exclusively to remove my makeup, but it is nice as a second step cleanser!</li>
            <li>She first got this as a sample and liked it immensely to get the full size one.</li>
            <li>I waited for my old cleanser to run out before I tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order process was simple and I was happy to pay the price.  </li>
            <li>not as good as I expected....</li>
            <li>Takes off makeup and is a nice addition to my daily needs.</li>
            <li>To me, it was worth the price because it works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is much larger than I expected so I am very happy all around.</li>
            <li>I had frown lines between my brow, lines across my forehead, the beginning of crows feet and the smile \\&quot;creases\\&quot; from nose to corner of mouth.</li>
            <li>I love all of Skin79&#x27;s products I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>This is just amazing, My skin felt clear and clean, and soft.</li>
            <li>Love the way cleanser foams into skin to deep clean pores without drying.</li>
            <li>, it does indeed produces lots of foam, but i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good cleanser compared to other ones i&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, it&#x27;s nice and creamy and really leaves your skin feeling so soft and not dry and taught after washing off your makeup.</li>
            <li>This product works very well to clean and was shipped to me on time</li>
            <li>My face always feels really refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Easily takes out makeup without hassle and makes skin feel soft and look fresh.</li>
            <li>In the beginning, I tried to save product and pumped a little at a time, more wasteful this way because you end up using more because it starts foaming up right away.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a fan, but that was mostly due to the overwhelming strong perfumed scent.</li>
            <li>It foams up in a lovely way and really seems provide a deep clean.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to strong scents, I would not recommend.</li>
            <li>Tonight I washed my face in the sink and it performed great, rinsing off very well with just a few slashes of water.</li>
            <li>it is very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am normally super picky with cleansers because my skin is super super sensitive and often perfumed soap and cleanser break me out in a mild allergy rash, but I was out of my normal cleanser</li>
            <li>I have used every brand of cleanser, high and low end, this is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Very gentle and cleansing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly wear make up, so with this product I wash my face before bed and rinse with cool water in the morning, then add my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most of the time 1 wash is enough and compare to all other cleanses this one is rarely leaves make up marks on my towel after a wash; only in cases when do &amp;#34;going-out&amp;#34; make up and use more products i need to wash my face twice to make sure i go to bed with clean pores.</li>
            <li>I use Skin79 BB Cream, so I figured the Skin79 BB Cleanser would be exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>I have been aware of BB products for some time</li>
            <li>and I was interested in trying this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>, I LOVE THE FACT THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY A GEL</li>
            <li>the BB cream makeup is pretty stubborn to remove, probably why it works so well.</li>
            <li>first I use bioderma makeup remover, then this...</li>
            <li>This is my first time using BB Cleanser</li>
            <li>but when it&#x27;s rubbed on the facial area, it is more invisible and then it starts to feel more bubbly and can definitely tell it&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>This is my first BB Cream cleanser, and I chose the detox cleanser.</li>
            <li>Not harsh, not drying to skin---I follow with light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>In one of my orders I received a free sample of this cleanser and was happily surprised by how well it worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and smooth after each use</li>
            <li>I love the facial cleanser and also use the Crystal Peeling Gel once weekly.</li>
            <li>The BB cream does go on looking grayish when first applied</li>
            <li>it makes my face feel so clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>First, my package came way faster than it was estimated</li>
            <li>It has at first gel consistency, but once oxidized-</li>
            <li>When I have light to medium coverage make-up on, this will completely cleans my foundation.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more when this runs low.</li>
            <li>Overall...very satisfied with this product and will definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Even though there&#x27;s no exfoliate beads in it, you can see the difference in your pores with the first use.</li>
            <li>I also love that it lasts awhile, I&#x27;m still on my first bottle even though I use this daily, since buying it about 3-4 months ago.</li>
            <li>It also arrived fast and I will order this again after I finish it!</li>
            <li>This is my first BB cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have spend a lot of money on my face, and used many different products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE, seriously!!</li>
            <li>The product is really well packaged and came super fast.</li>
            <li>, I have rosacea and a mild case of solar dermatitis (and I live in the hot, sunny, sweaty south).</li>
            <li>But this makes my skin feel clean, clear, refresh and replenish.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean and soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>My face felt clean but still soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>oh so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft, clean feeling and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seriously tried tons of washes and this truly is my favorite!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>have very dry sensitive skin, most cleansers dry out my skin and make wrinkles more prominent, but this cleanser leaves my skin soft, hydrated and</li>
            <li>normal cleanser won&#x27;t take away your mascara and eye liner without giving you that smudged raccoon eye right?</li>
            <li>I have found that the Skin79 Gold works better when your skin is dry and the Pink works better on hot sticky days</li>
            <li>I love how it foams and doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry.</li>
            <li>Have had no adverse skin reactions on super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is: SUPER SENSITIVE, so I can&#x27;t just use anything on my skin because I will get rashes or break out after a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and my skin glows and looks smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li>( I have super sensitive skin though.)</li>
            <li>This is about the only cleanser that easily removes all traces of the BB cream I wear.  </li>
            <li>You would think a cleanser that does such magical wonders would be incredibly harsh on your skin, and have a strong scent, but NOT the case!</li>
            <li>Actually using it is fine as it is in a pump.  </li>
            <li>I would not mind finding a hair product with this particular scent!</li>
            <li>Very drying.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t have to be a BB cream user.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to the whole freaking world.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not superfoamy but foams up well and seems to take off make up without much issues.</li>
            <li>It arrived at a reasonable time and well before the estimated shipping date.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think it cleans my face very well</li>
            <li>This really worked to remove the BB cream.  </li>
            <li>Works really well at cleansing skin.</li>
            <li>Really cleans the face and clears the pores.</li>
            <li>When I received the cleanser it seemed it was the real deal.  </li>
            <li>This product shipped fast</li>
            <li>but I wish if it can be used for the whole face but meh</li>
            <li>Fast and credibility of Connecting</li>
            <li>I have very senitive skin.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>very faster thank you .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care much for this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Cleanser was very well packaged, not even one dent on the box (some sellers can&#x27;t even fulfill that requirement while sending inside the US).</li>
            <li>The product cleans very well.</li>
            <li>Really need 2 pumps of product to wash face, not the one pump as it suggests.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really mind at all.......</li>
            <li>Container with pump is sterile and secure enough for the gym bag.</li>
            <li>Really loved!&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>I wasnt really expecting much of this product, i just bought it</li>
            <li>It really gets all my BB cream that I wear off, although you are supposed to avoid your eyes so you can&#x27;t use it to take off your eye makeup.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a very gentile cleanser.</li>
            <li>It comes out in gel form and then really foams when you start rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need that much to do anything to your face either.</li>
            <li>I really need a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>It amazes me that one product can work on so many different skin shades and still look natural.</li>
            <li>I really liked that the packaging gives a brief description of the product in English and has all the markings and labels of authenticity.</li>
            <li>and I love it as much as the other Skin79 products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see that it is any better than any other over the counter face cleaner I have used, but I still like it.</li>
            <li>I started noticing a gradual increase in the dryness of my skin after the first week of use, and a few more whiteheads than normal, but it&#x27;s also turning into summer here in the wickedly hot, sun bleached south.</li>
            <li>I think this is too much time to spend on your face, unless your going out for the evening, but this product works for me, and my simple approach to clean</li>
            <li>Cleans my face better than any other product I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>but I do usually use more than one shot of the cleanser after I rinse off the initial amount, just to be sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the clean feeling, just not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase again after noticing the minute changes in description and the changes in price after such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Very nice cleanser, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin or leave tight feeling.</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling more weighed down than clean.</li>
            <li>then I lather up a shot of the cleanser in my hand, apply it all over, then gently work it in with a washcloth, just to make sure to get all the BB cream off, especially from places such as the corner of the nose, etc.</li>
            <li>Some people said you don&#x27;t even need to use makeup remover before washing your face with this cleanser, but as a clean freak, I would always use makeup remover cloth first, then while my face still wet, massage this cleanser onto my face for 30 seconds, then leave it on for 2 mins and wash away all the foam.</li>
            <li>It will be just as good with only 1 or 2 days a week instead of daily which saves a lot from having to buy it so quickly, but it&#x27;s gently enough for daily use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>With my older product, I had to wash my face morning and night.  </li>
            <li>but it left my skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft &amp; super clean afterwards, if not a bit tight.</li>
            <li>Also made my skin very soft to the point where I didnt have layer globs of moisturier all over my face!</li>
            <li>5 stars highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>this works:&lt;br /&gt;It is a large bottle with a soft pump.</li>
            <li>Added a little water which created a healthy amount of foam.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves it feeling clean.</li>
            <li>This is just such a fun cleanser to use.</li>
            <li>I normally use that but decided to try from this company \\&quot;Seoul</li>
            <li>Glamour\\&quot; NEVER AGAIN, don&#x27;t waste your money, if you order the cream you&#x27;re better off gettin from another seller</li>
            <li>I feel like the BB cleanser does a much better job of cleaning off the extra &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; than the Proactiv alone, but the Proactiv delivers the extra exfoliation and medication that my skin craves to stay clear.</li>
            <li>The other was fine and intact.</li>
            <li>This is also a very versatile cleanser as I think it would work well for any age or skin type and even though it has a heavy fragrance it seems very mild.  </li>
            <li>The combo makes my skin clean, fresh and no more breakout.</li>
            <li>Real BB creams are a lot thicker than the BB creams that are generally available in the US, and I was concerned about how much they would clog my pores or if I could get all of it off of my face with my usual washing.</li>
            <li>Only a little bit is needed and it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>While looking to try a new face cleanser, I came across this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it bubbles it really makes it feel like its getting down deep.</li>
            <li>Their product isn&#x27;t worth it, the package was off, the product was way to bright and dry, what a waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li>I do have some redness on one cheek which has never really gotten better with any facial cleanser, moisturizer or toner.</li>
            <li>The seller did not only put 3 free samples of BB creams, but also added a personal note( not printed- written!!)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>my skin very soft and take of all the mascara that I use that</li>
            <li>No heavy fragrance odor at all which is also another plus!</li>
            <li>Unlike other face cleansers which make your skin dry and flaky, this BB cleanser leaves your face super clean and soft.</li>
            <li>skin felt soft and re-hydrated after using this; I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to moisturize the way I normally do after a face wash, and there was no tight feeling.</li>
            <li>It has great smell and makes my oily skin fresh and no any tight or uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li>I started struggling with oily, adult acne when I truned 28</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the personal post-it note along with the</li>
            <li>1 pump is really all you need and it foams instantly while you massage your face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how tenacious BB cream can be to remove (the real stuff anyway--not the American hooey that they call BB cream).  </li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to  be an every morning cleanser.</li>
            <li>and we tried it on her as well as my 13 year old who has my skin tone</li>
            <li>Cleans well, leaves skin soft...</li>
            <li>I also feel like this product does not do much for me because I still see bb cream on my face especially under my eyes.</li>
            <li>and it makes my face really soft.</li>
            <li>This product tingled and rejuvenates the skin for amazingly soft skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and tend to pay a lot for products.</li>
            <li>I have had acne since I was around 11 years old and am now 42.  </li>
            <li>As someone who only recently got into the world of Asian BB creams, I&#x27;m still learning what&#x27;s available out there.</li>
            <li>I have combination/oily, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>a Caucasian woman, close to 40 years old.</li>
            <li>The longer you rub it over your face, the thicker the foam, so don&#x27;t give up if it&#x27;s not foaming fast enough for you.</li>
            <li>I think I may be a budding Skin79 addict.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t tight, it wasn&#x27;t oily, it was just clean.</li>
            <li>I only use one or two small pumps and spread it around my face, it almost instantly starts to bubble and after two minutes I wash it off with warm water.  </li>
            <li>It also gets my face clean without it getting all dried out.</li>
            <li>however it cleaned my black heads up quickly.  </li>
            <li>This bb cleanser made my face very dry after using it for the first time of my life.</li>
            <li>This cleanser leaves my skin not only truly clean but soft, less oily and helps to clear my acne.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft not dry nor will it strip your skin from all the natural oils.</li>
            <li>I use this along with skin79&#x27;s bb cream (the hot pink one).</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash cleans my face but doesn&#x27;t over dry</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s dry and flaky on my chin, between my eyes, and on both sides of my nose but my cheeks and forehead are very oily and acne prone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out your face at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use twice daily.  </li>
            <li>So when I saw a cleanser made especially for BB creams, and made by the same SKIN79 company, I was really excited.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Barely got to use this before my kids stole it!</li>
            <li>skin has been stressed out for the past 2 weeks and with the weather changing to winter, my skin has gotten more dry too...almost unbearable!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like I need to apply moisturizer right after washing because my face feels so tight.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure it is a great product, however the seal that ensures that cap hasn&#x27;t been removed was broken, so that was a little questionable.</li>
            <li>I like this mild product, though seems like a small amount.</li>
            <li>The direction on the back is kind of vague in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough for true results, but it has taken down the redness already!</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t use this product exclusively, so I can&#x27;t say much for its other potential properties (moisturizing ability, results with extended use, etc).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I go to a facial spa regularly for a \\&quot;me day\\&quot; and have seen a skin care specialist for years because of blackheads and the occasional breakout and my skin care professional</li>
            <li>I have used this product for only 2 days in a row (I am trying to regulate my stressed, dry skin) and it has worked so far!</li>
            <li>Wish it had less chemicals in it, but since it&#x27;s a wash off product, I will not complain much.</li>
            <li>I just discovered BB Creams recently and chose SKIN79 due to high reviews on their products.  </li>
            <li>It been 6 months now and my skin is dry but it is finally getting back that natural oil, of course with the help of a lot of moisturizer.</li>

            <li> Packaging very nice, authentic, high quality cleanser.</li>
            <li> it smells yummy, feels really good on my dry skin, and does great job removing my BB cream off my face.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin and smells great.</li>
            <li> The seller send me some free sample and a cute hand written note</li>
            <li> Seller is incredibly great at packaging this product and has always shipped early.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this product rather than it is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Within a week, all of light acne had subsided and I now have beautiful, clear, skin.</li>
            <li> This has been quite gentle on my skin and has a light, pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong, very girly per fumy scent but not in a good way for me.  </li>
            <li> it gets all bubbly which feels really cool!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product , let me face súper clean and fresh, this is the second time that I buy it so much that I liked!</li>
            <li> The cleanser foams up easily and gives me a tingly/cooling sensation  while I am washing.</li>
            <li> like to have a clean face, and I ponder at the fact that some people have a ritualistic regimen that takes more than 8 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels clean, not stripped of moisture and more whiter and brighter after use.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to use and rinse off.  </li>
            <li> Like many who have reviewed this cleanser, I was happy that it not only removed my BB cream</li>
            <li> and I love the way it smells really clean.  </li>
            <li> waterproof mascara, lipstick, are washed off easily.</li>
            <li> it was very gentle on my skin, extremely effective</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, figure out how many pumps you need, pump onto your fingers and apply right away.  </li>
            <li> First I splash some warm water on my face</li>
            <li> The fine lines and wrinkles just seem to disappear and the BB creams DO NOT settle into wrinkles but seems to fill them in so that your end result is fabulous, smooth, radiant, even skin.</li>
            <li> Great for cleansing and facial make up removal purposes.</li>
            <li> fast dilvery and amazing pakging</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> Shipping was hassle free.  </li>
            <li> have had the chance to use the product for a week now and truly enjoy the simplicity of the product.  </li>
            <li> BUT WHEN MIXED WITH A BIT OF WATER MAKE A GREAT FOAM</li>
            <li> Amazing cleanser cleans very well</li>
            <li> it is important to mention).</li>
            <li> This cleanser is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It does a great job taking off regular foundation as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light, creamy cleanser</li>
            <li> I just hope the price and free shipping doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> Thats the only drawback lol</li>
            <li> Enjoy this face wash, but it is not my Holy Grail.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I use this with my Clarisonic Mia, and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> When all the bubbles are rinsed off my skin always feels light and clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I like what to do to the face, but remove makeup is something that needs to be quick and easy as i do it before heading to bed at night.</li>
            <li> It quickly and easily removes your makeup.  </li>
            <li> , it makes it fresh !</li>
            <li> I am very familiar with Korean skincare and never had a problem so this is the first.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel really clean and have glowing skin when your done.</li>
            <li> , I wanted a product that would really clean my skin.</li>
            <li> Of course i like more natural or organic based face washes (and i have tried so many)</li>
            <li> This really leaves skin feeling smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I use to have a oily/medium face but after using this product to clean my bb cream.</li>
            <li> My skin feels throughly clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> After drying with a towel, I used a face wipe to see how clean it made my skin, and there was no trace of BB cream</li>
            <li> Your face feels and is clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face with a nice glow and very soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d likely repurchase this as it is good value for money, unless I discover a better product first.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all afterwards, and overall it just feels very good and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Smells so yummy that I find it as a special treatment to wash my face every evening.</li>
            <li> My pores are quite large around the nose area and are always filled with dirt and oil no matter what product I&#x27;ve applied (and there have been many, many, many products, I could pay graduate school tuition for my children if I could get that money back).</li>
            <li> Light scent and keep my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Feels as if it is cleaning your face good and deep when all the bubbles start on your face.</li>
            <li> My face was super clean and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residues.</li>
            <li> I loved it, would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not a lot bubbles but good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I have been telling all my friends to get it.</li>
            <li> It smells light and fresh, and I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now, and my skin seems to be nice and clear.</li>
            <li> I have true combination skin</li>
            <li> You dont really feel that your removing makeup but its more like skipping towards cleansing (almost like hit-two-birds-with-one-stone</li>
            <li> The product is much better looking in real life than it is in the picture here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this at night to wash makeup off and it does a great job and also leaves my face feeling super clean but not too dry!!</li>
            <li> My 27 year old daughter is very fair skinned with Strawberry Blonde hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a light, pleasant scent which is a little perfume-y, which I&#x27;m usually not a fan of, but I found it nice with this.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> it is really fresh and clean after wash.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It foams/laters up quickly and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and</li>
            <li> i received super quick.</li>
            <li> I use the SKIN79 Crystal Peeling Gel once weekly, The SKIN79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox every 3 days and the SKIN 79 Super+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Pacific Islander with naturally super oily skin</li>
            <li> And not to mention the delivery was super fast !!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin squeaky clean and foams up nicely with just a tiny pea sized amount.  </li>
            <li> Good , but make my face feeling dry ....</li>
            <li> I am a big fan for sure!</li>
            <li> that is done, after 1 or 2 minutes as instructed by the bottle, put a little warm water on the hands to rub it which becomes more foamy instead of creamy cleanser.</li>
            <li> I firmly believe this one has helped soften that redness a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great for humid or heavily polluted areas.</li>
            <li> This cleanser comes out in gel form and once applied to the skin truns into a fun fizzy, foamy lather.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I would use this product exclusively to remove my makeup, but it is nice as a second step cleanser!</li>
            <li> She first got this as a sample and liked it immensely to get the full size one.</li>
            <li> I waited for my old cleanser to run out before I tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order process was simple and I was happy to pay the price.  </li>
            <li> not as good as I expected....</li>
            <li> Takes off makeup and is a nice addition to my daily needs.</li>
            <li> To me, it was worth the price because it works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is much larger than I expected so I am very happy all around.</li>
            <li> I had frown lines between my brow, lines across my forehead, the beginning of crows feet and the smile \\&quot;creases\\&quot; from nose to corner of mouth.</li>
            <li> I love all of Skin79&#x27;s products I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> This is just amazing, My skin felt clear and clean, and soft.</li>
            <li> Love the way cleanser foams into skin to deep clean pores without drying.</li>
            <li> , it does indeed produces lots of foam, but i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good cleanser compared to other ones i&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, it&#x27;s nice and creamy and really leaves your skin feeling so soft and not dry and taught after washing off your makeup.</li>
            <li> This product works very well to clean and was shipped to me on time</li>
            <li> My face always feels really refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Easily takes out makeup without hassle and makes skin feel soft and look fresh.</li>
            <li> In the beginning, I tried to save product and pumped a little at a time, more wasteful this way because you end up using more because it starts foaming up right away.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan, but that was mostly due to the overwhelming strong perfumed scent.</li>
            <li> It foams up in a lovely way and really seems provide a deep clean.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to strong scents, I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Tonight I washed my face in the sink and it performed great, rinsing off very well with just a few slashes of water.</li>
            <li> it is very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am normally super picky with cleansers because my skin is super super sensitive and often perfumed soap and cleanser break me out in a mild allergy rash, but I was out of my normal cleanser</li>
            <li> I have used every brand of cleanser, high and low end, this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Very gentle and cleansing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly wear make up, so with this product I wash my face before bed and rinse with cool water in the morning, then add my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Most of the time 1 wash is enough and compare to all other cleanses this one is rarely leaves make up marks on my towel after a wash; only in cases when do &amp;#34;going-out&amp;#34; make up and use more products i need to wash my face twice to make sure i go to bed with clean pores.</li>
            <li> I use Skin79 BB Cream, so I figured the Skin79 BB Cleanser would be exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I have been aware of BB products for some time</li>
            <li> and I was interested in trying this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> , I LOVE THE FACT THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY A GEL</li>
            <li> the BB cream makeup is pretty stubborn to remove, probably why it works so well.</li>
            <li> first I use bioderma makeup remover, then this...</li>
            <li> This is my first time using BB Cleanser</li>
            <li> but when it&#x27;s rubbed on the facial area, it is more invisible and then it starts to feel more bubbly and can definitely tell it&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> This is my first BB Cream cleanser, and I chose the detox cleanser.</li>
            <li> Not harsh, not drying to skin---I follow with light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> In one of my orders I received a free sample of this cleanser and was happily surprised by how well it worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and smooth after each use</li>
            <li> I love the facial cleanser and also use the Crystal Peeling Gel once weekly.</li>
            <li> The BB cream does go on looking grayish when first applied</li>
            <li> it makes my face feel so clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> First, my package came way faster than it was estimated</li>
            <li> It has at first gel consistency, but once oxidized-</li>
            <li> When I have light to medium coverage make-up on, this will completely cleans my foundation.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more when this runs low.</li>
            <li> Overall...very satisfied with this product and will definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Even though there&#x27;s no exfoliate beads in it, you can see the difference in your pores with the first use.</li>
            <li> I also love that it lasts awhile, I&#x27;m still on my first bottle even though I use this daily, since buying it about 3-4 months ago.</li>
            <li> It also arrived fast and I will order this again after I finish it!</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have spend a lot of money on my face, and used many different products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE, seriously!!</li>
            <li> The product is really well packaged and came super fast.</li>
            <li> , I have rosacea and a mild case of solar dermatitis (and I live in the hot, sunny, sweaty south).</li>
            <li> But this makes my skin feel clean, clear, refresh and replenish.  </li>
            <li> My face feels clean and soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> My face felt clean but still soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> oh so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft, clean feeling and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seriously tried tons of washes and this truly is my favorite!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> have very dry sensitive skin, most cleansers dry out my skin and make wrinkles more prominent, but this cleanser leaves my skin soft, hydrated and</li>
            <li> normal cleanser won&#x27;t take away your mascara and eye liner without giving you that smudged raccoon eye right?</li>
            <li> I have found that the Skin79 Gold works better when your skin is dry and the Pink works better on hot sticky days</li>
            <li> I love how it foams and doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Have had no adverse skin reactions on super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is: SUPER SENSITIVE, so I can&#x27;t just use anything on my skin because I will get rashes or break out after a week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and my skin glows and looks smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li> ( I have super sensitive skin though.)</li>
            <li> This is about the only cleanser that easily removes all traces of the BB cream I wear.  </li>
            <li> You would think a cleanser that does such magical wonders would be incredibly harsh on your skin, and have a strong scent, but NOT the case!</li>
            <li> Actually using it is fine as it is in a pump.  </li>
            <li> I would not mind finding a hair product with this particular scent!</li>
            <li> Very drying.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t have to be a BB cream user.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to the whole freaking world.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not superfoamy but foams up well and seems to take off make up without much issues.</li>
            <li> It arrived at a reasonable time and well before the estimated shipping date.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think it cleans my face very well</li>
            <li> This really worked to remove the BB cream.  </li>
            <li> Works really well at cleansing skin.</li>
            <li> Really cleans the face and clears the pores.</li>
            <li> When I received the cleanser it seemed it was the real deal.  </li>
            <li> This product shipped fast</li>
            <li> but I wish if it can be used for the whole face but meh</li>
            <li> Fast and credibility of Connecting</li>
            <li> I have very senitive skin.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> very faster thank you .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much for this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Cleanser was very well packaged, not even one dent on the box (some sellers can&#x27;t even fulfill that requirement while sending inside the US).</li>
            <li> The product cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Really need 2 pumps of product to wash face, not the one pump as it suggests.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really mind at all.......</li>
            <li> Container with pump is sterile and secure enough for the gym bag.</li>
            <li> Really loved!&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> I wasnt really expecting much of this product, i just bought it</li>
            <li> It really gets all my BB cream that I wear off, although you are supposed to avoid your eyes so you can&#x27;t use it to take off your eye makeup.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a very gentile cleanser.</li>
            <li> It comes out in gel form and then really foams when you start rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need that much to do anything to your face either.</li>
            <li> I really need a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> It amazes me that one product can work on so many different skin shades and still look natural.</li>
            <li> I really liked that the packaging gives a brief description of the product in English and has all the markings and labels of authenticity.</li>
            <li> and I love it as much as the other Skin79 products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see that it is any better than any other over the counter face cleaner I have used, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> I started noticing a gradual increase in the dryness of my skin after the first week of use, and a few more whiteheads than normal, but it&#x27;s also turning into summer here in the wickedly hot, sun bleached south.</li>
            <li> I think this is too much time to spend on your face, unless your going out for the evening, but this product works for me, and my simple approach to clean</li>
            <li> Cleans my face better than any other product I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> but I do usually use more than one shot of the cleanser after I rinse off the initial amount, just to be sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the clean feeling, just not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase again after noticing the minute changes in description and the changes in price after such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Very nice cleanser, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin or leave tight feeling.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling more weighed down than clean.</li>
            <li> then I lather up a shot of the cleanser in my hand, apply it all over, then gently work it in with a washcloth, just to make sure to get all the BB cream off, especially from places such as the corner of the nose, etc.</li>
            <li> Some people said you don&#x27;t even need to use makeup remover before washing your face with this cleanser, but as a clean freak, I would always use makeup remover cloth first, then while my face still wet, massage this cleanser onto my face for 30 seconds, then leave it on for 2 mins and wash away all the foam.</li>
            <li> It will be just as good with only 1 or 2 days a week instead of daily which saves a lot from having to buy it so quickly, but it&#x27;s gently enough for daily use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> With my older product, I had to wash my face morning and night.  </li>
            <li> but it left my skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft &amp; super clean afterwards, if not a bit tight.</li>
            <li> Also made my skin very soft to the point where I didnt have layer globs of moisturier all over my face!</li>
            <li> 5 stars highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this works:&lt;br /&gt;It is a large bottle with a soft pump.</li>
            <li> Added a little water which created a healthy amount of foam.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves it feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This is just such a fun cleanser to use.</li>
            <li> I normally use that but decided to try from this company \\&quot;Seoul</li>
            <li> Glamour\\&quot; NEVER AGAIN, don&#x27;t waste your money, if you order the cream you&#x27;re better off gettin from another seller</li>
            <li> I feel like the BB cleanser does a much better job of cleaning off the extra &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; than the Proactiv alone, but the Proactiv delivers the extra exfoliation and medication that my skin craves to stay clear.</li>
            <li> The other was fine and intact.</li>
            <li> This is also a very versatile cleanser as I think it would work well for any age or skin type and even though it has a heavy fragrance it seems very mild.  </li>
            <li> The combo makes my skin clean, fresh and no more breakout.</li>
            <li> Real BB creams are a lot thicker than the BB creams that are generally available in the US, and I was concerned about how much they would clog my pores or if I could get all of it off of my face with my usual washing.</li>
            <li> Only a little bit is needed and it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> While looking to try a new face cleanser, I came across this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it bubbles it really makes it feel like its getting down deep.</li>
            <li> Their product isn&#x27;t worth it, the package was off, the product was way to bright and dry, what a waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> I do have some redness on one cheek which has never really gotten better with any facial cleanser, moisturizer or toner.</li>
            <li> The seller did not only put 3 free samples of BB creams, but also added a personal note( not printed- written!!)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> my skin very soft and take of all the mascara that I use that</li>
            <li> No heavy fragrance odor at all which is also another plus!</li>
            <li> Unlike other face cleansers which make your skin dry and flaky, this BB cleanser leaves your face super clean and soft.</li>
            <li> skin felt soft and re-hydrated after using this; I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to moisturize the way I normally do after a face wash, and there was no tight feeling.</li>
            <li> It has great smell and makes my oily skin fresh and no any tight or uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> I started struggling with oily, adult acne when I truned 28</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the personal post-it note along with the</li>
            <li> 1 pump is really all you need and it foams instantly while you massage your face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how tenacious BB cream can be to remove (the real stuff anyway--not the American hooey that they call BB cream).  </li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to  be an every morning cleanser.</li>
            <li> and we tried it on her as well as my 13 year old who has my skin tone</li>
            <li> Cleans well, leaves skin soft...</li>
            <li> I also feel like this product does not do much for me because I still see bb cream on my face especially under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and it makes my face really soft.</li>
            <li> This product tingled and rejuvenates the skin for amazingly soft skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tend to pay a lot for products.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was around 11 years old and am now 42.  </li>
            <li> As someone who only recently got into the world of Asian BB creams, I&#x27;m still learning what&#x27;s available out there.</li>
            <li> I have combination/oily, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> a Caucasian woman, close to 40 years old.</li>
            <li> The longer you rub it over your face, the thicker the foam, so don&#x27;t give up if it&#x27;s not foaming fast enough for you.</li>
            <li> I think I may be a budding Skin79 addict.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t tight, it wasn&#x27;t oily, it was just clean.</li>
            <li> I only use one or two small pumps and spread it around my face, it almost instantly starts to bubble and after two minutes I wash it off with warm water.  </li>
            <li> It also gets my face clean without it getting all dried out.</li>
            <li> however it cleaned my black heads up quickly.  </li>
            <li> This bb cleanser made my face very dry after using it for the first time of my life.</li>
            <li> This cleanser leaves my skin not only truly clean but soft, less oily and helps to clear my acne.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft not dry nor will it strip your skin from all the natural oils.</li>
            <li> I use this along with skin79&#x27;s bb cream (the hot pink one).</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash cleans my face but doesn&#x27;t over dry</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry and flaky on my chin, between my eyes, and on both sides of my nose but my cheeks and forehead are very oily and acne prone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out your face at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use twice daily.  </li>
            <li> So when I saw a cleanser made especially for BB creams, and made by the same SKIN79 company, I was really excited.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Barely got to use this before my kids stole it!</li>
            <li> skin has been stressed out for the past 2 weeks and with the weather changing to winter, my skin has gotten more dry too...almost unbearable!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like I need to apply moisturizer right after washing because my face feels so tight.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure it is a great product, however the seal that ensures that cap hasn&#x27;t been removed was broken, so that was a little questionable.</li>
            <li> I like this mild product, though seems like a small amount.</li>
            <li> The direction on the back is kind of vague in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough for true results, but it has taken down the redness already!</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t use this product exclusively, so I can&#x27;t say much for its other potential properties (moisturizing ability, results with extended use, etc).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I go to a facial spa regularly for a \\&quot;me day\\&quot; and have seen a skin care specialist for years because of blackheads and the occasional breakout and my skin care professional</li>
            <li> I have used this product for only 2 days in a row (I am trying to regulate my stressed, dry skin) and it has worked so far!</li>
            <li> Wish it had less chemicals in it, but since it&#x27;s a wash off product, I will not complain much.</li>
            <li> I just discovered BB Creams recently and chose SKIN79 due to high reviews on their products.  </li>
            <li> It been 6 months now and my skin is dry but it is finally getting back that natural oil, of course with the help of a lot of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and leaves my skin feeling soft and not dry or tight.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over two years and have clearer pores with only a couple of occasional minor acne spots.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many cleanser from store brand to expensive name brand and they all make my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Vacuum type of dispenser, which I know in my experience, won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much &#x27;detox&#x27; is happening to my skin</li>
            <li> As with most women with troubled skin, I have wasted TONS of money on makeup, skin care products and natural skin care \\&quot;remedies\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I am a very picky person and hard to impress when it comes to facial cleansers but these are</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry one week and oily the next.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with pretty serious acne on and off since I was about 11</li>
            <li> Was skeptical of switching to new cleanser line, but when I bought the Hot Pink BB cream, I instantly became hooked on the SKIN79 line.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding something I like this much.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft, not too dry or tight, but in no way emollient either.</li>
            <li> I normally have dry skin but this winter has truly been very harsh to the point where my face felt like sand paper.</li>
            <li> I would definitely gift this product along with their other products for girlfriends.</li>
            <li> The product spilled all over the other item in the package and also it was not package proper duo to it being liquid.</li>
            <li> My skin is actually not very sensitive to products, just to hormones and the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ALSO, I want people to know that this cleanser does not leave your skin incredibly dry after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This face wash doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all</li>
            <li> It removes makeup and cleanses without making my skin feel dry.</li>
            <li> exellent i dont feel my skin dry or oily</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with areas of dry skin on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It was a pleasure to discover that since I&#x27;ve started using this product, I only had a few break outs and only when I forgot to take off my make up</li>
            <li> The next morning, I could see the dead skins, the dry sign on my face, especially around my mouth and eyes even after I use my routine moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I massaged it for a few minutes before finally rinsing it off, which proved to be a bit more difficult than I had expected due to its thickness.</li>
            <li> This face wash has a fizzy bubbling effect that left my skin with small red marks that took a long time to fade.</li>
            <li> I could no longer use my regular cleanser due to it drying out my skin!</li>
            <li> with other products after cleansing my face,it would feel so dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s with very pale, dry, photosensitive skin &amp; usually use BB cream as my only makeup.</li>
            <li> Shu eumera green tea cleansing oil ($80), DHC cleansing oil ($30), Murad vitamin-C cleanser ($30), and Dermalogica daily micro exfoliant ($50), and my Clarisonic ($100).</li>
            <li> (Be careful not to rub the washcloth in your immediate under eye area to avoid wrinkles.)</li>
            <li> but I did not enjoy having to smell it for several hours after.</li>
            <li> Then you let it sits for a few minutes and the white foam disappears!</li>
            <li> It can dry out your skin a bit but other than that it takes off all of the pact and BB cream plus my all the other eye make up and lip makeup that I wear with it.</li>
            <li> I have severe allergies and getting makeup off is a difficult task without the right remover/cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Might have broken me out the first few days I used it but hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin since.</li>
            <li> the minute water comes in touch with it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Probably not a great choice for dry or sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> This also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or make it feel tight.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use other products after it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of a sample I got from soulglamour when I purchased some other product.</li>
            <li> I have thrown away every other face cleanser that I had.</li>
            <li> Will not use anything other than these.</li>
            <li> I still use my exfoliating products, but I have eliminated three costly products due to this cleanser, so thank you</li>
            <li> I have tried other products in stores but nothing compares to this face wash.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone using BB creams or heavy makeup!</li>
            <li> It seems like every time I wash my face no matter how long I do it, I always get that harsh taste.</li>
            <li> However after I use it, my skin felt tight and dry and not very clean.</li>
            <li> bubbles get dried as soon as they appear and feels like it makes my skin dry</li>
            <li> The bottle was also much larger than I expected, but I didn&#x27;t read the description first, so that&#x27;s my bad.</li>
            <li> I only had to wash once to feel like I had removed all the junk off my face, which hardly happens.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every facial cleanser in existence (or at least it feels that way).  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that when you are washing it off, if you happen to taste any of the residue, it takes 15 minutes for the sourness to go away.</li>
            <li> The product is dispensed as a milky white gel, but as applied to the face it morphs into a thick, creamy foam.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with the pump breaking or being too stiff/hard to push down.</li>
            <li> I notice that my skin has become less oily and the dark spots on my face have seemed to be a lot less visible.</li>
            <li> The product says to avoid the eye area, but the Skin79 website says it removes eyeliner...which typically is applied to the eye area, no?</li>
            <li> the name is changed slightly and the price has increased quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Now the two main reasons why I didn&#x27;t like it:  did not clean all of my foundation or eye makeup and it broke me out!!!!!  </li>
            <li> It is also a mess too with the liquid coming out when not in use.</li>
            <li> and my face felt icky after a long day at work and 101 degree Texas weather.  </li>
            <li> Just a lil tight tho</li>
            <li> I just wet my face, give this bad &#x27;girl&#x27; ONE pump, lather and apply, rub GENTLY in 5 circular motions on my eyes and voila!</li>
            <li> I use a little water on my hands to make it spread easier.  </li>
            <li> I had a dramatic lost of my natural oil and started having small pimples/bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li> I already ordered it few times.</li>
            <li> No raccoon eyes from what the cleanser left behind or anything.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately they don&#x27;t remove make up completely and even after washing face twice</li>
            <li> Pea size amount does the job for two faces and no makeup left behind.</li>
            <li> I have a few acne scars, discoloration and uneven tone and texture.</li>
            <li> If my review wasn&#x27;t attached to the product by Amazon based on my actual purchase, I would be confused as to if this is what I purchased or not.</li>
            <li> it feels like little scrubbing bubbles on my face!</li>
            <li> ( I was little worried because there was no tracking number since it was sent from Korea!).</li>
            <li> AND it wasn&#x27;t harsh!</li>
            <li> i broke out like crazy :&amp;#60; if you have oily sensitive skin i do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have darker olive skin and usually wear a beige foundation and after about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> So, with cleansers, I usually squeeze the product and rub it between the palms of my hands before applying it to my face.</li>
            <li> But occasionally you also see random product spilled out of the pump which i don&#x27;t understand</li>
            <li> Because of this, I can usually tell if something is going to work for me after one application.</li>
            <li> It makes me hardly breath when I apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone with combo skin like mine and have a hard time finding cleansers that don&#x27;t irritate or tighten my skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the reviews, but after watching YouTube for a demonstration (which I would recommend if you&#x27;re curious and contemplating this product)</li>
            <li> It had somewhat of a drying effect on delicate areas like around my nose</li>
            <li> I think the fizzy factor irritates the skin, at least for me.</li>
            <li> But I think because the BB cream from this line is thick.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this product today, lightening fast shipping, i haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it yet, and base on the reviews</li>
            <li> But as soon as you start moving it around and massaging it into your skin, it turns into a thick foam that spreads a lot like shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Seriously...</li>
            <li> Ooze is a bad word, I&#x27;m not a gross, oily freak or anything, but if you have thatissue, you will know what I mean (and know that you aren&#x27;t alone).</li>
            <li> I bought this BB Cleanser from seller BB Cosmetic and it is the absolute worst cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Goes on like a thin cream and bubbles up into a lather.</li>
            <li> Not the worst feeling in the world, but that it gets old after a while.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong in using this product.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s bad to touch your face</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed yet.  </li>
            <li> but I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> she broke out worst than me</li>
            <li> BUT it has a terrible effect on my skin!</li>
            <li> Basically, my skin is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love this stuff works well</li>
            <li> Great for cleansing and facial make up removal purposes.</li>
            <li> fast dilvery and amazing pakging</li>
            <li> While looking to try a new face cleanser, I came across this on Amazon. After reading some reviews I figured I would give it a shot. I absolutely LOVE this cleanser. My skin has never felt healthier. You only need 2 pumps for your entire face and neck. It foams/laters up quickly and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I have noticed the overall tone/color of my face has evened out. I do have some redness on one cheek which has never really gotten better with any facial cleanser, moisturizer or toner. I firmly believe this one has helped soften that redness a great deal.</li>
            <li> Barely got to use this before my kids stole it! Awesome product! Made face feel very clean! Will be buying more</li>
            <li> Very drying. I actually don&#x27;t know how to feel about the quality of this product. It does wash away what feels like all the gunk from my face but a deep moisturizer is suggested for after.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser that leaves my skin nice and clean. I started struggling with oily, adult acne when I truned 28 and I have tried just about every line on the market. This cleanser comes out in gel form and once applied to the skin truns into a fun fizzy, foamy lather.It rinses off good and leaves skin nice and soft. The price is excellent and much more affordable then my Obagi foaming gel and my eminence mineral cleanser. Another excellent product by SKIN79!</li>
            <li> Cleans my face better than any other product I&#x27;ve used before. And it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product. I already ordered it few times. It cleans skin perfectly, even the BB cream and mascara. Don&#x27;t need to use other products after it.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! I use Skin79 BB Cream, so I figured the Skin79 BB Cleanser would be exactly what I need. And it definitely is! It removes all my makeup (even eye makeup!) and leaves my skin feeling soft and not dry or tight. At the end of the day, I lather up one pump, rub onto my face, rinse, and then do it one more time to get aaalllll the dirt and makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great and inexpensive! Love it!</li>
            <li> Product was open and leaking when package was opened. I ordered two. The other was fine and intact. It was sown the sides of the container.</li>
            <li> Awesome cleanser, removes all traces of makeup and leaves my face feeling impossibly clean. The cleanser foams up easily and gives me a tingly/cooling sensation  while I am washing. I use this with my shishedo facial brush when I want some extra exfoliation. It is not over drying at all. I precede this with DHC cleansing oil on days when I am wearing more makeup. Excellent product as an acne sufferer I have used every brand of cleanser, high and low end, this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of a sample I got from soulglamour when I purchased some other product. This is just such a fun cleanser to use. It comes out as a gel, but when you put it on your face, it turns into a foam. It&#x27;s kind of like a bubble bath for your face. It gets the gunk off and leaves my face all tingly. I&#x27;ve bought this as a gift for my friend and she and her daughter really liked it, too. A good way to get your kids to clean their face.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product. Very light and creamy with a great scent. It&#x27;s been great at keeping my skin clear and balanced. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I would use this product exclusively to remove my makeup, but it is nice as a second step cleanser! This has been quite gentle on my skin and has a light, pleasant smell.  I have used this product on and off for many months now and it hasn&#x27;t broken me out!</li>
            <li> The best cleanser I have every used. I am a BB cream user and this cleanser is perfect for everyone. You really don&#x27;t have to be a BB cream user. You spread this on damp skin and it just bubbles away cleaning and aerating your skin. When you see all the bubbles after a minute or two then you start scrubbing your skin and rinse. You&#x27;ll feel really clean and have glowing skin when your done. The product is really well packaged and came super fast. just two days. I recommend this to the whole freaking world. Use IT!</li>
            <li> I liked the cleanser but probably won&#x27;t repurchase because the price has doubled.</li>
            <li> Smells so yummy that I find it as a special treatment to wash my face every evening. It&#x27;s not superfoamy but foams up well and seems to take off make up without much issues. Wish it had less chemicals in it, but since it&#x27;s a wash off product, I will not complain much. Love packaging too.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE, seriously!! I use this at night to wash makeup off and it does a great job and also leaves my face feeling super clean but not too dry!! I&#x27;ve seriously tried tons of washes and this truly is my favorite!!</li>
            <li> This was for my bb cream using wife. She first got this as a sample and liked it immensely to get the full size one.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, figure out how many pumps you need, pump onto your fingers and apply right away.  In the beginning, I tried to save product and pumped a little at a time, more wasteful this way because you end up using more because it starts foaming up right away.</li>
            <li> A very good surprise for me, I wanted a product that would really clean my skin. It was a pleasure to discover that since I&#x27;ve started using this product, I only had a few break outs and only when I forgot to take off my make up so this is definitly a good purchase :)</li>
            <li> 5 stars highly recommended. Easily takes out makeup without hassle and makes skin feel soft and look fresh. It smells good too.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for quality.</li>
            <li> Hello, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used another cleansing product that I was satisfied with.  I have been aware of BB products for some time and I was interested in trying this cleanser.  I waited for my old cleanser to run out before I tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order process was simple and I was happy to pay the price.  Shipping was hassle free.  It arrived at a reasonable time and well before the estimated shipping date. I really appreciate the personal post-it note along with the the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the chance to use the product for a week now and truly enjoy the simplicity of the product.  1 pump is really all you need and it foams instantly while you massage your face. My face feels clean and soft after using it.  With my older product, I had to wash my face morning and night.  I don&#x27;t particularly wear make up, so with this product I wash my face before bed and rinse with cool water in the morning, then add my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to have a clean face, and I ponder at the fact that some people have a ritualistic regimen that takes more than 8 minutes.  I think this is too much time to spend on your face, unless your going out for the evening, but this product works for me, and my simple approach to clean face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;gamsahabnida!</li>
            <li> not as good as I expected....i don&#x27;t think it cleans my face very well, it does indeed produces lots of foam, but i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good cleanser compared to other ones i&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li> Very gentle and cleansing. I love how it foams and doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry. It also smells great; and foams very easily.</li>
            <li> I had foundation, banana powder, bronzer, blush and finishing spray on my face as well as eye primer, shadow, liner and mascara and this product took it all off. I even wiped my face with a face cleansing wipe to check and everything was gone. No raccoon eyes from what the cleanser left behind or anything. AND it wasn&#x27;t harsh! My face felt clean but still soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd order i think.. i love this cleanser.  i think it does so much better job then many others in the market. Even though i&#x27;m not always using the bb cream i still use this cleanser daily to remove any of my make up or just to wash my face before bed. Most of the time 1 wash is enough and compare to all other cleanses this one is rarely leaves make up marks on my towel after a wash; only in cases when do &amp;#34;going-out&amp;#34; make up and use more products i need to wash my face twice to make sure i go to bed with clean pores. Of course i like more natural or organic based face washes (and i have tried so many) but unfortunately they don&#x27;t remove make up completely and even after washing face twice i would still need to wipe it lotion or make up removing liquid.. So i would keep buying this one. It doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin and smells great.</li>
            <li> Love love this product . Leaves your skin soft not dry nor will it strip your skin from all the natural oils. This is my holy grail</li>
            <li> I love this BB face cleanser. Light scent and keep my face feeling fresh. I would buy more once I run out of it.</li>
            <li> I like what to do to the face, but remove makeup is something that needs to be quick and easy as i do it before heading to bed at night.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase !! And not to mention the delivery was super fast !! I like how it leaves your skin after applying it , it makes it fresh ! I would repurchase from this seller , they also included samples in my order ! Yay!!! That&#x27;s a plus! Overall am very happy with this purchase and the seller&#x27;s service !</li>
            <li> SKIN79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox Effect I really like this face wash cleans my face but doesn&#x27;t over dry and u only need one pump to do ur face with. Takes off makeup and is a nice addition to my daily needs. Very happy with this cleanser ^.^</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS OUT AND BELIEVE ME ITS WORKS GREAT, I LOVE THE FACT THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY A GEL BUT WHEN MIXED WITH A BIT OF WATER MAKE A GREAT FOAM AND AFTER CLEANSING IT LEAVES MY FACE SO SMOOOOOTH...</li>
            <li> This really worked to remove the BB cream.  We were very happy with it and the BB cream makeup is pretty stubborn to remove, probably why it works so well.</li>
            <li> Works really well at cleansing skin. The only problem is that the taste gets in your mouth. It tastes like soap but doesn&#x27;t smell like it. The air bubbles on your face do feel nice though.</li>
            <li> This really leaves skin feeling smooth and healthy. I think it has a lot of good ingredients. As for removing Skin 79 BB cream entirely, I don&#x27;t think you should use this alone, although it&#x27;s intended. first I use bioderma makeup remover, then this...If I used only this to remove  BB cream, it wouldn&#x27;t get all residue off my face. But I think because the BB cream from this line is thick.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using BB Cleanser and it does everything it promises for a very cheap price tag.  It leaves my skin squeaky clean and foams up nicely with just a tiny pea sized amount.  I didn&#x27;t realize how tenacious BB cream can be to remove (the real stuff anyway--not the American hooey that they call BB cream).  Will definitely buy again in bulk!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for only 2 days in a row (I am trying to regulate my stressed, dry skin) and it has worked so far! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough for true results, but it has taken down the redness already! I watched a review on YouTube and she said you don&#x27;t have to use it every day. It will be just as good with only 1 or 2 days a week instead of daily which saves a lot from having to buy it so quickly, but it&#x27;s gently enough for daily use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How this works:&lt;br /&gt;It is a large bottle with a soft pump. I have not had any problems with the pump breaking or being too stiff/hard to push down. Once the product comes out it&#x27;s creamy/cleanser like, but when it&#x27;s rubbed on the facial area, it is more invisible and then it starts to feel more bubbly and can definitely tell it&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;Once that is done, after 1 or 2 minutes as instructed by the bottle, put a little warm water on the hands to rub it which becomes more foamy instead of creamy cleanser. After washing it off, it does feel a lot healthier and lighter with one go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps! This is my first BB Cream cleanser, and I chose the detox cleanser. To me, it was worth the price because it works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been stressed out for the past 2 weeks and with the weather changing to winter, my skin has gotten more dry too...almost unbearable! I had to try something and I&#x27;m glad I got this. I was skeptical about the reviews, but after watching YouTube for a demonstration (which I would recommend if you&#x27;re curious and contemplating this product) I took a chance and bought this awesome product!</li>
            <li> Not harsh, not drying to skin---I follow with light moisturizer.Takes just one pump to cover face. I use a little water on my hands to make it spread easier.  Have been using for over two years and have clearer pores with only a couple of occasional minor acne spots. Have had no adverse skin reactions on super sensitive skin.  My son borrowed mine once and has now been purchasing for himself for over a year for the same reasons---clearer pores and controlled acne outbreaks. Follow-up:  03/2017  Still LOVE this cleanser</li>
            <li> I love this! I have very sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve started using Korean and Japanese made skin care products only. I&#x27;m so happy with this! It removed my make up except for my stubborn water proof eye liner. Made my skin feel clean and fresh. Just a lil tight tho so I follow up with a milky lotion.</li>
            <li> Really cleans the face and clears the pores.</li>
            <li> I bought this BB Cleanser from seller BB Cosmetic and it is the absolute worst cleanser I have ever used.  I have posted the seller because I don&#x27;t know if it is the product or seller not selling authenticate product.  When I received the cleanser it seemed it was the real deal.  The package is pretty nice and the dispenser worked well which pumped out a perfect amount of cream based cleanser.  Added a little water which created a healthy amount of foam.  The smell is a bit strong, very girly per fumy scent but not in a good way for me.  Now the two main reasons why I didn&#x27;t like it:  did not clean all of my foundation or eye makeup and it broke me out!!!!!  I thought maybe it is me, so I had my 13yr daughter try it...she broke out worst than me and so finally I had two of my girlfriends try...you guessed it, broke them out also.  I have no idea what is in this cleanser to cause the break outs.  I am very familiar with Korean skincare and never had a problem so this is the first.  I am currently using Etude House Baking Soda cleanser and I am very pleased.  Pea size amount does the job for two faces and no makeup left behind.</li>
            <li> I just discovered BB Creams recently and chose SKIN79 due to high reviews on their products.  I have not been disappointed yet.  In one of my orders I received a free sample of this cleanser and was happily surprised by how well it worked for me.  I have severe allergies and getting makeup off is a difficult task without the right remover/cleanser.  I have no problem with this one and love how my skin feels and looks afterwards.  It&#x27;s also simple to use - I only use one or two small pumps and spread it around my face, it almost instantly starts to bubble and after two minutes I wash it off with warm water.  If you haven&#x27;t tried BB Cream or this Cleanser I think it&#x27;s worth the money.  The bottle is much larger than I expected so I am very happy all around.</li>
            <li> This product shipped fast i recievd it quick along with awesome freebie samples..BUT it has a terrible effect on my skin! i broke out like crazy :&amp;#60; if you have oily sensitive skin i do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this yet but I already know I LOOOVE this cleanser. I got a sample of it and it makes my skin feel so clean and amazing without drying it out!</li>
            <li> smells good and cleans skin well without drying the skin. Good product. Skin feels soft and smooth after each use</li>
            <li> Amazing cleanser cleans very well but I wish if it can be used for the whole face but meh</li>
            <li> Fast and credibility of Connecting</li>
            <li> I like this wash. Feels as if it is cleaning your face good and deep when all the bubbles start on your face. When all the bubbles are rinsed off my skin always feels light and clean and refreshed. It is gentle enough to  be an every morning cleanser. I notice that my skin has become less oily and the dark spots on my face have seemed to be a lot less visible.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is hands down the best cleanser I have ever used.  (And I have used a lot, way more expensive than this one)  It&#x27;s a gel that turns foamy and great when you rub it on your face, it smells good, and you actually feel clean after.  I&#x27;m 31 and I have problem skin, but I have to say my skin is looking great now.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample of this cleanser and I&#x27;m definitely going to buy it.  My face was super clean and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residues.</li>
            <li> Good , but make my face feeling dry ....later on ....</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for couple weeks.  it is really fresh and clean after wash.  It has a pleasant smell.  The seller send me some free sample and a cute hand written note</li>
            <li> Packaging very nice, authentic, high quality cleanser. Vacuum type of dispenser, which I know in my experience, won&#x27;t last very long. Gel type of translucent, pleasant smelling type when you pump it out, then within seconds it foams up and creates a rich lather. My skin feels clean, not stripped of moisture and more whiter and brighter after use. I use this along with skin79&#x27;s bb cream (the hot pink one). Sort of pricey for a cleanser, but I&#x27;ll use it while I have it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser feels amazing on my skin! It&#x27;s gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. I loved it, would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> i received super quick. makes my skin oh so soft and clean. it feels like little scrubbing bubbles on my face!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this cleanser a try and I&#x27;m glad I did! I normally have dry skin but this winter has truly been very harsh to the point where my face felt like sand paper. I could no longer use my regular cleanser due to it drying out my skin! In comes this product. It comes out like a gel and then gets foamy! The smell was amazing! I would not mind finding a hair product with this particular scent! Also made my skin very soft to the point where I didnt have layer globs of moisturier all over my face!</li>
            <li> I have very senitive skin. with other products after cleansing my face,it would feel so dry and irritated.  With this product, i don&#x27;t have to hurry up and put moisterizer on. I have tried so many cleanser from store brand to expensive name brand and they all make my skin dry. But this makes my skin feel clean, clear, refresh and replenish.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> It quickly and easily removes your makeup.  The bubbles tickle your face.  Leaves your face feeling clean and soft.  Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I love all the Skin79 BB products that I have tried. I have thrown away every other face cleanser that I had. These products are amazing! I am a very picky person and hard to impress when it comes to facial cleansers but these are my def have to haves! Will not use anything other than these. I use the SKIN79 Crystal Peeling Gel once weekly, The SKIN79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox every 3 days and the SKIN 79 Super+ BeBlesh Balm BB Cream VIP Gold daily instead of foundation. EXCELLENT products!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these products for months now and they are absolutely amazing! I love the facial cleanser and also use the Crystal Peeling Gel once weekly. I have found that the Skin79 Gold works better when your skin is dry and the Pink works better on hot sticky days so I do alternate with those depending on weather, temp, etc. The difference that these products have made are absolutely astonishing! I had frown lines between my brow, lines across my forehead, the beginning of crows feet and the smile \\&quot;creases\\&quot; from nose to corner of mouth. These products have made a world of difference! I go to a facial spa regularly for a \\&quot;me day\\&quot; and have seen a skin care specialist for years because of blackheads and the occasional breakout and my skin care professional has even commented on the overall appearance and feel of my skin. The fine lines and wrinkles just seem to disappear and the BB creams DO NOT settle into wrinkles but seems to fill them in so that your end result is fabulous, smooth, radiant, even skin. The BB cream does go on looking grayish when first applied but as it blends the color is perfect. I have darker olive skin and usually wear a beige foundation and after about 10 minutes this BB cream looks like it is not even there but you have perfectly flawless skin. My 27 year old daughter is very fair skinned with Strawberry Blonde hair and we tried it on her as well as my 13 year old who has my skin tone and the results were amazing! All three of us ended with a perfect finish that looked natural. It amazes me that one product can work on so many different skin shades and still look natural. Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my cousin who lives in a tanning bed to see how the color works on her!</li>
            <li> bubbles get dried as soon as they appear and feels like it makes my skin dry so I rinse it off ASAP instead of massaging for a couple of minutes</li>
            <li> Very nice cleanser, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin or leave tight feeling. I do moisturize after using and I haven&#x27;t noticed a miracle yet but I&#x27;m always hopeful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good product .It&#x27;s com very faster thank you .</li>
            <li> it a great product I really like it , it clean the skin in a great way from makeup and fresh</li>
            <li> This product worked perfectly for me, it has an amazing smell, which makes me happy when I use it, it cleans my skin well, leaves it very silky and smooth after. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Seller &amp;#34;TOKTOK&amp;#34; added three samples to my purchase, lovely touch.</li>
            <li> Very great tool! good smell, forms a foam. To wash away all the makeup, I only use 2 drops. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product too good for remove the make up and detox the face .. its my fav till naw</li>
            <li> Their product isn&#x27;t worth it, the package was off, the product was way to bright and dry, what a waste of my money!!! I ordered the Missha BB cream in #21. I normally use that but decided to try from this company \\&quot;Seoul Glamour\\&quot; NEVER AGAIN, don&#x27;t waste your money, if you order the cream you&#x27;re better off gettin from another seller</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. it makes my face feel so clear and smooth. I love the way it bubbles it really makes it feel like its getting down deep. I also like the creamy texture. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much for this cleanser. I love all of Skin79&#x27;s products I&#x27;ve tried so far (BB creams, Rose Mist toner, BB compact powder), but this one was really disappointing. Left my skin feeling more weighed down than clean. I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Well,&lt;br /&gt;usually I don&#x27;t write any reviews, but this time I decided too. First, my package came way faster than it was estimated ( I was little worried because there was no tracking number since it was sent from Korea!). Cleanser was very well packaged, not even one dent on the box (some sellers can&#x27;t even fulfill that requirement while sending inside the US). There was an authenticity label on the box and bottle itself (since there are so many replicas it is important to mention). The seller did not only put 3 free samples of BB creams, but also added a personal note( not printed- written!!) which I found to be very cute. To the product itself- it smells yummy, feels really good on my dry skin, and does great job removing my BB cream off my face. It has at first gel consistency, but once oxidized- it turns into foam. I am very satisfied with product and seller. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is fantastic. It&#x27;s not only for BB cream users obviously. It does a great job taking off regular foundation as well. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and leaves it feeling clean. Will definitely keep buying this stuff.</li>
            <li> Not a lot bubbles but good enough for me.It makes my face clean and fresh.I love the odor too.Good to buy.</li>
            <li> This product works very well to clean and was shipped to me on time but I hate the smell. It makes me hardly breath when I apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> It smells very sweet and feminine, but not overpowering either.  Cleans well, leaves skin soft...I am a big fan for sure!</li>
            <li> This is just amazing, My skin felt clear and clean, and soft. Alot of cleaners cause me to have rashs but this one has not. I just love it to death and will order it again when Im almost out. I love it so much I have been telling all my friends to get it.</li>
            <li> Well i used this to remove my BB cream and the pact It can dry out your skin a bit but other than that it takes off all of the pact and BB cream plus my all the other eye make up and lip makeup that I wear with it.</li>
            <li> I love how this cleans and feels on my face.  It&#x27;s a light, creamy cleanser so it&#x27;s easy to use and rinse off.  No heavy fragrance odor at all which is also another plus!</li>
            <li> This bb cleanser made my face very dry after using it for the first time of my life. I use to have a oily/medium face but after using this product to clean my bb cream. I had a dramatic lost of my natural oil and started having small pimples/bumps on my skin. I have to stop using this product. I also feel like this product does not do much for me because I still see bb cream on my face especially under my eyes. It is also a mess too with the liquid coming out when not in use. It been 6 months now and my skin is dry but it is finally getting back that natural oil, of course with the help of a lot of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, it&#x27;s nice and creamy and really leaves your skin feeling so soft and not dry and taught after washing off your makeup. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin is: SUPER SENSITIVE, so I can&#x27;t just use anything on my skin because I will get rashes or break out after a week&#x27;s use. Before purchasing this product, I used all of these products: Shu eumera green tea cleansing oil ($80), DHC cleansing oil ($30), Murad vitamin-C cleanser ($30), and Dermalogica daily micro exfoliant ($50), and my Clarisonic ($100). I still use my exfoliating products, but I have eliminated three costly products due to this cleanser, so thank you SKIN79!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A normal cleanser won&#x27;t take away your mascara and eye liner without giving you that smudged raccoon eye right? Well, look no further ladies, because this cleanser is the bomb!!! I just wet my face, give this bad &#x27;girl&#x27; ONE pump, lather and apply, rub GENTLY in 5 circular motions on my eyes and voila! Seriously... it&#x27;s all gone I SWEAR!!! You would think a cleanser that does such magical wonders would be incredibly harsh on your skin, and have a strong scent, but NOT the case! It smells light and fresh, and I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now, and my skin seems to be nice and clear. ALSO, I want people to know that this cleanser does not leave your skin incredibly dry after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product!!! I have purchased three more so that my girlfriends can get hooked as well. I just hope the price and free shipping doesn&#x27;t change. Seller is incredibly great at packaging this product and has always shipped early. I would definitely gift this product along with their other products for girlfriends. GET IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and P.S. Their Skin79 BB cream VIP Gold is seriously a great product for $8.99; SPF, coverage, and vitamins all-in-one.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft, clean feeling and refreshed. Doesnt affect my skin sensitivities.</li>
            <li> this products i like it because it remove the make up and its good for my skin just like the cleaner for the skin</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! Like many who have reviewed this cleanser, I was happy that it not only removed my BB cream but it left my skin feeling smooth and soft.  The nice floral scent was a plus too. I recommend this to anyone with combo skin like mine and have a hard time finding cleansers that don&#x27;t irritate or tighten my skin. I really liked that the packaging gives a brief description of the product in English and has all the markings and labels of authenticity. All in all great product!</li>
            <li> So, with cleansers, I usually squeeze the product and rub it between the palms of my hands before applying it to my face. It took me a while to learn that I&#x27;m NOT SUPPOSED to do that with this product. The direction on the back is kind of vague in my opinion. But you&#x27;re supposed to just squeeze and apply to your face, let it bubbles, massage and then rinse. The product cleans very well. When I have light to medium coverage make-up on, this will completely cleans my foundation.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a sample with a Skin79 BB cream pack that I bought from Katie the Babe.  I am normally super picky with cleansers because my skin is super super sensitive and often perfumed soap and cleanser break me out in a mild allergy rash, but I was out of my normal cleanser and my face felt icky after a long day at work and 101 degree Texas weather.  I must say I was extremely impressed with this cleanser it was very gentle on my skin, extremely effective and I love the way it smells really clean.  I followed it up with my hypoallergenic lotion and my skin feels better than it ever has.  I have a hard time finding something I like this much. I have true combination skin it&#x27;s dry and flaky on my chin, between my eyes, and on both sides of my nose but my cheeks and forehead are very oily and acne prone.  I have a feeling this cleanser would do wonders for my skin with extended use and I love it as much as the other Skin79 products I have tried.  This is also a very versatile cleanser as I think it would work well for any age or skin type and even though it has a heavy fragrance it seems very mild.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> I like this mild product, though seems like a small amount. Really need 2 pumps of product to wash face, not the one pump as it suggests.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a nice cleanser since i used bb cream but it made me have even more break out as i already have acne prone skin. This product doesnt go well with me</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this product rather than it is amazing!!! You dont really feel that your removing makeup but its more like skipping towards cleansing (almost like hit-two-birds-with-one-stone kinda thing) ALTHOUGH! I suggest you cleanse your face afterwards as well.............. But occasionally you also see random product spilled out of the pump which i don&#x27;t understand but I don&#x27;t really mind at all.......</li>
            <li> I read the reviews thinking this bb cleanser was perfect since I am also using the SKIN 79 BB cream. However after I use it, my skin felt tight and dry and not very clean. The next morning, I could see the dead skins, the dry sign on my face, especially around my mouth and eyes even after I use my routine moisturizer. This never happen when I use Philosophy Purity or even the CETAPHIL antibacterial cleansing bar. I am gonna send it away.  I would stick to my DHC deep cleansing oil followed by the cetaphil cleansing bar if I have BB cream or any makeup on my face. The combo makes my skin clean, fresh and no more breakout.</li>
            <li> It arrived faster than I thought it would.  Actually using it is fine as it is in a pump.  This also doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or make it feel tight.  I will be buying more when this runs low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about three days now and LOVE it.  It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out your face at all.  I&#x27;m a Pacific Islander with naturally super oily skin but this product has actually helped to control the oiliness.  This face wash doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all and I don&#x27;t feel like I need to apply moisturizer right after washing because my face feels so tight.  It has a pleasant smell and really does feel like it&#x27;s cleansing my face.  I&#x27;ve seen improvement overall in my face.  It&#x27;s gentle enough to use twice daily.  At night, I also use an exfoliating scrub with this face wash to keep a glowing complexion but think just using this product alone would work just as well.  I also use/recommend using this brand&#x27;s tinted moisturizer.  It&#x27;s great as well.  Overall...very satisfied with this product and will definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I choose 5 stars because this cleansed met way beyond my expectations. It cleaned my pores and refined my tone. It had somewhat of a drying effect on delicate areas like around my nose however it cleaned my black heads up quickly.  I will Definately be ordering this again. Just wish there was a larger bottle. Thats the only drawback lol</li>
            <li> Great exfoliating cleanser</li>
            <li> Enjoy this face wash, but it is not my Holy Grail. Goes on like a thin cream and bubbles up into a lather. Smells fantastic. Not sure how much &#x27;detox&#x27; is happening to my skin - I have not seen a decrease in blackheads or pimples while using it, but as a thorough, non-soap face wash it is great. Leaves skin soft, not too dry or tight, but in no way emollient either. Probably not a great choice for dry or sensitive skins. The texture of this stuff leads me to believe it would also be great for shaving but I have yet to try it out.  Container with pump is sterile and secure enough for the gym bag. I&#x27;d likely repurchase this as it is good value for money, unless I discover a better product first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for cleansing BB cream. It has great smell and makes my oily skin fresh and no any tight or uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> This item was ship on time, but it came damage. The product spilled all over the other item in the package and also it was not package proper duo to it being liquid. My fault for not looking up the return or refund . I have to return it to then get a refund .</li>
            <li> Unlike other face cleansers which make your skin dry and flaky, this BB cleanser leaves your face super clean and soft. Even though there&#x27;s no exfoliate beads in it, you can see the difference in your pores with the first use. Some people said you don&#x27;t even need to use makeup remover before washing your face with this cleanser, but as a clean freak, I would always use makeup remover cloth first, then while my face still wet, massage this cleanser onto my face for 30 seconds, then leave it on for 2 mins and wash away all the foam. I know it&#x27;s bad to touch your face but I can&#x27;t stop touching my silky skin after every time I use this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this product! This stuff feels amazing and makes my skin feel so clean after using it. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have ever used, I wish I could find it in stores. It removes makeup and cleanses without making my skin feel dry. Only a little bit is needed and it lathers up nicely. I have tried other products in stores but nothing compares to this face wash. I would definitely recommend giving it a try and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> exellent i dont feel my skin dry or oily</li>
            <li> This cleanser is wonderful, it smells nice and love that it really deep cleanses your skin, getting out all the oil, dirt and bacteria build up. It&#x27;s refreshing and has improved the appearance of my skin. I also love that it lasts awhile, I&#x27;m still on my first bottle even though I use this daily, since buying it about 3-4 months ago.</li>
            <li> It does what it says and it smells elegant.</li>
            <li> My skin feels throughly clean and hydrated. No breakouts since I began use of the prouct along w Skin 79 BB cream. My pores are smaller and my skin glows and looks smooth and pretty. I&#x27;m over 40 but feel like I look much younger with glowing skin. Love the way cleanser foams into skin to deep clean pores without drying.</li>
            <li> Really good cleanser and it makes my face really soft. Only downside is that it made me break out. ( I have super sensitive skin though.) I&#x27;m sure for most people this will work perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser.  It leaves my face with a nice glow and very soft.  I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really loved!&lt;br /&gt;Let my skin very soft and take of all the mascara that I use that is water prove without any effort.</li>
            <li> This product tingled and rejuvenates the skin for amazingly soft skin. You cannot go wrong in using this product. I am almost 50 and my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li> I like this BB Cream Cleaner. It also arrived fast and I will order this again after I finish it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product , let me face súper clean and fresh, this is the second time that I buy it so much that I liked!</li>
            <li> I just recieved this product today, lightening fast shipping, i haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it yet, and base on the reviews i&#x27;m sure it is a great product, however the seal that ensures that cap hasn&#x27;t been removed was broken, so that was a little questionable.</li>
            <li> I wasnt really expecting much of this product, i just bought it cuz i bough the bb cream and said, well lets try it. Im really happy i bought it, its amazing, feels really good on the skin, and gives this clean sensation that i love.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. It really gets all my BB cream that I wear off, although you are supposed to avoid your eyes so you can&#x27;t use it to take off your eye makeup. It&#x27;s a gel and then after you rub it on your face it gets all bubbly which feels really cool! It also gets my face clean without it getting all dried out. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff. The smell is light, powdery and heavenly!</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cleanser. I like the way you put it on your face and it foams up then disappears. I use it once in a while, not daily. I don&#x27;t really see that it is any better than any other over the counter face cleaner I have used, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> I have spend a lot of money on my face, and used many different products.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry sensitive skin, most cleansers dry out my skin and make wrinkles more prominent, but this cleanser leaves my skin soft, hydrated and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and foams the minute water comes in touch with it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tend to pay a lot for products. Very happy to find a solid product that is cheaper and better. This is a great foaming face wash and I love the way my skin looks after using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> This face wash has a fizzy bubbling effect that left my skin with small red marks that took a long time to fade. I think the fizzy factor irritates the skin, at least for me.</li>
            <li> First I splash some warm water on my face then I lather up a shot of the cleanser in my hand, apply it all over, then gently work it in with a washcloth, just to make sure to get all the BB cream off, especially from places such as the corner of the nose, etc. (Be careful not to rub the washcloth in your immediate under eye area to avoid wrinkles.) This says \\&quot;One Shot\\&quot; on the package but I do usually use more than one shot of the cleanser after I rinse off the initial amount, just to be sure. My skin feels very soft &amp; super clean afterwards, if not a bit tight. I immediately apply my moisturizer. I am in my early 40&#x27;s with very pale, dry, photosensitive skin &amp; usually use BB cream as my only makeup. *This product is NOT fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> The product is much better looking in real life than it is in the picture here on Amazon. The bottle was also much larger than I expected, but I didn&#x27;t read the description first, so that&#x27;s my bad. I&#x27;m very happy with it, and my face seems to look brighter after I wash it off. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all afterwards, and overall it just feels very good and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every facial cleanser in existence (or at least it feels that way).  I have had acne since I was around 11 years old and am now 42.  I have oily skin with areas of dry skin on my cheeks. This cleanser leaves my skin not only truly clean but soft, less oily and helps to clear my acne.</li>
            <li> As someone who only recently got into the world of Asian BB creams, I&#x27;m still learning what&#x27;s available out there. Real BB creams are a lot thicker than the BB creams that are generally available in the US, and I was concerned about how much they would clog my pores or if I could get all of it off of my face with my usual washing. I often used a face wipe, followed by face wash, then again used a face wipe. There&#x27;d always be some of the cream left on the second go-around with the face wipe. So when I saw a cleanser made especially for BB creams, and made by the same SKIN79 company, I was really excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light, pleasant scent which is a little perfume-y, which I&#x27;m usually not a fan of, but I found it nice with this. It comes out somewhat opaque and white, and is like a gel when you start spreading it on your face. But as soon as you start moving it around and massaging it into your skin, it turns into a thick foam that spreads a lot like shaving cream. I massaged it for a few minutes before finally rinsing it off, which proved to be a bit more difficult than I had expected due to its thickness. After drying with a towel, I used a face wipe to see how clean it made my skin, and there was no trace of BB cream left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt soft and re-hydrated after using this; I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to moisturize the way I normally do after a face wash, and there was no tight feeling. I would definitely recommend this to anyone using BB creams or heavy makeup!</li>
            <li> ...Removing makeup and sunscreen. It foams up in a lovely way and really seems provide a deep clean. However, I don&#x27;t use this product exclusively, so I can&#x27;t say much for its other potential properties (moisturizing ability, results with extended use, etc).&lt;br /&gt;I use it to take off makeup and sunscreen, and then follow with Proactiv wash for my somewhat acne-prone skin. I feel like the BB cleanser does a much better job of cleaning off the extra &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; than the Proactiv alone, but the Proactiv delivers the extra exfoliation and medication that my skin craves to stay clear.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan, but that was mostly due to the overwhelming strong perfumed scent. I used product several times but could not tolerate the after smell. It did great removing BB cream but I did not enjoy having to smell it for several hours after. If you are sensitive to strong scents, I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical of switching to new cleanser line, but when I bought the Hot Pink BB cream, I instantly became hooked on the SKIN79 line. I use this with my Clarisonic Mia, and the results are fantastic. Within a week, all of light acne had subsided and I now have beautiful, clear, skin. The only complaint I have is that when you are washing it off, if you happen to taste any of the residue, it takes 15 minutes for the sourness to go away. It seems like every time I wash my face no matter how long I do it, I always get that harsh taste. Not the worst feeling in the world, but that it gets old after a while.</li>
            <li> I am 53 and this is the best skin cleanser ever.  No residue left on your face at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE MAKE THIS PRODUCT IN A WIPE AS WELL.  I WOULD BE SO HAPPY...</li>
            <li> This product removes it all. Makeup. waterproof mascara, lipstick, are washed off easily. I use it at the end of day with a spin brush and it seems to keep my pimple/blackheads under control. If you are 50 y/o like me you will want to add a moisturizer when you finish washing. Great for humid or heavily polluted areas. Your face feels and is clean.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  This is about the only cleanser that easily removes all traces of the BB cream I wear.  Not drying, and the bubbles feel nice.</li>
            <li> I love its bubbles~ it is very soft and comfortable. but there is a problem with the bottle. the cleaner always comes out automatically.</li>
            <li> The foam was nice and it seemed to do a good job clearing off my makeup but it dried out my skin WAY too much even with all the moisturizers I&#x27;d put on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 days, but I can already see an improvement in my skin. I have combination/oily, sensitive skin and it&#x27;s a very gentile cleanser. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like this cleaner a lot.  It comes out in gel form and then really foams when you start rubbing it in.  Then you let it sits for a few minutes and the white foam disappears! The smell is really nice and the cleanser gets rid of all your makeup leftover on your face. Might have broken me out the first few days I used it but hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin since.</li>
            <li> My face always feels really refreshed and clean after using it. It helps to get all the makeup off. You really don&#x27;t need that much to do anything to your face either. So I like that a lot.</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly &amp;#62;.&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;Im a guy and i like this product... guess its the korean in me.</li>
            <li> Skin Background:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman, close to 40 years old. I have dealt with pretty serious acne on and off since I was about 11, I have rosacea and a mild case of solar dermatitis (and I live in the hot, sunny, sweaty south). My pores are quite large around the nose area and are always filled with dirt and oil no matter what product I&#x27;ve applied (and there have been many, many, many products, I could pay graduate school tuition for my children if I could get that money back). Basically, my skin is horrible. I have a few acne scars, discoloration and uneven tone and texture. My skin is combination skin, but in a different way...it&#x27;s dry one week and oily the next. As with most women with troubled skin, I have wasted TONS of money on makeup, skin care products and natural skin care \\&quot;remedies\\&quot;. Because of this, I can usually tell if something is going to work for me after one application. My skin is actually not very sensitive to products, just to hormones and the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product:&lt;br /&gt;I received this product, and the BB Cream I ordered, within 3 days of pressing the order button (ordered both from Costsell). The product is dispensed as a milky white gel, but as applied to the face it morphs into a thick, creamy foam. I use 3 pumps of product. The longer you rub it over your face, the thicker the foam, so don&#x27;t give up if it&#x27;s not foaming fast enough for you. The product says to avoid the eye area, but the Skin79 website says it removes eyeliner...which typically is applied to the eye area, no? Anyway, it removed all of my mascara without issue. I only had to wash once to feel like I had removed all the junk off my face, which hardly happens. My skin felt \\&quot;normal\\&quot; after washing. It wasn&#x27;t tight, it wasn&#x27;t oily, it was just clean. My pores are still there and still junky (as they probably always will be), but they didn&#x27;t seem to ooze sebum throughout the rest of the day. Ooze is a bad word, I&#x27;m not a gross, oily freak or anything, but if you have thatissue, you will know what I mean (and know that you aren&#x27;t alone). Tonight I washed my face in the sink and it performed great, rinsing off very well with just a few slashes of water. It removed all of the BB Cream from my face. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again. I think I may be a budding Skin79 addict. I really need a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a Month Later:&lt;br /&gt;I paid $10 for this product a month ago. Seems like the name is changed slightly and the price has increased quite a bit. Hmmmm. If my review wasn&#x27;t attached to the product by Amazon based on my actual purchase, I would be confused as to if this is what I purchased or not. Anyway, it&#x27;s been a month. I still have some of the product left, but I no longer use it daily. I started noticing a gradual increase in the dryness of my skin after the first week of use, and a few more whiteheads than normal, but it&#x27;s also turning into summer here in the wickedly hot, sun bleached south. I&#x27;m happy with the clean feeling, just not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase again after noticing the minute changes in description and the changes in price after such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, will buy again, wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it but I&#x27;m glad I try it, you should too</li>
    </ol>
