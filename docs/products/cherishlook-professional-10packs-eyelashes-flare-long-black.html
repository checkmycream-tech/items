    <ol>
            <li> I love these individual eyelashes. My order was received within 3 business days.</li>
            <li> I been doing my own individual eyelashes for 2 years. I must say that I&#x27;ve used even lashes from the dollar store and there is no difference. Is not really about the lashes is about how you apply them. Definitely love these ones because they are the most affordable one. I&#x27;ll be ordering again soon</li>
            <li> Love it. High quality</li>
            <li> Lashes are as expected for the price.  The shipped and arrived in a timely manner.  The only problem was that the lashes did not come in a case to prevent them from falling off of package and getting all mixed up.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good product. They don&#x27;t stick to container and I don&#x27;t ruin them with tweezers when removing them from pack. Return customer.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are bent and damaged.</li>
            <li> Saves me a ton of money doing my own lashes and these come at unbeatable prices. Theses are very long so I would only recommend them to people that are going for that super dramatic look.</li>
            <li> All where there none missing even tho kinda hard for some to pull off but overall for the price excellent.</li>
            <li> Great quality , very rich and lush lashes and the amount you get is amazing for the price , you won&#x27;t be disappointed ladies these are a MUST in your beauty must haves !!</li>
            <li> Worth every cent!!! Great eyelashes very good used them for a wedding party they all loved them! A great deal</li>
            <li> After reviewing all the feedback from the customers, I ordered for the first time and here is my thought:&lt;br /&gt;1/ great price&lt;br /&gt;2/ fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;3/items look exactly in the picture when they come</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT FOR MY DAUGHTER, SHE IS VERY SATISFIED!</li>
            <li> Everything they said they would be. I just hope they will last a long time. I also ordered the short but I will return them and get mediums.</li>
            <li> I love these SOSO MUCH! These lashes came in pretty fast. there&#x27;s a lot of lashes so they&#x27;ll last A WHILE. I only used one row for each eye AND They look super voluminous and long without any mascara. Girls this is a must in your beauty routine! It takes up some time but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> These worked just as well as any other brand!! What a deal thanks! I will refer to friends! Good product</li>
            <li> These lashes are great... Just as good but not ass full as Ardell lashes</li>
            <li> Great price for the long lashes. They feel really nice and they look real. I am going to order them again.</li>
            <li> As always this vendor is fast getting my Lash order to me, and the quality of these Lashes  are impeccable. I ordered the Medium Last order and decided to go long this time around. I get so many compliments. Can&#x27;t beat the qty offered for the price. Considering I do my lashes every week my preference though you can go two Ior three weeks this fits my needs not having to run out every week and buy. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Adequate but flimsy- many will break apart or distort when you pull lash off the holder. Priced cheap but you are getting what you pay for.  Japonesque is better quality but also higher priced.</li>
