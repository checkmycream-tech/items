            <li>and I think that this is one of the best, especially to purchase online and not have it arrive all kinky from being folded, so no need to steam!</li>

            <li>Super cute and fun to wear!</li>
            <li>Great for Cosplay or daily wear c:</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of the color purple at all, but this is my most gorgeous wig.</li>
            <li>SO Much!!!</li>
            <li>Is exactly as pictured!!</li>
            <li>OKAY, let me first start off by saying I have never bought a wig...</li>
            <li>Its sucha beautiful color and not very shiny at all I 1000000000000% recommend this wigc:</li>
            <li>and the rich purple color transitions to a brown at the tips of the wig.</li>
            <li>However the effect satisfied the wearer and that is all that really mattered!</li>
            <li>Beautiful wig, which arrived within expected time frame.</li>
            <li>And I love how its heat safe and it so soft!</li>
            <li>Bought it to wear for a specific event but, can see myself wearing it &amp;#34;just because.&amp;#34; Really nice quality and the color is stunning.</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wig :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice and so soft and exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>The color is rich and vibrant, it has a part on top to make it look natural!!!</li>
            <li>It will be nice to have for future costume parties.</li>
            <li>I kind of just want to wear it on a regular day.  </li>
            <li>The picture is right on with the color.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, thick, and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>also it fit kind of tight on my head, it might of been because of my hair</li>
            <li>but you can let it down and it looks just as good.</li>
            <li>the upside is that it was super soft and long it felt like good quality</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a nice purple wig that you can actually wear as part of your normal attire, not just party and playtime, THIS IS IT!</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying a wig.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t even see the scalp except for the part in which it looks exactly like a scalp should.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, the gradient ends in brownish ends which I really love but thought to mention since it is not obvious from the picture.</li>
            <li>Probably won&#x27;t last more than a couple weeks, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li>but I wanted to have purple hair for New years and be super incognito...</li>
            <li>but it was nothing like that it was a bright  purple on top and a weird reddish-brown at the bottom.</li>
            <li>&amp; it doesn&#x27;t look much like the picture at all, it has a purple top &amp; an obnoxious red underneath which I&#x27;ll probably fix with a Sharpie.</li>
            <li>I really like this and will use it.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig as a gift and when I saw it, it was much darker than the photos make it look.</li>
            <li>it fits very well, it sheds alittle bit</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Got here fast.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li>it gets so knotty so fast and the bangs  keep messing up on me</li>
            <li>It tangles super easy and is a little shiny</li>
            <li>This wig is so pretty and so soft!</li>
            <li>everyone loves it more than my other wigs,  </li>
            <li>I needed a colored wig for a party, so I just ordered this because it looked cute and was less than $20.  </li>
            <li>The wig is a really nice quality of soft, silky material and it has weight to it but not at all heavy to wear.</li>
            <li>should know that it has a decent amount of weight on it.</li>
            <li>So soft, thick, good quality...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and gorgeous colors.</li>
            <li>In a certain angle, it looks like a wig but it usually looks like real hair which is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Its comfortable and isn&#x27;t at all itchy like some other wigs</li>
            <li>It is a pretty wig and looked nice, being thick enough to not show any wig structure through the strands.</li>
            <li>It even looks good on African American skin (I&#x27;m black).</li>
            <li>The only surprise was the &amp;#34;mixed gradient&amp;#34; was not a richer purple at the top to some other shade of purple at the bottom.</li>
            <li>first of all the date for delivery kept changing but the last date that  </li>
            <li>Just got mine early!</li>
            <li>This wig has soft hair!  </li>
            <li>a dark purple something at was some what ok to wear in public.</li>
            <li>Great wig just a little odd in the bangs and thin on top of head.</li>
            <li>You could hardly tell there is a change in color from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>THIS WIG IS SO SOFT AND AMAZING!!!c: I experience almost no tangles at allc:</li>
            <li>it came a day early.</li>
            <li>Soft feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s good because it stays firmly on the head.</li>
            <li>love the fact that it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li>The hair was perfectly brushed when it arrived and this wig looks a lot higher quality than party city wigs of the same price.</li>
            <li>Very shiny with no volume, bangs hang into eyes, the brownish underside is more like an unappealing faded red.</li>
            <li>Fits well, very thick wigs, but the ends are much more brown than the picture lets on.</li>
            <li>This wig is very soft and super thick.</li>
            <li>You could wear this everyday, it&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
            <li>Super soft and thick!</li>
            <li>But is to be expected by any wig that is a non natural color!</li>

            <li> In a certain angle, it looks like a wig but it usually looks like real hair which is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Its comfortable and isn&#x27;t at all itchy like some other wigs</li>
            <li> It is a pretty wig and looked nice, being thick enough to not show any wig structure through the strands.</li>
            <li> It even looks good on African American skin (I&#x27;m black).</li>
            <li> The only surprise was the &amp;#34;mixed gradient&amp;#34; was not a richer purple at the top to some other shade of purple at the bottom.</li>

            <li> THIS WIG IS SO SOFT AND AMAZING!!!c: I experience almost no tangles at allc:</li>
            <li> it came a day early.</li>
            <li> Soft feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s good because it stays firmly on the head.</li>
            <li> love the fact that it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> The hair was perfectly brushed when it arrived and this wig looks a lot higher quality than party city wigs of the same price.</li>
            <li> Very shiny with no volume, bangs hang into eyes, the brownish underside is more like an unappealing faded red.</li>
            <li> Fits well, very thick wigs, but the ends are much more brown than the picture lets on.</li>
            <li> This wig is very soft and super thick.</li>
            <li> You could wear this everyday, it&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
            <li> Super soft and thick!</li>
            <li> But is to be expected by any wig that is a non natural color!</li>
            <li> it doesnt have that light silly look and feel to it.</li>
            <li> It comes in the two braids already, and the bangs aren&#x27;t too long.</li>
            <li> A little small for my head but still fits if you adjust it right</li>
            <li> Although the back is a bit thin and the straps are a bit loose, I overall really like this wig.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin on the back of the head and really, really shiny.</li>
            <li> It is really soft and long; It went past my girlfriend&#x27;s shoulders.</li>
            <li> Represented well in pic, although it was a slightly darker purple (which I actually prefer to purple of pic).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other wigs that make really long bangs</li>
            <li> i wish it would of came with a wig or net cap to hold it on keeps falling off its so heavy</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have a really big head, but this wig was too small for my head.</li>
            <li> other than that it did the job.</li>
            <li> for)&lt;br /&gt;It sheds a little, but that is expected with any wig.</li>
            <li> Fairly thin as far as wigs go</li>
            <li> Please also note that i am Black</li>
            <li> It was just a little thin in the back but with the hair down, you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> Color was a little darker than pictured.  </li>
            <li> If you look closely you will see the ends are brown, there is a little bit woven into the wig.</li>
            <li> However, I think the biggest problem is it being too thin in the back.</li>
            <li> so you  can wear it for everyday use (thats what I bought it</li>
            <li> I actually found some purple false lashes to go with it.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the part is a bit weird</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick hair, so I&#x27;m used to the weight of this wig, but others who aren&#x27;t used to wigs weighing a bit</li>
            <li> I cut the wig a little bit so it wouldn&#x27;t look fake!</li>
            <li> My friends seriously thought I died my hair!</li>
            <li> but it was just the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it arrived the day after I needed it, but I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
            <li> the weird cosplay hair cut.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by the quality for the price.</li>

            <li> Wow, nice quality wig!  I really like this and will use it.</li>
            <li> Super cute and fun to wear! The wig looks good! it doesnt have that light silly look and feel to it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a wig. Although the back is a bit thin and the straps are a bit loose, I overall really like this wig. It&#x27;s a nice color and it comes braided but you can let it down and it looks just as good. In a certain angle, it looks like a wig but it usually looks like real hair which is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Honestly was impressed with the Quality of the wig. Loved it! Great for Cosplay or daily wear c:</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have a really big head, but this wig was too small for my head. I made it work for halloween because I had no choice, other than that it did the job.</li>
            <li> Arrived beautiful and Love the rich purple color. Can style it anyway you want. Come with a hair net too.</li>
            <li> OKAY, let me first start off by saying I have never bought a wig...ever....i hate wigs....but I wanted to have purple hair for New years and be super incognito...THAT BEING SAID this wig is AWESOME! So soft, thick, good quality...I brushed it and all the hair stayed in place.....it has this beautiful blend of brown in with the purple. The colors blew me away...this experience totally changed the way I look at wigs and I LOOK AWESOME WITH PURPLE HAIR...who knew? Im stoked, it also came in the mail in like 4 days.</li>
            <li> I love the wig. It came already in the pigtails. I&#x27;m allergic to synthetic hair, so I had a reaction but it&#x27;s just so beautiful. It was just a little thin in the back but with the hair down, you can&#x27;t tell. Very easy to care for and does not tangle easily.</li>
            <li> Hello! This is a really nice wig! :)</li>
            <li> THIS WIG IS SO SOFT AND AMAZING!!!c: I experience almost no tangles at allc: Its sucha beautiful color and not very shiny at all I 1000000000000% recommend this wigc:</li>
            <li> Very shiny with no volume, bangs hang into eyes, the brownish underside is more like an unappealing faded red.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig as a gift and when I saw it, it was much darker than the photos make it look. It&#x27;s thin on the back of the head and really, really shiny. You could hardly tell there is a change in color from top to bottom. It is really soft and long; It went past my girlfriend&#x27;s shoulders. The picture shows the wig braided, but I doubt you can do that seeing has you need some hair hiding the back, so the wig cap will not show. The bangs were nice, the length was good, the color was not bad either for it being darker. However, I think the biggest problem is it being too thin in the back.</li>
            <li> Bangs need to be trimmed but it&#x27;s suuuuch a nice wig! Super soft and thick!</li>
            <li> I like to wear long wigs and run around my house, this is perfect for that purpose. looks as pictured- and the rich purple color transitions to a brown at the tips of the wig. Looks hella fine though.</li>
            <li> I got this wig a year ago and it is amazing :-) it fits very well, it sheds alittle bit but it was very nice! I cut the wig a little bit so it wouldn&#x27;t look fake! Its a very good wig</li>
            <li> Beautiful costume wig.  Bought it to wear for a specific event but, can see myself wearing it &amp;#34;just because.&amp;#34; Really nice quality and the color is stunning.</li>
            <li> I needed a colored wig for a party, so I just ordered this because it looked cute and was less than $20.  I was shocked that it&#x27;s so soft and really nice quality.  The hair was perfectly brushed when it arrived and this wig looks a lot higher quality than party city wigs of the same price.</li>
            <li> just got this in the mail today, I&#x27;m in love! it&#x27;s so amazing, i dont want to take it off. &lt;3</li>
            <li> Super cute wig. Plan on wearing it to an upcoming color run. Fast shipping. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> I love purple and this wig has a great feel and quality to it. It is well made and sewn together very nicely. If you are looking for a nice purple wig that you can actually wear as part of your normal attire, not just party and playtime, THIS IS IT! In my opinion, this wig is awesome enough to go from daytime, fashion forward, and chic to nightlife in a snap. I actually found some purple false lashes to go with it. Please also note that i am Black and it goes with my complexion very nicely. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great item. The quality and color are really great!</li>
            <li> Fits well, very thick wigs, but the ends are much more brown than the picture lets on.</li>
            <li> This purchase was for a cosplay. It is a pretty wig and looked nice, being thick enough to not show any wig structure through the strands. The only surprise was the &amp;#34;mixed gradient&amp;#34; was not a richer purple at the top to some other shade of purple at the bottom. It was purple at the top grading out to brown at the bottom.  However the effect satisfied the wearer and that is all that really mattered!</li>
            <li> The color is rich and vibrant, it has a part on top to make it look natural!!! I highly recommend this wig :) It even looks good on African American skin (I&#x27;m black). You could wear this everyday, it&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
            <li> Color was a little darker than pictured.  I put it on and it felt good on.  Package arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> This wig is so pretty and so soft! I love it!</li>
            <li> If you look closely you will see the ends are brown, there is a little bit woven into the wig. The wig is a really nice quality of soft, silky material and it has weight to it but not at all heavy to wear. Impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> first of all the date for delivery kept changing but the last date that  I checked it came a day early. I thought it was gonna be just like the picture a dark purple something at was some what ok to wear in public. but it was nothing like that it was a bright  purple on top and a weird reddish-brown at the bottom. also it fit kind of tight on my head, it might of been because of my hair but I don&#x27;t know. the upside is that it was super soft and long it felt like good quality but it was just the wrong color. I wont be buying from this company again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great ! It tangles super easy and is a little shiny but it&#x27;s so cute on me all that doesn&#x27;t matter !</li>
            <li> Very nice, full looking wig. Unfortunately it arrived the day after I needed it, but I&#x27;m keeping it. It will be nice to have for future costume parties.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! Looks just like it does in the pics, fits good as well. Got here fast.</li>
            <li> I like this wig but it has that shiny feature that makes it look like a wig when you wear it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it&#x27;s thick so you can&#x27;t even see the scalp except for the part in which it looks exactly like a scalp should. the bangs were perfect for my head. I&#x27;ve had other wigs that make really long bangs so you can cut them but this wig already has the perfect cut for any face. the only reason it&#x27;s getting four stars is because of the shiny feature. if it wasn&#x27;t so shiny, it would be a perfect 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Just got mine early! Extremely fast shipping. It&#x27;s so nice and so soft and exactly like the picture. It&#x27;s a tad smaller than I expected, but it&#x27;s good because it stays firmly on the head. I LOVE IT SO Much!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig, which arrived within expected time frame. Represented well in pic, although it was a slightly darker purple (which I actually prefer to purple of pic). Looks great without piggy tails too.</li>
            <li> I love this wig every time I wear it people always stop me for it! I&#x27;m buying another one to to put away since I wear my current one so often. I have really short hair that I&#x27;m growing out so having the wig to change things up is awesome! Thanks to this wig I now own 4 wigs!</li>
            <li> This wig has soft hair!  The picture is right on with the color.  It can be styled lots of different ways. I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Wow, what an incredible wig! I was shocked by the quality for the price. As others have mentioned, the gradient ends in brownish ends which I really love but thought to mention since it is not obvious from the picture. Awesome wig!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome! My friends seriously thought I died my hair! Fantastic! Its comfortable and isn&#x27;t at all itchy like some other wigs</li>
            <li> Fairly thin as far as wigs go &amp; it doesn&#x27;t look much like the picture at all, it has a purple top &amp; an obnoxious red underneath which I&#x27;ll probably fix with a Sharpie. Probably won&#x27;t last more than a couple weeks, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Is exactly as pictured!! Very pretty wig! It comes in the two braids already, and the bangs aren&#x27;t too long. I will trim them to better suit my face though. It&#x27;s very thick and gorgeous colors. The only thing is that the part is a bit weird and it&#x27;s a bit shiny. But is to be expected by any wig that is a non natural color! Just put baby powder on it and it&#x27;ll be fine. Over all, I love the wig, great purchase!!!</li>
            <li> This wig is great!  it came braided, i unbraided it and it was beautiful and silky.  Nice and relaxed wave!  I kind of just want to wear it on a regular day.  I have a massive stash of wigs and I think that this is one of the best, especially to purchase online and not have it arrive all kinky from being folded, so no need to steam!</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig back in December, 2014. I have to say... I am not a big fan of the color purple at all, but this is my most gorgeous wig. This wig is very soft and super thick. I have naturally thick hair, so I&#x27;m used to the weight of this wig, but others who aren&#x27;t used to wigs weighing a bit should know that it has a decent amount of weight on it. Ever since I bought this wig, I&#x27;ve only needed to brush it a few times because it never tangles, and it doesn&#x27;t shed too much. The pic for my review was taken 6 months after purchase.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, thick, and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;I personally liked the wig more when I took the braids out.</li>
            <li> A little small for my head but still fits if you adjust it right everyone loves it more than my other wigs,  wish it had more hair for more volume.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price. Soft feel. I just didn&#x27;t like the brown hair tip and the weird cosplay hair cut. The bangs are too big and too bowl cut for me. But after being trimmed, this will work out perfectly for my alter ego.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> it gets so knotty so fast and the bangs  keep messing up on me i wish it would of came with a wig or net cap to hold it on keeps falling off its so heavy</li>
            <li> Great wig just a little odd in the bangs and thin on top of head.</li>
            <li> Cutest wig ever!! Easy to style and manage. Just don&#x27;t try to curl it with heat appliances lol. Instead use rollers.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and wig as pictured. My sister in law loves doing different makeups and this purple shade was something she didn&#x27;t have in her wig drawer! Made a great Christmas stocking stuffer! :)</li>
            <li> I love it!! it&#x27;s so pretty and it&#x27;s not to shiny either so you  can wear it for everyday use (thats what I bought it for)&lt;br /&gt;It sheds a little, but that is expected with any wig. And I love how its heat safe and it so soft!</li>
