            <li>Bought a large bottle of this for my son; this is his newest scent.  </li>
            <li>It really is a turn on to a lot of people.</li>
            <li>Had read about scams substituting bogus scents for the real thing - didn&#x27;t happen to me.  </li>

            <li>I guess it&#x27;s ok, but the scent does not last as long as when it first came out.</li>
            <li>Out of all my colones 20+this is hands down my most compliment getter by both sexes.</li>

            <li> This is one of the best smelling cologne&#x27;s I have ever used. A friend of mine that I once had used it and it smelled soo good that it made me go out and buy it. I get all kinds of compliments when I wear it. It really is a turn on to a lot of people.</li>
            <li> Bought a large bottle of this for my son; this is his newest scent.  It smells sooooo good on him.  Shopped all over &amp; got the best deal by far on Amazon.com  Had read about scams substituting bogus scents for the real thing - didn&#x27;t happen to me.  This is where I will order my fragrences from now on.</li>
            <li> This cologne is my husbands favorite! This was the best deal I could find online! I will definetly be back to buy more when he runs out of this one.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s ok, but the scent does not last as long as when it first came out.</li>
            <li> I got it in 2 days! It&#x27;s amazing and I love it. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it ~ and I love it!!  It&#x27;s not too expensive and I would buy it again!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, my only issue is it was listed as Amazon Prime, for 2 day shipping, and it arrived about a week after I ordered it. I was hoping to have this by the weekend, but it didn&#x27;t come in until several days after. Not a big deal, as it&#x27;s still a good product, just should be advertised correctly.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BYE THIS!! &amp;#34;&amp;#34;!! Doesn&#x27;t have any smell you can spray it and it&#x27;s like putting alcohol on your face and clothes. I have never wrote about anything that I bought until now... wished I could get my money back!  I will make sure to never buy from this company again!!  If I could give zero stars I would..</li>
            <li> still number one. Refreshing and cool  scent. A favorite amongst my brothers. They do not entertain the thought of purchasing any other colognes.</li>
            <li> the best cologne I ever had.... lasts all day and all women always ask or make good comment about it...and although I use every day, I lasted almost 11 months,,, that&#x27;s the reason why I&#x27;m buying again,,,</li>
            <li> No I will not order Curve again this did not have the strength of any Curve that I have bought thru Macy&#x27;s or other department stores, I satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Good cologne!, but to each his own. A very good price!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!!!!</li>
            <li> It smell so good. I would recommend it to every man or young man.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for a colleague deployed in Afghanistan who had received a $50 Walmart Giftcard and had asked me to buy this for him when I was on leave. I was worried that the card would only allow me to pay for the lowest price shipping and that the cologne might arrive after my departure date of September 13 preventing me from taking the cologne with me that trip.  Well, lo and behold, although I ordered it in the evening of September 8, it arrived the afternoon of September 9. I don&#x27;t even know how they managed to ship it so quickly! Needless to say, my colleague is overjoyed since he said he likes this cologne and hadn&#x27;t been able to find it for years. Thanks, from people in the UN mission in Afghanistan!</li>
            <li> Out of all my colones 20+this is hands down my most compliment getter by both sexes. People absolutely love it. Does not smell dated. I don&#x27;t get the frat/ high school references at all. This is my main staple go to.I will always have this juice in my collection. For the price you get a big bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected it to be. It is also a great value in relation to size and cost. My boyfriend is super happy with his gift. And as a consumer I am super happy with my purchase. I will most likely get it for someone else again soon.</li>
            <li> Nice long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years. Always get compliments from the ladies. The price is a great deal too.</li>
            <li> My favorite for a man to wear!! Bought it for my bf and that&#x27;s all he wears now. Price is rly not bad for the size of this bottle too.</li>
            <li> Still stuck in the old age but love the smell of this S***</li>
            <li> Does not smell like curve at all!!!! Smells like spice and it&#x27;s very strong! Curve should smell sweet and not itch the nose!</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery</li>
