            <li>This is a nice eyeliner that wears really well.</li>
            <li>It has more of a golden bronze tint to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super creamy and goes on really easily.</li>
            <li>It lasts much longer than most eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Its not a bad liner but the color is not what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a nice eyeliner</li>
            <li>much superior to other pencil gels.  </li>
            <li>also love the color Dark Choco - very complimentary!</li>
            <li>The sparkle really brings out my eyes!</li>
            <li>a natural smooth gliding and sweatproof eyeliner but</li>
            <li>I bought Dark Choco and it&#x27;s a nice rich brown and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>The color dark choco is a beautiful dark, rich, brown color.</li>
            <li>It is just a nice dark brown color</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I expected more from this product.</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this purchase and will be using it in the long term.</li>
            <li>I love the Clio products but noticed this one is made in China when they are usually Korea</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too soft for me to use, i have to use a brush</li>
            <li>Very long lasting.isn&#x27;t quite as dark as I thought it would be, but very nice and a  little shimmery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now because it&#x27;s a pretty big product.</li>
            <li>They last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>Love the dark chocolate color, makes it somewhat softer than black.  </li>
            <li>Yes, this is a brown liner but its not very dark.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t pull the delicate skin along the eyelids.  </li>
            <li>If you want a dark brown color, this is not going to be what you expect, so just be aware of that.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily eyelids and live in a very hot environment (CA desert) and this is the only eyeliner that last all day for me (Dark Choco).</li>
            <li>Id say it has a slight coppery undertone,  rather than a true dark chocolate brown.</li>

            <li> It makes my eyes little bit sensitive</li>
            <li> i got the dark brown,</li>
            <li> would like to find in purple, navy and black as well.</li>

            <li> I press hard to get some coverage but get nothing.  </li>
            <li> Smudges and hard to get off.</li>

            <li> i love the consistency of the gel pencil, it glides on perfectly, looks professional and lasts.  i got the dark brown, would like to find in purple, navy and black as well.</li>
            <li> I use this as an eye shadow instead of a liner. I just line then smudge it out. The sparkle really brings out my eyes!</li>
            <li> Great seller decent product.</li>
            <li> Got my pencil today and came broken. The gel eyeliner was stuck to the lid. I did get the gel eyeliner to come out of the lid and pushed back into the pencil. I got the beige and it has sparkle. Too shimmery for me.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! It glides so nicely and the color is pretty too...  Stays on all day!  I ordered one in black too!</li>
            <li> Ordered this pencil in Espresso Brown and sorry I did not order a Black one too for evenings.  I am a redhead so I like the brown for daytime use.  This pencil is fantastic and so easy to apply.  I will definitely be ordering it again........much superior to other pencil gels.  Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily eyelids and live in a very hot environment (CA desert) and this is the only eyeliner that last all day for me (Dark Choco). Plus I love the glitter in it and it never irrates my contacts. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE IT,IT FADES</li>
            <li> I love the Clio products but noticed this one is made in China when they are usually Korea so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Not as long lasting as I thought it would be but still durable</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for! a natural smooth gliding and sweatproof eyeliner but the color has a little bit of a pop to it so it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I reallllly love this product. I love that a Korean product came out to be so cheap on Amazon. I read great reviews for this gel eyeliner so I decided to get it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now because it&#x27;s a pretty big product. It applies smooth and for a girl who has oily eyelids, it does not smudge and leave embarrassing panda eye residue like most eyeliners do. The color dark choco is a beautiful dark, rich, brown color. I can&#x27;t wait to purchase it in different colors. I am hoping to try the beige shine soon. I am so excited about this purchase and will be using it in the long term.</li>
            <li> This is a nice eyeliner that wears really well. It lasts much longer than most eyeliners. It&#x27;s super creamy and goes on really easily. The only issue I have with it is that it&#x27;s not really a dark brown, as I expected it to be. It&#x27;s more of a bronze brown. So I can wear it most of the time but not always. If you want a dark brown color, this is not going to be what you expect, so just be aware of that. It has more of a golden bronze tint to it.</li>
            <li> FAVORITE!! it works magic and the color is awesome.. :)</li>
            <li> Great pencil.  This is my 4th one. They last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> After one use the pencil stopped working.  I press hard to get some coverage but get nothing.  There is still product in the pencil  but very little color...not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> The eye pencil is great it has good color and its has good pigmentation. The only thing is that I have bought two already they keep break from where you have to twist it to bring up the color and that is really annoying.</li>
            <li> I love the way the Gelpresso pencil goes on very smoothly. The color also last with no smudges throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the color Dark Choco - very complimentary!</li>
            <li> Very nice eyeliner. I bought Dark Choco and it&#x27;s a nice rich brown and highly pigmented. It goes on very smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Awesome, exactly what I was looking for! Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> Love this product line I have the Purple and this color works abit with brown green eyes! Fav company for eyeliner</li>
            <li> This a nice smooth eyeliner with nice color.  However it is advertised as waterproof and it is definitely not.  I have to re apply during the day because it rubs off.  Overall, it is a nice eyeliner</li>
            <li> This product truly holds up to its description. It never smudges and lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;I have already purchased two more. Thank you for making a product that i don&#x27;t have to keep touching up all day.</li>
            <li> The tip got pushed into the pencil!!  I never even got to try it!!</li>
            <li> Smudges and hard to get off.</li>
            <li> The gel eyeliners make it so easy to line your eyes.  It glides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t pull the delicate skin along the eyelids.  Love the dark chocolate color, makes it somewhat softer than black.  Was really pleased with this pencil.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting.isn&#x27;t quite as dark as I thought it would be, but very nice and a  little shimmery.</li>
            <li> Terrible. After a few uses it crumbles when you try to apply it. It is completely dried out and I kept the cap on it</li>
            <li> Very good color but  my eyes did not like it . It makes my eyes little bit sensitive</li>
            <li> Slow shipping,  which I find disappointing for such a small item.  It seems to me that since its so small the merchant can afford faster shipping.  Its not a bad liner but the color is not what I had hoped for. Yes, this is a brown liner but its not very dark. Id say it has a slight coppery undertone,  rather than a true dark chocolate brown.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this product. It is just a nice dark brown color but it does tend to smudge</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too soft for me to use, i have to use a brush help me out.</li>
