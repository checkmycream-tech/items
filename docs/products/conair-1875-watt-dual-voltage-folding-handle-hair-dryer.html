            <li>Like, good to go for about 15 years.</li>
            <li>Because of the fold-down capability, this hairdryer fit perfectly into my carry-on.  </li>
            <li>Great power and the 2 heat settings are nice.</li>
            <li>Have not used it yet overseas, but on a use test it produced good airflow and heat.</li>
            <li>This is not as good as the hair dryer</li>
            <li>Still searching for a good hair blower...</li>
            <li>Must be good</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in the States yet, but I assume it will be just as good.</li>
            <li>The good thing I like about</li>
            <li>This is a good deal if you&#x27;re looking for a multi-power option for traveling.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s weight and balance are good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>this looked like a good value</li>
            <li>I LOVED IT.</li>
            <li>In the end, it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li>And it was a good value.</li>
            <li>Good for travel since handle retracts and is lightweight for travel.</li>
            <li>This could also be a good feature,</li>
            <li>Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>Light weight and perfect for a person with arthritis and difficulty holding things.</li>
            <li>It has good power and works well.</li>
            <li>I bought a cheap continental Europe adapter (no voltage changer needed) and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Not as good as one with the tip piece.</li>
            <li>And the one of the exceptional aspects is it can use at 220V condition.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with my dryer.</li>
            <li>We are very satisfied with the Conair 1875.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This worked great, with the appropriate adaptor, when I used it in Italy.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It works great - pleased with the feel, dual voltage for travel, etc.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Excellent hairdryer, folds up nicely, haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to test it on 240V yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do just fine.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I was so glad Conair still makes it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beyond satisfied!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>cute!</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li>Great power, compact shape, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Compact size makes this hair dryer great and easy to pack for weekend and/or longer trips.</li>
            <li>, it is very light weight and the power is good.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer works amazingly.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Handle folds up nicely.</li>
            <li>I know many people loved this dryer, but it didn&#x27;t suit my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice size for storage.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a hanger loop.</li>
            <li>Great hairdryer and perfect for traveling internationally.  </li>
            <li>Folds up nicely for packing as well.  </li>
            <li>and it is nicely powered.</li>
            <li>It just about stopped again today so will have to buy another kind maybe.  </li>
            <li>Nice hair dryer, dual voltage comes in handy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice and compact.  </li>
            <li>My husband had to use a tool of some kind to change the setting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also handy if someone is in the bathroom</li>
            <li>A nice hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a nice dryer for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d also be nice if they included some sort of cable management component - even just a velcro tie for when through with it</li>
            <li>would&#x27;ve been nice.  </li>
            <li>Awesome blow drying - easy to clean</li>
            <li>Barely warm on either speed.</li>
            <li>very nice very powerful</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and works great.</li>
            <li>Does a good job drying my fine hair</li>
            <li>I bought this convenient folding hair dryer when my old travel dryer needed to be replaced, and it just may be the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>&quot; button was great, too, but we rarely used it.</li>
            <li>Great for travel, compact and powerful.</li>
            <li>Handy size, but too many minuses.</li>
            <li>The dryer worked great at both 140 and 220 volts, and it was light weight and compact, easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>They can be easily switched between 110/220v by using a coin (just don&#x27;t forget!)</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully, is very light for travel, and has a fold up handle, making it very easy to pack.</li>
            <li>Works almost as good as a full size one.</li>
            <li>SUPER!!</li>
            <li>received it quick and good quality</li>
            <li>This is fantastic - it works so much better than my &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; sized one!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and compact and fit into the suitcase nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice size, convenient for travel, powerfull and light.</li>
            <li>To top it off, cleaning the filter is a cinch</li>
            <li>The dryer does not have a retractable cord, but that&#x27;s never been an issue for me, since most travel dryers also do not have a cord keeper.</li>
            <li>Worked awesome in London and Scotland while using a Universal</li>
            <li>This works OK.</li>
            <li>it does pull a lot of power and I have tripped the circuit breaker more than once.  </li>
            <li>My wife love this.</li>
            <li>Much more is that it&#x27;s AUTO-VOLT</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>if i designed hair dryers, i couldn&#x27;t do any better then this.  </li>
            <li>So glad I spotted this one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It was my only dryer and perfect for overseas.</li>
            <li>Frankly, I used to have a Conair 1875 watts that was much better than this one.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money and good quality no issues</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is perfect for international travel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and fit nicely in my baggage.</li>
            <li>is that I&#x27;ll be able to use it any where in the world.</li>
            <li>Works great and dries your hair fast.</li>
            <li>I love that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the voltage</li>
            <li>well...not much more than that.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Gifted this to my mom in India.</li>
            <li>In fact, it worked better than the one in the hotel bathroom that was made for use in Europe.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>So this one is even better.  </li>
            <li>The handle folds, making it more compact.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I gotta say I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this Hairdryer</li>
            <li>All I needed was the plug adapter that I had purchased and when I set the dryer to the international voltage the dryer functioned perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I love this blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I love how it folds up for when I travel.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you tell your wife to switch it to 220v when you go to Europe BEFORE she turns it on.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my recent trip to Europe.  </li>
            <li>Would be better if it had three speeds.</li>
            <li>After about 2 minutes, you can audibly hear the temperature sensor reset itself, after which you can use it again for about 30 more seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wish I would have shopped around for a better hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I just love it...</li>
            <li>so glad i found it here and bought this as a backup.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer to replace a different hair dryer that had fallen apart but was small,and perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>But I use it in my room which is ok for me.</li>
            <li>its sound isn&#x27;t as obnoxious as others!</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I have it for when I go to Europe again</li>
            <li>Perfect for international travel.</li>
            <li>Love it, was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>size is great and very compact.</li>
            <li>It has an American plug, but with a convertor for each country it worked wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>I love the power it throws out.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the instructions for overseas use.</li>
            <li>Really good quality, l liked it so much l bought 4,</li>
            <li>and yet it is very powerful!</li>
            <li>This dryer and a compact flat iron are the perfect pair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a great buy, I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for drying my hair but was too strong to do any &amp;#34;styling.&amp;#34;  The nozzle is wider than what I&#x27;d have liked</li>
            <li>like the cool shot button, that is a nice feature to have on a compact dryer.  </li>
            <li>Much better blow dryers are available, but for the price this more than satisfied my needs.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with my new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love how it folds and how it is easy to convert the voltage.  </li>
            <li>It is quick and nice in doing its business.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s easy, free return policy!</li>
            <li>I had no issue with over heating and had really effective power which was far superior to the dryer in our bathroom provided by the hotel.  </li>
            <li>Great dryer but LOUD!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this works fine</li>
            <li>works as good as my large one</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Overall very good product, lightweight and durable.</li>
            <li>I bought it for a trip to Europe but the hotels and apartment we stayed in actually had very good hair dryers</li>
            <li>Just make sure you turn the air intake cap counterclock wise to clean out the lint that&#x27;s caught on the grate or it becomes to hot.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t sound like a jet engine:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as great as a professional hair-dryer but for the cost and for packing efficiency, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>The most important part....</li>
            <li>I was looking for a blowdryer to go in my travel bag, it fit, but better yet works well.</li>

            <li>Good price with decent product.</li>
            <li>I used it in Paris and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>If barely took any space in my suitcase and worked great during the trip</li>
            <li>Also I LOVE the cool shot button.</li>
            <li>So much better than the full size dryer it replaced.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a trip to Europe because it has the dual voltage, is folding and lightweight, and has one of my favorite features, the cool shot button.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>works fine</li>
            <li>and it caused a fuse to blow, but fine in newer homes and hotels).  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve fine hair, but a lot of it) in scant minutes.  </li>
            <li>This is light and would probably be easy to travel with, but I&#x27;m returning it after one use.</li>
            <li>The dryer works fine.  </li>
            <li>it worked out fine</li>

            <li>Drys my hair quickly!</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace a very old travel hairdryer after reading good reviews.</li>
            <li>This little dryer is perfect.</li>
            <li>this is a wonderful little dryer.</li>
            <li>Awesome little dryer.</li>
            <li>Perfect little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The cord is longer than on most dryers, which is actually nice when traveling, because you don&#x27;t end up leaning sideways on one foot when the outlet is far from the mirror.  </li>
            <li>The reviews we read about it were accurate.  </li>
            <li>my hair doesn&#x27;t come out nearly as smooth as it does with a longer barrel drier + diffuser.  </li>
            <li>This compact styler is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and compact, so it travels well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but it still works great!</li>
            <li>I purchased for a recent trip to Italy and with the correct adapter this hairdryer worked great.  </li>
            <li>So each inch of space and each ounce of weight is important.  </li>
            <li>It is compact but not as light as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Not so great for styling my short hair.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and folds neatly.</li>
            <li>Great for short or medium length hair.</li>
            <li>and there isn&#x27;t a hair dryer available.  </li>
            <li>Light weight.  </li>
            <li>By the way, the old one we had is still good, except there is some rust on the rim now</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>It is very powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It is also very powerful for it&#x27;s size.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>Convenient for travel yet more durable looking than the older model that I had for many years.</li>
            <li>Great for short hair, not so great for long hair/pets.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for a friend and it arrived immediately - nice compact - perfect for travel - went on a month long vacation  - 3rd day on vacation</li>
            <li>This new one seems to be of equally good quality and has all the features I&#x27;d liked on my old one.</li>
            <li>It has an option for warm or normal air.</li>
            <li>Perfect... exactly that I expected and needed!</li>
            <li>Perfect size for the small suitcase I had to use for a trip to Italy.  </li>
            <li>When we got married and bought a house it has stayed on with me, becoming my primary hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I am African and it&#x27;s perfect for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>But the power over there is so strong that it feels more like high.  </li>
            <li>It is very powerful and dries my hair quite quickly.</li>
            <li>Larger than the hard-to-manipulate micro-travel dryers, smaller than the overweight full-size models, it fits perfectly in the hand and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>For a quick dry in the mornings, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get real hot other than that works great.</li>
            <li>I make my daughter bring this one when we travel since I love it so much</li>
            <li>I also like the COOL button.  </li>
            <li>A true travel dryer/styler.</li>
            <li>Has full power in a compact size.</li>
            <li>I think this blow dryer is stronger than my full size blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I had to use the cool button intermittently.  </li>
            <li>Worked as advertised, powerful and light.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Dries well and good to take international.</li>
            <li>It has a cool setting, which I like.  </li>
            <li>Cool blast.  </li>
            <li>I like the cool shot feature.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good weight although it&#x27;s not lighter than my &#x27;regular&#x27; dryer.  </li>
            <li>Compact, light weight, powerful.</li>
            <li>I love it and will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;cool air\\</li>
            <li>Of course, the compact size is perfect for travel, but it&#x27;s the power of this little baby that really sealed the deal for me.  </li>
            <li>Fairly lightweight; powerful enough.</li>
            <li>I forgot, but luckily it has a built in kill switch that prevents the dryer from blowing out.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>the loud part is more like a wind noise or a whooshing sound.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and on time.  </li>
            <li>It does not put out as much air as my old one, but it does a good job of drying my hair.</li>
            <li>Super for Germany and US.  </li>
            <li>But it arrived quickly and it works.</li>
            <li>Quick drying of hair without making it brittle.  </li>
            <li>Light weight also which I like very much.</li>
            <li>Make sure to set it to high with a screwdriver before you go-</li>
            <li>awesome, small but powerful, great for everyday use or traveling</li>
            <li>This dryer is a bit larger, but also more powerful and I love the placement of the cool shot.  </li>
            <li>Works great, small, lightweight, easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>light, powerful, plug a little big, but over all a great buy, and easy to use, easy to pack, does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li>It get&#x27;s very hot already</li>
            <li>I looked a long time for a good brand, reliable compact dryer with a folding handle.  </li>
            <li>but it arrived quickly and does seem very lightweight and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>Light weight and small and great power...</li>
            <li>I was immediately impressed with the power, I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the folding feature making it easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>This compact styler is very lightweight but has plenty of power and levels making for easy styling.  </li>
            <li>Plug is a bit large, which was problematic in a vacation rental, but otherwise works fine at home.</li>
            <li>, long story short, this dryer is great for what it is :)</li>
            <li>Great little dryer and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>It is a gentle air for fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap hairdryer, and stopped working after only 7 months of very light use.</li>
            <li>Great little travel dryer.  </li>
            <li>Great little travel dryer.</li>
            <li>Great little hair dryer for traveling.</li>
            <li>importantly the &amp;#34;low speed&amp;#34; did almost nothing and the &amp;#34;high speed&amp;#34; was way too much at 1875watts.</li>
            <li>Great for travel and everyday use.</li>
            <li>The removable lint screen makes this dryer a rare find.  </li>
            <li>The old dryer was dropped too many times that the plastic cover around the power plug was exposed.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like to spend a ton of time drying my hair, so I need something powerful.</li>
            <li>This is not as small as I wanted but it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I liked it, it was a present to my Son-in -Law.  </li>
            <li>compact, yet powerful.  </li>
            <li>the States, this hair dryer isn&#x27;t really worth using.  </li>
            <li>It was powerful as advertised and according to reviewers.  </li>
            <li>Really handy smaller travel hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it very much on my last trip, but it came in handy for drying clothes in a humid climate.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth keeping one in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>Works well so far....:)</li>
            <li>Compact and powerful.</li>
            <li>So lightweight but powerful.</li>
            <li>I would have given the product top star rating if it had a plug like my old model.  </li>
            <li>Compact yet powerful.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s only warm.</li>
            <li>It has a high temp with strong wind and also a lower temp with breeze.</li>
            <li>Before we left the US, I changed the switch to be compatible with UK power, followed the instructions and kept it on the low setting (which is just as powerful as the high setting on US voltage), plugged it into the plug adapter (you need this to be able to plug any US appliances into wall outlets in most other countries), plugged that into the wall outlet, and it worked perfectly!  </li>
            <li>I tried 3 other travel blow dryers, and this one is definitely the BEST</li>
            <li>It is fairly compact and does a decent job on my wife&#x27;s short hair.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, we expect to enjoying using this light and powerful hair dryer for a long while.</li>
            <li>Its 1875 watts of power make drying fast and easy, and add in the cool burst feature and it pretty much does everything.</li>
            <li>The right size to carry in your luggage.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve grown it out a bit, and the styling wasn&#x27;t looking right.  </li>
            <li>The air flow is concentrated, and the heat levels are just right</li>
            <li>Just the right size and power for travel.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t usually rate hair dryers, but this by far is the best dryer i&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Great little travel hair dryer!</li>
            <li>Works very well, very powerful and hot, would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Light enough to make blow drying easy on the shoulder and arm.  </li>
            <li>but my gym dryer &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; last week so started using this one and even though it is more compact, it dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The new one works just fine.</li>
            <li>but if all you&#x27;re interested in is drying your hair or if you use a high speed for styling this is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, but powerful, and pretty lightweight.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button is great for protecting hair from excessive heat damage.</li>
            <li>small, compact, good controls and cool shot in exactly right place.  </li>
            <li>Got this for a trip and it&#x27;s more powerful than my regular hair dryer, so</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and blows out very hot.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I bought it two weeks ago after reading the reviews and absolutely all the positive reviews about it are true.</li>
            <li>Dryer came ready to use, and the cool switch is great as last stage to dry.</li>
            <li>This little dryer packs a good punch and holds up well.</li>
            <li>True that it only operates on high speed when using the higher voltage, but works just fine!</li>
            <li>Also, the sound of this dryer is thankfully not shrill like some of the older compacts I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And although I liked my old 1600 watt dryer better than my new Vagabond, it didn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster than the 1200 watt dryer it replaced, or the 1000 watt dryer before that.</li>
            <li>Just bought this before traveling to Europe and Africa, as in the past I haven&#x27;t had the best luck with converters and voltage when bringing american hair dryers to Europe.  </li>
            <li>I was told various dates for shipping and arrival and then the product never arrived and I received an email from amazon.com saying that they had received this product damaged and would not be able to ship it to me.</li>
            <li>We have purchased several of these hairdryers and we love them.  </li>
            <li>I first bought one in 2007 and it lasted about 6 or 7 years.  </li>
            <li>I needed to make sure the next one was up to speed.</li>
            <li>I would prefer something more compact for international travel.</li>
            <li>i like this hair dryer more than many i&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly pleased with this hair dryer on my recent trip abroad.</li>
            <li>Pretty nifty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my most recent Eurotrip.  </li>
            <li>I used it in France, Italy and Spain with no problems (on the higher voltage setting).  </li>
            <li>I had this dryer for travel for many years in 1675 Watt and recently it overheated and stopped over and again.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first one about 7 years ago.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too hot or get that burning smell that some hairdryers get in Europe.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to use!</li>
            <li>Found only on Amazon:)</li>
            <li>If they wish to make a universal product, they need to supply appropriate connections.</li>
            <li>This will be great for travel, as long as I&#x27;m not worried about being quiet.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to switch the voltage with a screwdriver and only use on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting in Europe (will work like &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; in U.S.).</li>
            <li>I used to have a similar one of these that I used for MANY years.  </li>
            <li>it works, it&#x27;s hot and will fold up just like advertised</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot at all</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, small &amp; easy to store, easy to use and it blows warm and cool air to dry my mother&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li>I found my old one to be very reliable and with a surprisingly strong air flow for the compact size of the dryer.</li>
            <li>The high setting is very hot</li>
            <li>Now, when I use it in warm (not hot) weather, the temperature sensor thinks it is too hot and shuts the hair dryer off.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time, I don&#x27;t even have to use the flat iron</li>
            <li>Performs as expected, light weight ,compact and presently looking forward to significant durability.&lt;br /&gt;Believe the price was appropriate.</li>
            <li>Overall simple to use and works good.</li>
            <li>Light weight and powerful even on low setting</li>
            <li>The plug is a little bulky but very safe.</li>
            <li>very pleased with this little dryer.  </li>
            <li>but: the cable is stiff with a HUGE safe box at the end.</li>
            <li>Small and easy to fit into luggage!</li>
            <li>Makes drying my hair very simple and the cool jet sets the curls quickly and well.  </li>
            <li>Even on the low setting this dryer had way more power than any of the European dryers that were available.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, this small dryer works really well!  </li>
            <li>It may be good for trip, but the hotel I stay usually has a dryer, so I don&#x27;t bring it.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, small with a</li>
            <li>I loved the small size.</li>
            <li>Replaces the old hair dryer, same brand, and is more powerful.</li>
            <li>Small but has good power.</li>
            <li>The handle folds down, which is nice for travel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple dryer, easy to use and change for overseas.</li>
            <li>Today it sparked and caught fire, luckily before I put it near my head.  </li>
            <li>Tiny and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully if it lasts as long (more than 5 years) that I would be real please.  </li>
            <li>Enough power and easy to pack/carry.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I still have my old model to use (</li>
            <li>I used a voltage converter for European outlets and the dryer was just as strong as it would be if I had used it at home.</li>
            <li>I got this to travel next week, but I love it so much I&#x27;ve been using it as my main dryer.  </li>
            <li>so we got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much lighter than I expected but still blows strong and hot!  </li>
            <li>i have a large bushy handlebar mustache and curl it with a dryer after a shower.  </li>
            <li>I got a new one and was pleased to find the design was the same.</li>
            <li>It kind of defeats the purpose of this travel-sized little device.</li>
            <li>This is a great little hair dryer and I like the various settings.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe this fair dryer really gas 1875 watts.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, instructions clear, has plenty of power, very light and small for travel.</li>
            <li>Fits in suitcase very well.</li>
            <li>Dual voltage is very beneficial if you travel to Europe.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>However, it really needs to come with a diffuser...</li>
            <li>Very handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I returned the product because it weighed too much..</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Its very compact with a folding handle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and she doesn&#x27;t have much hair, but it was unusable for me.  </li>
            <li>More power than expected.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks much</li>
            <li>It has a lot of power and works very well.</li>
            <li>Bought this unit for traveling to Europe, very compact for travel and with the dual voltage</li>
            <li>Compact for travel and very powerful.can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li>Wife needed something for our trip that didn&#x27;t take up as much space as her full-size hair dryer...</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Just turn the butyon and you are ready for overseas.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight, dries fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I purchased this and was initially very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s available at Amazon for only $13.65 at the time of this review.</li>
            <li>I really like the size, the folding handle</li>
            <li>If I put the plug into the lower outlet there is too much space between the plug and the outlet cover near the bottom of the plug, making the plug unwieldly and even more prone to falling out of the socket than when it is plugged into the upper socket.  </li>
            <li>For the price, though, I can&#x27;t complain too much, it works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Appears solid, as expected, good transaction, thank you</li>
            <li>It is very strong and dries my thick hair as quickly as the hairdryer I use at home.  </li>
            <li>But, my old 1600 watt Conair compact styler felt much more solid, was slightly smaller even though it felt bigger and more comfortable in my hand, dried my hair faster, had a fan motor that didn&#x27;t sound quite as whiney, and coexisted nicely with other electrical devices on a 15 amp circuit.</li>
            <li>It is versatile and easy to stow for long trips.  </li>
            <li>Strong yet more quiet than the previous folding model.  </li>
            <li>Like that I can dry my hair quickly as it is quite powerful.</li>
            <li>I have had several compact dryers in the past and this one definitely does the best job.</li>
            <li>I have used it daily for about 3 years now and it has not faltered, definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I was originally going to use this dryer only when travelling, but it works so well that I use it every day now!  </li>
            <li>Most foreign countries use 220 VAC instead of the USA 120 VAC.  </li>
            <li>so I swapped and let her bring my older travel dryer because it was so much lighter since weight was an issue for her...</li>
            <li>Other than the plug problem, the dryer works well, is fairly quiet, and folds for easy packing and less space used in a drawer, which is the main reason I liked my original dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really wish that when manufacturers have a good product that it is just left alone, or at least checked to be sure that the specifications and qualties are the same in every product.</li>
            <li>It really cuts down on the reach cabability of the dryer, making the plug even more unstable.  </li>
            <li>While I prefer the original configuration (longer cord with smaller plug/GFI), the changes have not seriously compromised the product.</li>
            <li>Turning the dial on the handle locks you out of putting it on the high setting whenever you&#x27;re using it with 240V, which is a really user-friendly addition.</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t do anything extra special to my hair.</li>
            <li>It folds up nicely so it takes up very little space.</li>
            <li>Although not essential, it was good to find something besides black...</li>
            <li>Blew hot as my Chi at home, no trouble using it anywhere</li>
            <li>The dryer is nice and small.  </li>
            <li>nice and light - but has two speeds - high and low - hard for styling</li>
            <li>had to wait until it cooled down to be able to turn it on again.  </li>
            <li>This little thing is light and powerful.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this anyone looking for a good quality hair dryer in general and definitely for someone going on an extended trip where luggage space is limited.</li>
            <li>Cord slightly shorter (almost 5 feet) which is even better for traveling and packing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This looks and feels quality and definitely dries fast and is powerful.</li>
            <li>The hairdryer itself is powerful and was able to handle my thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I had an older version that no longer worked.  </li>
            <li>I had this blow dryer for many years and when it finally died I didn&#x27;t even consider getting a different model.</li>
            <li>Item as advertised claims it comes with a &#x27;concentrator&#x27;, which is why I chose this particular dryer.  </li>
            <li>additional but important problem with the plug is that it is 8 1/2\\&quot; shorter than the old plug, which is a big difference!  </li>
            <li>Very hot even at the lower setting required for international voltage.</li>
            <li>The high air flow is also a plus.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but I like the volume of air it produces on high.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect this hairdryer to be as high quality as salon-style</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Low&amp;#34; is like someone blowing out their birthday cake candles and high is like...</li>
            <li>The dryer for some reason heats up too high and then turns itself off.</li>
            <li>so you know why you can&#x27;t get it to work on high at 220 volts.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Safer than using a voltage converter with the high wattage of the dryer.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li>This happens after about 30 seconds of use on the high setting.  </li>
            <li>The dryer produces a high volume of heated air for rapid drying.</li>
            <li>Like the button that allows you to control the cooling on the high fan setting.</li>
            <li>(You&#x27;re not suppose to use it on high with 240V according to the manual.)</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to travelers.</li>
            <li>I realize the faster the fan, the more it dilutes the heat from the heating coils, but it could be a little warmer.  </li>
            <li>Even high though isn&#x27;t that powerful, but gets the job done for basic drying purposes - probably not any fancy styles.  </li>
            <li>Even though you have to use it on low speed on the 220 volt setting, it is as powerful as the high setting on 110 volts.  </li>
            <li>The folding handle makes it convenient for travel, it does a reasonable job of drying my hair, and I didn&#x27;t find it excessively loud.</li>
            <li>but WOW this thing works fast.  </li>
            <li>Like the long cord and the cool shot button.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is smaller than my regular dryer but bigger than I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Low setying is powerful.  </li>
            <li>one was powerful enough</li>
            <li>(I blow dry on high and then blow out/smooth with the cool shot).</li>
            <li>It is so compact that it fit right into my small suitcase.  </li>
            <li>Folds up nicely so takes up less space in a suitcase then a regular size hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It is the right size, not to big for the bathroom and with a lot of power</li>
            <li>Works well, completely adequate for medium to long hair.</li>
            <li>The dry time is fast, I manage to dry &amp; style my ear-length hair in 3 minutes or less every single time, with wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on European travel hairdryers and this one consistently got high reviews.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I advise buying two, so in twenty years or so, when you need a new dryer, you&#x27;ve got another one on hand.</li>
            <li>Needed a spare, the style may change, I often do not like the new and improved.  </li>
            <li>It was still working the day I replaced it with this new one.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my mom since it&#x27;s small and very light</li>
            <li>Please note the directions read to only use on low setting when overseas; but the air volumne was still very good &amp; I have thick hair!  </li>
            <li>Seems to work well, although on 230v setting only low heat setting is available.</li>
            <li>Also, the plug was so big that it didn&#x27;t fit into the space above my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>No surprises - this hair dryer is exactly as described, and it probably deserves another star if it&#x27;s only compared to other units that are currently available.</li>
            <li>Directions very clear about how to switch the voltage.</li>
            <li>(There was one night I stayed in a very old home in Switzerland</li>
            <li>It is also super powerful and I can dry my long hair in just 5 - 10 min.</li>
            <li>dried my hair pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Satisfied practical and manageable for small</li>
            <li>The first time I went to use the dryer it short circuited and wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty temperamental, and this left me frizzy and puffed up.</li>
            <li>This small Conair 1875 will always be my favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li>worn looking as it is), and will pack the new model away for emergency use in case the old one stops working.</li>
            <li>This is a big improvement over my 15 year old Conair with a higher volume of air pushed out.  </li>
            <li>It drys my hair quickly and isn&#x27;t too large or heavy to use.</li>
            <li>Very important to me, because I have thick hair.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>A little bit smaller than my Sharper Image one that has served me well for many years but just died recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Took this hair dryer to France, was a little skeptical, but with an adapter, it was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It works a little better if I plug it into the upper outlet, but I have to keep my curling iron plugged into that one because the plug covers the lower outlet.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful for a little hair dyer</li>
            <li>and I leave mine old clunky one at home.</li>
            <li>Works well but extremely loud.</li>
            <li>Going to Europe and it was not compact enough and took up too much room in my suitcase..</li>
            <li>so much I am using it now as my regular dryer instead of the bulky Conair styler</li>
            <li>(Our old one never did.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as loud as some dryers.  </li>
            <li>Quieter than my old dryer, but I wouldn&#x27;t describe any dryer as &amp;#34;quiet.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s because my old dryer died 6 weeks ago</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it is far quieter than my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for a Europe trip and back in the States I pack this in my gym bag to get ready at work.</li>
            <li>It has so much power for such a compact dryer.  </li>
            <li>My old dryer was not putting out any heat.</li>
            <li>Have had about 4 of them so far over the years ... wouldn&#x27;t use anything else if i can help it.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really convenient to bring for travel because of its tiny size.</li>
            <li>you can hold it directly towards your scalp</li>
            <li>Durability is good - our&#x27;s usually last at least five years with daily use by two people.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect and i have long thick hair and this small hair dryer</li>
            <li>I can dry my hair very fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, it&#x27;s small, but it packs a punch!</li>
            <li>For years, I&#x27;ve used Conair 1875s for both our primary blow dryer (yes, my wife has long hair) and our travel needs (motorcycle touring means limited luggage space).</li>
            <li>Product is small and folds making it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Dry exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this dryer, it sucked my long hair into the back of it and knotted it up.  </li>
            <li>Small easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Small and strong.  </li>
            <li>Only problem is that it&#x27;s loud on high setting.</li>
            <li>Replacement for an older similar model.  </li>
            <li>Using this higher setting gives you only one setting option - low.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer as a back up for my older version of another hair dryer made by Conair.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.....as it is only used when traveling and hair is short.  </li>
            <li>It only works on high with</li>
            <li>but I only use it on high that that didn&#x27;t make a difference to me.</li>
            <li>only works on the HIGH setting at 220V.</li>
            <li>2 speeds (high and low) with a cooling button.</li>
            <li>but when I used it in the apartment in Paris, after switching the voltage, it only had one speed, high.</li>
            <li>The plug on the new model is much larger and heavier than the old plug.  </li>
            <li>light and very little noise, dual voltage dries your hair soon.</li>
            <li>It is light and small and travels well, however it only has one heat setting and one fan speed, (high).</li>
            <li>We intend to travel light, 1 small suitcase each...</li>
            <li>In 220 mode they can only be used on LOW, however, this is still powerful enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I first thought the button was jammed, so tried again after switching to 120V and the button to switch</li>
            <li>It definitely has a punch and works really well outside the US.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is powerful and dries my hair in less than five minutes.  </li>
            <li>It is true that you can only use the low setting in Europe; however, it seemed as though the low setting was  putting out as much air as the high setting usually does here in the US.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful enough to dry my hair quickly, as well as lightweight and space-efficient (small bathroom counter).  </li>
            <li>Will do European and US power settings, though at the higher voltage it will only work with the low setting.</li>
            <li>This was the star purchase for my first foreign travel trip.  </li>
            <li>Small / Compacted and powerful !</li>
            <li>It is compact size but not small enough for travel.</li>
            <li>Ended up being a little TOO powerful.</li>
            <li>Powerful blower in that little motor.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer began to malfunction today after 17 months of light use; about 1-2 times per week/during the summer months hardly at all.</li>
            <li>(I will say that my hair is long, but not extremely thick.)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, small, doing job (enough power).</li>
            <li>Has very similar features as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>However, it is much noisier than expected.</li>
            <li>since models change all the time and seem to get worse, noy better.  </li>
            <li>Nice and small, but seems really heavy.  </li>
            <li>Just as powerful, but easier to use in that it&#x27;s not as heavy.</li>
            <li>Air flow a little too strong and opening a bit too wide.  </li>
            <li>Folds up nicely, Very powerful for such a small dryer.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t extremely compact or lightweight, but it was definitely small enough to fit in my luggage without taking up much room.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve tried other 1875 watt dryers, for some reason, this particular model seems to dry my hair much faster than any of the others, including full-size dryers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s puts out a LOT of air, and with the right amount of heat to style with my round brush.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what are all these hundreds of extra watts doing for me other than increasing the size of my carbon footprint?</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly and folds away small.</li>
            <li>I like this dryer because it&#x27;s extremely lightweight and yet has as much power as a full-size dryer.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve learned over the years that the cost of a great international vacation is bad hair...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s loud yet seems to take a tiny bit longer to dry my hair than the old one did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually considering swapping it out with my regular dryer since it&#x27;s so much lighter and seemed to dry my hair even quicker.  </li>
            <li>My previous portable one was smaller and dried better.</li>
            <li>Dried my hair quickly, was compact for travel, used low setting only based on prior reviews.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t really used a hair dryer in a couple of years, due to a short hair style.  </li>
            <li>Fairly small, but quite powerful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a few minutes to heat up when you first start drying your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also still quite powerful for how small it is.  </li>
            <li>This small but powerful dryer is just want I wanted.</li>
            <li>Small, compact, powerful.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but that&#x27;s to be expected with most compact dryers that put out any volume of air.</li>
            <li>I have had a few Conair hair dryers, but this one with the folding handle really saves space in my bag!</li>
            <li>I use this dryer as my everyday hair dryer, it&#x27;s small size makes it easy to store and also not heavy to hold</li>
            <li>This was a replacement to my old one which I had for a very long time.</li>
            <li>powerful and small enough to travel with</li>
            <li>This is for my regular daily use because the small size fits under my sink but is powerful enough to blow out my hairstyle every day.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and can dry my short hair in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Works well but heavy and large.</li>
            <li>So much power in this little thing.</li>
            <li>I just wish that the electrical plug wasn&#x27;t so huge, or at the very least, that it was reversible</li>
            <li>I really cannot say enough about this little guy.  </li>
            <li>My sister and I were both pleased with the strength of this little hair dryer (we both have really thick hair).</li>

            <li> Like, good to go for about 15 years.</li>
            <li> Because of the fold-down capability, this hairdryer fit perfectly into my carry-on.  </li>
            <li> Great power and the 2 heat settings are nice.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet overseas, but on a use test it produced good airflow and heat.</li>
            <li> This is not as good as the hair dryer</li>
            <li> Still searching for a good hair blower...</li>
            <li> Must be good</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in the States yet, but I assume it will be just as good.</li>
            <li> The good thing I like about</li>
            <li> This is a good deal if you&#x27;re looking for a multi-power option for traveling.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s weight and balance are good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> this looked like a good value</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT.</li>
            <li> In the end, it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li> And it was a good value.</li>
            <li> Good for travel since handle retracts and is lightweight for travel.</li>
            <li> This could also be a good feature,</li>
            <li> Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Light weight and perfect for a person with arthritis and difficulty holding things.</li>
            <li> It has good power and works well.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap continental Europe adapter (no voltage changer needed) and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not as good as one with the tip piece.</li>
            <li> And the one of the exceptional aspects is it can use at 220V condition.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my dryer.</li>
            <li> We are very satisfied with the Conair 1875.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This worked great, with the appropriate adaptor, when I used it in Italy.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It works great - pleased with the feel, dual voltage for travel, etc.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent hairdryer, folds up nicely, haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to test it on 240V yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do just fine.</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I was so glad Conair still makes it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> cute!</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li> Great power, compact shape, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Compact size makes this hair dryer great and easy to pack for weekend and/or longer trips.</li>
            <li> , it is very light weight and the power is good.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works amazingly.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Handle folds up nicely.</li>
            <li> I know many people loved this dryer, but it didn&#x27;t suit my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice size for storage.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a hanger loop.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer and perfect for traveling internationally.  </li>
            <li> Folds up nicely for packing as well.  </li>
            <li> and it is nicely powered.</li>
            <li> It just about stopped again today so will have to buy another kind maybe.  </li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer, dual voltage comes in handy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice and compact.  </li>
            <li> My husband had to use a tool of some kind to change the setting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also handy if someone is in the bathroom</li>
            <li> A nice hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still a nice dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d also be nice if they included some sort of cable management component - even just a velcro tie for when through with it</li>
            <li> would&#x27;ve been nice.  </li>
            <li> Awesome blow drying - easy to clean</li>
            <li> Barely warm on either speed.</li>
            <li> very nice very powerful</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works great.</li>
            <li> Does a good job drying my fine hair</li>
            <li> I bought this convenient folding hair dryer when my old travel dryer needed to be replaced, and it just may be the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> &quot; button was great, too, but we rarely used it.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, compact and powerful.</li>
            <li> Handy size, but too many minuses.</li>
            <li> The dryer worked great at both 140 and 220 volts, and it was light weight and compact, easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> They can be easily switched between 110/220v by using a coin (just don&#x27;t forget!)</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully, is very light for travel, and has a fold up handle, making it very easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Works almost as good as a full size one.</li>
            <li> SUPER!!</li>
            <li> received it quick and good quality</li>
            <li> This is fantastic - it works so much better than my &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; sized one!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and compact and fit into the suitcase nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice size, convenient for travel, powerfull and light.</li>
            <li> To top it off, cleaning the filter is a cinch</li>
            <li> The dryer does not have a retractable cord, but that&#x27;s never been an issue for me, since most travel dryers also do not have a cord keeper.</li>
            <li> Worked awesome in London and Scotland while using a Universal</li>
            <li> This works OK.</li>
            <li> it does pull a lot of power and I have tripped the circuit breaker more than once.  </li>
            <li> My wife love this.</li>
            <li> Much more is that it&#x27;s AUTO-VOLT</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> if i designed hair dryers, i couldn&#x27;t do any better then this.  </li>
            <li> So glad I spotted this one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It was my only dryer and perfect for overseas.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I used to have a Conair 1875 watts that was much better than this one.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money and good quality no issues</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is perfect for international travel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and fit nicely in my baggage.</li>
            <li> is that I&#x27;ll be able to use it any where in the world.</li>
            <li> Works great and dries your hair fast.</li>
            <li> I love that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the voltage</li>
            <li> well...not much more than that.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Gifted this to my mom in India.</li>
            <li> In fact, it worked better than the one in the hotel bathroom that was made for use in Europe.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> So this one is even better.  </li>
            <li> The handle folds, making it more compact.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I gotta say I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this Hairdryer</li>
            <li> All I needed was the plug adapter that I had purchased and when I set the dryer to the international voltage the dryer functioned perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I love this blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I love how it folds up for when I travel.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you tell your wife to switch it to 220v when you go to Europe BEFORE she turns it on.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my recent trip to Europe.  </li>
            <li> Would be better if it had three speeds.</li>
            <li> After about 2 minutes, you can audibly hear the temperature sensor reset itself, after which you can use it again for about 30 more seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wish I would have shopped around for a better hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I just love it...</li>
            <li> so glad i found it here and bought this as a backup.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer to replace a different hair dryer that had fallen apart but was small,and perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> But I use it in my room which is ok for me.</li>
            <li> its sound isn&#x27;t as obnoxious as others!</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m glad I have it for when I go to Europe again</li>
            <li> Perfect for international travel.</li>
            <li> Love it, was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> size is great and very compact.</li>
            <li> It has an American plug, but with a convertor for each country it worked wonderfully!  </li>
            <li> I love the power it throws out.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the instructions for overseas use.</li>
            <li> Really good quality, l liked it so much l bought 4,</li>
            <li> and yet it is very powerful!</li>
            <li> This dryer and a compact flat iron are the perfect pair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a great buy, I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for drying my hair but was too strong to do any &amp;#34;styling.&amp;#34;  The nozzle is wider than what I&#x27;d have liked</li>
            <li> like the cool shot button, that is a nice feature to have on a compact dryer.  </li>
            <li> Much better blow dryers are available, but for the price this more than satisfied my needs.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love how it folds and how it is easy to convert the voltage.  </li>
            <li> It is quick and nice in doing its business.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s easy, free return policy!</li>
            <li> I had no issue with over heating and had really effective power which was far superior to the dryer in our bathroom provided by the hotel.  </li>
            <li> Great dryer but LOUD!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works fine</li>
            <li> works as good as my large one</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Overall very good product, lightweight and durable.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a trip to Europe but the hotels and apartment we stayed in actually had very good hair dryers</li>
            <li> Just make sure you turn the air intake cap counterclock wise to clean out the lint that&#x27;s caught on the grate or it becomes to hot.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t sound like a jet engine:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as great as a professional hair-dryer but for the cost and for packing efficiency, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> The most important part....</li>
            <li> I was looking for a blowdryer to go in my travel bag, it fit, but better yet works well.</li>
            <li> Nice and powerful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good product.</li>
            <li> Good power and very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Super strong for the size!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I remembered why I always used to love compact hair dryers!  </li>
            <li> However here, the voltage is already converted for you to 220 making it so easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Great size, easy to fold up for travel.</li>
            <li> Plus the folding design makes it easy to stash away.</li>
            <li> the handle folds and that it can easily switch from 120v to 220v.</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> Easy Peasy.</li>
            <li> is easy to hold and manage my hair.</li>
            <li> Packs easily and does the job.</li>
            <li> The dual voltage made it easy to use while overseas</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to fold and travel.</li>
            <li> I did need a plug adapter, but easily switched from 120 to 240 volts by moving the switch button the the handle.</li>
            <li> Easy to change the voltage with just a coin.</li>
            <li> It is made for a woman&#x27;s hand; easy to hold and handle.</li>
            <li> Compact size perfect for traveling and powerful enough to do its job.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> It is compact and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power and folds up&lt;br /&gt;For easy packing.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Easy to pack and travel with.</li>
            <li> Fairly strong.  </li>
            <li> Good price with decent product.</li>
            <li> I used it in Paris and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> If barely took any space in my suitcase and worked great during the trip</li>
            <li> Also I LOVE the cool shot button.</li>
            <li> So much better than the full size dryer it replaced.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip to Europe because it has the dual voltage, is folding and lightweight, and has one of my favorite features, the cool shot button.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> works fine</li>
            <li> and it caused a fuse to blow, but fine in newer homes and hotels).  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve fine hair, but a lot of it) in scant minutes.  </li>
            <li> This is light and would probably be easy to travel with, but I&#x27;m returning it after one use.</li>
            <li> The dryer works fine.  </li>
            <li> it worked out fine</li>
            <li> The dryer is works fine;  however, I cannot turn the button to change voltage.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer works fine.  </li>
            <li> Light &amp; Easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Drys my hair quickly!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a very old travel hairdryer after reading good reviews.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is perfect.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful little dryer.</li>
            <li> Awesome little dryer.</li>
            <li> Perfect little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The cord is longer than on most dryers, which is actually nice when traveling, because you don&#x27;t end up leaning sideways on one foot when the outlet is far from the mirror.  </li>
            <li> The reviews we read about it were accurate.  </li>
            <li> my hair doesn&#x27;t come out nearly as smooth as it does with a longer barrel drier + diffuser.  </li>
            <li> This compact styler is fabulous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and compact, so it travels well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but it still works great!</li>
            <li> I purchased for a recent trip to Italy and with the correct adapter this hairdryer worked great.  </li>
            <li> So each inch of space and each ounce of weight is important.  </li>
            <li> It is compact but not as light as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> Not so great for styling my short hair.  </li>
            <li> Light weight and folds neatly.</li>
            <li> Great for short or medium length hair.</li>
            <li> and there isn&#x27;t a hair dryer available.  </li>
            <li> Light weight.  </li>
            <li> By the way, the old one we had is still good, except there is some rust on the rim now</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> It is very powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It is also very powerful for it&#x27;s size.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> Convenient for travel yet more durable looking than the older model that I had for many years.</li>
            <li> Great for short hair, not so great for long hair/pets.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend and it arrived immediately - nice compact - perfect for travel - went on a month long vacation  - 3rd day on vacation</li>
            <li> This new one seems to be of equally good quality and has all the features I&#x27;d liked on my old one.</li>
            <li> It has an option for warm or normal air.</li>
            <li> Perfect... exactly that I expected and needed!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for the small suitcase I had to use for a trip to Italy.  </li>
            <li> When we got married and bought a house it has stayed on with me, becoming my primary hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I am African and it&#x27;s perfect for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> But the power over there is so strong that it feels more like high.  </li>
            <li> It is very powerful and dries my hair quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Larger than the hard-to-manipulate micro-travel dryers, smaller than the overweight full-size models, it fits perfectly in the hand and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> For a quick dry in the mornings, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get real hot other than that works great.</li>
            <li> I make my daughter bring this one when we travel since I love it so much</li>
            <li> I also like the COOL button.  </li>
            <li> A true travel dryer/styler.</li>
            <li> Has full power in a compact size.</li>
            <li> I think this blow dryer is stronger than my full size blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I had to use the cool button intermittently.  </li>
            <li> Worked as advertised, powerful and light.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Dries well and good to take international.</li>
            <li> It has a cool setting, which I like.  </li>
            <li> Cool blast.  </li>
            <li> I like the cool shot feature.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good weight although it&#x27;s not lighter than my &#x27;regular&#x27; dryer.  </li>
            <li> Compact, light weight, powerful.</li>
            <li> I love it and will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;cool air\\</li>
            <li> Of course, the compact size is perfect for travel, but it&#x27;s the power of this little baby that really sealed the deal for me.  </li>
            <li> Fairly lightweight; powerful enough.</li>
            <li> I forgot, but luckily it has a built in kill switch that prevents the dryer from blowing out.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> the loud part is more like a wind noise or a whooshing sound.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and on time.  </li>
            <li> It does not put out as much air as my old one, but it does a good job of drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Super for Germany and US.  </li>
            <li> But it arrived quickly and it works.</li>
            <li> Quick drying of hair without making it brittle.  </li>
            <li> Light weight also which I like very much.</li>
            <li> Make sure to set it to high with a screwdriver before you go-</li>
            <li> awesome, small but powerful, great for everyday use or traveling</li>
            <li> This dryer is a bit larger, but also more powerful and I love the placement of the cool shot.  </li>
            <li> Works great, small, lightweight, easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> light, powerful, plug a little big, but over all a great buy, and easy to use, easy to pack, does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s very hot already</li>
            <li> I looked a long time for a good brand, reliable compact dryer with a folding handle.  </li>
            <li> but it arrived quickly and does seem very lightweight and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Light weight and small and great power...</li>
            <li> I was immediately impressed with the power, I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the folding feature making it easy to pack.  </li>
            <li> This compact styler is very lightweight but has plenty of power and levels making for easy styling.  </li>
            <li> Plug is a bit large, which was problematic in a vacation rental, but otherwise works fine at home.</li>
            <li> , long story short, this dryer is great for what it is :)</li>
            <li> Great little dryer and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> It is a gentle air for fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap hairdryer, and stopped working after only 7 months of very light use.</li>
            <li> Great little travel dryer.  </li>
            <li> Great little travel dryer.</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer for traveling.</li>
            <li> importantly the &amp;#34;low speed&amp;#34; did almost nothing and the &amp;#34;high speed&amp;#34; was way too much at 1875watts.</li>
            <li> Great for travel and everyday use.</li>
            <li> The removable lint screen makes this dryer a rare find.  </li>
            <li> The old dryer was dropped too many times that the plastic cover around the power plug was exposed.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like to spend a ton of time drying my hair, so I need something powerful.</li>
            <li> This is not as small as I wanted but it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I liked it, it was a present to my Son-in -Law.  </li>
            <li> compact, yet powerful.  </li>
            <li> the States, this hair dryer isn&#x27;t really worth using.  </li>
            <li> It was powerful as advertised and according to reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Really handy smaller travel hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it very much on my last trip, but it came in handy for drying clothes in a humid climate.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth keeping one in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> Works well so far....:)</li>
            <li> Compact and powerful.</li>
            <li> So lightweight but powerful.</li>
            <li> I would have given the product top star rating if it had a plug like my old model.  </li>
            <li> Compact yet powerful.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only warm.</li>
            <li> It has a high temp with strong wind and also a lower temp with breeze.</li>
            <li> Before we left the US, I changed the switch to be compatible with UK power, followed the instructions and kept it on the low setting (which is just as powerful as the high setting on US voltage), plugged it into the plug adapter (you need this to be able to plug any US appliances into wall outlets in most other countries), plugged that into the wall outlet, and it worked perfectly!  </li>
            <li> I tried 3 other travel blow dryers, and this one is definitely the BEST</li>
            <li> It is fairly compact and does a decent job on my wife&#x27;s short hair.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, we expect to enjoying using this light and powerful hair dryer for a long while.</li>
            <li> Its 1875 watts of power make drying fast and easy, and add in the cool burst feature and it pretty much does everything.</li>
            <li> The right size to carry in your luggage.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve grown it out a bit, and the styling wasn&#x27;t looking right.  </li>
            <li> The air flow is concentrated, and the heat levels are just right</li>
            <li> Just the right size and power for travel.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t usually rate hair dryers, but this by far is the best dryer i&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Great little travel hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Works very well, very powerful and hot, would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Light enough to make blow drying easy on the shoulder and arm.  </li>
            <li> but my gym dryer &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; last week so started using this one and even though it is more compact, it dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> The new one works just fine.</li>
            <li> but if all you&#x27;re interested in is drying your hair or if you use a high speed for styling this is fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, but powerful, and pretty lightweight.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button is great for protecting hair from excessive heat damage.</li>
            <li> small, compact, good controls and cool shot in exactly right place.  </li>
            <li> Got this for a trip and it&#x27;s more powerful than my regular hair dryer, so</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and blows out very hot.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I bought it two weeks ago after reading the reviews and absolutely all the positive reviews about it are true.</li>
            <li> Dryer came ready to use, and the cool switch is great as last stage to dry.</li>
            <li> This little dryer packs a good punch and holds up well.</li>
            <li> True that it only operates on high speed when using the higher voltage, but works just fine!</li>
            <li> Also, the sound of this dryer is thankfully not shrill like some of the older compacts I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And although I liked my old 1600 watt dryer better than my new Vagabond, it didn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster than the 1200 watt dryer it replaced, or the 1000 watt dryer before that.</li>
            <li> Just bought this before traveling to Europe and Africa, as in the past I haven&#x27;t had the best luck with converters and voltage when bringing american hair dryers to Europe.  </li>
            <li> I was told various dates for shipping and arrival and then the product never arrived and I received an email from amazon.com saying that they had received this product damaged and would not be able to ship it to me.</li>
            <li> We have purchased several of these hairdryers and we love them.  </li>
            <li> I first bought one in 2007 and it lasted about 6 or 7 years.  </li>
            <li> I needed to make sure the next one was up to speed.</li>
            <li> I would prefer something more compact for international travel.</li>
            <li> i like this hair dryer more than many i&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly pleased with this hair dryer on my recent trip abroad.</li>
            <li> Pretty nifty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my most recent Eurotrip.  </li>
            <li> I used it in France, Italy and Spain with no problems (on the higher voltage setting).  </li>
            <li> I had this dryer for travel for many years in 1675 Watt and recently it overheated and stopped over and again.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my first one about 7 years ago.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get too hot or get that burning smell that some hairdryers get in Europe.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to use!</li>
            <li> Found only on Amazon:)</li>
            <li> If they wish to make a universal product, they need to supply appropriate connections.</li>
            <li> This will be great for travel, as long as I&#x27;m not worried about being quiet.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to switch the voltage with a screwdriver and only use on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting in Europe (will work like &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; in U.S.).</li>
            <li> I used to have a similar one of these that I used for MANY years.  </li>
            <li> it works, it&#x27;s hot and will fold up just like advertised</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot at all</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, small &amp; easy to store, easy to use and it blows warm and cool air to dry my mother&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> I found my old one to be very reliable and with a surprisingly strong air flow for the compact size of the dryer.</li>
            <li> The high setting is very hot</li>
            <li> Now, when I use it in warm (not hot) weather, the temperature sensor thinks it is too hot and shuts the hair dryer off.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time, I don&#x27;t even have to use the flat iron</li>
            <li> Performs as expected, light weight ,compact and presently looking forward to significant durability.&lt;br /&gt;Believe the price was appropriate.</li>
            <li> Overall simple to use and works good.</li>
            <li> Light weight and powerful even on low setting</li>
            <li> The plug is a little bulky but very safe.</li>
            <li> very pleased with this little dryer.  </li>
            <li> but: the cable is stiff with a HUGE safe box at the end.</li>
            <li> Small and easy to fit into luggage!</li>
            <li> Makes drying my hair very simple and the cool jet sets the curls quickly and well.  </li>
            <li> Even on the low setting this dryer had way more power than any of the European dryers that were available.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, this small dryer works really well!  </li>
            <li> It may be good for trip, but the hotel I stay usually has a dryer, so I don&#x27;t bring it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, small with a</li>
            <li> I loved the small size.</li>
            <li> Replaces the old hair dryer, same brand, and is more powerful.</li>
            <li> Small but has good power.</li>
            <li> The handle folds down, which is nice for travel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple dryer, easy to use and change for overseas.</li>
            <li> Today it sparked and caught fire, luckily before I put it near my head.  </li>
            <li> Tiny and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully if it lasts as long (more than 5 years) that I would be real please.  </li>
            <li> Enough power and easy to pack/carry.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I still have my old model to use (</li>
            <li> I used a voltage converter for European outlets and the dryer was just as strong as it would be if I had used it at home.</li>
            <li> I got this to travel next week, but I love it so much I&#x27;ve been using it as my main dryer.  </li>
            <li> so we got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much lighter than I expected but still blows strong and hot!  </li>
            <li> i have a large bushy handlebar mustache and curl it with a dryer after a shower.  </li>
            <li> I got a new one and was pleased to find the design was the same.</li>
            <li> It kind of defeats the purpose of this travel-sized little device.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer and I like the various settings.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe this fair dryer really gas 1875 watts.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, instructions clear, has plenty of power, very light and small for travel.</li>
            <li> Fits in suitcase very well.</li>
            <li> Dual voltage is very beneficial if you travel to Europe.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> However, it really needs to come with a diffuser...</li>
            <li> Very handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I returned the product because it weighed too much..</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Its very compact with a folding handle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t have much hair, but it was unusable for me.  </li>
            <li> More power than expected.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks much</li>
            <li> It has a lot of power and works very well.</li>
            <li> Bought this unit for traveling to Europe, very compact for travel and with the dual voltage</li>
            <li> Compact for travel and very powerful.can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Wife needed something for our trip that didn&#x27;t take up as much space as her full-size hair dryer...</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Just turn the butyon and you are ready for overseas.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight, dries fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased this and was initially very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s available at Amazon for only $13.65 at the time of this review.</li>
            <li> I really like the size, the folding handle</li>
            <li> If I put the plug into the lower outlet there is too much space between the plug and the outlet cover near the bottom of the plug, making the plug unwieldly and even more prone to falling out of the socket than when it is plugged into the upper socket.  </li>
            <li> For the price, though, I can&#x27;t complain too much, it works.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Appears solid, as expected, good transaction, thank you</li>
            <li> It is very strong and dries my thick hair as quickly as the hairdryer I use at home.  </li>
            <li> But, my old 1600 watt Conair compact styler felt much more solid, was slightly smaller even though it felt bigger and more comfortable in my hand, dried my hair faster, had a fan motor that didn&#x27;t sound quite as whiney, and coexisted nicely with other electrical devices on a 15 amp circuit.</li>
            <li> It is versatile and easy to stow for long trips.  </li>
            <li> Strong yet more quiet than the previous folding model.  </li>
            <li> Like that I can dry my hair quickly as it is quite powerful.</li>
            <li> I have had several compact dryers in the past and this one definitely does the best job.</li>
            <li> I have used it daily for about 3 years now and it has not faltered, definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I was originally going to use this dryer only when travelling, but it works so well that I use it every day now!  </li>
            <li> Most foreign countries use 220 VAC instead of the USA 120 VAC.  </li>
            <li> so I swapped and let her bring my older travel dryer because it was so much lighter since weight was an issue for her...</li>
            <li> Other than the plug problem, the dryer works well, is fairly quiet, and folds for easy packing and less space used in a drawer, which is the main reason I liked my original dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really wish that when manufacturers have a good product that it is just left alone, or at least checked to be sure that the specifications and qualties are the same in every product.</li>
            <li> It really cuts down on the reach cabability of the dryer, making the plug even more unstable.  </li>
            <li> While I prefer the original configuration (longer cord with smaller plug/GFI), the changes have not seriously compromised the product.</li>
            <li> Turning the dial on the handle locks you out of putting it on the high setting whenever you&#x27;re using it with 240V, which is a really user-friendly addition.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t do anything extra special to my hair.</li>
            <li> It folds up nicely so it takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> Although not essential, it was good to find something besides black...</li>
            <li> Blew hot as my Chi at home, no trouble using it anywhere</li>
            <li> The dryer is nice and small.  </li>
            <li> nice and light - but has two speeds - high and low - hard for styling</li>
            <li> had to wait until it cooled down to be able to turn it on again.  </li>
            <li> This little thing is light and powerful.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this anyone looking for a good quality hair dryer in general and definitely for someone going on an extended trip where luggage space is limited.</li>
            <li> Cord slightly shorter (almost 5 feet) which is even better for traveling and packing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This looks and feels quality and definitely dries fast and is powerful.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer itself is powerful and was able to handle my thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I had an older version that no longer worked.  </li>
            <li> I had this blow dryer for many years and when it finally died I didn&#x27;t even consider getting a different model.</li>
            <li> Item as advertised claims it comes with a &#x27;concentrator&#x27;, which is why I chose this particular dryer.  </li>
            <li> additional but important problem with the plug is that it is 8 1/2\\&quot; shorter than the old plug, which is a big difference!  </li>
            <li> Very hot even at the lower setting required for international voltage.</li>
            <li> The high air flow is also a plus.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but I like the volume of air it produces on high.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect this hairdryer to be as high quality as salon-style</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Low&amp;#34; is like someone blowing out their birthday cake candles and high is like...</li>
            <li> The dryer for some reason heats up too high and then turns itself off.</li>
            <li> so you know why you can&#x27;t get it to work on high at 220 volts.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Safer than using a voltage converter with the high wattage of the dryer.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li> This happens after about 30 seconds of use on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> The dryer produces a high volume of heated air for rapid drying.</li>
            <li> Like the button that allows you to control the cooling on the high fan setting.</li>
            <li> (You&#x27;re not suppose to use it on high with 240V according to the manual.)</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to travelers.</li>
            <li> I realize the faster the fan, the more it dilutes the heat from the heating coils, but it could be a little warmer.  </li>
            <li> Even high though isn&#x27;t that powerful, but gets the job done for basic drying purposes - probably not any fancy styles.  </li>
            <li> Even though you have to use it on low speed on the 220 volt setting, it is as powerful as the high setting on 110 volts.  </li>
            <li> The folding handle makes it convenient for travel, it does a reasonable job of drying my hair, and I didn&#x27;t find it excessively loud.</li>
            <li> but WOW this thing works fast.  </li>
            <li> Like the long cord and the cool shot button.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is smaller than my regular dryer but bigger than I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Low setying is powerful.  </li>
            <li> one was powerful enough</li>
            <li> (I blow dry on high and then blow out/smooth with the cool shot).</li>
            <li> It is so compact that it fit right into my small suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Folds up nicely so takes up less space in a suitcase then a regular size hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It is the right size, not to big for the bathroom and with a lot of power</li>
            <li> Works well, completely adequate for medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> The dry time is fast, I manage to dry &amp; style my ear-length hair in 3 minutes or less every single time, with wonderful results.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on European travel hairdryers and this one consistently got high reviews.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I advise buying two, so in twenty years or so, when you need a new dryer, you&#x27;ve got another one on hand.</li>
            <li> Needed a spare, the style may change, I often do not like the new and improved.  </li>
            <li> It was still working the day I replaced it with this new one.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my mom since it&#x27;s small and very light</li>
            <li> Please note the directions read to only use on low setting when overseas; but the air volumne was still very good &amp; I have thick hair!  </li>
            <li> Seems to work well, although on 230v setting only low heat setting is available.</li>
            <li> Also, the plug was so big that it didn&#x27;t fit into the space above my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> No surprises - this hair dryer is exactly as described, and it probably deserves another star if it&#x27;s only compared to other units that are currently available.</li>
            <li> Directions very clear about how to switch the voltage.</li>
            <li> (There was one night I stayed in a very old home in Switzerland</li>
            <li> It is also super powerful and I can dry my long hair in just 5 - 10 min.</li>
            <li> dried my hair pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Satisfied practical and manageable for small</li>
            <li> The first time I went to use the dryer it short circuited and wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty temperamental, and this left me frizzy and puffed up.</li>
            <li> This small Conair 1875 will always be my favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li> worn looking as it is), and will pack the new model away for emergency use in case the old one stops working.</li>
            <li> This is a big improvement over my 15 year old Conair with a higher volume of air pushed out.  </li>
            <li> It drys my hair quickly and isn&#x27;t too large or heavy to use.</li>
            <li> Very important to me, because I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> A little bit smaller than my Sharper Image one that has served me well for many years but just died recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took this hair dryer to France, was a little skeptical, but with an adapter, it was wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It works a little better if I plug it into the upper outlet, but I have to keep my curling iron plugged into that one because the plug covers the lower outlet.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful for a little hair dyer</li>
            <li> and I leave mine old clunky one at home.</li>
            <li> Works well but extremely loud.</li>
            <li> Going to Europe and it was not compact enough and took up too much room in my suitcase..</li>
            <li> so much I am using it now as my regular dryer instead of the bulky Conair styler</li>
            <li> (Our old one never did.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as loud as some dryers.  </li>
            <li> Quieter than my old dryer, but I wouldn&#x27;t describe any dryer as &amp;#34;quiet.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s because my old dryer died 6 weeks ago</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it is far quieter than my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for a Europe trip and back in the States I pack this in my gym bag to get ready at work.</li>
            <li> It has so much power for such a compact dryer.  </li>
            <li> My old dryer was not putting out any heat.</li>
            <li> Have had about 4 of them so far over the years ... wouldn&#x27;t use anything else if i can help it.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really convenient to bring for travel because of its tiny size.</li>
            <li> you can hold it directly towards your scalp</li>
            <li> Durability is good - our&#x27;s usually last at least five years with daily use by two people.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect and i have long thick hair and this small hair dryer</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair very fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, it&#x27;s small, but it packs a punch!</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve used Conair 1875s for both our primary blow dryer (yes, my wife has long hair) and our travel needs (motorcycle touring means limited luggage space).</li>
            <li> Product is small and folds making it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Dry exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this dryer, it sucked my long hair into the back of it and knotted it up.  </li>
            <li> Small easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Small and strong.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is that it&#x27;s loud on high setting.</li>
            <li> Replacement for an older similar model.  </li>
            <li> Using this higher setting gives you only one setting option - low.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer as a back up for my older version of another hair dryer made by Conair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.....as it is only used when traveling and hair is short.  </li>
            <li> It only works on high with</li>
            <li> but I only use it on high that that didn&#x27;t make a difference to me.</li>
            <li> only works on the HIGH setting at 220V.</li>
            <li> 2 speeds (high and low) with a cooling button.</li>
            <li> but when I used it in the apartment in Paris, after switching the voltage, it only had one speed, high.</li>
            <li> The plug on the new model is much larger and heavier than the old plug.  </li>
            <li> light and very little noise, dual voltage dries your hair soon.</li>
            <li> It is light and small and travels well, however it only has one heat setting and one fan speed, (high).</li>
            <li> We intend to travel light, 1 small suitcase each...</li>
            <li> In 220 mode they can only be used on LOW, however, this is still powerful enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I first thought the button was jammed, so tried again after switching to 120V and the button to switch</li>
            <li> It definitely has a punch and works really well outside the US.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is powerful and dries my hair in less than five minutes.  </li>
            <li> It is true that you can only use the low setting in Europe; however, it seemed as though the low setting was  putting out as much air as the high setting usually does here in the US.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful enough to dry my hair quickly, as well as lightweight and space-efficient (small bathroom counter).  </li>
            <li> Will do European and US power settings, though at the higher voltage it will only work with the low setting.</li>
            <li> This was the star purchase for my first foreign travel trip.  </li>
            <li> Small / Compacted and powerful !</li>
            <li> It is compact size but not small enough for travel.</li>
            <li> Ended up being a little TOO powerful.</li>
            <li> Powerful blower in that little motor.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer began to malfunction today after 17 months of light use; about 1-2 times per week/during the summer months hardly at all.</li>
            <li> (I will say that my hair is long, but not extremely thick.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, small, doing job (enough power).</li>
            <li> Has very similar features as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> However, it is much noisier than expected.</li>
            <li> since models change all the time and seem to get worse, noy better.  </li>
            <li> Nice and small, but seems really heavy.  </li>
            <li> Just as powerful, but easier to use in that it&#x27;s not as heavy.</li>
            <li> Air flow a little too strong and opening a bit too wide.  </li>
            <li> Folds up nicely, Very powerful for such a small dryer.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t extremely compact or lightweight, but it was definitely small enough to fit in my luggage without taking up much room.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve tried other 1875 watt dryers, for some reason, this particular model seems to dry my hair much faster than any of the others, including full-size dryers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s puts out a LOT of air, and with the right amount of heat to style with my round brush.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what are all these hundreds of extra watts doing for me other than increasing the size of my carbon footprint?</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly and folds away small.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer because it&#x27;s extremely lightweight and yet has as much power as a full-size dryer.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve learned over the years that the cost of a great international vacation is bad hair...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s loud yet seems to take a tiny bit longer to dry my hair than the old one did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually considering swapping it out with my regular dryer since it&#x27;s so much lighter and seemed to dry my hair even quicker.  </li>
            <li> My previous portable one was smaller and dried better.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair quickly, was compact for travel, used low setting only based on prior reviews.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t really used a hair dryer in a couple of years, due to a short hair style.  </li>
            <li> Fairly small, but quite powerful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a few minutes to heat up when you first start drying your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also still quite powerful for how small it is.  </li>
            <li> This small but powerful dryer is just want I wanted.</li>
            <li> Small, compact, powerful.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but that&#x27;s to be expected with most compact dryers that put out any volume of air.</li>
            <li> I have had a few Conair hair dryers, but this one with the folding handle really saves space in my bag!</li>
            <li> I use this dryer as my everyday hair dryer, it&#x27;s small size makes it easy to store and also not heavy to hold</li>
            <li> This was a replacement to my old one which I had for a very long time.</li>
            <li> powerful and small enough to travel with</li>
            <li> This is for my regular daily use because the small size fits under my sink but is powerful enough to blow out my hairstyle every day.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and can dry my short hair in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Works well but heavy and large.</li>
            <li> So much power in this little thing.</li>
            <li> I just wish that the electrical plug wasn&#x27;t so huge, or at the very least, that it was reversible</li>
            <li> I really cannot say enough about this little guy.  </li>
            <li> My sister and I were both pleased with the strength of this little hair dryer (we both have really thick hair).</li>
            <li> Typically we used the low setting, and occasionally the high setting.</li>
            <li> and they are powerful enough to dry my long hair in a just a few minutes without over heating.  </li>
            <li> : just pop off the back cover and vacuum the dust off the filter</li>
            <li> It broke down the first time I used it in my foreign travel.</li>
            <li> However, as with most small dryers, the noise it makes is pretty horrifying - loud loud loud.</li>
            <li> I hope it last long than the one I got last year</li>
            <li> In fact, since we&#x27;ve been home, I routinely pull this out to dry my hair on a daily basis rather than my big, bulky dryer.  </li>
            <li> For the small size it dries hair very well.</li>
            <li> It barely could blow and definitely not hot enough.  </li>
            <li> They are compact, durable and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I had a heck of a time finding an object equivalent to a flat head screwdriver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last&#x27;s a long time and was thankful it was still around</li>
            <li> Works well and seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a universal hair dryer to work in other countries as her current one is 115v only.</li>
            <li> For use as a regular hair dryer, it takes awhile to dry, and just hi/lo heat and volume.</li>
            <li> We purchased the black travel model while we were traveling because our old Conair went on the blink.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and need 2 heat settings and prefer a fast, medium, slow speed on the fan.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.  </li>
            <li> No hair dryer hanger loop like my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reserve one less star for long term durability test.</li>
            <li> The dryer is about half as heavy as the voltage converter I originally bought for this puprpose, which weighed about a pound and a half.  </li>
            <li> Its just not hot enough on the low setting, which I do not like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, after we ordered what we thought was the same through Amazon, it turned out that the color is not the only thing different on this unit from the black one by Conair.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, when voltage was changed and it was used on the low setting it had plenty of ability to dry my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This Conair 1875 Watt Dual Voltage Folding Handle Hair Dryer is a little bulkier than the 10 year old unit it replaced.</li>
            <li> I have had mine just about that long</li>
            <li> (when in reality it isn&#x27;t THAT long).</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> I expected it to be smaller.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been so long I can&#x27;t remember, probably around 8 years.  </li>
            <li> It was rather bigger than I expected from the image though.</li>
            <li> Not terribly loud or forceful; it does the job, and was under $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was bigger than I had expected.</li>
            <li> other places that use that current</li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s not hot enough).  </li>
            <li> Can dry hair faster than the other of the same voltage I ever used.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> You can dry your hair in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Sometimes chemically treated hair takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> , it takes longer to dry and the Conair automatically shut down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lightweight, compact w/ plenty of power to dry hair</li>
            <li> Gets my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer at least since high school--</li>
            <li> This thing stores well as it folds up, for those of us that have limited bathroom space and cabinets or travel often.</li>
            <li> There is limited space around the electric outlet in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll still need an adapter for  the European receptacles, from the flat blade to the round one.</li>
            <li> I have recently been a backpack traveler and this folds down and fits in any bag you would want to travel with.</li>
            <li> the ionic technology actually cuts drying time if half, it seems.  </li>
            <li> What they fail to tell you is that once you plug it into 220V, there is only one speed setting and that is HIGH!&lt;br /&gt;That must be how they compensate for the higher voltage.</li>
            <li> have had this product for less than one year, and it has stopped working properly.  </li>
            <li> I recommend the black unit that looks identical to this one except that the cooling button is on the back side of the unit.</li>
            <li> I got so tired of trying to clean out my previous dryers, knowing that the air starvation would otherwise cook the insides and cause early failure.  </li>
            <li> My old one broke down after only about 20 years of hard work.</li>
            <li> I was tired of dealing with a large blow dryer on a daily basis, and wanted one that was small enough to fold and pack for a trip.  </li>
            <li> With no plug in within the bathroom, it had very limited use.</li>
            <li> , I only had to turn the little dial on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this little powerhouse since 2002 and just now on my third Conair.</li>
            <li> This little dryer works well as a travel dryer, especially since it folds.</li>
            <li> For the last month or so the fan seemed to be starting a little slow and would gradually work up to regular speed.  </li>
            <li> I use them for both my regular everyday hair dryer and our travel hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> but simply because it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE NOT REALLY COMPACT.  </li>
            <li> but the nozzle is too wide for my diffuser</li>
            <li> My hair is short, and I use this for a few minutes and it&#x27;s done.  </li>
            <li> Highly NOT RECOMENDED!</li>
            <li> Great...exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Not very compact for a travel device.</li>
            <li> You need to read the instructions carefully</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> was not going to carry to around Europe dead for a month and bring it back - just to mail it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I sent&lt;br /&gt;it back because I do not have time to waste until the hair dryer could&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s  well and is small enough to pack for travel.</li>
            <li> For a small hair dryer, it has a decent amount of power and is comparable to an ordinary use dryer.  </li>
            <li> Also, I only took a small carry-on suitcase to Europe.  </li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small.  </li>
            <li> Also it has the Cool switch that blows cold air that my wife likes as well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had one burn out like other brands.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the trip since it has the dual controls for both the US and for foreign electricity.  </li>
            <li> I took this hair dryer to Cuba with me, where they have 110 volts in some hotels and 220 volts in other.  </li>
            <li> My hair is past the halfway point of my back.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this product and the short return window.</li>
            <li> I had a Conair hair dryer that gave out finally due to usage and</li>
            <li> It took me way too long to dry my very short, thin hair.</li>
            <li> but I could completely dry it in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Holy cow...</li>
            <li> but I guess that is something which I felt in my previous dryers from other brands too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this little guy daily for the past 3 months</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> (you can&#x27;t plug it in upside down, limiting which socket you can use for it).  </li>
            <li> We used it almost every day, or at least every other day, to dry my 3-year-old&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I like it because it also folds up &amp; takes less space</li>
            <li> I had purchased previously for my home.</li>
            <li> it folds in half.</li>
            <li> This is not true, at all.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a little less weight</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is that it is very hard to switch between the 140 and 220 modes.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair that takes time to dry and style.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE A LITTLE ON THE BULKY SIDE, BUT THEY DO FOLD UP.</li>
            <li> Lots of power in this little guy - handle folds if storage is a problem in a drawer or a suitcase.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a hanging loop on th handle , and it is a little on the noisy side</li>
            <li> but I needed an adapter as usual for a foreign country</li>
            <li> It is a little noisy</li>
            <li> Dries my shorter hair in a few minutes tops.</li>
            <li> I bought this travel hair dryer for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it abroad yet, but plan to in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t like a heavy hairdryer).  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter to use in her study abroad program but it is on the heavy side</li>
            <li> Waste of money, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> It will work well for few months</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t blow dried</li>
            <li> It will not stay firmly in the outlet and is prone to falling out.  </li>
            <li> and it dried my hair.</li>
            <li> They are small, but not too small or too heavy for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth it for me to bring it all the way back to the US and return it, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> dryer had ceased working so this little dryer was the ticket!</li>
            <li> It folds in half and the cord retracts into the handle, making it very small.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is small and fierce.</li>
            <li> For compact, portable, it is not that small.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small compact dryer.  </li>
            <li> This means that if you try your hair dryer overseas it will work for about 1 second and fail.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s relatively small</li>
            <li> Small size</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as small as I had hoped</li>
            <li> Small for packing as it collapses.</li>
            <li> I bought it at a retail store within the past year.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small (pocket size) hair dryer to take on vacation.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for you or not.  </li>
            <li> Purchase this hair dryer to use for travel, it folds and is small but has lots of power.</li>
            <li> Finally, I&#x27;ve found that when buying a hair dryer, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Conair, as their products provide years and years of use.  </li>
            <li> My old product still worked, but had gotten worn and dirty looking, even though I had cleaned it.  </li>
            <li> Dried my hair well for as small as it is, and I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Both times the conversations were hard to understand and</li>
            <li> why are colors so hard to find?  </li>
            <li> Hard to style.</li>
            <li> The button from 125-250 can be a bit hard to turn -</li>
            <li> That is not by way of complaint, just an observation.[[ASIN</li>
            <li> this product was defective, sucks</li>
            <li> If it breaks, you&#x27;ll bet I&#x27;ll just buy another without complaint.</li>
            <li> but since I have thick shoulder length</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small!</li>
            <li> I mean, seriously, if you want it to be a PORTABLE dryer, don&#x27;t have the end of the cord</li>
            <li> was looking to replace a very small 1250watt mini dryer that I had for years.</li>
            <li> Small but packs some serious heat and power!</li>
            <li> - I will be shocked if I get anything back.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because it was so small</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Unless I just got a weird one, in which case I&#x27;ll probably find out soon, but when you wake up late and you&#x27;re drying your hair...</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if the price has increased or decreased since my purchase.</li>
            <li> It also made a terrible noise on high, when I plugged it in to test it - and popped the safety switch three times.</li>
            <li> as if you had it set at 110 when you needed 220, the dryer would burn out and be useless.  </li>
            <li> Since we did not bring another adapter, it was useless.  </li>
            <li> It has traveled throughout Europe and the Mediterranean with us and has never been a disappointment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is almost impossible to find in stores, which is a shame, because it is so well designed.</li>
            <li> Trying to plug the dryer in is almost impossible.</li>
            <li> Could not use it all the time I was abroad and need it badly.</li>
            <li> the noise is not that horrible high-pitched whine that lots of hair dryers have so that part could definitely be worse.</li>
            <li> This was not the product I ordered and was disappointed that it cost me $12.20 to return it.   </li>
            <li> Has a cold shot button!  </li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, but couldn&#x27;t return the product since I was in another country</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the replacement model.</li>
            <li> Conair Hair dryers are the worst.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fairly lightweight; powerful enough. Compact. Like the folding handle.</li>
            <li> Folds. Nice. For the small size it dries hair very well. Fits in suitcase very well. The plug is a little bulky but very safe. Good product.</li>
            <li> Good size, good power.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my dryer.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Nice size, convenient for travel, powerfull and light. Dual voltage is very beneficial if you travel to Europe. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this! Works great! So portable!</li>
            <li> This dryer is almost impossible to find in stores, which is a shame, because it is so well designed. Larger than the hard-to-manipulate micro-travel dryers, smaller than the overweight full-size models, it fits perfectly in the hand and is easy to use. Its 1875 watts of power make drying fast and easy, and add in the cool burst feature and it pretty much does everything. To top it off, cleaning the filter is a cinch: just pop off the back cover and vacuum the dust off the filter and you&#x27;re good to go. Like, good to go for about 15 years. I have had mine just about that long, I use it every day, and it&#x27;s still cruising along no problem.  The dryer does not have a retractable cord, but that&#x27;s never been an issue for me, since most travel dryers also do not have a cord keeper. The cord is longer than on most dryers, which is actually nice when traveling, because you don&#x27;t end up leaning sideways on one foot when the outlet is far from the mirror.  I cannot recommend this dryer enough. In fact, I advise buying two, so in twenty years or so, when you need a new dryer, you&#x27;ve got another one on hand. You won&#x27;t want to use anything else. SUPER!!</li>
            <li> Fairly small, but quite powerful. Dries my shorter hair in a few minutes tops. Will do European and US power settings, though at the higher voltage it will only work with the low setting.</li>
            <li> I bought this travel hair dryer for everyday use.  For a small hair dryer, it has a decent amount of power and is comparable to an ordinary use dryer.  It dries my hair quickly and folds away small. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Dual voltage perfect for travel.  Wonderful size and perfect heat...not too hot as some can be.  I make my daughter bring this one when we travel since I love it so much and I leave mine old clunky one at home.</li>
            <li> Worked great while in Kenya.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Just bought this before traveling to Europe and Africa, as in the past I haven&#x27;t had the best luck with converters and voltage when bringing american hair dryers to Europe.  However here, the voltage is already converted for you to 220 making it so easy to use. Product is small and folds making it easy to travel with. Would recommend to anyone for travel!</li>
            <li> Has a 110 or 220 setting so it&#x27;s perfect for worldwide travel. Works with a plug adapter. No converter needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to bring with me to Europe. The size is perfect and i have long thick hair and this small hair dryer dried my hair pretty quickly. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The best travel dryer I have found. So much power in this little thing.</li>
            <li> Bought this dual voltage drier for my trip to Europe. Dried my hair quickly, was compact for travel, used low setting only based on prior reviews. Great dryer but LOUD!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as a birthday gift for my wife 3 weeks in advance. I never received the product, but did get a email with a gift certificate for $0.00. I spoke with the vendor twice, once on the phone and once via chat. Both times the conversations were hard to understand and confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this vendor. You can get this item at KMart for $14.99 (but shipping was $6.95...pick up at store is $0).</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer to use while vacationing in Europe.  It worked great!  It is true that you can only use the low setting in Europe; however, it seemed as though the low setting was  putting out as much air as the high setting usually does here in the US.  Also, I only took a small carry-on suitcase to Europe.  Because of the fold-down capability, this hairdryer fit perfectly into my carry-on.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is the right size, not to big for the bathroom and with a lot of power</li>
            <li> The removable lint screen makes this dryer a rare find.  I got so tired of trying to clean out my previous dryers, knowing that the air starvation would otherwise cook the insides and cause early failure.  The high air flow is also a plus.</li>
            <li> used it for travel abroad - served me perfectly</li>
            <li> Small but packs some serious heat and power!</li>
            <li> No surprises - this hair dryer is exactly as described, and it probably deserves another star if it&#x27;s only compared to other units that are currently available. The folding handle makes it convenient for travel, it does a reasonable job of drying my hair, and I didn&#x27;t find it excessively loud. But, my old 1600 watt Conair compact styler felt much more solid, was slightly smaller even though it felt bigger and more comfortable in my hand, dried my hair faster, had a fan motor that didn&#x27;t sound quite as whiney, and coexisted nicely with other electrical devices on a 15 amp circuit. And although I liked my old 1600 watt dryer better than my new Vagabond, it didn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster than the 1200 watt dryer it replaced, or the 1000 watt dryer before that. Exactly what are all these hundreds of extra watts doing for me other than increasing the size of my carbon footprint? Hey Conair - come up with an Energy Star rated dryer and I&#x27;ll trade this puppy in in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is small and fierce. I have not used it abroad yet, but plan to in a few weeks. I have had several compact dryers in the past and this one definitely does the best job.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my wife to use on our motorcycle trips.  It is fairly compact and does a decent job on my wife&#x27;s short hair.  Everything on it was just as described, no surprises.  She likes it so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement to my old one which I had for a very long time. The old dryer was dropped too many times that the plastic cover around the power plug was exposed.  My husband didn&#x27;t want me to continue to use it for fear of being electrocuted because of exposed wires.  Dryer was still working though.  The new one works just fine. I will be taking this with me when we go to U. K.</li>
            <li> Replaced my last travel Conair that I swear I&#x27;ve probably had well over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Great size, easy to fold up for travel. Great power and the 2 heat settings are nice. Also I LOVE the cool shot button. That&#x27;s a must for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few minutes to heat up when you first start drying your hair. Unless I just got a weird one, in which case I&#x27;ll probably find out soon, but when you wake up late and you&#x27;re drying your hair... ugh.. that time feels like forever (when in reality it isn&#x27;t THAT long).</li>
            <li> Great product.  Worked awesome in London and Scotland while using a Universal All in one interantional travel power plug adapter.</li>
            <li> Great mini dryer with plenty of power. Only problem is that it&#x27;s loud on high setting.</li>
            <li> Great when traveling. The right size to carry in your luggage.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what the product was like because the service from this shipper was horrendous! I was told various dates for shipping and arrival and then the product never arrived and I received an email from amazon.com saying that they had received this product damaged and would not be able to ship it to me. This was supposed to be a gift and it never arrived on time! I wouldn&#x27;t use the company that ships this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Great little travel dryer.  Super strong for the size!</li>
            <li> Works well but extremely loud.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for a trip to London, and had no problems with the voltage whatsoever.  Note that even though the dryer converts the voltage, the plug prongs themselves are still made for US outlets - you will need to get a socket adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size and portability of this dryer are great.  It&#x27;s also still quite powerful for how small it is.  However, it really needs to come with a diffuser...my hair doesn&#x27;t come out nearly as smooth as it does with a longer barrel drier + diffuser.  But I&#x27;ve learned over the years that the cost of a great international vacation is bad hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, long story short, this dryer is great for what it is :)</li>
            <li> We have purchased several of these hairdryers and we love them.  They are compact, durable and last a long time.  We are overseas travelers and find them the perfect size for the suitcase.  They are small, but not too small or too heavy for everyday use.  (I don&#x27;t like a heavy hairdryer).  They can be easily switched between 110/220v by using a coin (just don&#x27;t forget!) and they are powerful enough to dry my long hair in a just a few minutes without over heating.  (I will say that my hair is long, but not extremely thick.)  The handle folds down, which is nice for travel.  In 220 mode they can only be used on LOW, however, this is still powerful enough for me.  I also like the COOL button.  Our family currently owns three of these.  I use them for both my regular everyday hair dryer and our travel hair dryers.  I first bought one in 2007 and it lasted about 6 or 7 years.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Since I was traveling overseas, this was a great purchase because of it&#x27;s dual voltage capabilities.  It is so compact that it fit right into my small suitcase.  I definitely would purchase it again and would recommend it to anyone traveling overseas...</li>
            <li> This product suits it&#x27;s purpose for traveling.  I have short hair and it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for long hair.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter to use in her study abroad program but it is on the heavy side so I swapped and let her bring my older travel dryer because it was so much lighter since weight was an issue for her...I may send this one back not because it doesn&#x27;t work well but simply because it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet overseas, but on a use test it produced good airflow and heat.</li>
            <li> I had a smaller travel Conair for years and it just died. I needed to make sure the next one was up to speed. This little dryer is perfect. I have long hair and I don&#x27;t like to spend a ton of time drying my hair, so I need something powerful. I use this dryer as my everyday hair dryer, it&#x27;s small size makes it easy to store and also not heavy to hold so your arm doesn&#x27;t get sore.&lt;br /&gt;Also comes with a switch so that you can adjust the voltage if you travel abroad. Very handy.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I returned the product because it weighed too much..Going to Europe and it was not compact enough and took up too much room in my suitcase..</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD SEVERAL OF THESE HAIR DRYERS....THEY ARE GREAT, AND A GREAT BRAND NAME....AS FOR A TRAVEL HAIR DRYER THEY ARE NOT REALLY COMPACT.  THEY ARE A LITTLE ON THE BULKY SIDE, BUT THEY DO FOLD UP.</li>
            <li> This is not as good as the hair dryer I use at home, a Conair 225NP Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875-Watt Hair Dryer. For compact, portable, it is not that small. For use as a regular hair dryer, it takes awhile to dry, and just hi/lo heat and volume. My previous portable one was smaller and dried better. This works OK.</li>
            <li> Perfect travel dryer.  Fairly strong.  Drys my hair quickly!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small compact dryer.  This is not as small as I wanted but it works beautifully.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really cannot say enough about this little guy.  It is versatile and easy to stow for long trips.  I have very long hair and it does the job in under 10 minutes.  A word of warning though..it does pull a lot of power and I have tripped the circuit breaker more than once.  That is not by way of complaint, just an observation.[[ASIN:B00006IV22 CONAIR 1875 Compact Styler]]</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my trip to florida where I would be staying with friends who didn&#x27;t have a hair dryer... this is a wonderful little dryer. I have recently been a backpack traveler and this folds down and fits in any bag you would want to travel with.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the best one I have ever used. And the one of the exceptional aspects is it can use at 220V condition.</li>
            <li> I have a Conair hair dryer that I use at home.  I bought this one for a trip to the UK because of the dual voltage feature and compact size.  My trip is in three weeks so I am yet to try it out overseas yet but it arrived quickly and does seem very lightweight and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> My wife love this. Its very compact with a folding handle. It has an option for warm or normal air. Much more is that it&#x27;s AUTO-VOLT so you can use it anywhere. A true travel dryer/styler. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love it. It is very powerful hair dryer. I like it because it also folds up &amp; takes less space</li>
            <li> It is much larger than I had hoped. I would prefer something more compact for international travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, small, doing job (enough power). It may be good for trip, but the hotel I stay usually has a dryer, so I don&#x27;t bring it. If you look for a compact dryer, then this is a perfect model as that price.</li>
            <li> This small but powerful dryer is just want I wanted.</li>
            <li> This compact styler is fabulous. It folds up nicely so it takes up very little space. It has traveled throughout Europe and the Mediterranean with us and has never been a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I use this on my dog after I give her a bath. Great</li>
            <li> I picked up this dryer when I was staying some nights at my fiancee&#x27;s apartment, so I could stash it out of his way when I wasn&#x27;t there. It folds in half and the cord retracts into the handle, making it very small. I was immediately impressed with the power, I have pretty thick hair but I could completely dry it in just a few minutes. When we got married and bought a house it has stayed on with me, becoming my primary hair dryer. I have used it daily for about 3 years now and it has not faltered, definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a very old travel hairdryer after reading good reviews.</li>
            <li> bought this dryer for trips-US and Europe. Worked great. Alot of power for a compact dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my larger ionic dryer. It is advertised on the Amazon site as being ionic. It just arrived and there is no reference to ionic on the box or the insert. Trying to decide if I should return it. Any input?</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t usually rate hair dryers, but this by far is the best dryer i&#x27;ve ever used.  the ionic technology actually cuts drying time if half, it seems.  i have a large bushy handlebar mustache and curl it with a dryer after a shower.  this works great.  small, compact, good controls and cool shot in exactly right place.  if i designed hair dryers, i couldn&#x27;t do any better then this.  since models change all the time and seem to get worse, noy better.  i ordered 4</li>
            <li> I liked it, it was a present to my Son-in -Law.  He was happy to receive it, but I don&#x27;t have any feedback yet.  They are out of state for visit.</li>
            <li> Work well and has great heat. I can dry my hair very fast</li>
            <li> Does it job but too noisy</li>
            <li> This hair dryer worked perfectly on my trip to Europe!! Even on the low setting this dryer had way more power than any of the European dryers that were available. It isn&#x27;t extremely compact or lightweight, but it was definitely small enough to fit in my luggage without taking up much room. Don&#x27;t forget to change the voltage setting on the dryer before using. I forgot, but luckily it has a built in kill switch that prevents the dryer from blowing out. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because I was taking a trip to Ireland, and needed a hair dryer that could switch voltage. Before we left the US, I changed the switch to be compatible with UK power, followed the instructions and kept it on the low setting (which is just as powerful as the high setting on US voltage), plugged it into the plug adapter (you need this to be able to plug any US appliances into wall outlets in most other countries), plugged that into the wall outlet, and it worked perfectly!  I was originally going to use this dryer only when travelling, but it works so well that I use it every day now!  LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!! Small, compact, powerful. This thing stores well as it folds up, for those of us that have limited bathroom space and cabinets or travel often. Conair has been making quality products for years and they have always been affordable.</li>
            <li> Really good quality, l liked it so much l bought 4,</li>
            <li> Bought for a trip to Europe; worked great with an adapter; no troubles. Small and easy to fit into luggage!</li>
            <li> This is a great blowdryer to take traveling. Has full power in a compact size. Handle folds up nicely. Used it in France wth an adapter.</li>
            <li> I think this blow dryer is stronger than my full size blow dryer.  It is just the perfect size and the folding handle is great.  I looked a long time for a good brand, reliable compact dryer with a folding handle.  So glad I spotted this one on Amazon.  This dryer and a compact flat iron are the perfect pair.</li>
            <li> I am African and it&#x27;s perfect for my natural hair.It&#x27;s a mini but in several minutes i get my hair dry.cool!</li>
            <li> Dry exactly as advertised.Quick delivery. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Traveling abroad?  Most foreign countries use 220 VAC instead of the USA 120 VAC.  This means that if you try your hair dryer overseas it will work for about 1 second and fail.  This unit has a voltage selector switch so it will work no matter what the voltage is.  Folds to much smaller unit, name branded.  Remember to buy the correct country plug adaptor.</li>
            <li> Replacement for an older similar model.  Works fine.  Convenient to pack and store.  Plug is a bit large, which was problematic in a vacation rental, but otherwise works fine at home.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair dryer you will probably ever find. It is very powerful and dries my hair quite quickly. Plus the folding design makes it easy to stash away. In addition, it&#x27;s relatively small so it&#x27;s not taking up a ton of room in your suitcase. A win all around.</li>
            <li> This was not the product I ordered and was disappointed that it cost me $12.20 to return it.   I feel Amazon should have refunded my postage.  I do thank you for the timely return price of the item itself.    Thank you  Pat Savina</li>
            <li> I hope it last long than the one I got last year</li>
            <li> works fine but it&#x27;s loud yet seems to take a tiny bit longer to dry my hair than the old one did. the noise is not that horrible high-pitched whine that lots of hair dryers have so that part could definitely be worse. the loud part is more like a wind noise or a whooshing sound. i like this hair dryer more than many i&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Meets my needs perfectly.!</li>
            <li> My last hair dryer ( same fold, wattage, size) lasted 25 years! It was my only dryer and perfect for overseas. Of course 25 years ago it was made in USA. Now made in China. Remember to change the wattage overseas and you should have no problem. Read the directions if you are unfamiliar with 110 vs. 225. I&#x27;m so happy to find this item again! It&#x27;s a simple dryer, easy to use and change for overseas. It fits well in carry on luggage.  If you are looking for bells and whistles this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Great power, compact shape, easy to use. This is for my regular daily use because the small size fits under my sink but is powerful enough to blow out my hairstyle every day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer for a trip to Europe.  If barely took any space in my suitcase and worked great during the trip (There was one night I stayed in a very old home in Switzerland and it caused a fuse to blow, but fine in newer homes and hotels).  I actually like the dryer so much I am using it now as my regular dryer instead of the bulky Conair styler I had purchased previously for my home.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I used to have a Conair 1875 watts that was much better than this one.  It barely could blow and definitely not hot enough.  I gave it to my mom since it&#x27;s small and very light and she doesn&#x27;t have much hair, but it was unusable for me.  Still searching for a good hair blower...</li>
            <li> I expected it to be smaller.</li>
            <li> This little thing is light and powerful. I like the controls and styling. I would definitely buy it again. Yeah.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, instructions clear, has plenty of power, very light and small for travel. Have begun using it every day instead of my regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I got this compact hair dryer to replace the same model, which I&#x27;d had for a decade or two but the cord started to wear. I found my old one to be very reliable and with a surprisingly strong air flow for the compact size of the dryer. I&#x27;d taken it on several dozen trips and used it at home often as well. This new one seems to be of equally good quality and has all the features I&#x27;d liked on my old one. I was so glad Conair still makes it!</li>
            <li> This item died after only a couple uses. Waste of money, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Great traveling hair dryer...compact, yet powerful.  I&#x27;m actually considering swapping it out with my regular dryer since it&#x27;s so much lighter and seemed to dry my hair even quicker.  I&#x27;m beyond satisfied!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works fine but the nozzle is too wide for my diffuser so I had to return the item.  I did like that the handle folds and that it can easily switch from 120v to 220v.</li>
            <li> Satisfied practical and manageable for small</li>
            <li> Works great.  Small size but I like the volume of air it produces on high.</li>
            <li> Perfect... exactly that I expected and needed!</li>
            <li> Very good for travel and very potent.</li>
            <li> Bought for wife.  Must be good, she takes it in all the trips</li>
            <li> Can dry hair faster than the other of the same voltage I ever used.  A good compact hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
            <li> Worth the money and good quality no issues</li>
            <li> Lots of power in this little guy - handle folds if storage is a problem in a drawer or a suitcase.</li>
            <li> Nice and small, but seems really heavy.  The high setting is very hot and I had to use the cool button intermittently.  Dried my hair well for as small as it is, and I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I know many people loved this dryer, but it didn&#x27;t suit my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking to replace a very small 1250watt mini dryer that I had for years. This wasn&#x27;t as small as I had hoped and I didn&#x27;t like folding handle (seemed like it would break easily).&lt;br /&gt;More importantly the &amp;#34;low speed&amp;#34; did almost nothing and the &amp;#34;high speed&amp;#34; was way too much at 1875watts. It also made a terrible noise on high, when I plugged it in to test it - and popped the safety switch three times. Perhaps mine was defective, so I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I like Conair products and found a compact Conair travel 1600w at a local store that feels sturdier and is smaller than this one.</li>
            <li> Nice size for storage. Dryer came ready to use, and the cool switch is great as last stage to dry. It would be nice to have a hanger loop.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. It definitely has a punch and works really well outside the US.</li>
            <li> Compact size makes this hair dryer great and easy to pack for weekend and/or longer trips.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is perfect for international travel. It is compact, and the dual voltage feature is great. No need to spend money on a voltage converter, and no worries about blowing fuses overseas. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Bought this to take on a trip to Europe.  I love how it folds and how it is easy to convert the voltage.  Most importantly, this small dryer works really well!  Great purchase....BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly pleased with this hair dryer on my recent trip abroad. It will likely replace my full-sized hair dryer on future trips.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to use in Germany. The first time I went to use the dryer it short circuited and wouldn&#x27;t work. The blowdryer works great in the states but no in Europe.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected, light weight ,compact and presently looking forward to significant durability.&lt;br /&gt;Believe the price was appropriate. Good Buy!</li>
            <li> More power than expected.</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to travel with.  Puts out plenty of air.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> It got the job done in Copenhagen, Paris, London, and Iceland! Just don&#x27;t expect this hairdryer to be as high quality as salon-style dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and fit nicely in my baggage. I used a voltage converter for European outlets and the dryer was just as strong as it would be if I had used it at home. The dryer features a turnable voltage switch that allows the user to change the voltage depending on which area of the world they are using it in. Pretty nifty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for European travel (or any travel!)</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Worked as advertised, powerful and light.</li>
            <li> We are very satisfied with the Conair 1875.  The reviews we read about it were accurate.  Now the only question remaining is whether it will make the cut in my Camino backpack where weight means everything.  Otherwise, we expect to enjoying using this light and powerful hair dryer for a long while.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s  well and is small enough to pack for travel.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, small with a but: the cable is stiff with a HUGE safe box at the end. It kind of defeats the purpose of this travel-sized little device.</li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small.  My hair is short, and I use this for a few minutes and it&#x27;s done.  Easy Peasy.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It&#x27;s compact, but powerful, and pretty lightweight.  Does a good job drying my fine hair (I&#x27;ve fine hair, but a lot of it) in scant minutes.  The only thing it isn&#x27;t, is quiet, but they don&#x27;t advertise it as such- just pointing it out though.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This item is great!&lt;br /&gt;Great price and the best thing I like is that I&#x27;ll be able to use it any where in the world. Thanks much</li>
            <li> Works excellent. Light weight also which I like very much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well, returned</li>
            <li> Got this for a trip and it&#x27;s more powerful than my regular hair dryer, so I think I&#x27;m going to use this one every day!</li>
            <li> I loved the small size. Definatley a plus when you need to save space in your suit case. Works great and dries your hair fast. I used it in Italy and only needed an adaptor.</li>
            <li> It drys my hair quickly and isn&#x27;t too large or heavy to use. I wish it had a hanging loop on th handle , and it is a little on the noisy side</li>
            <li> What can I say? This is a cheap hairdryer, and stopped working after only 7 months of very light use. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Did not work in Italy</li>
            <li> Used it in southern France. Directions very clear about how to switch the voltage. Still needs the plug adapter, but I knew that when I bought it. Folds up nicely, Very powerful for such a small dryer.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works great.</li>
            <li> I use this hair dryer on a daily basis at home and traveling.  Works very well, very powerful and hot, would recommend it.  Update: As of Nov 2016 (3 yrs) still working perfectly. Seems to be very good quality.</li>
            <li> I like this one for it is easy to hold and manage my hair. Small for packing as it collapses.</li>
            <li> GF brought it and loves it. I am a guy and don&#x27;t use it myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer just to travel with. I used it in Ireland and it worked great. All you need is an adapter. Don&#x27;t use a converter! The hair dryer will zap out the converter. My sister and I were both pleased with the strength of this little hair dryer (we both have really thick hair). It&#x27;s light and compact, so it travels well. I haven&#x27;t used it in the States yet, but I assume it will be just as good.</li>
            <li> Appears solid, as expected, good transaction, thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer at least since high school-- it&#x27;s been so long I can&#x27;t remember, probably around 8 years.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but it still works great!</li>
            <li> This looks and feels quality and definitely dries fast and is powerful. It was rather bigger than I expected from the image though.</li>
            <li> Although I buy a lot of things on Amazon, I did not buy this hairdryer here.  I bought it at a retail store within the past year. For the last month or so the fan seemed to be starting a little slow and would gradually work up to regular speed.  Today it sparked and caught fire, luckily before I put it near my head.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer and perfect for traveling internationally.  I purchased for a recent trip to Italy and with the correct adapter this hairdryer worked great.  I love that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about the voltage, I only had to turn the little dial on the bottom. Folds up nicely for packing as well.  The hairdryer itself is powerful and was able to handle my thick, curly hair.  It only works on high with you have it on 220V but I only use it on high that that didn&#x27;t make a difference to me.</li>
            <li> Very good vendor to deal with......very good product.</li>
            <li> Love it! It has a lot of power and works very well.</li>
            <li> Great product, lives up to its name, it is compact, lightweight, plenty of power.  I would recommend it to anyone that travels with a hairdryer.</li>
            <li> light, powerful, plug a little big, but over all a great buy, and easy to use, easy to pack, does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small (pocket size) hair dryer to take on vacation. This is way too big.  We intend to travel light, 1 small suitcase each... So each inch of space and each ounce of weight is important.  Years ago I had just such a dryer.. Maybe someday I&#x27;ll find another...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my most recent Eurotrip.  I used it in France, Italy and Spain with no problems (on the higher voltage setting).  It is compact but not as light as I was expecting.  Using this higher setting gives you only one setting option - low.  But the power over there is so strong that it feels more like high.  Even high though isn&#x27;t that powerful, but gets the job done for basic drying purposes - probably not any fancy styles.  Make sure to set it to high with a screwdriver before you go- I had a heck of a time finding an object equivalent to a flat head screwdriver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the States, this hair dryer isn&#x27;t really worth using.  &amp;#34;Low&amp;#34; is like someone blowing out their birthday cake candles and high is like...well...not much more than that.  I will use this as my travel blow dryer only.</li>
            <li> My wife already has this dryer, but she wanted another one to gift someone. The good thing I like about it is the dual voltage switch, compact, very simple to use. Also it has the Cool switch that blows cold air that my wife likes as well. Overall simple to use and works good. The only con I can think of is the chord gets in the way a lot.    By the way, the old one we had is still good, except there is some rust on the rim now so try to keep it away from any moisture....</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Didn&#x27;t blow the fuse in my Greek apartment like my classmates&#x27; dryers. Could use an attachment to focus the heat.</li>
            <li> But somewhat noisy.  This is a big improvement over my 15 year old Conair with a higher volume of air pushed out.  Works like a hair dryer should with a compact form.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I ordered two.  Works great, small, lightweight, easy to handle.  Like the long cord and the cool shot button.</li>
            <li> This appliance ran only once briefly on UK current with the use of a voltage adapter.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic - it works so much better than my &amp;#34;industrial&amp;#34; sized one!  I got this to travel next week, but I love it so much I&#x27;ve been using it as my main dryer.  It&#x27;s puts out a LOT of air, and with the right amount of heat to style with my round brush.  It dries my hair a lot faster.  It also doesn&#x27;t sound like a jet engine:)</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is smaller than my regular dryer but bigger than I would have liked. It gets the job done and I like that it folds in half.</li>
            <li> Gifted this to my mom in India. Since they use 220Volts in India, I needed something with dual voltage. What I realized was this dryer only works on the HIGH setting at 220V. I first thought the button was jammed, so tried again after switching to 120V and the button to switch high/low worked. I was very disappointed, but couldn&#x27;t return the product since I was in another country and this was a gift.&lt;br /&gt;I believe the product is designed that way, I wish they mentioned it. A low setting is critical to set a hairstyle or curl your hair.</li>
            <li> Conair Hair dryers are the worst. It will work well for few months and then it will stop working. When i asked couple of friends they had the same experience. Recently I bought a hair dryer for $34 and after 8 months it stopped working. When i called conair for warranty they asked me to send it to AZ with $7 in the pack to send it from AZ to CA. Please dont trust Conair.</li>
            <li> Great little travel hair dryer! Very powerful for a little hair dyer</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer as a back up for my older version of another hair dryer made by Conair. It is very lightweight and blows out very hot. I have thick long hair and it gets the job done. The shipping was very fast. It didn&#x27;t come with any attachments though but it is a very good hair dryer. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Worked in Middle East</li>
            <li> i need to exchange it for another hair dryer</li>
            <li> This is a good deal if you&#x27;re looking for a multi-power option for traveling.  It&#x27;s not as great as a professional hair-dryer but for the cost and for packing efficiency, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> For the international traveler, this is a must.  Works there and at home as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this unit for traveling to Europe, very compact for travel and with the dual voltage it&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;But you&#x27;ll still need an adapter for  the European receptacles, from the flat blade to the round one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this little powerhouse since 2002 and just now on my third Conair. It Last&#x27;s a long time and was thankful it was still around so I purchased two this time. Just make sure you turn the air intake cap counterclock wise to clean out the lint that&#x27;s caught on the grate or it becomes to hot. It get&#x27;s very hot already but I&#x27;ve never had one burn out like other brands.</li>
            <li> Compact for travel and very powerful.can&#x27;t beat it for the price. Recommend it for anyone looking for a travel hairdryer or enen great for home use.</li>
            <li> This Conair 1875 Watt Dual Voltage Folding Handle Hair Dryer is a little bulkier than the 10 year old unit it replaced. But it&#x27;s weight and balance are good and it is nicely powered.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling. Folds up nicely so takes up less space in a suitcase then a regular size hair dryer. Anymore I travel with this hair dryer as opposed to my regular bulky dryer.</li>
            <li> I had this dryer for travel for many years in 1675 Watt and recently it overheated and stopped over and again.  This dryer is a bit larger, but also more powerful and I love the placement of the cool shot.  Very important to me, because I have thick hair. I&#x27;m delighted I found it on Amazon.  I tried 3 other travel blow dryers, and this one is definitely the BEST</li>
            <li> This worked great, with the appropriate adaptor, when I used it in Italy.  In fact, it worked better than the one in the hotel bathroom that was made for use in Europe.</li>
            <li> Did not work, return policy do not allows you to return. this product was defective, sucks I can not return it. Save your bucks and do not buy it!</li>
            <li> Great for traveling abroad!</li>
            <li> Junk! Highly NOT RECOMENDED! It was broke for a week used!</li>
            <li> Great...exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Great for trips and taking to gym</li>
            <li> Wife needed something for our trip that didn&#x27;t take up as much space as her full-size hair dryer...this looked like a good value so we got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much lighter than I expected but still blows strong and hot!  Handle folds and seems to be made well enough to last quite some time.</li>
            <li> Not very compact for a travel device.</li>
            <li> Small and strong.  Great dryer for travel.  Also has dual voltage.  Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> For a quick dry in the mornings, it&#x27;s great.  Not terribly loud or forceful; it does the job, and was under $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I use it on our 12lb dog post-bath, it overheats/shuts off after about 3 mins of use.  (Our old one never did.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So:  Great for short hair, not so great for long hair/pets.  Not sure if that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for you or not.  4-stars, but -1 for overheat.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re landing on 3-stars, everyone!</li>
            <li> Love it.  I had an older version that no longer worked.  So this one is even better.  Dries well and good to take international.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before making the purchase for my trip to Europe. All makes and models had a mixed bag of reviews and I finally decided for this one. I LOVED IT. It fully performed to my expectations.</li>
            <li> This was the star purchase for my first foreign travel trip.  Blew hot as my Chi at home, no trouble using it anywhere I went in Spain.  Tiny and easy to pack.  Has a cold shot button!  Perfect!!</li>
            <li> Yes it works in Ireland. Remember to change the voltage selector, and only use it on low (which seemed like medium to me).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a hair blower daily but this is a great product for the price!  I purchased it years ago so I don&#x27;t know if the price has increased or decreased since my purchase.</li>
            <li> It was powerful as advertised and according to reviewers.  I realize the faster the fan, the more it dilutes the heat from the heating coils, but it could be a little warmer.  I&#x27;d still recommend it though.</li>
            <li> Use every day and works well.</li>
            <li> For the backup when traveling</li>
            <li> Very hot even at the lower setting required for international voltage.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I travel abroad quite a bit and needed a reliable hair dryer. I took this and all of my friends took theirs. Mine was the only one left standing. The dual wattage allows me to use this in America and also when I go places. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be smaller, for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great to find a compact hair dryer with this level of wattage.</li>
            <li> Really handy smaller travel hair dryer.  It has a cool setting, which I like.  The handle folds, making it more compact.  It isn&#x27;t as loud as some dryers.  I&#x27;ve been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this little guy daily for the past 3 months and I gotta say I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with it is how bulky the plug is. I mean, seriously, if you want it to be a PORTABLE dryer, don&#x27;t have the end of the cord be almost as big as the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of performance, however, I cannot complain.</li>
            <li> Perfect Size and Power!</li>
            <li> Great seller, will use again.</li>
            <li> I love this Hairdryer but I have only had it since March, which is only 5 months.  I keep buying them though but for $14.95 what can you expect I guess.  It just about stopped again today so will have to buy another kind maybe.  Darn!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer, dual voltage comes in handy.</li>
            <li> NOT travel size. Works well but heavy and large.</li>
            <li> Awesome little dryer. Quieter than my old dryer, but I wouldn&#x27;t describe any dryer as &amp;#34;quiet.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Perfect travel hair dryer for overseas!</li>
            <li> Very good, satisfactory</li>
            <li> I just returned from a trip to Israel and this travel dryer performed beautifully.  All I needed was the plug adapter that I had purchased and when I set the dryer to the international voltage the dryer functioned perfectly.  I had no issue with over heating and had really effective power which was far superior to the dryer in our bathroom provided by the hotel.  I also appreciated the folding feature making it easy to pack.  Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this for almost 15 years and it still works great. Best dryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I ordered.  I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> received it quick and good quality</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking I would have a hair dryer with two heat settings and two speed settings in Europe. What they fail to tell you is that once you plug it into 220V, there is only one speed setting and that is HIGH!&lt;br /&gt;That must be how they compensate for the higher voltage. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  We went to Ireland, Scotland, and London last summer (2014) and were gone for 3 weeks.  I bought this for the trip since it has the dual controls for both the US and for foreign electricity.  It worked well in all 3 countries.  I also bought it for it&#x27;s compact size and the fact that the handle folds.  We took backpacks rather than suitcases and I needed something that wasn&#x27;t bulky or took up a lot of room.  It is also very powerful for it&#x27;s size.  In fact, since we&#x27;ve been home, I routinely pull this out to dry my hair on a daily basis rather than my big, bulky dryer.  This one is faster, is easier to handle, and does an excellent job.  I would recommend this anyone looking for a good quality hair dryer in general and definitely for someone going on an extended trip where luggage space is limited.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the Conair Compact 1875. I purchased my first one about 7 years ago. I use it almost everyday. I have thick, course hair that takes time to dry and style. This little dryer packs a good punch and holds up well. FYI 2 speeds (high and low) with a cooling button.</li>
            <li> Packs easily and does the job.</li>
            <li> This is light and would probably be easy to travel with, but I&#x27;m returning it after one use. There are two places on the product page where the dryer is described as ionic. This is not true, at all. The ionic version from Conair actually says &amp;#34;Ion Shine&amp;#34; or something like that on the side of the dryer. My hair is pretty temperamental, and this left me frizzy and puffed up. If you have hair that will actually behave, this might work for you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer for a trip to Italy &amp; it worked perfectly.  It has a switch so I can use it in either the USA or when I travel abroad.  Please note the directions read to only use on low setting when overseas; but the air volumne was still very good &amp; I have thick hair!  You will need an adaptor for it for international travel, but not a convertor.  Overall very good product, lightweight and durable.</li>
            <li> Purchase this hair dryer to use for travel, it folds and is small but has lots of power. Works great</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on European travel hairdryers and this one consistently got high reviews.  I used it in Paris and liked it very much.  It is very strong and dries my thick hair as quickly as the hairdryer I use at home.  It doesn&#x27;t get too hot or get that burning smell that some hairdryers get in Europe.  I recommend buying this one.</li>
            <li> A little bit smaller than my Sharper Image one that has served me well for many years but just died recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully if it lasts as long (more than 5 years) that I would be real please.  Has very similar features as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like:  End cap just unscrew for removing lint and dust.  Cool blast.  Cord slightly shorter (almost 5 feet) which is even better for traveling and packing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislike:  No hair dryer hanger loop like my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reserve one less star for long term durability test.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it&#x27;s nice and compact.  * I have revised my opinion. This hair dryer began to malfunction today after 17 months of light use; about 1-2 times per week/during the summer months hardly at all. The dryer for some reason heats up too high and then turns itself off. I checked the entire hair dryer and there is no lint or hair inside which might have caused this problem.  So, I have reduced and given this hair dryer only 1 star.</li>
            <li> I got this product to take on my trip to Germany. From the product description, I assumed I would have no problem with the voltage. When I plugged this in and turned it on, it worked for about 5 seconds and then burned up. It wasn&#x27;t worth it for me to bring it all the way back to the US and return it, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Compact and great to use!</li>
            <li> Took this to Ireland and it worked perfectly.  Very powerful.</li>
            <li> It broke down the first time I used it in my foreign travel. Could not use it all the time I was abroad and need it badly.</li>
            <li> I had this blow dryer for many years and when it finally died I didn&#x27;t even consider getting a different model. I like this dryer because it&#x27;s extremely lightweight and yet has as much power as a full-size dryer. Much easier to use! The &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button is great for protecting hair from excessive heat damage. I wish it came with some add-on attachments but otherwise it&#x27;s perfect. Great for travel and everyday use.</li>
            <li> So much better than the full size dryer it replaced.  Just as powerful, but easier to use in that it&#x27;s not as heavy.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer and I like the various settings.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but that&#x27;s to be expected with most compact dryers that put out any volume of air.</li>
            <li> The dryer works fine.  But it has this big cumbersome transformer.  There is limited space around the electric outlet in my bathroom.  Trying to plug the dryer in is almost impossible.</li>
            <li> I love this blowdryer. It is light-weight and portable. I love how it folds up for when I travel. It is also super powerful and I can dry my long hair in just 5 - 10 min.</li>
            <li> This compact styler is very lightweight but has plenty of power and levels making for easy styling.  My Mom loves it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a bit smaller and had a retractable cable.  In the end, it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer.  It is nothing fancy, but it does everything I was looking for.  It is powerful enough to dry my hair quickly, as well as lightweight and space-efficient (small bathroom counter).  I like the cool shot feature.  And it was a good value.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations--small, compact, plenty of air, heat etc.  Good for travel since handle retracts and is lightweight for travel.</li>
            <li> It works as I desired, without blowing my hair with a blast.  It is a gentle air for fine hair.</li>
            <li> me gustó mucho el producto y llego a tiempo , según lo acordado y comprado, gracias por el servicio. pilar</li>
            <li> I took this hair dryer to Cuba with me, where they have 110 volts in some hotels and 220 volts in other.  The dryer is about half as heavy as the voltage converter I originally bought for this puprpose, which weighed about a pound and a half.  The dryer worked great at both 140 and 220 volts, and it was light weight and compact, easy to travel with.  My only minor complaint is that it is very hard to switch between the 140 and 220 modes.  My husband had to use a tool of some kind to change the setting.  This could also be a good feature, as if you had it set at 110 when you needed 220, the dryer would burn out and be useless.  You need to read the instructions carefully (I will keep mine rubber banded to the dryer), as you can only use the 220 on the low setting.  However, the low setting on 220 is not that low, so no worries.  But it is helpful to read the instructions before each trip so you know why you can&#x27;t get it to work on high at 220 volts. I&#x27;ll defininately travel with this hair dryer again.</li>
            <li> Great little travel dryer. Works almost as good as a full size one.</li>
            <li> IT HAS GREAT POWER AND WORKED GREAT ON OUR TRAVELS TO EUROPE.</li>
            <li> I just returned from 3 weeks in Italy and France.  This dual voltage hair dryer worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> Ended up being a little TOO powerful.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Replaces the old hair dryer, same brand, and is more powerful.</li>
            <li> Worked great in Germany and the UK.  Just turn the butyon and you are ready for overseas.  Lightweight.  Low setying is powerful.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Worked great in Australia with an adapter.  Enough heat, enough blowing power....has a switch on it to convert between USA electric and Australia/other places that use that current</li>
            <li> Works great. Make sure that you tell your wife to switch it to 220v when you go to Europe BEFORE she turns it on.</li>
            <li> Perfect match to the one that died.</li>
            <li> Small / Compacted and powerful ! Girlfriend really liked !</li>
            <li> Holy cow...maybe it&#x27;s because my old dryer died 6 weeks ago and I haven&#x27;t blow dried since (what can I say?  It&#x27;s hot and I&#x27;m too lazy to fancy up in the summer) but WOW this thing works fast.  It&#x27;s cute, it&#x27;s small, but it packs a punch!</li>
            <li> Good price with decent product. It has a high temp with strong wind and also a lower temp with breeze. It is not that big so I could take it when I am travelling. Also, it works well and won&#x27;t hurt my hair.</li>
            <li> Replacing earlier unit, same model. Found only on Amazon:)</li>
            <li> Item as advertised claims it comes with a &#x27;concentrator&#x27;, which is why I chose this particular dryer.  It did not come with the concentrator.  It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> I gave it for stars because it is noisy. I didn&#x27;t use it very much on my last trip, but it came in handy for drying clothes in a humid climate. It&#x27;s also handy if someone is in the bathroom and you can&#x27;t use the hotel hair dryer. For the price, it&#x27;s worth keeping one in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> A nice hairdryer.  Strong yet more quiet than the previous folding model.  You can dry your hair in a couple of minutes. Convenient for travel yet more durable looking than the older model that I had for many years.</li>
            <li> Sent it back because it was not as compact as I needed for travel. Found a much smaller one at a drugstore.</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer for traveling. Has lots of power</li>
            <li> Enough power and easy to pack/carry.</li>
            <li> Used this for our trip to Europe with no issues.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a universal hair dryer to work in other countries as her current one is 115v only. Because of the wider grounding plug it does not work in China - in any of the standard plugs. Since we did not bring another adapter, it was useless.  Very disappointed!  I feel I was mislead!! If they wish to make a universal product, they need to supply appropriate connections.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for travel but  I am using it regularly at home.  It&#x27;s good weight although it&#x27;s not lighter than my &#x27;regular&#x27; dryer.  I had hoped for a little less weight but I like it anyway.  I also noticed that it is far quieter than my old dryer.  Although not essential, it was good to find something besides black...why are colors so hard to find?  This is definitely a &#x27;thumbs up&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my recent trip to Europe.  The dual voltage made it easy to use while overseas and yet it is very powerful!</li>
            <li> Bought this to take to Italy....it worked out fine but I needed an adapter as usual for a foreign country</li>
            <li> Perfect little hair dryer. Would be better if it had three speeds. Compact and easy to fold and travel.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a Europe trip and back in the States I pack this in my gym bag to get ready at work. Works great on both settings!</li>
            <li> Not so great for styling my short hair.  Air flow a little too strong and opening a bit too wide.  Hair flies all over the place.  Hard to style.</li>
            <li> Great product. I would only suggest that the cord be about six inches longer for ease and comfort.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is just what I wanted!!!  Could not believe the improvements made to hair dryers since I purchased the last one 15 or so years ago.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a trip to Paris. When I tested it at home it had tow speeds but when I used it in the apartment in Paris, after switching the voltage, it only had one speed, high. It worked fine for drying my hair but was too strong to do any &amp;#34;styling.&amp;#34;  The nozzle is wider than what I&#x27;d have liked but if all you&#x27;re interested in is drying your hair or if you use a high speed for styling this is fine.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, dries fast.</li>
            <li> This product worked well on the European power system. I did need a plug adapter, but easily switched from 120 to 240 volts by moving the switch button the the handle. Safer than using a voltage converter with the high wattage of the dryer.</li>
            <li> I thought it was smaller than what it is. It works great but needed for travel.Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for about twelve years now and my sister always uses it when she&#x27;s here, so I got her one for Christmas.  It has so much power for such a compact dryer.  When mine dies, I&#x27;m going to order another one.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this convenient folding hair dryer when my old travel dryer needed to be replaced, and it just may be the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  Of course, the compact size is perfect for travel, but it&#x27;s the power of this little baby that really sealed the deal for me.  Although I&#x27;ve tried other 1875 watt dryers, for some reason, this particular model seems to dry my hair much faster than any of the others, including full-size dryers.  Finally, I&#x27;ve found that when buying a hair dryer, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Conair, as their products provide years and years of use.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> We took this unit to Europe and Ireland and it worked great on 240v with an adapter plug, no transformer needed. Shipped quickly and on time.  Would highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and was initially very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product for less than one year, and it has stopped working properly.  Now, when I use it in warm (not hot) weather, the temperature sensor thinks it is too hot and shuts the hair dryer off.  This happens after about 30 seconds of use on the high setting.  After about 2 minutes, you can audibly hear the temperature sensor reset itself, after which you can use it again for about 30 more seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.  I am having to order another hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.....as it is only used when traveling and hair is short.  Light weight and folds neatly.</li>
            <li> Its lightweight, which I like.  Its just not hot enough on the low setting, which I do not like.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have shopped around for a better hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Have had this product before and had no problems, continues to function.  Light weight and perfect for a person with arthritis and difficulty holding things. Needed a spare, the style may change, I often do not like the new and improved.  Satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Compact, light weight, powerful. Great for short or medium length hair. Excellent for travel.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, although on 230v setting only low heat setting is available. Not a deal breaker though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get real hot other than that works great.</li>
            <li> Simple and functional. Great price. Works well so far....:)</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this dryer, it sucked my long hair into the back of it and knotted it up.  Had to cut the hair off.  Definitely going back, and I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> awesome, small but powerful, great for everyday use or traveling</li>
            <li> This little dryer works well as a travel dryer, especially since it folds. However, as with most small dryers, the noise it makes is pretty horrifying - loud loud loud.</li>
            <li> Great product -- used it overseas and at home!  True that it only operates on high speed when using the higher voltage, but works just fine! Easy to change the voltage with just a coin.</li>
            <li> My old dryer was not putting out any heat. That was why I bought this one. It does not put out as much air as my old one, but it does a good job of drying my hair.</li>
            <li> The dryer is nice and small.  Works great.  It&#x27;s not as quiet as I thought it would be but it&#x27;s still a nice dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for the small suitcase I had to use for a trip to Italy.  It has good power and works well.</li>
            <li> Compact and powerful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this at my local store anymore and I just love it... so glad i found it here and bought this as a backup.  Works well and seems to last a long time. Have had about 4 of them so far over the years ... wouldn&#x27;t use anything else if i can help it.</li>
            <li> The dryer is works fine;  however, I cannot turn the button to change voltage.  I have tried the plug prong and dime as recommended, and a butter knife but it&#x27;s not going to budge.  I&#x27;ll just use is only on the lower setting so as to not burn the dryer out.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair. This hair dryer works amazingly. And it&#x27;s really convenient to bring for travel because of its tiny size. I love it and will absolutely buy again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because it was so small but this baby packs a punch.  My hair is past the halfway point of my back. I have long thick hair and it is ombred (bleached). Sometimes chemically treated hair takes forever to dry but this thing does the job as if it&#x27;s a regular sized hair dryer. Definitely a plus. If it breaks, you&#x27;ll bet I&#x27;ll just buy another without complaint.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve used Conair 1875s for both our primary blow dryer (yes, my wife has long hair) and our travel needs (motorcycle touring means limited luggage space). The dryer produces a high volume of heated air for rapid drying. Its wattage draw is low enough that tripping circuit breakers is never an issue. Durability is good - our&#x27;s usually last at least five years with daily use by two people. The current iteration of this model uses a shorter cord and a bulkier plug/GFI than earlier models. While I prefer the original configuration (longer cord with smaller plug/GFI), the changes have not seriously compromised the product.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t really used a hair dryer in a couple of years, due to a short hair style.  But I&#x27;ve grown it out a bit, and the styling wasn&#x27;t looking right.  My stylist recommended adding a dryer back into my routine.  I don&#x27;t like big, bulky dryers, so I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I remembered why I always used to love compact hair dryers!  The air flow is concentrated, and the heat levels are just right (I have never felt like it&#x27;s burning or like it&#x27;s not hot enough).  The dry time is fast, I manage to dry &amp; style my ear-length hair in 3 minutes or less every single time, with wonderful results.  Most of the time, I don&#x27;t even have to use the flat iron afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the cool shot button, that is a nice feature to have on a compact dryer.  Also, the sound of this dryer is thankfully not shrill like some of the older compacts I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great buy, I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just what we needed for a trip to europe. Works well, completely adequate for medium to long hair. The button from 125-250 can be a bit hard to turn - I suggest using the end of the plug.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is superb. Like that I can dry my hair quickly as it is quite powerful. Also like the folding handle. It is made for a woman&#x27;s hand; easy to hold and handle.</li>
            <li> Small but has good power. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Just the right size and power for travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because it&#x27;s dual voltage and I needed something for a trip to Italy.  It worked wonderfully in Europe.  And it&#x27;s working great at home too.  Nice and powerful.</li>
            <li> We purchased the black travel model while we were traveling because our old Conair went on the blink. Had to get it from Target. It works great - pleased with the feel, dual voltage for travel, etc. Like the button that allows you to control the cooling on the high fan setting. Powerful blower in that little motor. However, after we ordered what we thought was the same through Amazon, it turned out that the color is not the only thing different on this unit from the black one by Conair. This unit is louder and feels cheeper. I recommend the black unit that looks identical to this one except that the cooling button is on the back side of the unit. The only number I could find on the black unit was D167S - that may be an older version of the Conair &amp;#34;Folding Handle&amp;#34; dryer on the Conair website - Model: 124TL. It&#x27;s available at Amazon for only $13.65 at the time of this review.</li>
            <li> Compact size perfect for traveling and powerful enough to do its job. I am very pleased with it and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Item is as described. But 250V function has only one heat level. So, do not consider buying it because you will permanently go abroad or you will give it as a gift to some friend abroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I think it is too big for travel. All of the hotels have hair dryer you know.</li>
            <li> My old one broke down after only about 20 years of hard work. I got a new one and was pleased to find the design was the same. Why get off a winner. Works well and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Excellent hairdryer, folds up nicely, haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to test it on 240V yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do just fine. Turning the dial on the handle locks you out of putting it on the high setting whenever you&#x27;re using it with 240V, which is a really user-friendly addition. (You&#x27;re not suppose to use it on high with 240V according to the manual.)</li>
            <li> This will be great for travel, as long as I&#x27;m not worried about being quiet.  I really like the size, the folding handle, it is very light weight and the power is good.  However, it is much noisier than expected.</li>
            <li> Super for Germany and US.  Just be sure to switch the voltage with a screwdriver and only use on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting in Europe (will work like &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; in U.S.).</li>
            <li> This was used to replace a much larger, bulky hair dryer, and it works quite well.  No criticism or complaints.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer to replace a different hair dryer that had fallen apart but was small,and perfect for traveling. This hair dryer was bigger than I had expected. Also, the plug was so big that it didn&#x27;t fit into the space above my bathroom counter.  It worked well but was too big.  Had to return it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in an open box. The cord was pushed into the box. Looked as if it had been returned. But it arrived quickly and it works. Small easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for a trip to China. It broke on the third use. I brought it back to return. But because I was away for over a month, the return window expired. Not pleased with this product and the short return window. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> It is compact size but not small enough for travel. But I use it in my room which is ok for me. It is powerful and can dry my short hair in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Light weight and small and great power...very pleased with this little dryer.  Bought it for travel but may end up using for every day.</li>
            <li> The raving reviews about this hair dryer are all correct: it dries hair faster! its sound isn&#x27;t as obnoxious as others! it&#x27;s small! compact! cute! However, it only lasted about 10 months. We used it almost every day, or at least every other day, to dry my 3-year-old&#x27;s hair. Typically we used the low setting, and occasionally the high setting. The \\&quot;cool air\\&quot; button was great, too, but we rarely used it. It died suddenly, with no warning sign, after about 9-10 months. DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> This small Conair 1875 will always be my favorite hair dryer. It is compact and easy to handle. I hope they never quit making this model.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer. Purchased it for a trip abroad but my gym dryer &amp;#34;died&amp;#34; last week so started using this one and even though it is more compact, it dries my hair quickly. The dual voltage is a plus. Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for travel and it is perfect.  Plenty of power and folds up&lt;br /&gt;For easy packing.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, compact and powerful. Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works fine.  I bought it for a trip to Europe but the hotels and apartment we stayed in actually had very good hair dryers so I didn&#x27;t need it after all.  But I&#x27;m glad I have it for when I go to Europe again and there isn&#x27;t a hair dryer available.  It&#x27;s very light and compact and fit into the suitcase nicely.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good product.</li>
            <li> works as good as my large one</li>
            <li> powerful and small enough to travel with</li>
            <li> I purchased this travel dryer to insure ability to use in France. It is light and small and travels well, however it only has one heat setting and one fan speed, (high). I have short hair and need 2 heat settings and prefer a fast, medium, slow speed on the fan.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip to Europe because it has the dual voltage, is folding and lightweight, and has one of my favorite features, the cool shot button. Worked exactly as I expected. No, as others have said, you can&#x27;t use the low setting in Europe, but I don&#x27;t use it anyway (I blow dry on high and then blow out/smooth with the cool shot). And no, it&#x27;s obviously not a high-end brand, but it&#x27;s a lot of bang for your buck. I bought a cheap continental Europe adapter (no voltage changer needed) and it worked perfectly. I&#x27;ll continue to use this one for travel over my heavier regular dryer.</li>
            <li> Perfect for international travel. Works perfectly</li>
            <li> Worked well in Turkey.</li>
            <li> very good! light and very little noise, dual voltage dries your hair soon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend and it arrived immediately - nice compact - perfect for travel - went on a month long vacation  - 3rd day on vacation she plugged it in and it sizzled  - and died ---- was not going to carry to around Europe dead for a month and bring it back - just to mail it to Amazon. - I will be shocked if I get anything back.</li>
            <li> great product and seller AAA</li>
            <li> Took this hair dryer to France, was a little skeptical, but with an adapter, it was wonderful.  Very lightweight, when voltage was changed and it was used on the low setting it had plenty of ability to dry my thick hair.  Would highly recommend this to travelers.</li>
            <li> Will be perfect for Greece.  Just change setting to 220/250 and plug in to adapter.</li>
            <li> I used to have a similar one of these that I used for MANY years.  It was still working the day I replaced it with this new one.</li>
            <li> Makes drying my hair very simple and the cool jet sets the curls quickly and well.  Light enough to make blow drying easy on the shoulder and arm.  Dual voltage will make this a must pack on my next trip to Europe.</li>
            <li> I had a Conair hair dryer that gave out finally due to usage and age.&lt;br /&gt;This one was powerful enough but since I have thick shoulder length&lt;br /&gt;hair, it takes longer to dry and the Conair automatically shut down.&lt;br /&gt;I had to wait until it cooled down to be able to turn it on again.  I sent&lt;br /&gt;it back because I do not have time to waste until the hair dryer could&lt;br /&gt;operate again.  Handy size, but too many minuses.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my new hair dryer.  It works wonderfully, is very light for travel, and has a fold up handle, making it very easy to pack.</li>
            <li> very nice very powerful and I like the folding handle. dries my hair in no time!</li>
            <li> Love it, was just what I was looking for. So lightweight but powerful.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer and very reasonably priced! I bought this for my elderly mother.  Her hand held dryer had ceased working so this little dryer was the ticket! It is lightweight, small &amp; easy to store, easy to use and it blows warm and cool air to dry my mother&#x27;s hair! The most important part....she likes it, so what&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair dryer to replace the same model that I had purchased several years ago.  My old product still worked, but had gotten worn and dirty looking, even though I had cleaned it.  I am very disappointed in the replacement model. The plug on the new model is much larger and heavier than the old plug.  It will not stay firmly in the outlet and is prone to falling out.  It works a little better if I plug it into the upper outlet, but I have to keep my curling iron plugged into that one because the plug covers the lower outlet.  If I put the plug into the lower outlet there is too much space between the plug and the outlet cover near the bottom of the plug, making the plug unwieldly and even more prone to falling out of the socket than when it is plugged into the upper socket.  I actually had to build up the lower part of the plug with foam board and cover it with tape to fill in that space.  There is only one outlet in the room, so I don&#x27;t have an optional outlet for each appliance.&lt;br /&gt;An additional but important problem with the plug is that it is 8 1/2\\&quot; shorter than the old plug, which is a big difference!  It really cuts down on the reach cabability of the dryer, making the plug even more unstable.  I would have given the product top star rating if it had a plug like my old model.  I can&#x27;t return the item because I cut off the warning labels (which I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to do, but I know the safety hazards and don&#x27;t have any children around to worry about).  Other than the plug problem, the dryer works well, is fairly quiet, and folds for easy packing and less space used in a drawer, which is the main reason I liked my original dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why they changed the plug.  I really wish that when manufacturers have a good product that it is just left alone, or at least checked to be sure that the specifications and qualties are the same in every product. Luckily, I still have my old model to use (worn looking as it is), and will pack the new model away for emergency use in case the old one stops working.</li>
            <li> it works, it&#x27;s hot and will fold up just like advertised</li>
            <li> just what we wanted. size is great and very compact.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hair dryer.  It works.  I just wish that the electrical plug wasn&#x27;t so huge, or at the very least, that it was reversible (you can&#x27;t plug it in upside down, limiting which socket you can use for it).  It&#x27;d also be nice if they included some sort of cable management component - even just a velcro tie for when through with it would&#x27;ve been nice.  For the price, though, I can&#x27;t complain too much, it works.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a dual voltage and a travel edition as well.  With no plug in within the bathroom, it had very limited use.</li>
            <li> Quick drying of hair without making it brittle.  Gave my hair quite a bit of volume as well which was a plus!</li>
            <li> works great! especially for travel</li>
            <li> nice and light - but has two speeds - high and low - hard for styling</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly in our trip to Spain, France and Italy!</li>
            <li> Awesome blow drying - easy to clean which will prolong it&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> Great for travel or Home. Lightweight, compact w/ plenty of power to dry hair&lt;br /&gt;Quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer because it was dual voltage, and I wished to use it in both the United Kingdom and France.  It has an American plug, but with a convertor for each country it worked wonderfully!  I could not be happier with this purchase.  Turns out we went to Italy too, and with the same French convertor, the dryer worked in Italy too.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer. Light &amp; Easy to pack. I used it in Belgium and France with no problems.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little hair dryer. I bought it two weeks ago after reading the reviews and absolutely all the positive reviews about it are true. I love the power it throws out. It is quick and nice in doing its business. It is a little noisy but I guess that is something which I felt in my previous dryers from other brands too. A point to note however is that though the product description indicates \\&quot;...and removable concentrator make this a versatile styler...\\&quot;, there is no concentrator that I received in my package. So if you are looking for a hair dryer with a diffuser or concentrator, then this product does not come with one and you may need to search and buy one separately.</li>
            <li> Gets my hair dry. Folds up neatly. But it didn&#x27;t do anything extra special to my hair. It&#x27;s a hair dryer...and it dried my hair. It gets the job done n fits in my luggage. So it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Light weight.  Easy to use. Easy to pack.</li>
            <li> I have had a few Conair hair dryers, but this one with the folding handle really saves space in my bag!</li>
            <li> Compact yet powerful. Easy to pack and travel with. Excellent value for the price. Much better blow dryers are available, but for the price this more than satisfied my needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe this fair dryer really gas 1875 watts. It doesn&#x27;t get hot at all you can hold it directly towards your scalp and it&#x27;s only warm. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great dryer for Europe!  Light weight and powerful even on low setting</li>
            <li> I was tired of dealing with a large blow dryer on a daily basis, and wanted one that was small enough to fold and pack for a trip.  This blow dryer is powerful and dries my hair in less than five minutes.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Barely warm on either speed. It took me way too long to dry my very short, thin hair. Perhaps it&#x27;s defective and stuck on \\&quot;Cool\\&quot; mode. I&#x27;m returning this one and will try a replacement. Hopefully, I got the one lemon in the batch. Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s easy, free return policy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a trip to France.  It was compact and lightweight which is a plus for traveling.  It also worked great.  Even though you have to use it on low speed on the 220 volt setting, it is as powerful as the high setting on 110 volts.  Be sure to follow the instructions for overseas use.</li>
            <li> Not as good as one with the tip piece.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a blowdryer to go in my travel bag, it fit, but better yet works well.</li>
            <li> Good power and very lightweight.  I like the folding handle because it travels well. A winner!</li>
