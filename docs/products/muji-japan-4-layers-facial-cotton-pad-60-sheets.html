            <li>Excellent quality cotton however the layers in the top sections are sticking to one another and fraying.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best cotton at the best price I have found for my atomizer builds.  </li>

            <li>Love this cotton pads!</li>
            <li>IT IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>My favorite for wicking RBAs.</li>
            <li>I still love them.  </li>
            <li>No terrible burnt cotton taste.</li>
            <li>would be even better if amazon did not charge for shipping.</li>
            <li>Better than organic cotton and cellucotton and easier to work with.</li>
            <li>I believe I&#x27;ll be able to get 10-12 wicks per pad out of these</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great wicking for e-cigs.</li>
            <li>but after that works better than anything I have found</li>
            <li>The best facial cotton pad on the market.</li>
            <li>It is okay quality.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Even those not sticking to one another are frayed much more than any</li>
            <li>Better than &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The flavor is so much better than organic cotton balls.  </li>
            <li>A lot better than organic cotton for use in rebuild able atomizers</li>
            <li>but the women love them for there face....</li>
            <li>Most makeup stores don&#x27;t sell anything that compares.</li>
            <li>Taste is very clean.</li>
            <li>Pretty good cotton for wicking.</li>
            <li>Very much worth it!!</li>
            <li>I break up one into 4 sheets (happens easy) and soak each sheet in Bioderma H20 and leave one on each eye</li>
            <li>They responded very quickly letting me know that these were indeed chemically treated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Based on the information I received from the manufacture I would strongly suggest not doing this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A full pad would be soft and absorbent and would  make a great compress.  </li>
            <li>Clean, neutral flavor, easy to work with, and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>They are great for Japanese Lotion masks (look it up).  </li>
            <li>Clean taste and very quick to wick.</li>
            <li>Works great in my Thundercloud RDA with a simple 5-wrap coil.</li>
            <li>far as wicking ability, it seems to be as good as the KGD brand in that respect.  </li>
            <li>Organic and clean.</li>
            <li>It is amazing, but it really bears heeding: boil it first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard Japanese cotton was superior to organic and didn&#x27;t realize how true that was until I got this.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, much cheaper (and more available) than Koh Gen Do cotton.</li>
            <li>may be great for other uses however.</li>
            <li>Clean flavor from the first hit and holds the load of juice.  </li>
            <li>So easy to work with to make new wicks!</li>
            <li>I soak one with hada labo lotion and water and break them into 4 sheets, which you stretch them to fit over the whole face.</li>
            <li>deliver is good and fast, like the product, will buy again in the future</li>
            <li>It is by FAR better than organic cotton or silica.</li>
            <li>Compared to the Shiseido pads, Shiseido wins over Muji each time.</li>
            <li>Work better then anything I have found so far for vaping.</li>
            <li>Very soft and easy to use</li>
            <li>I really like the layers, its super convenient.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how they are layered together and find they are too large absorbing way too much product compared to the smaller size which I can control more easily.</li>
            <li>Straight out of Japan!</li>
            <li>even this is the first time using it.</li>
            <li>, there is cotton taste for the first 1-2 ml of juice.</li>
            <li>A bit earthy the first couple hits</li>
            <li>The smaller sized ones perform much better tho</li>
            <li>Wicks excellent, easy to work with, one package should last just shy of forever.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>* brand puffs, which give you 5 layers, are much larger, and so easy to peel apart.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still a good quantity and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>short, if you&#x27;re using these for makeup removal, they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>For the purpose I bought these for I can&#x27;t read them very high.</li>
            <li>VERY recommended.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>cotton balls, and much easier, convenient to make wicks out of.  </li>
            <li>Shipping is much faster than it states.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to work with and you can get 5+ wicks out of a single pad.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as easy to form into a needle point as cotton balls to thread through coils, but that is the only con I have so far.  </li>
            <li>Solution was to trim the insertion end with scissors into a pointy shape in order to get it through far enough to pull the remainder, which makes the process stupendously easy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>When I am done the sheet is dry and full of make up not product.</li>
            <li>very soft.</li>
            <li>:) these will of course work with other essentials such as skincare and what not.</li>
            <li>It is not raw and was bleached.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Much better than conventional cotton pads!!!</li>
            <li>What I love is that each layer is paper thin but large and holds a lot of product (but doesn&#x27;t soak it up) .  </li>
            <li>This is very nice cotton pads, but the price is way more expensive than the original price, it is very unfair.</li>
            <li>I use the shiseido cotton pads, as they are so soft and hold a lot of product.</li>
            <li>The product is not wasted and goes on the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also MUCH whiter then organic cotton, indicating that it likely has been bleached.</li>
            <li>Amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usability , the pad is made of thin sheets which are held together by some kind of glueing operation.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>They seem to be good quality cotton pads unfortunately they are chemically treated and therefore should not be used for wicking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, the dry hit on this stuff is much milder then normal organic</li>
            <li>The 4 layers are very easy to separate and each layer is not too thin.</li>
            <li>they are to be out of the same high quality cotton  </li>
            <li>Better IMO than the expensive small packs of Japanese Cotton you get in most Vape shops...</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no ordor coming from the whole package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, and I use it as facial mask</li>
            <li>I can not detect any of the &amp;#34;organic impurities&amp;#34; that are apparent with the KGD brand.  </li>
            <li>it is kind of expensive.. and because of that - I might not repurchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft but will waste much toning lotion.</li>
            <li>Other vape reviews were promising.</li>
            <li>No dry hits at all on a .8 nano in a Kayfun Lite at 20 watts.</li>
            <li>Maybe because of the increased wicking action, I find it needs to be changed more frequently than cotton balls to keep the flavor at its best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More expensive than cotton balls, but the amount you get and how little it takes to make a wick, this bag will outlast me.</li>

            <li> it in a Russian 91% and had 0 dry hits</li>
            <li> a little work to round them up in a wick but not impossible.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue my quest for a decent pad but in the meanwhile this should do the job and keep me off cigarettes.</li>
            <li> These have replaced the standard round ones from the drug store to remove my eye makeup.</li>

            <li> Amazing product for my dripper! Clean flavor from the first hit and holds the load of juice.  So easy to work with to make new wicks! Just peel, cut, roll, and install! This is by far the best cotton at the best price I have found for my atomizer builds.  Straight out of Japan! Woot!</li>
            <li> The package came open.</li>
            <li> good for vaping! :) these will of course work with other essentials such as skincare and what not.</li>
            <li> Love this cotton pads! They are great for rda&#x27;s, leaves a great flavor, i will never use cotton balls ever again. I seperate one sheet until you see the cotton between the sheet which gives you two sheets. They awesome!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for wicking my vape stuff</li>
            <li> My favorite for wicking RBAs. Clean, neutral flavor, easy to work with, and the price is fantastic. Better IMO than the expensive small packs of Japanese Cotton you get in most Vape shops...</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy to use</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin and hate to use anything abrasive or that leaves bits of cotton on my face.  I use the shiseido cotton pads, as they are so soft and hold a lot of product. I still love them.  But then I saw these and they are a different idea. Think of 4 larger paper thin layers held together . They are are not as soft as the shiseido, but  larger  and break  apart into 4 thin layers.  A full pad would be soft and absorbent and would  make a great compress.  However, I always break them up into layers.  What I love is that each layer is paper thin but large and holds a lot of product (but doesn&#x27;t soak it up) .  The product is not wasted and goes on the skin.  I use them to take off my makeup. I break up one into 4 sheets (happens easy) and soak each sheet in Bioderma H20 and leave one on each eye togently soak off my eye makeup. When I am done the sheet is dry and full of make up not product. The other two sheets, I use to remove the rest of my makeup.  I feel using one of these is less wasteful than 3 or 4 thicker pads.  They are great for Japanese Lotion masks (look it up).  I soak one with hada labo lotion and water and break them into 4 sheets, which you stretch them to fit over the whole face. You maybe need 5 sheets, but you can save the left over ones. You leave it on for 10 minutes.  This is how they are used in Japan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for some time now and I find them to be the best value for its purpose. They aren&#x27;t made out of the softest material but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> deliver is good and fast, like the product, will buy again in the future even this is the first time using it.</li>
            <li> This is very nice cotton pads, but the price is way more expensive than the original price, it is very unfair. I only found this out after I purchased this one.</li>
            <li> The 4 layers are very easy to separate and each layer is not too thin. Overall, it is a satisfatory purchase.</li>
            <li> Works very well for intended purpose, and terribly for vaping! Taste was awful.</li>
            <li> I ordered some to try as wick material in my ecig. This stuff blows away any wicking material imaginable. It is by FAR better than organic cotton or silica. Dry hits only lack flavor. No terrible burnt cotton taste. It is easy to work with and you can get 5+ wicks out of a single pad.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these hoping to use them for Lotion Masks (japanese skincare technique by Chizu Saeki), but they are too small and puny. Peeling them apart is difficult as they are compressed on the edges, so you have to use a tiny bit more effort when separating into layers--and you only get 4 layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;re using these for makeup removal, they&#x27;re fine. Compared to the Shiseido pads, Shiseido wins over Muji each time. But BOTH Muji and Shiseido are terrible for lotion masks.  If you need pads for lotion masks, get *[[ASIN:B00260T94K SELENA Multi-Layer Cotton Puff, 80 Count]]* brand puffs, which give you 5 layers, are much larger, and so easy to peel apart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft but will waste much toning lotion.</li>
            <li> Pretty good cotton for wicking. It is not raw and was bleached.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good wicking , probably best I had to date.&lt;br /&gt;Using it in a Russian 91% and had 0 dry hits but I do swap it every 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;Taste once it breakes in taste is very good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons :&lt;br /&gt;Taste , there is cotton taste for the first 1-2 ml of juice. Not really strong but still there.&lt;br /&gt;Usability , the pad is made of thin sheets which are held together by some kind of glueing operation.&lt;br /&gt;You can remove the glued region but the rest of the pad will come out in thin sheets .&lt;br /&gt;Takes a little work to round them up in a wick but not impossible.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue my quest for a decent pad but in the meanwhile this should do the job and keep me off cigarettes.</li>
            <li> This stuff wicks with ease and soaks up some juice. It chucks the clouds and handles the flavor, I&#x27;m really impressed. I&#x27;ve used organic cotton balls, rayon, silica in the past, but I&#x27;m sticking with Muji.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! would be even better if amazon did not charge for shipping.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, much cheaper (and more available) than Koh Gen Do cotton. Multi-layered makes it easier to get the thickness needed. Organic and clean.</li>
            <li> No cotton taste, wicks great. Use for vaping in my RBA&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Using this for an ecig wick material. IT IS AMAZING. Better than organic cotton and cellucotton and easier to work with. VERY recommended.</li>
            <li> great stuff for wicking&lt;br /&gt;Vape on!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as wicking material for my RBAs. I&#x27;d heard Japanese cotton was superior to organic and didn&#x27;t realize how true that was until I got this. I believe I&#x27;ll be able to get 10-12 wicks per pad out of these so while this is more expensive than the organic cotton balls it&#x27;s still a good quantity and will last a long time. I still notice a bit of &#x27;cottony&#x27; taste when I fill my tank after rebuilding but it goes away a lot faster than with organic cotton. Also, this stuff wicks like a beast. No dry hits at all on a .8 nano in a Kayfun Lite at 20 watts. It can keep up all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff indeed.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try Koh Gen Do but it was out of stock. This was a little cheaper anyway. Figured I would give these a shot for my vape gear. Other vape reviews were promising. I must say, these work well. They aren&#x27;t as easy to form into a needle point as cotton balls to thread through coils, but that is the only con I have so far.  Taste is very clean. There is absolutely no ordor coming from the whole package. I cut one lengthwise strip on one edge, then separated the layers approximately in half. I figure I can get  8-10 coil builds from each pad. Putting the unused portion of the pads back in the package is easier than trying to save left over cotton balls. Regarding rolling the cotton into a needle tip to get through the coil: I struggled to do this and doing so made the cotton ultra dense, and still wouldn&#x27;t go through the coil. Solution was to trim the insertion end with scissors into a pointy shape in order to get it through far enough to pull the remainder, which makes the process stupendously easy.</li>
            <li> Too expensive! It should be cheaper.</li>
            <li> Work better then anything I have found so far for vaping. Clean taste and very quick to wick. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great wicking for e-cigs. A bit earthy the first couple hits but after that works better than anything I have found</li>
            <li> Not like other asain cotton, has strange flavor, its not as fluffy as others i have tried.  Will not be using this as a wicking maerial....wife can use it in her make-up but wont be rebuilding with this</li>
            <li> This is the BEST cotton for rebuilding your coils. Beats organic cotton and I am never going back.</li>
            <li> stated organic,was not, the worst cotton pads ever rubbish,rubbish,do not purchase if you want to use as e-cig wicks,and as they are written in japanese you have no clue as to what is in it,the only saving grace was they arrived quickly and i wish they had never turned up.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot.. You can peel the layers off and use as much or as little as you&#x27;d like.  I use these to get my eye makeup off and also to apply toner.  Very nice product, but it is kind of expensive.. and because of that - I might not repurchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, and I use it as facial mask</li>
            <li> The best facial cotton pad on the market. Perfect size, absorb liquid well and release it well.</li>
            <li> The project came on time, but when I got it, the package was broken. The cotton pads were all dusty because of the broken package. I cannot use it for my face. I didn&#x27;t bother to run to post office to just make such small return. It was a disappointment tho.</li>
            <li> It is okay quality. I won&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> For the purpose I bought these for I can&#x27;t read them very high. They seem to be good quality cotton pads unfortunately they are chemically treated and therefore should not be used for wicking.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the manufacture to inquire if these were truly organic, unbleached and untreated pads. They responded very quickly letting me know that these were indeed chemically treated.&lt;br /&gt;I know other reviewer&#x27;s have suggested using these for a wicking material. Based on the information I received from the manufacture I would strongly suggest not doing this.&lt;br /&gt;They may be great for other uses however.</li>
            <li> Good product, excellent seller. I recommend to everyone. Kiváló és előzékeny kereskedő, ajánlom mindenkinek. A termék gyorsan érkezett, az ecigihez kanócnak perfekt.Thanks</li>
            <li> Vape wicking is not good, took me over 2 days, and 6 batteries trying to get rid of the horrible cotton flavor before giving up and going to a organic cotton.  However, the dry hit on this stuff is much milder then normal organic cotton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also MUCH whiter then organic cotton, indicating that it likely has been bleached.</li>
            <li> Love them. Much better than conventional cotton pads!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality cotton however the layers in the top sections are sticking to one another and fraying. Even those not sticking to one another are frayed much more than any I have purchased previously. A few  aren&#x27;t holding up well to the toner I use them for skincare  The smaller sized ones perform much better tho they are to be out of the same high quality cotton  I will not repurchase these are I don&#x27;t like how they are layered together and find they are too large absorbing way too much product compared to the smaller size which I can control more easily.</li>
            <li> Used for wick in e cig and it works great! Much better flavor than organic cotton!! Can get 6 wicks out of 1 sheet and 60 sheets come in a bag so thats 360 wicks per bag! Very much worth it!!</li>
            <li> Works great in my Thundercloud RDA with a simple 5-wrap coil.</li>
            <li> This cotton is reported to be treated with pesticides and is not organic. It is amazing, but it really bears heeding: boil it first. Vaper beware!</li>
            <li> Out of Koh gen do, so figured I would try this.  Vape vendors are scalping on koh gen do prices due to everyone being out (asking from $1 to $5 per pad.  I am making a note of these vendors and will not buy from them again because of this behavior).  The Japanese company site is now limiting it to two purchases per customer to try to prevent the price scalping.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to wick the same as the KGD brand.  It does look bleached to me.  I can not detect any of the &amp;#34;organic impurities&amp;#34; that are apparent with the KGD brand.  Maybe my eyesight is just not good enough.  I do not know that these are processed, but it looks like it to me.  I could not find that information on their website.  If anyone knows, please write a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as wicking ability, it seems to be as good as the KGD brand in that respect.  Better than &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; cotton balls, and much easier, convenient to make wicks out of.  For me, I also don&#x27;t taste that initial &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; taste that I get with ordinary cotton balls.  It does wick best if the fibers are aligned in the direction of the wicking desired.  Maybe because of the increased wicking action, I find it needs to be changed more frequently than cotton balls to keep the flavor at its best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More expensive than cotton balls, but the amount you get and how little it takes to make a wick, this bag will outlast me.</li>
            <li> very soft. My face doesn&#x27;t feel pain and get blush after I use it.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s meant for cosmetics but I use these as wicks in my vaping rig. Wicks excellent, easy to work with, one package should last just shy of forever.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. This is the best wicking material for my RDAs I have found. If you are a vaper that built the own RDA, stop what you are doing and buy this!!!!</li>
            <li> Love ordering from Amazon. Good product.</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely and just as described.</li>
            <li> Product works just like it&#x27;s advertised. Wicks great in my Kayfun lite plus.  The flavor is so much better than organic cotton balls.  Shipping is much faster than it states.  Only took 9 days to get to California.</li>
            <li> A lot better than organic cotton for use in rebuild able atomizers</li>
            <li> Amazingly soft. These have replaced the standard round ones from the drug store to remove my eye makeup. I really like the layers, its super convenient.</li>
            <li> bleached not for vaping....but the women love them for there face....great gift</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and she loves them. Most makeup stores don&#x27;t sell anything that compares.</li>
