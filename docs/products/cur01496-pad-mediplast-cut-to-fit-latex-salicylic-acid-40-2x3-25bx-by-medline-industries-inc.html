            <li>so you don&#x27;t kill healthy skin!!!</li>
            <li>Kills good skin and reduces callouses, but doesn&#x27;t faze the warts!</li>
            <li>but what I did worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>but it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Its a good product recomended by my dermatologis.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our dermatologist recommended this product to eliminate plantars warts which it did effectively and pain-free.  </li>
            <li>works good for the most of the time.</li>
            <li>As far as over-the-counter salicylic acid pads go, these are the best.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t happy to see that the product&#x27;s expiration date is in 6 months (I&#x27;ll never be able to use them up that quickly).</li>
            <li>so it stays on better.</li>
            <li>100 time better than dr scholls version and</li>
            <li>Love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>Way better, and way cheaper, than DR.</li>
            <li>Using for more than a year on dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked great</li>

            <li>Purchasing this product makes it easy to take care of it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Adhesive is strong</li>
            <li>This is doing the trick but it should be taken seriously as STRONG meds.</li>
            <li>Excellent delivery, within a few days of order.  </li>
            <li>this is the only product that successfully removed warts!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for those stubborn warts.</li>

            <li>Sure glad they are individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>40% is as strong as you can get OTC, and at 50% more expensive than a weeks worth it is a great value.</li>
            <li>Requires to be cut but worth it.</li>
            <li>Still a good deal compared to what my local drugstore offers for wart removal.</li>
            <li>Love this: especially the cut-to-fit pads.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to only cover the wart</li>
            <li>Pads worked really well to get rid of my large area of Planters Wart on the bottom of my foot.</li>

            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I bought for my son&#x27;s warts, but it works very well on callouses on my foot.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>At that point, after showers, changing socks and sleeping etc, the dressing was really ready to come off.  </li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>I find it nice for flat stubborn warts on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered, easy to cut to make smaller to cover the tiny wart on my sons arm.</li>
            <li>course, you&#x27;re buying more than you could ever use: one pad is enough for a 1-month treatment, and you get ten.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it for the hard/calloused areas on your feet.  </li>
            <li>You can cut to fit and use as much or as little as you want.</li>
            <li>Over the medi latex, I placed another soft piece of sticky fabric.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good product.  It takes a long time to remove plantar warts from the soles of one&#x27;s feet.  Months of daily use.  Well priced product.  Not sold over the counter at my local  national chain drugstores.  Excellent delivery, within a few days of order.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommended this product to eliminate plantars warts which it did effectively and pain-free.  The price/performance beat the procedures offered in the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Had a big wart on the bottom of my foot for years. Tried everything. Nothing worked. Went to doctor for a solution. He told me about Mediplast. Had never heard of it before. It works. Love this: especially the cut-to-fit pads. Will recommend it to anyone and everyone unable to get rid of plantar warts.</li>
            <li> Very cost effective compared to the little dots sold. Requires to be cut but worth it. Product works well being 40%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adhesive is strong</li>
            <li> This is doing the trick but it should be taken seriously as STRONG meds. I bought for 3 little warts (all between toes), and the whole box is a ridiculous amount if product but I couldn&#x27;t find them locally or by the sheet. Still a good deal compared to what my local drugstore offers for wart removal. I do advice getting bandaids to cover the tiny piece you trim for the wart so it stays on better. Also, be sure to only cover the wart so you don&#x27;t kill healthy skin!!!</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  A little hard to peel off.</li>
            <li> Pads worked really well to get rid of my large area of Planters Wart on the bottom of my foot.</li>
            <li> 40%salyicitic acid recommend by dermtologist. Can cut to any size you want. I find it nice for flat stubborn warts on the back of my hand. Very sticky so most of the time no need to cover with tape. 100 time better than dr scholls version and much less expensive. Checked three different drug store, but none carried it. Could only find on line</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered, easy to cut to make smaller to cover the tiny wart on my sons arm.</li>
            <li> I bought for my son&#x27;s warts, but it works very well on callouses on my foot.  Love, love this product.  Sure glad they are individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> I did what it needed to do and it is something I would use again if the same problem happens again.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  I tried the Dr Scholls pads several years ago but for some reason it did not do the job.  I have a callus on my right foot that can get painful if I don&#x27;t tend to it regularly.  Purchasing this product makes it easy to take care of it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not sure of the correct way to use the product but what I did worked beautifully.  After a pedicure, I cut a piece to size and placed it on the callous.  Over the medi latex, I placed another soft piece of sticky fabric.  I left it on for 3 days.  At that point, after showers, changing socks and sleeping etc, the dressing was really ready to come off.  It had come off once during the night.  I tried to cut some of the callous off but did not get it all.  I left it alone and within a week, the remainder was peeling off. I believe if I had done back to back treatments as directed, my callous would be totally removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works very well and I highly recommend it for the hard/calloused areas on your feet.  The trick is to cover it with the correct bandage or fabric so that it does not come off while you do regular things during the day &amp; night.</li>
            <li> works good for the most of the time. A little hard to tear off without a scissors but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> As far as over-the-counter salicylic acid pads go, these are the best.  You can cut to fit and use as much or as little as you want. This will end up saving you money instead of purchasing the little precut pads from other manufacturers.  This is also what one of my doctors used for my.</li>
            <li> Trying to get read of some persistent warts on my fingers nothing in stores helped. Trying this as a last resort. So far it has worked great</li>
            <li> Way better, and way cheaper, than DR. Scholl&#x27;s &amp;#34;not nearly big enough&amp;#34; little pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you&#x27;re buying more than you could ever use: one pad is enough for a 1-month treatment, and you get ten.</li>
            <li> Using for more than a year on dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation. Kills good skin and reduces callouses, but doesn&#x27;t faze the warts!</li>
            <li> Its a good product recomended by my dermatologis.&lt;br /&gt;If your wart is serious it wont be enought treatment (getting nitroget too).&lt;br /&gt;The 25 sheets will last you a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Been using it for over a month now. Not really working. If it was me I&#x27;d just bur them off. But the warts or on my grandson.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find the right kind of tape to use to hold the medicated pad in place.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;d tried everything from W-40 to duck tape...this is the only product that successfully removed warts!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for those stubborn warts.</li>
            <li> I received my box of Mediplast strips.  Wasn&#x27;t happy to see that the product&#x27;s expiration date is in 6 months (I&#x27;ll never be able to use them up that quickly).</li>
            <li> I will never run out of salicylate pads now. 40% is as strong as you can get OTC, and at 50% more expensive than a weeks worth it is a great value.</li>
