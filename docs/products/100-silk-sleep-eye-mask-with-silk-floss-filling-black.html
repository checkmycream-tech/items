    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best eye mask I have ever had.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent, well-designed product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars, because he says it works perfectly</li>
            <li>this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a great mask.  </li>
            <li>someone told me silk masks were great.</li>
            <li>I love sleeping with them, great for traveling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>good point is that it&#x27;s nice that the strap is covered in silk fabric and does not have any velcro on it</li>
            <li>I love this eye mask!</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s still the best mask I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I bought several eyemasks and liked this one the best.</li>
            <li>The silk breathes, so it doesn&#x27;t get hot, or cause skin irritation... the silk filling is especially important here.  </li>
            <li>Is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many many sleep masks, cotton, bamboo, and mystery fabrics.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered THREE MORE today.  </li>
            <li>I use each mask for many months before it stretches &amp;</li>
            <li>I LOVE this eye mask.</li>
            <li>It still stays on all night though, and I just love the mask.</li>
            <li>This product is magic.  </li>
            <li>I have bought more than one of these.</li>
            <li>and I love how it&#x27;s silk</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s elastic covered in silk) taut over and over again, hoping it would loosen the elastic and it would stretch to a better size, but that didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one I ordered fit great.  </li>
            <li>it blocks the light 100% and it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is THE MOST COMFORTABLE SLEEP MASK that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>i love that the elastic is covered in silk, and that it is filled w/ silk.    </li>
            <li>So if they love the mask and find it extremely comfortable, anyone should.</li>
            <li>I love this product, its light on my eyes</li>
            <li>By itself, it would not stay on for me, but I use this underneath a wide Prana head band (cotton), and that way it works perfectly and, bonus, holds in my earplugs.</li>
            <li>Many blindfolds do this, of course, but they&#x27;re not as comfortable as this one.</li>
            <li>Nice large size</li>
            <li>It works well in blocking out the light.</li>
            <li>Worth the money for sure.  </li>
            <li>If that piece of fabric were not there, given that there is no cut-out for the nose, a lot of light would get in.  </li>
            <li>I actually cut the rubber straps and attached an adjustable eyeglass strap which worked out great.</li>
            <li>sleep during the day, and therefore need help keeping the light from my eyes.</li>
            <li>It also keeps light leakage from the bottom at the sides of the nose to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is LIGHT, COOL, COMFORTABLE, and the fabric covered elastic doesn&#x27;t snag in my hair.  </li>
            <li>The fabric is smooth, the filling is thicker than most and conforms gently around my eyes, with a thinner section over the bridge of the nose to allow close fit and keep out light.</li>
            <li>Cool &amp; light.</li>
            <li>Is nice soft and does not create any problems sleeping !</li>
            <li>This product is good for the following reasons.</li>
            <li>Seem like it would be a great comfortable mask if the strap were not so tight.</li>
            <li>One positive thing I can say about this mask is that the silk is very nice and soft (and &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>The nose flap to keep light out from around your nose isn&#x27;t great, unless a very small amount of light isn&#x27;t an issue for you, or having something on your nose isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li>The mask is very light and soft.</li>
            <li>Really keeps light out.</li>
            <li>so it really blocks all light out.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and I love it.</li>
            <li>Feels almost exactly like silk &amp; stays cool and comfy all night.</li>
            <li>Lovely soft and silky eye mask.</li>
            <li>Theres also an extra inside fold that peels up to fight light even better.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>The mask blocks out all of the light when I tried it on, but my husband has quite a prominent nose, and a little light sneaks in.</li>
            <li>However, all natural, soft, light weight sleep masks are not so easy to come by.</li>
            <li>Both of them love the mask more than any other mask they have and &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these daily since my first review, and have given many as gifts.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut out light completely for me but</li>
            <li>I bought two then went back and got 8 more.  </li>
            <li>i looked for many different eye masks.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that big of a deal because I use them mostly to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>Great product for the small amount of money it costs !</li>
            <li>This silk blindfold is soft, light, and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was exactly what I needed, smooth, BREATHABLE!, soft, not too tight, blocks out light.</li>
            <li>The elastic back is cased in silk, so it is easy on the hair.  </li>
            <li>and he doubts he can find any mask that won&#x27;t let light in because of his big schnoz ;-).</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li>I do not have a large head.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a large head - a standard size strap should fit me.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with it but never liked the way it fit.</li>
            <li>Totally blocks light, really helps to turn off the world and sleep well.</li>
            <li>Take these with me whenever I travel, really makes a difference in hotel rooms with flimsy curtains that don&#x27;t fully block outside light.  </li>
            <li>I spent a good amount of time researching masks before buying, and ultimately chose this one due to the reasonable price and the lack of scent (surprised to find most had lavender!).</li>
            <li>Other than that the  mask is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The cool thing is, Amazon did the refund/exchange before the eye mask even arrived back to its rightful owner.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable - don&#x27;t even feel like you have them on, and elastic isn&#x27;t too tight.</li>
            <li>I just tug GENTLY on the elastic when it&#x27;s new...</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It was very comfortable and not too tight, so I ordered a second one the week after the first.  </li>
            <li>Right when it was picked up, they credited us back, and paid for shipping!</li>
            <li>Plus, band is secure but not too tight.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t care about a little light, you don&#x27;t have to use the nose flap</li>
            <li>this covers my eyes well, and has a little fold-down flap to prevent light bleed from around the bridge of my nose.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s superbly soft.</li>
            <li>and it is so soft you don&#x27;t even notice it is there.</li>
            <li>is so soft</li>
            <li>i am 13 years old</li>
            <li>The fabric is really soft.</li>
            <li>This mask fit so tight, it made my eye balls hurt!  </li>
            <li>These are a bit tight for me when new, and eventually stretch out too much, which is typical of elastic, but easy to cope with.  </li>
            <li>I love these, but after a few months the elastic stretched and they don&#x27;t sit on my eyes all night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read comments criticizing the elastic as too tight, or too loose, and want to say that I&#x27;m glad there is no way to adjust it, and I hope they don&#x27;t change the product.  </li>
            <li>, as you can see from the picture of the mask, it&#x27;s sort of an oval shape (more like a rectangle with rounded edges) - which is not a good shape for a sleep mask.  </li>
            <li>A little light comes in but it is no big deal with the nose flap.  </li>
            <li>They do have a little flap of extra silk inside that sort of flaps under your eyes around your nose, so that helps to block light out.  </li>
            <li>the price is so reasonable that I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one, or paying someone a few dollars to restitch the band by then.  </li>
            <li>although after a couple of washings (cold, gentle, hung dry) it is becoming less smooth, like the pillowcase.</li>
            <li>One, it&#x27;s all natural and thin, so breathable, and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>my head is a bit bigger than average and this one fits very well</li>

            <li> One, it&#x27;s all natural and thin, so breathable, and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> my head is a bit bigger than average and this one fits very well</li>
            <li> It arrived just three days later, and is extremely well made, soft, and just what I wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits so tight and is not built so not to put pressure on eyes - and it&#x27;s hard to keep light out around the edges.</li>
            <li> This eye mask would have been great, if it didn&#x27;t stick so horribly bad!</li>
            <li> The band on this style is narrow, lightweight and covered with silk fabric, so it&#x27;s barely noticeable and never gets tangled in my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is simply too tight.  </li>
            <li> The second is tight across my eyes.  </li>
            <li> For the price of the item paid, I would expect it to last a little bit longer than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that overreacts to everything, especially dark dyes, so I started by purchasing one, as a test.  </li>
            <li> careful not to put pressure on the points where it&#x27;s attached to the mask.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought several eyemasks and liked this one the best. I wanted something to protect my eyes from drying out at night due to my cpap, and this did the trick.</li>
            <li> The best eye mask I have ever had. Cool &amp; light. You don&#x27;t even notice it is there!   Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have bought many many sleep masks, cotton, bamboo, and mystery fabrics.  This is THE MOST COMFORTABLE SLEEP MASK that I&#x27;ve ever used.  The fabric is smooth, the filling is thicker than most and conforms gently around my eyes, with a thinner section over the bridge of the nose to allow close fit and keep out light. I have sensitive skin that overreacts to everything, especially dark dyes, so I started by purchasing one, as a test.  I just ordered THREE MORE today.  The silk breathes, so it doesn&#x27;t get hot, or cause skin irritation... the silk filling is especially important here.  It is LIGHT, COOL, COMFORTABLE, and the fabric covered elastic doesn&#x27;t snag in my hair.  This is an excellent, well-designed product.  Nov 2016 I&#x27;ve read comments criticizing the elastic as too tight, or too loose, and want to say that I&#x27;m glad there is no way to adjust it, and I hope they don&#x27;t change the product.  All the other brands I tried, that had adjustable bands, became tangled in my hair &amp; pulled chunks out... and had hard buckles or thick velcro areas that were uncomfortable. The band on this style is narrow, lightweight and covered with silk fabric, so it&#x27;s barely noticeable and never gets tangled in my hair.  These are a bit tight for me when new, and eventually stretch out too much, which is typical of elastic, but easy to cope with.  I just tug GENTLY on the elastic when it&#x27;s new... careful not to put pressure on the points where it&#x27;s attached to the mask.  I use each mask for many months before it stretches &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34; and the price is so reasonable that I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one, or paying someone a few dollars to restitch the band by then.  When I received a mask with a band that broke soon after it arrived, the company replaced it.  I&#x27;ve used these daily since my first review, and have given many as gifts.  I never received one that smelled bad, but I did cause the fabric to become rough when I washed one in regular detergent... ironing helped, but it was never the same.  Silk needs cold water and mild detergent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye mask. it&#x27;s superbly soft. It doesn&#x27;t cut out light completely for me but thats because my head is too small for the strap, so it&#x27;s loose. It still stays on all night though, and I just love the mask. A+++</li>
            <li> It fits so tight and is not built so not to put pressure on eyes - and it&#x27;s hard to keep light out around the edges.</li>
            <li> The mask is very light and soft. It works well in blocking out the light. Is very comfortable.  The elastic back is cased in silk, so it is easy on the hair.  I would recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> It lasted for 2 weeks and then stretch to the limit. I had to end up getting another one. I hated this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask.  It is so soft and I love it. Worth the money for sure.  A little light comes in but it is no big deal with the nose flap.  If you don&#x27;t care about a little light, you don&#x27;t have to use the nose flap and it is so soft you don&#x27;t even notice it is there.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask for my husband, who just started working nights. I spent a good amount of time researching masks before buying, and ultimately chose this one due to the reasonable price and the lack of scent (surprised to find most had lavender!). The mask blocks out all of the light when I tried it on, but my husband has quite a prominent nose, and a little light sneaks in. I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars, because he says it works perfectly and he doubts he can find any mask that won&#x27;t let light in because of his big schnoz ;-).</li>
            <li> This product is magic.  I bought two then went back and got 8 more.  You don&#x27;t know you have it on it is so soft</li>
            <li> this covers my eyes well, and has a little fold-down flap to prevent light bleed from around the bridge of my nose.    i love that the elastic is covered in silk, and that it is filled w/ silk.    although after a couple of washings (cold, gentle, hung dry) it is becoming less smooth, like the pillowcase.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was exactly what I needed, smooth, BREATHABLE!, soft, not too tight, blocks out light. I was pleased with it but never liked the way it fit. I just reviewed another sleep mask I bought recently, a terry one believe it or not, that I was not sure i&#x27;d like, but now it&#x27;s my fave. This one will be in my drawer for days when I can&#x27;t find my Earth Therapeutics terry one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this sleep mask after I lost mine, and needed to travel for business. The window between ordering and leaving was short, and I emailed Feeling Pampered. I told the sales person that I was Feeling Panicked about trying to sleep without it. It arrived just three days later, and is extremely well made, soft, and just what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely order again from this store.</li>
            <li> It served it&#x27;s purpose when operated on for cataracts..</li>
            <li> i am 13 years old and ive been having trouble sleeping because the streetlights were always in my eyes. i looked for many different eye masks. someone told me silk masks were great. this one is perfect. this doesnt slip off your pillow and im a side sleeper. there is also a flab that goes aroudn your nose. it blocks the light 100% and it is very comfortable. my head is a bit bigger than average and this one fits very well</li>
            <li> I bought this mask for my son with Asperger&#x27;s syndrome and for my girlfriend who claims she used to have Asperger&#x27;s. Both of them love the mask more than any other mask they have and &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with Asperger&#x27;s syndrome usually like &amp;#34;shutting off the world&amp;#34; at the end of the day and lowering the amount of sensory input. So if they love the mask and find it extremely comfortable, anyone should.</li>
            <li> Great product for the small amount of money it costs ! Is nice soft and does not create any problems sleeping ! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have bought more than one of these. I love sleeping with them, great for traveling. I swear my eyes are less puffy when I wake up after wearing these!</li>
            <li> I love this product, its light on my eyes and I love how it&#x27;s silk so it&#x27;s super soft. I use it almost every night. Really keeps light out. I love this eye mask!</li>
            <li> Feels almost exactly like silk &amp; stays cool and comfy all night. Plus, band is secure but not too tight.</li>
            <li> So comfy you do &#x27;t know it&#x27;s there.  Totally blocks light, really helps to turn off the world and sleep well.</li>
            <li> Take these with me whenever I travel, really makes a difference in hotel rooms with flimsy curtains that don&#x27;t fully block outside light.  Very comfortable - don&#x27;t even feel like you have them on, and elastic isn&#x27;t too tight.</li>
            <li> Lovely soft and silky eye mask.Nice large size so it really blocks all light out. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I love these, but after a few months the elastic stretched and they don&#x27;t sit on my eyes all night. It&#x27;s not that big of a deal because I use them mostly to fall asleep. Theres also an extra inside fold that peels up to fight light even better. The fabric is really soft.</li>
            <li> After reading numerous reviews of sleep masks, I decided to try this one.  I do not have a large head.  I am a woman with an average size head.  This mask fit so tight, it made my eye balls hurt!  I tried positioning it several different ways - with the strap above and below my ears.  It didn&#x27;t matter, still hurt.  I have thought about cutting the strap in two and then sewing in a short piece of elastic to make it looser because the fabric is very soft as is the strap.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re so comfertable. now I can&#x27;t sleep without wearing these. The silk feels like sleeping with clouds on your eyes.. if that can make any sense.</li>
            <li> One positive thing I can say about this mask is that the silk is very nice and soft (and &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;). Unfortunately, the strap is not long enough so the mask is too tight. I don&#x27;t have a large head - a standard size strap should fit me.  This is simply too tight.  I have spent quite a bit of time pulling the strap (it&#x27;s elastic covered in silk) taut over and over again, hoping it would loosen the elastic and it would stretch to a better size, but that didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One good point is that it&#x27;s nice that the strap is covered in silk fabric and does not have any velcro on it so it does not catch your hair.  That was a big selling point for me.  But the strap needs to be about an inch longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as you can see from the picture of the mask, it&#x27;s sort of an oval shape (more like a rectangle with rounded edges) - which is not a good shape for a sleep mask.  It should have a cut-out where your nose goes.  This does not, so it presses against your nose, which is annoying and affects breathing. They do have a little flap of extra silk inside that sort of flaps under your eyes around your nose, so that helps to block light out.  If that piece of fabric were not there, given that there is no cut-out for the nose, a lot of light would get in.  Nevertheless, with the strap being too tight, combined with the fact that there is no cut-out for the nose, the mask pulls across the nose as well as the eyes and presses against them, making it too uncomfortable to wear.  If the strap were looser, you could adjust the way it sits on your face enough so that the shape of the mask wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal issue.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not the case.</li>
            <li> Elastic broke after only two weeks of use.  Bought a second one and it happened again.  For the price of the item paid, I would expect it to last a little bit longer than two weeks.  Disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me but I thought the straps were too tight - I don&#x27;t like the pressure against my eyeballs. I actually cut the rubber straps and attached an adjustable eyeglass strap which worked out great. Other than that the  mask is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I like this mask, but found it to have slightly inconsistent manufacturing.  The first one I ordered fit great.  It was very comfortable and not too tight, so I ordered a second one the week after the first.  The second is tight across my eyes.  So far, it&#x27;s still the best mask I&#x27;ve found.  I don&#x27;t like the adjustable ones, as I find it uncomfortable to sleep on the strap adjuster.</li>
            <li> Seem like it would be a great comfortable mask if the strap were not so tight. It doesn&#x27;t adjust, so it&#x27;s pretty much pointless to wear. The pressure on the eyes is very uncomfortable because the tight strap pulls the mask taught right across the eyes. Don&#x27;t buy unless you have a really tiny head, in which case you may have bigger problems than sleep.</li>
            <li> This product is good for the following reasons. One, it&#x27;s all natural and thin, so breathable, and that&#x27;s important. The nose flap to keep light out from around your nose isn&#x27;t great, unless a very small amount of light isn&#x27;t an issue for you, or having something on your nose isn&#x27;t a problem. However, all natural, soft, light weight sleep masks are not so easy to come by. By itself, it would not stay on for me, but I use this underneath a wide Prana head band (cotton), and that way it works perfectly and, bonus, holds in my earplugs.</li>
            <li> This eye mask would have been great, if it didn&#x27;t stick so horribly bad! Unusable! My wife absolutely hated this mask. The cool thing is, Amazon did the refund/exchange before the eye mask even arrived back to its rightful owner. Right when it was picked up, they credited us back, and paid for shipping!</li>
            <li> This silk blindfold is soft, light, and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sleep during the day, and therefore need help keeping the light from my eyes. Many blindfolds do this, of course, but they&#x27;re not as comfortable as this one. It also keeps light leakage from the bottom at the sides of the nose to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most other blindfolds have made me wake in discomfort, making me remove them. With this one, I can sleep through the day and forget I have anything on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price.</li>
