            <li>The hologram effect was nice.</li>
            <li>The seller packed the set nicely; it includes two boxes containing  6 bottles each.</li>
            <li>but I think it looks better with a good layer of Seche Vite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The colors are nice.</li>
            <li>The colors are soooooo nice</li>
            <li>I liked Layla because that polish throws the most colors Ive seen until now {and is around $15.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this set to anyone who wants gorgeous nails!  </li>
            <li>I wish there were even more colors.  </li>
            <li>They are great for water color manis and for nail stamping as they show up well and are very pigmented</li>

            <li>It only takes 2 coat and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this polish.</li>

            <li>I love these polishes.</li>
            <li>Just love them.</li>
            <li>I wish I had more fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>each color in the set is totally wearable and beautiful!  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to have them in time for Summer sunshine!</li>
            <li>I am THEE original polish junkie!</li>
            <li>I am also happy about the fast &amp; free shipping, I ordered on June 4th</li>
            <li>You can never have too many fabulous holos, IMO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a bad one in the set! {</li>
            <li>If you love an easy unique way to paint your nails, this is your solution.</li>
            <li>These are really strong holographic polishes, and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>also strongly recommend seller Universal Nail Supply, they did a great job.</li>
            <li>but when the light hits your nails you can tell the difference.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just fabulous.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>on smooth and is full of rainbowy goodness!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things  about these polishes.</li>
            <li>These polishes are absolutely gorgeous, every last one of them!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to polish lovers!!!</li>
            <li>I tried using these with top coat the holographic effect was dulled, but you can get longer wear out of them without compromising the effect by putting your usual top coat in between two coats of the polish, instead of on top of everything.</li>
            <li>First the seller must have shipped the items within minutes because I received the set within 2 days!</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>they are very vibrant and rich</li>
            <li>I have many other Holographic polishes which I paid wayyy more for {</li>
            <li>I swear I&#x27;m in heaven right now.</li>
            <li>Trust me when I say you need those in your nail polish stash ;)</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how smoothly this polish goes on.</li>
            <li>They go on with no streaks like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried and they are so pretty</li>
            <li>The price for this set is not bad considering each polish retails for about $10, and it includes 12 brand new polishes.</li>
            <li>though if your nails are heavily ridged I recommend a ridge-filling basecoat or using a nail buffer to smooth out the surface, you&#x27;ll get a better linear effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors it throws is amazing, texture is fab and shines like crazy without my fave Seche top coat!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I paid for and more than I expected it to be!  </li>
            <li>I only tried Beyond so far, but I am so happy that this polish is the real deal as far as the holographic affect; you don&#x27;t need multiple coats either, one coat is sufficient.</li>
            <li>They were packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Fast reliable shipping.</li>
            <li>The first coat will go on streaky, you have to apply a second coat and make sure to give the first coat ample time to dry.  </li>
            <li>Harp On (platinum color),  Miss Bliss (strong pink color), Angel Kiss (light blue).</li>
            <li>All the colors are lovely but my faves are Cosmic Fate (dark peach color),  </li>
            <li>hands down some of my favorite nail polishes out there.</li>
            <li>All the colors are vibrant when they are on the nails.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love a little holo?</li>
            <li>The prism effect with all the colors is very apparent unless in low light.  </li>
            <li>They also got here very quickly and were carefully packed!</li>
            <li>In the bottles some look almost exactly the same</li>
            <li>I usually never leave feedback but this nail polish is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>I used the silver that came in the set and all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>So, make sure you apply as thin a first coat as you can.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used three of them so far</li>
            <li>The holographic effect in these polishes is really strong, and if you love holo, you definitely won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my bottle of Blue Heaven leaked a little during shipment, but other than that they are excellent.</li>

            <li> This is  nice polish.  The hologram effect was nice. I&#x27;ve used three of them so far and I haven&#x27;t&#x27; been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> I have never tried any products from Color Club, but after searching for iridescent or holographic nail polishes, I discovered lots of photos of this brand online. I knew I definitely wanted to try Cosmic Fate and Beyond, but I decided to just go ahead and purchase a set. The price for this set is not bad considering each polish retails for about $10, and it includes 12 brand new polishes. The seller packed the set nicely; it includes two boxes containing  6 bottles each. I only tried Beyond so far, but I am so happy that this polish is the real deal as far as the holographic affect; you don&#x27;t need multiple coats either, one coat is sufficient. I am also happy about the fast &amp; free shipping, I ordered on June 4th and I received the package today June 7th.</li>
            <li> One of the best &amp; most affordable holographic polishes out there. Trust me when I say you need those in your nail polish stash ;)</li>
            <li> hands down some of my favorite nail polishes out there. I wish there were even more colors.  They are great for water color manis and for nail stamping as they show up well and are very pigmented</li>
            <li> I had been wanting these polishes for a while. They had all of them. The price wash cheaper than anywhere else. Even with shipping cost. The polish are So amazing! So dimensional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth the money. I really love these polishes. The only bad part is that it&#x27;s hard to see the color difference between 3 polishes. It only takes 2 coat and it&#x27;s perfect. I highly recommend it to polish lovers!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this polish. I was surprised at how smoothly this polish goes on. You almost don&#x27;t need a second coat. All the colors are vibrant when they are on the nails. In the bottles some look almost exactly the same but when the light hits your nails you can tell the difference. If you love an easy unique way to paint your nails, this is your solution.</li>
            <li> I swear I&#x27;m in heaven right now. I ordered these polishes on 4/2 and received them on 4/5. The expected delivery date was between 4/8 and 4/11. Imagine my surprise when I opened the mailbox today. The colors are all beautiful, I can&#x27;t quit looking at them. They matched perfectly to the description given. They were packaged very well. Overall all they surpassed the 5 star rating, but that is the highest I could give. Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> I usually never leave feedback but this nail polish is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth and is full of rainbowy goodness!&lt;br /&gt;If I had to choose just 1 collection I would get the 2013 because the colors are very different, where as the 2012 colors are all very similar. Having gotten all 12 I am totally thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;Some say do not use top coat with these but I think it looks better with a good layer of Seche Vite.&lt;br /&gt;I also strongly recommend seller Universal Nail Supply, they did a great job.</li>
            <li> I love these polishes. They go on with no streaks like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried and they are so pretty it&#x27;s hard to stop looking at your nails.</li>
            <li> Beautiful polishes. Unfortunately my bottle of Blue Heaven leaked a little during shipment, but other than that they are excellent.</li>
            <li> These are really strong holographic polishes, and easy to work with. The colors are nice. A few are very similar, so if you don&#x27;t care to have similar polishes I wouldn&#x27;t suggest getting the whole set, but I *would* still recommend picking out your favorites individually. And if you can&#x27;t pick, well, go for it. You can never have too many fabulous holos, IMO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No aqua base necessary, though if your nails are heavily ridged I recommend a ridge-filling basecoat or using a nail buffer to smooth out the surface, you&#x27;ll get a better linear effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried using these with top coat the holographic effect was dulled, but you can get longer wear out of them without compromising the effect by putting your usual top coat in between two coats of the polish, instead of on top of everything.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things  about these polishes. They&#x27;re just fabulous. Great price. Fast reliable shipping. Just love them.</li>
            <li> These polishes are absolutely gorgeous, every last one of them!  I wish I had more fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they got to me in TWO DAYS... I have to go paint my nails now....</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a little holo? Simply gorgeous! I&#x27;m so happy I bought these.</li>
            <li> These arrived in perfect condition, and the holographics are stunning. I am so excited to have them in time for Summer sunshine!</li>
            <li> I am THEE original polish junkie! If it&#x27;s made I have it or I will figure out a way to concockt it! Never tried this brand but I took a chance and Im soooo glad I did! I have many other Holographic polishes which I paid wayyy more for {NFU OH is a good one as well but its like $30. a bottle}. I liked Layla because that polish throws the most colors Ive seen until now {and is around $15. per bottle}.............First the seller must have shipped the items within minutes because I received the set within 2 days! KUDOS to them! Now, about the polish....each color in the set is totally wearable and beautiful!  Not a bad one in the set! {and it averages to be aprox. $8. per bottle!} I used the silver that came in the set and all I can say is WOW!  I was going to use it as a base color to do a gradient polish but who needs it! The colors it throws is amazing, texture is fab and shines like crazy without my fave Seche top coat! LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE LACQUERS!!!!!!!  \\&quot;Colorclub\\&quot; keep up the great products!</li>
            <li> The colors are soooooo nice I bought them twice you can not go wrong with these colors they are very vibrant and rich looking Color Club is tops in the Holographic polishes</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are awesome! I have over 200 bottles in my collection but these are my FAVORITE! They also got here very quickly and were carefully packed! Love them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting these forever and am happy I splurged. The colors in the earlier set are fairly similar, but I got them anyway with plans to experiment using different inks and pigments. The holographic effect in these polishes is really strong, and if you love holo, you definitely won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best collection ever... Looks absolutely stunning on my nails!!!!  It was exactly what I paid for and more than I expected it to be!  I would recommend this set to anyone who wants gorgeous nails!  best purchase i have invested in in years !!</li>
