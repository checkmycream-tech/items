            <li>My loved one was not too  happy with this, on the other hand it got the wound taken care of.</li>
            <li>Glad it is available here.</li>
            <li>Price is great with Prime free shipping and ordering saves a trip to the medical supply store.</li>
            <li>Great for using in and cleaning open wounds when you don&#x27;t want to touch it.</li>
            <li>I love this cleaner very much and it is sterile.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to help keep some skin biopsy sights clean while healing.  </li>
            <li>and I use Skintegrity to clean the area around the tube 2 to 3 times a day.</li>

            <li>I like the product and assume that it does a good job of cleaning open wounds.</li>
            <li>Wipe and clean wound with this no ouch liquid before applying antiseptic and fresh dressing.</li>
            <li>Veronica was extremely helpful and very nice.</li>
            <li>I used this last year and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>True, staying off the sore helps, but wasn&#x27;t a complete cure before using this combination.</li>
            <li>It is very convienient to use with the quality spray head.  </li>
            <li>Product worked very well.</li>

            <li>This works very well</li>
            <li>Needed a wound cleanser and this spray bottle works very well.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Just takes a little more pumping.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of spray-on versus dab on because it not only is much more convenient and it doesn&#x27;t push debris or dead skin down into the wound (as dabbing does)</li>
            <li>We love it - and it was not carried in our local pharmacy, so I checked Amazon - and we were not let down.</li>
            <li>Other than that its great, bottle doesnt spray too hard to damage fragile new skin...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so far, but my wound care nurse seems to think it works very well on my wound.</li>
            <li>I use this frequently</li>
            <li>Some months after he had a debridement by another surgeon and the area was cleaned with peroxide resulting in extensive damage with no growth of new cells.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. CHEAPEST ONLINE</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Will keep it on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this product.  She is a former caregiver and used this cleanser on pressure sores on her clients.  It is great that it does not need to be rinsed off.  It seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> cost to high for this product.</li>
            <li> My loved one was not too  happy with this, on the other hand it got the wound taken care of. I am glad it healed.</li>
            <li> I have sensative skin and am diabetic.  I purchased this to help keep some skin biopsy sights clean while healing.  This worked well.  It did not irritate my skin.  It is very convienient to use with the quality spray head.  I will keep buying and using this for all types of wounds.</li>
            <li> My husband had surgery to remove a sarcoma of the upper arm and Skintegrity wound cleanser was used in the after care by a wound care specialist.  Some months after he had a debridement by another surgeon and the area was cleaned with peroxide resulting in extensive damage with no growth of new cells.  He was reviewed by the wound care specialist and after a month using Skintegrity the area is on its was to full recovery.  A great product..</li>
            <li> We have people that have incontinence and are on medications that doesn&#x27;t help out their skin. This is a very &#x27;ideal&#x27; solution that has kept everyones skin healthy. This product is a must in our household</li>
            <li> Skintegrity was first recommended to us by a wound specialist after my husband had a very bad skin tear when he fell. We love it - and it was not carried in our local pharmacy, so I checked Amazon - and we were not let down.</li>
            <li> I would never be without this one. it is great. I love this cleaner very much and it is sterile.</li>
            <li> Makes wound care easy!</li>
            <li> excellent as described</li>
            <li> I use this frequently it&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> I had a chronic sore and nothing I used for 3 years kept it healed til I used this and Silversorb.  True, staying off the sore helps, but wasn&#x27;t a complete cure before using this combination. Dramatic change within couple weeks.  I&#x27;d give 5 stars if I knew for sure it wasn&#x27;t adding silversorb that&#x27;s done it.  But yes, I&#x27;d buy it again if I needed it.</li>
            <li> This is especially great to use if my elderly husband is sore or rashy from antibiotics.</li>
            <li> Product worked very well.</li>
            <li> Wipe and clean wound with this no ouch liquid before applying antiseptic and fresh dressing.</li>
            <li> Skintegrity works excellent to clean wounds.It is fast, thorough and gentle. I highly recommend everyone try this product. I think it helps the wound heal faster and better. The company that sells this product has great customer service. Veronica was extremely helpful and very nice. I highly recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li> It works is about all you can say about the bottle, as it loses its prime overnight. Just takes a little more pumping. Other than that its great, bottle doesnt spray too hard to damage fragile new skin... The seller I bought it from, sold it for $2.04 each and $15.98 for 2 bottles coming to a total of $20.06 for 2. Came out cheaper than other sellers, just a weird way of going about it...</li>
            <li> Good cleanser.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so far, but my wound care nurse seems to think it works very well on my wound.</li>
            <li> Use daily on a wound that does not heal. Price is great with Prime free shipping and ordering saves a trip to the medical supply store.</li>
            <li> Best price and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Excellent and easy to use cleanses and also some pain relief!</li>
            <li> A real good product from a trusted vendor.</li>
            <li> performed as expected. I used this last year and was very pleased with the results. Glad it is available here.</li>
            <li> Great for using in and cleaning open wounds when you don&#x27;t want to touch it.</li>
            <li> excellent wound and skin dressing for my diabetic leg blisters</li>
            <li> I have a feeding tube and I use Skintegrity to clean the area around the tube 2 to 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> Nice product would buy again no sting when used</li>
            <li> I love the product, but not the seller this time.  If I manufactured this product, I would definitely have a stronger trigger system.</li>
            <li> This works very well and  is painless. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Needed a wound cleanser and this spray bottle works very well.</li>
            <li> Order came as described and on time</li>
            <li> I like the product and assume that it does a good job of cleaning open wounds. I love the idea of spray-on versus dab on because it not only is much more convenient and it doesn&#x27;t push debris or dead skin down into the wound (as dabbing does) it sort of washes it away. I recently took a bad fall and the wound card nurse used a spray-on product which I was unable to find so I ordered this one to have at home. I like her product better because it sprays on like this one does but doesn&#x27;t sting at all. This one stings a little bit, not painful, but a little sting on open wounds.</li>
            <li> Great, as advertised.</li>
