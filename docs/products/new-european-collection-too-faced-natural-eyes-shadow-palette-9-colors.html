            <li>I&#x27;ve been eyeing this palette for a while now, and I&#x27;m so glad I finally purchased it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the real one!</li>
            <li>Anyways overall love the set.</li>
            <li>If you were looking for the real deal</li>
            <li>you can get the REAL palette at Sephora or the Too Faced website.</li>
            <li>Seem to show really well on the eye.</li>
            <li>The shadows are very similar in color, however they did not blend or even swatch like the real deal !!</li>
            <li>This shadow is very shimmery and natural.</li>

            <li>If your skin stone is rather tan, maybe this palette won&#x27;t show very clearly.</li>
            <li>the left side has 2 matte colors, and the middle is very shiney...the ones on the right are 1/2 matte and the other 1/2 shiny...</li>
            <li>The colors are lovely, yet I would dare to say that it is too sparkly and not pigmented enough, at least comparison to UrbanDecay.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday, and I love how it comes with a little mirror.</li>
            <li>The far left middle shade doesn&#x27;t show too well</li>

            <li> but that might be the eye primer that makes it hard to see the shimmer?</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> This palette was awful!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t like this palate. The shades do not match the palate that I got from sephora. I would like to return it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real one! Don&#x27;t buy this fake one when you can get the real one for the same price.</li>
            <li> I love this palette!!!!! I use this everyday, and I love how it comes with a little mirror. I was going to buy at Ulta, but got a gift card for Amazon and I&#x27;m in love. I love these eye shadows, I want to buy and collect all of their palettes.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this palette. The colors are rich and the texture is great. Long wearing. Have recommended to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is a knock off too faced palette I learned that the hard way. Garbage</li>
            <li> I love this pallet I have been buying the natural eye from too faced for year. I love the colors and its the only one I use, this is the best price I have ever seen it listed for and the only pallet of this kind that comes with a mirror how awesome! will buy again and again  and again !</li>
            <li> This palette was awful! The shadows are cheap imitations of the Too Faced originals (which is a great palette). The shadows are very similar in color, however they did not blend or even swatch like the real deal !! For the price you pay for this knock off you can get the REAL palette at Sephora or the Too Faced website. Really don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> The colors are lovely, yet I would dare to say that it is too sparkly and not pigmented enough, at least comparison to UrbanDecay. If your skin stone is rather tan, maybe this palette won&#x27;t show very clearly. If your skin tone is brighter, then this must be the perfect romantic palette for you.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely fashion and the box looked good.  Once I opened it up the powder in each compartment was totally crushed and mixed together. totally un-useable.  Waste of $$.  I would color 0 stars, but the program won&#x27;t let me</li>
            <li> The colors are really pigmented, and the palette creates a beautiful natural eye without your eyes looking too crazy. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect everyday palette. I love it. There&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t match this palette to. It is awesome.</li>
            <li> The color palate I received today did not have the colors shown in the picture. Totally different color palate. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Item was not as described. The colors listed in the description were not the colors on the pallette that I received.</li>
            <li> Good colors and pigments. Seem to show really well on the eye. The far left middle shade doesn&#x27;t show too well but that might be the eye primer that makes it hard to see the shimmer? Anyways overall love the set.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the colors as depicted in the description</li>
