            <li>Amazing, works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use; it beeps when you turn it on/off, it beeps when it reaches the heat setting you want, and best of all it beeps after 30 minutes just in case you leave it on (and you can press any button to keep it</li>

            <li>If you are a college student like me, who is looking for a straightener that will leave your hair still looking good after class, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>If nobody else has reported that their hair gets pulled then this is a really good product.</li>

            <li>and now I love it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty awesome)</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>this straightener arrived, and i love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>works amazing.</li>
            <li>straightener is amazing.</li>
            <li>The dial for heat is very reliable, although the best setting is 25 without the steam, because that&#x27;s about 350ยบ, the recommended heat setting.</li>
            <li>The ability to fully adjust the heat is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>Test it on your own hair, but as for mine--</li>
            <li>Its a nice buy for the price.</li>
            <li>(But honestly I think you should get this one cause</li>
            <li>I borrowed this from a friend to see how well I liked it before telling my family that I would like it for christmas.</li>
            <li>I have never seen my hair lay so nice</li>
            <li>and till i couldnt find in the stores with this kind of plug.</li>
            <li>This straightener does work, however I used it on my own hair and it does pull a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Excellent straight iron.</li>
            <li>My daughter is extremely thrilled with this product</li>
            <li>It was awesome  did a great job straightening semi-thick loose curls.</li>
            <li>All the reviews are RIGHT!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best straightener I have used.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my 14 year old thinking the 1\\&quot; slim would be best for her to handle over the 2\\&quot;plate</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, and I&#x27;ve never had a lot of it.</li>
            <li>It dries hair very quickly too, in 1-2 swipes!</li>
            <li>It still works as great as it did when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>I like this product and have been using it for many months.</li>
            <li>One reviewer recommended reading the instructions to get better results.</li>
            <li>I am looking for another affordable straightener that will produce better results.</li>
            <li>I have medium thickness hair, and love using this at around 15-18 heat level.  </li>
            <li>Another thing I love about this straightener is that its slim plate makes it perfect for you to not only straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more like the one my mother has; but its OK.  </li>
            <li>I would rate it as just &#x27;ok&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I love this tool.  </li>
            <li>after lowering the temp, it got better.</li>
            <li>sure it would have been salon quality if i realised the wet/dry settings.</li>
            <li>I like the thinner plates because it allows more manueverability close to my scalp without burning myself.</li>
            <li>I also love the steam feature.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS TOO,</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT TOO</li>
            <li>but, great price and the ceramic material really protects the hair from damaging.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is the straightest it has ever been (even more so than a time I had it straightened at a salon).</li>
            <li>but could be more better.</li>
            <li>WHEN YOU CAN PURCHASE THIS REMINGTON WHICH WORKS BETTER</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this</li>
            <li>I love to ride and always wear a helmet, leaving me with a severe case of \\&quot;helmet hair\\&quot; after every ride.</li>
            <li>Even better, I no longer have to wash and straighten my hair every morning.</li>
            <li>I do use a culing iron more often but this does do the trick</li>
            <li>Love it and  recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so you can straighten it layer by layer from bottom to top.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take a month for me to get it,It was on time at my door and am just in love with it.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>but I am sure</li>
            <li>the more you use it the better you get</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and i fell in love with it</li>
            <li>one I have for $19.99 works better.</li>
            <li>Best flat iron ever.</li>
            <li>flat iron is perfect!!</li>
            <li>This the best iron flat I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>It still heats up perfectly, but the top plate is loose and coming off (I think the screws inside loosened up.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it and couldn&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li>brand new and works great</li>
            <li>As dry it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>When I am done my hair is fully dry and the results are beautiful!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing straightener it straigtens hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Good straightened....not great on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>And whether you choose to buy the Remington wet 2straight straightener or not I hope you are able to find the perfect straightener for you!</li>
            <li>she was very happy with it and told me that it is better than any other straighteners she has ever owned in the $50 and below price range.  </li>
            <li>The handles stay cool but you can burn yourself very easily on the heat alone.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for dry hair, because the size is easy to use and hold without getting it too close to the face.  </li>
            <li>very good product, description is the same that the seller, work pefect</li>
            <li>light, realy quick to warm up  and to control the heat</li>
            <li>There was some sticky residue on it, probably hairspray, that cleaned off easily.</li>
            <li>I hear it chips off easily.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair, yet another blessing for someone whose hair is easily damaged (I use about the mid-high 15 setting).     </li>
            <li>The lack of insulation can easily cause burns.</li>
            <li>It also heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>have fine hair, so I never go beyond the lowest setting (350).  </li>
            <li>it works fine.</li>
            <li>cause my girl friend who recommend it to me has one for over 14 months and hers is fine.</li>
            <li>and it is fine hair</li>
            <li>It looks fine when I wake up.</li>
            <li>honestly the thought of putting my wet hair in a straightener kind of scared me(I like my hair and didn&#x27;t want to burn it!)</li>
            <li>Easy temperature settings to control and glides through my hair smoothly.</li>
            <li>Received product one day early and in perfect new condition.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly for doing bangs and getting rid of those little curls.</li>
            <li>Every college student can agree that time management is huge in college.</li>
            <li>This will keep it straight for twenty-four hours, which is amazing.  </li>
            <li>ANd, it&#x27;s shiny, and smooth....</li>
            <li>A light and beep</li>
            <li>I have medium length semi wavy hair and this product does a fantastic job of straightening.</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair fast and really nice.</li>
            <li>When its wet its good cause it has steam holes so its gets rid of all the water without burning it and it leaves your hair so sleek and nice and flowy</li>
            <li>before I retire old trustee he deserves a good review.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t give more than 2 stars if doesn&#x27;t do the job right.</li>
            <li>and it was so much easier she loves it!!!  </li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron for the price.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and gets the job done quickly without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>so the higher settings are better.</li>
            <li>It is a great tool for straightening if one cannot afford the flat iron that leaves about 3% moisture in your hair shaft (even after completely &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; drying it) as it costs $300-$400 or more - of course!  </li>
            <li>, my original one was the 2 inch lasted about seven years.</li>
            <li>pretty sure it was a counterfeit knock-off.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not at all dry, not frizzy and it looks great.</li>
            <li>This iron straightens quickly and easily, and cools relatively quickly too.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you buy some kind of flat iron cream, if not you might burn all your hair off.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use the &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; setting, though it&#x27;s never done anything special for me.  </li>
            <li>but she use a hair cream special for it...</li>
            <li>I own a higher end flat iron I paid over $100 for and it doesn&#x27;t do as a nice of job on my hair as the Remington.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;If used properly on wet hair, you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It did have the potential to be good</li>
            <li>Love this straight before this one</li>
            <li>I would definetly recommend this to anyone who likes having their hair straight in no time at all :)</li>
            <li>I love that curling iron, it really does</li>
            <li>I had one like 4 years ago this one is more modern</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product since I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>First, as with all straighteners I would recommend using a heat protectant (this just helps protect your hair from drying out and becoming frizzy).</li>
            <li>I still have to keep trying it out to make sure that I really want it, but I do believe that it may just stay at my house.</li>
            <li>My last straightener like this one I loved</li>
            <li>Not a bad Iron</li>
            <li>Not bad after 1800 days of use.)</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>I have not yet used the wet-to-dry feature, as I have been told it is very damaging to your hair, but on slightly damp hair it works great!</li>
            <li>favorite thing about this product is how quickly it heats up (in seconds) and beeps to let you know its ready.</li>
            <li>I was so ticked off when right before an important interview, this thing didn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li>and it is a really good flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flatiron heats up quickly and hair stays straightened longer.</li>
            <li>However, with a little time and patience your hair can look just as beautiful as theirs</li>
            <li>I have a curly and coarse hair, and I found in this product the best way to make my hair look soft, silky and straight.   </li>
            <li>flat iron curls and straightens the hair with great shine and really locks in the moisture in your hair regardless of the hair type.</li>
            <li>This straightner is amazing and makes my hair look full, shiny, healthy and cut my drying time almost in half.</li>
            <li>But, again, I value my time and cannot afford to blow dry my hair for a good thirty minutes.</li>
            <li>Everyone always has so much running through their minds so it can be easy sometimes to forget to do something.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, heats up amazingly fast, and made my hair shine.</li>
            <li>It is very slim and easy to manuever but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got super fine straight hair but often times after sleeping on it</li>
            <li>i just love it and when your hair is dry its even better</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and very frizzy and curly.  </li>
            <li>I love it that I can straighten my hair even if it&#x27;s little wet and still look great!</li>
            <li>After reading the great reviews on the Remington Wet 2 Straight iron I decided to buy it.  </li>
            <li>My wife liked it and uses it in a regular basis.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>I honestly bought this product for a weave that doesn&#x27;t get straighten with regular hair straighteners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>, Amazon rarely drops the ball but did with this.</li>
            <li>This product was cheaply made, never stayed on for more than 30 seconds and occasionally sent off sparks.</li>
            <li>This product is very good.i liked it very much,does not take much time to set my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and it shipped out quickly.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly even though this flat iron is inexpensive it works very well.  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li>I tried both the wet and dry settings after reading many great reviews on this iron.</li>
            <li>My 21-year old daughter has very long hair and said it works great.  </li>
            <li>and they are lucky enough to be able to straighten all their hair at once</li>
            <li>Knowing how great it works, its worth double this price, I have a second one in wait</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good flat iron for the price, and it&#x27;s nice to be able to use it on wet hair when I need to, but I&#x27;m considering purchasing a higher-quality ceramic flat iron, and</li>
            <li>thick hair is totally GORGEOUS! ;-) ]</li>
            <li>Straightening takes more than 5 minutes and a little more patience.</li>
            <li>It start quick and it has an auto shut off, which I really needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The result is so good and no trouble to use it at all, it&#x27;s actually pleasent.</li>
            <li>Well this is review of observation of my friend that use the hair thing, she has a very curly hair and this machine smooth her hair very well</li>
            <li>I use this on my hair straight out of the shower in conjunction with Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Smoothing Serum.</li>
            <li>To make matters worse, while it looks nice when I style it, it kinks up if I let it dry on its own, and frizzes up in humid weather regardless of how nice it looks when I walk out the door.    </li>
            <li>After a quick shower, I just run my fingers through my hair, and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>It heated up quick, and I can finish getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>This one is thinner, heats up much faster and the size provides him with a way to quickly straighten his hair.</li>
            <li>Okay so I was completely skepital about buying any straightner because my hair is naturally straight</li>
            <li>It gets very hot, maintains heat, and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I would very much suggest getting it.</li>
            <li>The digital temperature is so easy to use and it heats up so quick.</li>
            <li>I love that I never have to put any extra heat on my hair.      </li>
            <li>Just the fact that you are reading this review lets me know that you are interested in this product.</li>
            <li>I personally love it and do not plan on buying a different one.</li>
            <li>Over the 6 years, I have had two of them, the first one</li>
            <li>I got this yesterday, and while at first I was overjoyed, I realized that it doesn&#x27;t seem to protect the hair in any way.</li>
            <li>It drys the hair, but it gets extremely HOT.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li>WHO NEEDS A HOT TOOLS</li>
            <li>A HOT TOOLS....</li>
            <li>After many years of use and abuse by me and 3 teen girls it was time to replace.</li>
            <li>plus with last minute out the door teens :)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally pretty wavy and medium thickness.  </li>
            <li>It gets really hot though.</li>
            <li>This thing has gone through many drops, and daily use.</li>
            <li>and they really hurt!)</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll probably want to first separate your hair into sections</li>
            <li>Then take the first section of hair and use a hair clip to pin part of it up</li>
            <li>but I am sadly not one of those people.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>My old straightener was another cheap model (I got it from WalMart for about $15), so I was expecting this one to suffice.</li>
            <li>This is my first straightener</li>
            <li>I had a problem with the product, when connected to first use, something exploded in it and does not turn over, I hope your answer.</li>
            <li>I did use products to reduce the drying effects of using the hot iron.</li>
            <li>used it the first time this morning</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive at all</li>
            <li>It has been 4 days now and my hair is still straight and shiny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used on my dry hair but that alone has been a great experience.</li>
            <li>I got the 2 inch Remington wet 2 straight straightener for Christmas in 2010 and it is by far the best present I got.</li>
            <li>This has to be my favorite flat iron ever.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I went anywhere, I needed time for my top layer of hair to calm down a day or so before it looked smooth or go and spend 35.00 to have it blown out professionally!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find my hair stick straight and shiny and smooth, since I figured it would damage my hair.  </li>
            <li>as if was on the straightening setting very safely on the lowest setting I prefer ( the popping noise is normal when your hair is damp and never use it on soaking wet</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s barely damp, and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>My hair was still slightly damp at the top once I finished, but I was happy to wait for 10 minutes for it to dry naturally.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair kind of frizzy even with the wet 2 straight function.</li>
            <li>The first swipe I did on my first section made my hair look really curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!!!  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast, works well on my already pretty straight hair.</li>
            <li>The digital controls make it extremely easy for you to adjust the heat to whatever temperature you would like, which can go up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>I have yet to try it with wet hair because I dont want to damage my hair, but other than that it is a great iron and leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various different flat irons to straighten my hair and so far this one has been the best.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this straightener has a certain thing to help it stand, so it eventually tips over or lands on the side when I put it on the table, but it doesn&#x27;t damage anything since the non metal plastic is covering up the side, not allowing the metal to touch surface.</li>
            <li>We both get so many complements on our hair since we&#x27;ve been using them and again because of the setting (15 levels) I do not see alot of damage being done like I have with other hot irons.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality product.</li>
            <li>even though that&#x27;s not a very good idea on a regular basis, it&#x27;s nice to be able to do it occassionally.</li>
            <li>The straightner works great on my daughter&#x27;s very thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Enter the super light and easily wieldable 1\\&quot;, slim but long plated Remington Wet</li>
            <li>I love wet 2 straight.</li>
            <li>But by the third swipe it was smooth and straight.  </li>
            <li>Since this product advertises using it on wet hair is okay</li>
            <li>I love the adjustable heat settings, because even as I straighten my hair, untouched parts go from wet to damp.  </li>
            <li>She really loves it.  </li>
            <li>At times I have so much going on I run out the door and forget to turn off my straightener.</li>
            <li>but I get it really straight</li>
            <li>It also stays straight until I wash it so about a week or a week and 1/2.</li>
            <li>I am very please.</li>
            <li>It really heats up in 30 seconds and the steam helps out to get your hair straight it shorter time.</li>
            <li>2 straight</li>
            <li>2 straight ceramic straightening iron</li>
            <li>I really like this hair iron.</li>
            <li>It takes me 25-30 minutes to go from damp hair to straight, shiny, silky hair, with NO frizz or curls.  </li>
            <li>~ I repeat going over the whole section of hair about 3 times.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never gotten this straight before.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>People do not believe me when I say that I do not have naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li>It saves me so much time doing my hair in the mornings.</li>
            <li>2 Straight 1\\&quot; Slim Plate Wet/Dry Ceramic Hair</li>
            <li>Also, it makes my lights flicker, haha.</li>
            <li>But im really disapointed i didn&#x27;t recieve the &amp;#34;Bonus mini straightener&amp;#34</li>
            <li>; that was the whole reason I chose this one.</li>
            <li>so when i tried this much cheaper one, I was so suprised about how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>It really did the job and didn&#x27;t damage my hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair much silkier and shiny to.  </li>
            <li>It gets my hair straight as I needed and is lightweight and very slick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gets heated fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this would really work and</li>
            <li>thanks -maria</li>
            <li>My hair is really wavy, and it took out my waves just flattening a piece one time.</li>
            <li>I may very well just stretch out my fro with a blow dryer and be on my merry way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>2 Straight.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re ready to hit</li>
            <li>The product in a cheap &amp;#34;Curling Iron&amp;#34; box with a sticker on it that obviously printed in China,</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I used this many times, straight out of the shower on soaking wet hair.</li>
            <li>This flat iron really heats up quick, and I really love how I can change the temperature of the flat iron.</li>
            <li>but I am almost sure that it works because this is the straightener that other females that bought the particular weave that I am about to install in my hair!</li>
            <li>My older sister owns this straightener, and after using it a few times, decided I wanted one of my own.</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers who say after straightening, hair has a straw-like quality, and is not shiny or healthy looking (part of the reason I straighten).</li>
            <li>I love this brand because it can style wet!</li>
            <li>This heats up FAST, but watch out, because the sides of the iron (near the plates) get almost as hot as the plates themselves.  </li>
            <li>It heats up super fast, and the diffrent heating settings works for wet or dry hair as well as for all types of hair mine is very fine</li>
            <li>Great flat iron and lasts a few years !</li>
            <li>To give you a visual, imagine using one of those crimping irons from the 90&#x27;s--Not cool.  </li>
            <li>and you have to be patient because you have to hold the iron in each section before sliding it down some more.  </li>
            <li>I understand the top plate is supposed to be engineered to allow for water to be released as vapor through those holes, but the 2 small indentations where these vapor holes are place prevent my hair from coming out very straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed this iron does a better job than my CHI, at a fraction of the price, and it has cut my hair styling time in half.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about the straightener being so hot at first because I didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair, but I&#x27;ve been using it regularly since August and haven&#x27;t noticed any problems.     </li>
            <li>I had an older version (bought 2010) of this straightener.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly - a plus with last minute out the door teens and an auto shut off - again-a</li>
            <li>Although its not slick straight it makes it some</li>
            <li>durable and high quality.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t even need to use it on a high volume it does the work regardless.</li>
            <li>high recommend of  brand.</li>
            <li>my freshman year of high school</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and I really liked the separate setting for dry or wet hair.  </li>
            <li>After going to the salon and having my stylist straighten my hair, I decided to do a little research and invest in a slightly better iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Saved me so much $$ with getting my hair done professionally, I can do it myself.</li>
            <li>It is also soft and very shiney, which with my blow dryer and straightner</li>
            <li>It does work amazingly as a normal straightener though.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>this is the second wet 2 straight, and i love it.</li>
            <li>Plates don&#x27;t meet right, so you can&#x27;t grab smaller sections of hair.</li>
            <li>The whole process just took an hour because I am new to flat ironing so it will get much shorter with practise!</li>
            <li>I have used the iron at least 3 times since purchase on wet hair and it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>and I live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li>my dog chewed the cord so Had to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>so I think I need a new one</li>
            <li>But I ordered a new straightener and it did not appear to be so.</li>
            <li>so I had to replace with a new one.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use this on wet hair and dry it straight.  </li>
            <li>After years of spending too much money trying everything I could find, using this iron along with CHI Iron Guard not only straightens my hair, but also keeps it straight.</li>
            <li>If I flat iron it from a wet state, it doesn&#x27;t get as straight as I want, but it&#x27;s a good start; I normally have to come back later and finish it off, however.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love it, and I mean it, this iron is what I was looking for, heats really fast</li>
            <li>We returned the Conair we bought at Target because it didn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this straightener as a freshman in highschool and I am currently a freshman in College.</li>
            <li>While it irons my hair even better than my old straightener, especially when wet, both my mom and a friend agree that it seems to be damaging my hair, and it gets so burned you can smell it.</li>
            <li>Its really epic!</li>
            <li>Then I start using the iron on small sections of hair, using a clip to put up the top layers.  </li>
            <li>I fully intend to buy this exact same item again.</li>
            <li>This left my hair STRAIGHT AND SHINY!</li>
            <li>This is my first flat iron and it works well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am just getting into flat irons for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>With a little bit more patience after your hair is dry you continue to use it until your hair is straight.</li>
            <li>I Love the fact that I can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m trying hard to fight the urge to replace it with something better.</li>
            <li>This straightener on the other hand, keeps your hair safe and non damaged when used dry.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair like the other ones I love that I don&#x27;t have to wait for my hair to be completely dry to strain it ..</li>
            <li>Clearly, that also applies here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As the mother of two children, one of them a young infant, I need all the help I can get in saving time.  </li>
            <li>I still use my old one.</li>
            <li>You need something that can leave your hair looking spot-on while still taking away the least amount of your precious time.</li>
            <li>all natural no chemicals besides conditioners and shampoos</li>
            <li>It is not as smooth or nearly as narrow as the 100 dollar irons.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far (3 days apart, as I don&#x27;t wash/straighten every day)</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener after my old one, that I&#x27;d been using for years, cracked and started pulling my hair out.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a lot of broken items come from amazon honestly.</li>
            <li>it is also small which makes it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I dry thoroughly first and then straighten.</li>
            <li>Not so much because of the flat iron itself but because of the process involved.</li>
            <li>For the tough strands that don&#x27;t want to straighten out smoothly, I used a higher heat setting and it helped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;m speaking of dry hair, I get much better results when I flat iron my hair when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>Love how it is small and tiny and can be packaged to go anywhere!!</li>
            <li>I had an older model for 4 years and it finally gave out</li>
            <li>I spent a total of maybe 30-45 minutes, and my hair reaches my waist; not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>This does the job, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s as high of quality as the (several)</li>
            <li>My last one didn&#x27;t do this, so I have no clue how high the heat was on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fast too, I spend less time getting ready.</li>
            <li>I almost always use this as a regular straightener, not so much for the wet to straight aspect.</li>
            <li>cause you could do it so fast my hair is long</li>
            <li>it is small it is mighty.</li>
            <li>Remington Wet 2 Straight Slim Plate Straightening Iron!</li>
            <li>Well, there are a few reasons that not only make it different, but more convenient as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand-Remington wet 2 straight for 6 years now!</li>
            <li>Ok, so don&#x27;t expect this to be better than the chi or some other expensive hair straightner, it&#x27;s only $30!</li>
            <li>I usually pay more for my flat irons</li>
            <li>Bought another one for my friend because she had expensive Italian flat iron and wasn&#x27;t happy</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this flat iron to anyone with my hair type.</li>
            <li>Not having to dry my hair before straightening it is a real help.</li>
            <li>it leaves your hair straight without it looking dry or damaged.  </li>
            <li>I have never used it to dry my hair; this is absolutely nonsense - hair needs to be dry in order to remain straight.</li>
            <li>, plates are pretty long, it&#x27;s digital</li>
            <li>Apart from that, I was pleased with the digital setting seeing as this was the first time I used an iron like that, previously I had been using a dial-setting to adjust the heat on all my previous flat irons.</li>
            <li>: when flat ironing on wet or damp hair, do not go too close to the root on your first swipe because the evaporating steam will burn your scalp!</li>
            <li>That being said, if you just dry it slightly, it works fine.  </li>
            <li>As a regular flat iron it doesn&#x27;t straighten very well.</li>
            <li>My first attempt was with a Conair mini flat iron and the whole experience left a sour taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Remington Wet 2 Straight 1\\&quot; Slim Plate Wet/Dry Ceramic Hair</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be amazed, as you see nappy, curly wet hair go in, and sleek, straight, frizz-free hair come out.  </li>
            <li>So straightening with this not only gets your hair soft and silky as you save time.</li>
            <li>This iron really does work on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t use it to get my hair wet to straight -it</li>
            <li>The whole process takes over an hour to do and even then I have some sections that are not straight.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I not have to worry about not blow drying my hair but this straightener makes my hair unbelievably soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and this can be extremely hot &amp; possibly burn you, so you have to be careful about that</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a bit bulky &amp; heavy), but to me, it&#x27;s well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>could be better, could be worse</li>
            <li>When my hair is dry, it only takes maybe 3x going over  on the same piece of hair before it&#x27;s VERY straight.</li>
            <li>I am not so sure about the wet part (maybe it works better for thin hair and mine is curly and thick)</li>
            <li>I have a hot tools one that is a little too big, and can make my hair get really dry, and also another straightener that makes my hair very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Another reason is it will not damage your hair as much as any other straightener would.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had like four flat irons since I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m now in college and the only reason I&#x27;m getting a new flat iron</li>
            <li>i have relaxed thick hair, the first time when i washed and used the hair straightner for a while the settings were too high</li>
            <li>and this allows me to wear my hair straight without having to blow dry and flat iron, thus, saving me about an hour in styling time.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it with wet hair, since I have seen how most of the negative reviews on this straightener is when it is used with damp hair.  </li>
            <li>I had to blow dry my hair first and then flat iron and lets just say that when I was done, there was a lot of breakage and my hair didn&#x27;t even look flat</li>
            <li>After using the Wet 2 Straight iron with the CHI Iron Guard, my hair actually stays pretty  straight other than a few curled up ends.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to my old flat iron.   </li>
            <li>I have long naturally curly hair (3C hair type)</li>
            <li>Even the most difficult clothing materials can be ironed straight when wet or damp.</li>
            <li>The plates don&#x27;t touch closer to the chord part and so have to really press down.</li>
            <li>The problem is that there is little insulation between the hot plates and the outside of the device.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the expensive flat irons, and this is by far my favorite tool yet, at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li>It does work that way, but it leaves hair somewhat frizzy and not super straight and sleek</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m black with very curly pass shoulder length hair,</li>
            <li>He really loves this one as opposed to the previous Conair that I bought for him.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday with wet or dry hair, the results are OUTSTANDING for my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable</li>
            <li>since my hair can really only be managed when wet, why not get a water friendly flat iron, a wet to dry?</li>
            <li>This straightening iron really does make your hair go from wet to dry , but my hair feels crispy now.</li>
            <li>This iron works as good as the &#x27;expensive&#x27; one I previously bought.  </li>
            <li>(I usually separate mine into 3 sections, the left side, right side and the back).  </li>
            <li>The wet to straight slim plate straightener can dry and style your hair at the same time.</li>
            <li>It takes me a short time to straighten my entire head of hair (which is super thick and curly).</li>
            <li>It is very hard to maintain straight, non-frizzy, smooth hair in Florida where the humidity levels are always about 90%, this is a lot cheaper than a salon and pain-free unlike those round brushes they use at the salons that pull out a third of your hair from the scalp!</li>
            <li>You just have to dry it first with the wet setting and then turn it back to the dry setting when it&#x27;s finished drying your hair.     </li>

            <li> Amazing, works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use; it beeps when you turn it on/off, it beeps when it reaches the heat setting you want, and best of all it beeps after 30 minutes just in case you leave it on (and you can press any button to keep it</li>
            <li> This one works even better!!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great and amazing for it&#x27;s price.  </li>
            <li> If you are a college student like me, who is looking for a straightener that will leave your hair still looking good after class, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> If nobody else has reported that their hair gets pulled then this is a really good product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> , it works great on our kind of hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I received this for X-mas 2007 and loved it</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s still working good.</li>
            <li> It heats well and straightens good.</li>

            <li> and she is so happy and love it too.  </li>

            <li> and now I love it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty awesome)</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> this straightener arrived, and i love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> works amazing.</li>
            <li> straightener is amazing.</li>
            <li> The dial for heat is very reliable, although the best setting is 25 without the steam, because that&#x27;s about 350ยบ, the recommended heat setting.</li>
            <li> The ability to fully adjust the heat is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> Test it on your own hair, but as for mine--</li>
            <li> Its a nice buy for the price.</li>
            <li> (But honestly I think you should get this one cause</li>
            <li> I borrowed this from a friend to see how well I liked it before telling my family that I would like it for christmas.</li>
            <li> I have never seen my hair lay so nice</li>
            <li> and till i couldnt find in the stores with this kind of plug.</li>
            <li> This straightener does work, however I used it on my own hair and it does pull a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Excellent straight iron.</li>
            <li> My daughter is extremely thrilled with this product</li>
            <li> It was awesome  did a great job straightening semi-thick loose curls.</li>
            <li> All the reviews are RIGHT!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best straightener I have used.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 14 year old thinking the 1\\&quot; slim would be best for her to handle over the 2\\&quot;plate</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and I&#x27;ve never had a lot of it.</li>
            <li> It dries hair very quickly too, in 1-2 swipes!</li>
            <li> It still works as great as it did when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li> I like this product and have been using it for many months.</li>
            <li> One reviewer recommended reading the instructions to get better results.</li>
            <li> I am looking for another affordable straightener that will produce better results.</li>
            <li> I have medium thickness hair, and love using this at around 15-18 heat level.  </li>
            <li> Another thing I love about this straightener is that its slim plate makes it perfect for you to not only straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more like the one my mother has; but its OK.  </li>
            <li> I would rate it as just &#x27;ok&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I love this tool.  </li>
            <li> after lowering the temp, it got better.</li>
            <li> sure it would have been salon quality if i realised the wet/dry settings.</li>
            <li> I like the thinner plates because it allows more manueverability close to my scalp without burning myself.</li>
            <li> I also love the steam feature.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOO,</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT TOO</li>
            <li> but, great price and the ceramic material really protects the hair from damaging.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is the straightest it has ever been (even more so than a time I had it straightened at a salon).</li>
            <li> but could be more better.</li>
            <li> WHEN YOU CAN PURCHASE THIS REMINGTON WHICH WORKS BETTER</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this</li>
            <li> I love to ride and always wear a helmet, leaving me with a severe case of \\&quot;helmet hair\\&quot; after every ride.</li>
            <li> Even better, I no longer have to wash and straighten my hair every morning.</li>
            <li> I do use a culing iron more often but this does do the trick</li>
            <li> Love it and  recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so you can straighten it layer by layer from bottom to top.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take a month for me to get it,It was on time at my door and am just in love with it.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> but I am sure</li>
            <li> the more you use it the better you get</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and i fell in love with it</li>
            <li> one I have for $19.99 works better.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever.</li>
            <li> flat iron is perfect!!</li>
            <li> This the best iron flat I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> It still heats up perfectly, but the top plate is loose and coming off (I think the screws inside loosened up.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it and couldn&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> brand new and works great</li>
            <li> As dry it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> When I am done my hair is fully dry and the results are beautiful!  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing straightener it straigtens hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Good straightened....not great on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> And whether you choose to buy the Remington wet 2straight straightener or not I hope you are able to find the perfect straightener for you!</li>
            <li> she was very happy with it and told me that it is better than any other straighteners she has ever owned in the $50 and below price range.  </li>
            <li> The handles stay cool but you can burn yourself very easily on the heat alone.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for dry hair, because the size is easy to use and hold without getting it too close to the face.  </li>
            <li> very good product, description is the same that the seller, work pefect</li>
            <li> light, realy quick to warm up  and to control the heat</li>
            <li> There was some sticky residue on it, probably hairspray, that cleaned off easily.</li>
            <li> I hear it chips off easily.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair, yet another blessing for someone whose hair is easily damaged (I use about the mid-high 15 setting).     </li>
            <li> The lack of insulation can easily cause burns.</li>
            <li> It also heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> have fine hair, so I never go beyond the lowest setting (350).  </li>
            <li> it works fine.</li>
            <li> cause my girl friend who recommend it to me has one for over 14 months and hers is fine.</li>
            <li> and it is fine hair</li>
            <li> It looks fine when I wake up.</li>
            <li> honestly the thought of putting my wet hair in a straightener kind of scared me(I like my hair and didn&#x27;t want to burn it!)</li>
            <li> Easy temperature settings to control and glides through my hair smoothly.</li>
            <li> Received product one day early and in perfect new condition.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for doing bangs and getting rid of those little curls.</li>
            <li> Every college student can agree that time management is huge in college.</li>
            <li> This will keep it straight for twenty-four hours, which is amazing.  </li>
            <li> ANd, it&#x27;s shiny, and smooth....</li>
            <li> A light and beep</li>
            <li> I have medium length semi wavy hair and this product does a fantastic job of straightening.</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair fast and really nice.</li>
            <li> When its wet its good cause it has steam holes so its gets rid of all the water without burning it and it leaves your hair so sleek and nice and flowy</li>
            <li> before I retire old trustee he deserves a good review.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t give more than 2 stars if doesn&#x27;t do the job right.</li>
            <li> and it was so much easier she loves it!!!  </li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron for the price.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and gets the job done quickly without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> so the higher settings are better.</li>
            <li> It is a great tool for straightening if one cannot afford the flat iron that leaves about 3% moisture in your hair shaft (even after completely &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; drying it) as it costs $300-$400 or more - of course!  </li>
            <li> , my original one was the 2 inch lasted about seven years.</li>
            <li> pretty sure it was a counterfeit knock-off.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not at all dry, not frizzy and it looks great.</li>
            <li> This iron straightens quickly and easily, and cools relatively quickly too.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you buy some kind of flat iron cream, if not you might burn all your hair off.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use the &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; setting, though it&#x27;s never done anything special for me.  </li>
            <li> but she use a hair cream special for it...</li>
            <li> I own a higher end flat iron I paid over $100 for and it doesn&#x27;t do as a nice of job on my hair as the Remington.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;If used properly on wet hair, you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It did have the potential to be good</li>
            <li> Love this straight before this one</li>
            <li> I would definetly recommend this to anyone who likes having their hair straight in no time at all :)</li>
            <li> I love that curling iron, it really does</li>
            <li> I had one like 4 years ago this one is more modern</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product since I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> First, as with all straighteners I would recommend using a heat protectant (this just helps protect your hair from drying out and becoming frizzy).</li>
            <li> I still have to keep trying it out to make sure that I really want it, but I do believe that it may just stay at my house.</li>
            <li> My last straightener like this one I loved</li>
            <li> Not a bad Iron</li>
            <li> Not bad after 1800 days of use.)</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> I have not yet used the wet-to-dry feature, as I have been told it is very damaging to your hair, but on slightly damp hair it works great!</li>
            <li> favorite thing about this product is how quickly it heats up (in seconds) and beeps to let you know its ready.</li>
            <li> I was so ticked off when right before an important interview, this thing didn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li> and it is a really good flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flatiron heats up quickly and hair stays straightened longer.</li>
            <li> However, with a little time and patience your hair can look just as beautiful as theirs</li>
            <li> I have a curly and coarse hair, and I found in this product the best way to make my hair look soft, silky and straight.   </li>
            <li> flat iron curls and straightens the hair with great shine and really locks in the moisture in your hair regardless of the hair type.</li>
            <li> This straightner is amazing and makes my hair look full, shiny, healthy and cut my drying time almost in half.</li>
            <li> But, again, I value my time and cannot afford to blow dry my hair for a good thirty minutes.</li>
            <li> Everyone always has so much running through their minds so it can be easy sometimes to forget to do something.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, heats up amazingly fast, and made my hair shine.</li>
            <li> It is very slim and easy to manuever but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got super fine straight hair but often times after sleeping on it</li>
            <li> i just love it and when your hair is dry its even better</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and very frizzy and curly.  </li>
            <li> I love it that I can straighten my hair even if it&#x27;s little wet and still look great!</li>
            <li> After reading the great reviews on the Remington Wet 2 Straight iron I decided to buy it.  </li>
            <li> My wife liked it and uses it in a regular basis.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> I honestly bought this product for a weave that doesn&#x27;t get straighten with regular hair straighteners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> , Amazon rarely drops the ball but did with this.</li>
            <li> This product was cheaply made, never stayed on for more than 30 seconds and occasionally sent off sparks.</li>
            <li> This product is very good.i liked it very much,does not take much time to set my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and it shipped out quickly.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly even though this flat iron is inexpensive it works very well.  </li>
            <li> It heats quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li> I tried both the wet and dry settings after reading many great reviews on this iron.</li>
            <li> My 21-year old daughter has very long hair and said it works great.  </li>
            <li> and they are lucky enough to be able to straighten all their hair at once</li>
            <li> Knowing how great it works, its worth double this price, I have a second one in wait</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good flat iron for the price, and it&#x27;s nice to be able to use it on wet hair when I need to, but I&#x27;m considering purchasing a higher-quality ceramic flat iron, and</li>
            <li> thick hair is totally GORGEOUS! ;-) ]</li>
            <li> Straightening takes more than 5 minutes and a little more patience.</li>
            <li> It start quick and it has an auto shut off, which I really needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The result is so good and no trouble to use it at all, it&#x27;s actually pleasent.</li>
            <li> Well this is review of observation of my friend that use the hair thing, she has a very curly hair and this machine smooth her hair very well</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair straight out of the shower in conjunction with Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Smoothing Serum.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, while it looks nice when I style it, it kinks up if I let it dry on its own, and frizzes up in humid weather regardless of how nice it looks when I walk out the door.    </li>
            <li> After a quick shower, I just run my fingers through my hair, and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> It heated up quick, and I can finish getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> This one is thinner, heats up much faster and the size provides him with a way to quickly straighten his hair.</li>
            <li> Okay so I was completely skepital about buying any straightner because my hair is naturally straight</li>
            <li> It gets very hot, maintains heat, and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I would very much suggest getting it.</li>
            <li> The digital temperature is so easy to use and it heats up so quick.</li>
            <li> I love that I never have to put any extra heat on my hair.      </li>
            <li> Just the fact that you are reading this review lets me know that you are interested in this product.</li>
            <li> I personally love it and do not plan on buying a different one.</li>
            <li> Over the 6 years, I have had two of them, the first one</li>
            <li> I got this yesterday, and while at first I was overjoyed, I realized that it doesn&#x27;t seem to protect the hair in any way.</li>
            <li> It drys the hair, but it gets extremely HOT.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li> WHO NEEDS A HOT TOOLS</li>
            <li> A HOT TOOLS....</li>
            <li> After many years of use and abuse by me and 3 teen girls it was time to replace.</li>
            <li> plus with last minute out the door teens :)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s naturally pretty wavy and medium thickness.  </li>
            <li> It gets really hot though.</li>
            <li> This thing has gone through many drops, and daily use.</li>
            <li> and they really hurt!)</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll probably want to first separate your hair into sections</li>
            <li> Then take the first section of hair and use a hair clip to pin part of it up</li>
            <li> but I am sadly not one of those people.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> My old straightener was another cheap model (I got it from WalMart for about $15), so I was expecting this one to suffice.</li>
            <li> This is my first straightener</li>
            <li> I had a problem with the product, when connected to first use, something exploded in it and does not turn over, I hope your answer.</li>
            <li> I did use products to reduce the drying effects of using the hot iron.</li>
            <li> used it the first time this morning</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive at all</li>
            <li> It has been 4 days now and my hair is still straight and shiny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used on my dry hair but that alone has been a great experience.</li>
            <li> I got the 2 inch Remington wet 2 straight straightener for Christmas in 2010 and it is by far the best present I got.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite flat iron ever.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I went anywhere, I needed time for my top layer of hair to calm down a day or so before it looked smooth or go and spend 35.00 to have it blown out professionally!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find my hair stick straight and shiny and smooth, since I figured it would damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> as if was on the straightening setting very safely on the lowest setting I prefer ( the popping noise is normal when your hair is damp and never use it on soaking wet</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s barely damp, and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> My hair was still slightly damp at the top once I finished, but I was happy to wait for 10 minutes for it to dry naturally.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair kind of frizzy even with the wet 2 straight function.</li>
            <li> The first swipe I did on my first section made my hair look really curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!!  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast, works well on my already pretty straight hair.</li>
            <li> The digital controls make it extremely easy for you to adjust the heat to whatever temperature you would like, which can go up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try it with wet hair because I dont want to damage my hair, but other than that it is a great iron and leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various different flat irons to straighten my hair and so far this one has been the best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this straightener has a certain thing to help it stand, so it eventually tips over or lands on the side when I put it on the table, but it doesn&#x27;t damage anything since the non metal plastic is covering up the side, not allowing the metal to touch surface.</li>
            <li> We both get so many complements on our hair since we&#x27;ve been using them and again because of the setting (15 levels) I do not see alot of damage being done like I have with other hot irons.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality product.</li>
            <li> even though that&#x27;s not a very good idea on a regular basis, it&#x27;s nice to be able to do it occassionally.</li>
            <li> The straightner works great on my daughter&#x27;s very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Enter the super light and easily wieldable 1\\&quot;, slim but long plated Remington Wet</li>
            <li> I love wet 2 straight.</li>
            <li> But by the third swipe it was smooth and straight.  </li>
            <li> Since this product advertises using it on wet hair is okay</li>
            <li> I love the adjustable heat settings, because even as I straighten my hair, untouched parts go from wet to damp.  </li>
            <li> She really loves it.  </li>
            <li> At times I have so much going on I run out the door and forget to turn off my straightener.</li>
            <li> but I get it really straight</li>
            <li> It also stays straight until I wash it so about a week or a week and 1/2.</li>
            <li> I am very please.</li>
            <li> It really heats up in 30 seconds and the steam helps out to get your hair straight it shorter time.</li>
            <li> 2 straight</li>
            <li> 2 straight ceramic straightening iron</li>
            <li> I really like this hair iron.</li>
            <li> It takes me 25-30 minutes to go from damp hair to straight, shiny, silky hair, with NO frizz or curls.  </li>
            <li> ~ I repeat going over the whole section of hair about 3 times.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never gotten this straight before.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> People do not believe me when I say that I do not have naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li> It saves me so much time doing my hair in the mornings.</li>
            <li> 2 Straight 1\\&quot; Slim Plate Wet/Dry Ceramic Hair</li>
            <li> Also, it makes my lights flicker, haha.</li>
            <li> But im really disapointed i didn&#x27;t recieve the &amp;#34;Bonus mini straightener&amp;#34</li>
            <li> ; that was the whole reason I chose this one.</li>
            <li> so when i tried this much cheaper one, I was so suprised about how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> It really did the job and didn&#x27;t damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair much silkier and shiny to.  </li>
            <li> It gets my hair straight as I needed and is lightweight and very slick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gets heated fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would really work and</li>
            <li> thanks -maria</li>
            <li> My hair is really wavy, and it took out my waves just flattening a piece one time.</li>
            <li> I may very well just stretch out my fro with a blow dryer and be on my merry way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> 2 Straight.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re ready to hit</li>
            <li> The product in a cheap &amp;#34;Curling Iron&amp;#34; box with a sticker on it that obviously printed in China,</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I used this many times, straight out of the shower on soaking wet hair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron really heats up quick, and I really love how I can change the temperature of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> but I am almost sure that it works because this is the straightener that other females that bought the particular weave that I am about to install in my hair!</li>
            <li> My older sister owns this straightener, and after using it a few times, decided I wanted one of my own.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers who say after straightening, hair has a straw-like quality, and is not shiny or healthy looking (part of the reason I straighten).</li>
            <li> I love this brand because it can style wet!</li>
            <li> This heats up FAST, but watch out, because the sides of the iron (near the plates) get almost as hot as the plates themselves.  </li>
            <li> It heats up super fast, and the diffrent heating settings works for wet or dry hair as well as for all types of hair mine is very fine</li>
            <li> Great flat iron and lasts a few years !</li>
            <li> To give you a visual, imagine using one of those crimping irons from the 90&#x27;s--Not cool.  </li>
            <li> and you have to be patient because you have to hold the iron in each section before sliding it down some more.  </li>
            <li> I understand the top plate is supposed to be engineered to allow for water to be released as vapor through those holes, but the 2 small indentations where these vapor holes are place prevent my hair from coming out very straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed this iron does a better job than my CHI, at a fraction of the price, and it has cut my hair styling time in half.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about the straightener being so hot at first because I didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair, but I&#x27;ve been using it regularly since August and haven&#x27;t noticed any problems.     </li>
            <li> I had an older version (bought 2010) of this straightener.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly - a plus with last minute out the door teens and an auto shut off - again-a</li>
            <li> Although its not slick straight it makes it some</li>
            <li> durable and high quality.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t even need to use it on a high volume it does the work regardless.</li>
            <li> high recommend of  brand.</li>
            <li> my freshman year of high school</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and I really liked the separate setting for dry or wet hair.  </li>
            <li> After going to the salon and having my stylist straighten my hair, I decided to do a little research and invest in a slightly better iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Saved me so much $$ with getting my hair done professionally, I can do it myself.</li>
            <li> It is also soft and very shiney, which with my blow dryer and straightner</li>
            <li> It does work amazingly as a normal straightener though.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> this is the second wet 2 straight, and i love it.</li>
            <li> Plates don&#x27;t meet right, so you can&#x27;t grab smaller sections of hair.</li>
            <li> The whole process just took an hour because I am new to flat ironing so it will get much shorter with practise!</li>
            <li> I have used the iron at least 3 times since purchase on wet hair and it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> and I live in a humid climate.</li>
            <li> my dog chewed the cord so Had to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> so I think I need a new one</li>
            <li> But I ordered a new straightener and it did not appear to be so.</li>
            <li> so I had to replace with a new one.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this on wet hair and dry it straight.  </li>
            <li> After years of spending too much money trying everything I could find, using this iron along with CHI Iron Guard not only straightens my hair, but also keeps it straight.</li>
            <li> If I flat iron it from a wet state, it doesn&#x27;t get as straight as I want, but it&#x27;s a good start; I normally have to come back later and finish it off, however.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love it, and I mean it, this iron is what I was looking for, heats really fast</li>
            <li> We returned the Conair we bought at Target because it didn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this straightener as a freshman in highschool and I am currently a freshman in College.</li>
            <li> While it irons my hair even better than my old straightener, especially when wet, both my mom and a friend agree that it seems to be damaging my hair, and it gets so burned you can smell it.</li>
            <li> Its really epic!</li>
            <li> Then I start using the iron on small sections of hair, using a clip to put up the top layers.  </li>
            <li> I fully intend to buy this exact same item again.</li>
            <li> This left my hair STRAIGHT AND SHINY!</li>
            <li> This is my first flat iron and it works well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am just getting into flat irons for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> With a little bit more patience after your hair is dry you continue to use it until your hair is straight.</li>
            <li> I Love the fact that I can use it on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m trying hard to fight the urge to replace it with something better.</li>
            <li> This straightener on the other hand, keeps your hair safe and non damaged when used dry.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair like the other ones I love that I don&#x27;t have to wait for my hair to be completely dry to strain it ..</li>
            <li> Clearly, that also applies here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the mother of two children, one of them a young infant, I need all the help I can get in saving time.  </li>
            <li> I still use my old one.</li>
            <li> You need something that can leave your hair looking spot-on while still taking away the least amount of your precious time.</li>
            <li> all natural no chemicals besides conditioners and shampoos</li>
            <li> It is not as smooth or nearly as narrow as the 100 dollar irons.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far (3 days apart, as I don&#x27;t wash/straighten every day)</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener after my old one, that I&#x27;d been using for years, cracked and started pulling my hair out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of broken items come from amazon honestly.</li>
            <li> it is also small which makes it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I dry thoroughly first and then straighten.</li>
            <li> Not so much because of the flat iron itself but because of the process involved.</li>
            <li> For the tough strands that don&#x27;t want to straighten out smoothly, I used a higher heat setting and it helped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;m speaking of dry hair, I get much better results when I flat iron my hair when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Love how it is small and tiny and can be packaged to go anywhere!!</li>
            <li> I had an older model for 4 years and it finally gave out</li>
            <li> I spent a total of maybe 30-45 minutes, and my hair reaches my waist; not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> This does the job, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s as high of quality as the (several)</li>
            <li> My last one didn&#x27;t do this, so I have no clue how high the heat was on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fast too, I spend less time getting ready.</li>
            <li> I almost always use this as a regular straightener, not so much for the wet to straight aspect.</li>
            <li> cause you could do it so fast my hair is long</li>
            <li> it is small it is mighty.</li>
            <li> Remington Wet 2 Straight Slim Plate Straightening Iron!</li>
            <li> Well, there are a few reasons that not only make it different, but more convenient as well.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand-Remington wet 2 straight for 6 years now!</li>
            <li> Ok, so don&#x27;t expect this to be better than the chi or some other expensive hair straightner, it&#x27;s only $30!</li>
            <li> I usually pay more for my flat irons</li>
            <li> Bought another one for my friend because she had expensive Italian flat iron and wasn&#x27;t happy</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this flat iron to anyone with my hair type.</li>
            <li> Not having to dry my hair before straightening it is a real help.</li>
            <li> it leaves your hair straight without it looking dry or damaged.  </li>
            <li> I have never used it to dry my hair; this is absolutely nonsense - hair needs to be dry in order to remain straight.</li>
            <li> , plates are pretty long, it&#x27;s digital</li>
            <li> Apart from that, I was pleased with the digital setting seeing as this was the first time I used an iron like that, previously I had been using a dial-setting to adjust the heat on all my previous flat irons.</li>
            <li> : when flat ironing on wet or damp hair, do not go too close to the root on your first swipe because the evaporating steam will burn your scalp!</li>
            <li> That being said, if you just dry it slightly, it works fine.  </li>
            <li> As a regular flat iron it doesn&#x27;t straighten very well.</li>
            <li> My first attempt was with a Conair mini flat iron and the whole experience left a sour taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Remington Wet 2 Straight 1\\&quot; Slim Plate Wet/Dry Ceramic Hair</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be amazed, as you see nappy, curly wet hair go in, and sleek, straight, frizz-free hair come out.  </li>
            <li> So straightening with this not only gets your hair soft and silky as you save time.</li>
            <li> This iron really does work on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t use it to get my hair wet to straight -it</li>
            <li> The whole process takes over an hour to do and even then I have some sections that are not straight.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I not have to worry about not blow drying my hair but this straightener makes my hair unbelievably soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and this can be extremely hot &amp; possibly burn you, so you have to be careful about that</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a bit bulky &amp; heavy), but to me, it&#x27;s well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> could be better, could be worse</li>
            <li> When my hair is dry, it only takes maybe 3x going over  on the same piece of hair before it&#x27;s VERY straight.</li>
            <li> I am not so sure about the wet part (maybe it works better for thin hair and mine is curly and thick)</li>
            <li> I have a hot tools one that is a little too big, and can make my hair get really dry, and also another straightener that makes my hair very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Another reason is it will not damage your hair as much as any other straightener would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had like four flat irons since I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now in college and the only reason I&#x27;m getting a new flat iron</li>
            <li> i have relaxed thick hair, the first time when i washed and used the hair straightner for a while the settings were too high</li>
            <li> and this allows me to wear my hair straight without having to blow dry and flat iron, thus, saving me about an hour in styling time.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it with wet hair, since I have seen how most of the negative reviews on this straightener is when it is used with damp hair.  </li>
            <li> I had to blow dry my hair first and then flat iron and lets just say that when I was done, there was a lot of breakage and my hair didn&#x27;t even look flat</li>
            <li> After using the Wet 2 Straight iron with the CHI Iron Guard, my hair actually stays pretty  straight other than a few curled up ends.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to my old flat iron.   </li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair (3C hair type)</li>
            <li> Even the most difficult clothing materials can be ironed straight when wet or damp.</li>
            <li> The plates don&#x27;t touch closer to the chord part and so have to really press down.</li>
            <li> The problem is that there is little insulation between the hot plates and the outside of the device.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the expensive flat irons, and this is by far my favorite tool yet, at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> It does work that way, but it leaves hair somewhat frizzy and not super straight and sleek</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with very curly pass shoulder length hair,</li>
            <li> He really loves this one as opposed to the previous Conair that I bought for him.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday with wet or dry hair, the results are OUTSTANDING for my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable</li>
            <li> since my hair can really only be managed when wet, why not get a water friendly flat iron, a wet to dry?</li>
            <li> This straightening iron really does make your hair go from wet to dry , but my hair feels crispy now.</li>
            <li> This iron works as good as the &#x27;expensive&#x27; one I previously bought.  </li>
            <li> (I usually separate mine into 3 sections, the left side, right side and the back).  </li>
            <li> The wet to straight slim plate straightener can dry and style your hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> It takes me a short time to straighten my entire head of hair (which is super thick and curly).</li>
            <li> It is very hard to maintain straight, non-frizzy, smooth hair in Florida where the humidity levels are always about 90%, this is a lot cheaper than a salon and pain-free unlike those round brushes they use at the salons that pull out a third of your hair from the scalp!</li>
            <li> You just have to dry it first with the wet setting and then turn it back to the dry setting when it&#x27;s finished drying your hair.     </li>
            <li> My hair did seem less wavy than it does when I only blow dry, but I was disappointed that my hair is not as straight as it was with my former straightner that died after 5 good years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several flat Irons.</li>
            <li> Then I take my hair down, use a little Paul Mitchell Super Skinny, and I use my regular hair dryer only to briefly dry the roots of my hair at the crown (I saw this suggestion on a YouTube video!).  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that it did not take as long as expected to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> Its a lot easier if you have someone straighten your hair FOR you when its wet because the steam can easily burn you and after a while your arms will get tired.</li>
            <li> Because the plates don&#x27;t meet all the way down (only at the very tip), you have to try to force it down by hand for equal heating.</li>
            <li> (By the way, if you are flat ironining and not using a heat protectant, you</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because the price.</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron</li>
            <li> But since my hair is damaged, I need a flat iron with tourmaline and ceramic</li>
            <li> Well, I just got this flat iron today.</li>
            <li> Literally I just flat ironed my hair with it</li>
            <li> almost gave up on flat ironing as a styling option but decided look up steam flat irons when a thought occurred to me,</li>
            <li> Lesson learned- don&#x27;t skimp on a flat iron.</li>
            <li> This morning, I let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes, just long enough to have some stringy, kinky, frizzy curls starting to develop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First it&#x27;s hard to straight your hair and Second &amp;#34;wet to dry&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t work at all !!!!!</li>
            <li> One of the reasons has to be its ability to dry and style your hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> I need to dry my hair before using the iron, I ordered this item and it arrived in a different box than the box on pictures, it made me believe that it is a refurbrished item, althought this iron has a hight temperature and you save time.</li>
            <li> Now, I will admit it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone because they are not use to the wet to straight thing, they try to dry the hair then straighten on the second round</li>
            <li> I have super thin shoulder length hair, but am still always looking for shortcuts.</li>
            <li> &amp;&amp; another reviewer said the plates are merely coated, not exactly pure ceramic--not sure of the validity</li>
            <li> First let me point out that you should never use any sort of hair styling iron on wet hair because you will basically end up damaging your hair to some degree (but given that I am half black, I was essentially born with damaged hair).  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal, just a minor complaint really.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t see any other flat iron including the more expensive ones catering to my hair needs like this one does.</li>
            <li> I owned this straightener for five years until it recently broke on me (the plate came loose).</li>
            <li> but I find that I&#x27;m not really saving any time as it takes double as long as a hair dryer to actually get your hair dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was difficult at first to get the wet-to-straight thing down, but I finally did manage to get this iron to work on wet hair; the trick for me was not going too fast and waiting in between passes a bit to let the iron get back up to temperature.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend actually broke my other flat iron that I was using which was a pro tools flat iron.</li>
            <li> Sucks the price is so much.</li>
            <li> I also like the beeping to let you know it&#x27;s been on too long</li>
            <li> Strangely, for me the iron flattens but does not straighten hair.</li>
            <li> It means that I can straighten my hair before bed, wake up, and go with only minimal touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> I wish somebody would recomend this thing long time ago.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised when this device dried my hair just as the description claimed it would.</li>
            <li> My old straightner really killed it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I&#x27;m mixed with Italian and Black.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron a few months ago to use on my hair, which is not particularly curly but sometimes will have a little wave (or do whatever it wants on the ends, which I prefer to be straight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , if you do use it as wet to straight, watch where you put your fingers, because (duh) steam is created from the wet hair, and there is a definite possibility of burning yourself if you aren&#x27;t paying attention.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s crazy how this works better for my hair then other flat irons which cost in the 100$ range.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be looking for the ability to flat iron wet hair.</li>
            <li> You may be wondering, what makes this straightener different from any other one?</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It took me about the same amount of time that it would doing my other routine</li>
            <li> I only wish I would have saved myself the money and gone to Amazon and trolled the reviews before buying my other ones at Walmart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This straightener saved me from having to blow dry my hair since it dries it as I am styling it.</li>
            <li> Because the straightener can blow dry your hair while styling it.</li>
            <li> Dry setting:    </li>
            <li> , there is still a dry setting on the instructions that come with it.</li>
            <li> I towel dry my hair, put in products and use the tool.</li>
            <li> ~ that is why I dry the roots</li>
            <li> but I still find when I use it all the way out to the ends of my hair, it is dry.  </li>
            <li> After reading a ton of reviews, I chose this one because it took the work out of having to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It does tend to make your hair look dry though instead of shiny.</li>
            <li> I usually swipe the iron near the roots 3-4 times and then bring the iron through the rest of that section of hair</li>
            <li> None of the other straighteners I bought before worked even remotely as well and this was about the same price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American female and my natural hair texture is very thick!</li>
            <li> However, the power button and heat buttons on the side are so tiny and recessed into the handle, that they are impossible to press easily.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is, of course, necessary to set the iron at a higher temperature when using it on wet hair, and so it&#x27;s probably necessary to pay attention and turn it down a bit after the hair gets dry so you don&#x27;t damage it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So u get the dry hair along with the straightener!</li>
            <li> It DOES straighten wet hair, though I do not know how well it works on dry hair because I have not put it to that use as of yet.</li>
            <li> It straightens dry hair, and it drys wet hair.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t find any difference b/w the wet and the dry options.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it was advertised as being purple, but when we received it, it was actually black.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, processed by color</li>
            <li> I have very culry thick hair and tried different straightner&#x27;s in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to the handle being so short, or with the iron not opening so wide compared to my previous one.</li>
            <li> I was also a little annoyed that the normal setting when turning it on is always at the mid 15 with wet setting applied, I just wish it would remember the settings you last had</li>
            <li> I have very curly, coarse hair that is difficult to straighten.  </li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m out of the money i spent</li>
            <li> Wet setting:    </li>
            <li> It does what it says and straightens wet hair</li>
            <li> Even when I&#x27;m using it to straighten my wet hair</li>
            <li> wet</li>
            <li> Buy this remington wet</li>
            <li> I also like the option of using it on wet hair -</li>
            <li> Also, I like the automatic shut off and how you can lock it closed.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit longer when straightening wet hair</li>
            <li> w/ the dryer for a few seconds before starting.  </li>
            <li> Just b careful with the steam you can burn yourself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on wet hair, so I can&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
            <li> B0009OAFWU Remington  Wet</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only had it a few days</li>
            <li> I iron my hair while it&#x27;s still wet</li>
            <li> my hair was wet</li>
            <li> wet</li>
            <li> I can set my wet hair too.i will recommend this.</li>
            <li> I alos use the larger iron that&#x27;s over 2 inches thick - Same brand.</li>
            <li> not only do I not hear her complain about bad hair days when she cant get her hair straight, she uses it with ease!!!</li>
            <li> I should have known a flat iron that costs as little as this one did would break.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those two little downsides are minor.  </li>
            <li> My old one used to do that soo much that I would loose three or four hairs because it snagged so badly.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other&#x27;s reviews...</li>
            <li> This may be due to the texture of my hair, though.  </li>
            <li> I had my other one for 4 to 5 years</li>
            <li> My other straightner was about $70</li>
            <li> I had an expensive iso that broke within the first 6 months after one drop on the floor.</li>
            <li> I know because I wet my hair and used it!</li>
            <li> Also, this also has the option to straighten your hair without the stem for wet hair!</li>
            <li> and it did not get any curl back after 4 hours which my hair usually does.</li>
            <li> ironed enough so the hours invested felt pointless.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for so long &amp; basically understand all too well about working with what you&#x27;ve got (my uniquely half asian/half black hair taught me that)</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s going to take longer to straighten wet hair, that&#x27;s common sense.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is not worth getting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten too close to my ears and it&#x27;s not fun.  </li>
            <li> , that may stay moist at times, with an ionic blowdryer in 5 minutes and it looks as if I had spent a few hours at the salon.  </li>
            <li> It cut down my hair routine a lot.</li>
            <li> So I do not have to worry about burning down my apartment one of these days that I forget to turn it</li>
            <li> I usually use it on dry hair because its saves time and is easier to do.   </li>
            <li> it was usually corse and dry.</li>
            <li> Even worse, helmets cause my thin hair to get wet and kink up when my head perspires in hot weather.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m praying it won&#x27;t conk out on me in less than 2 years.</li>
            <li> It is still wavy, just less puffy.</li>
            <li> But, it is also less time consuming.</li>
            <li> so I need less heat</li>
            <li> I do this less than 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> and i finish in less then a hour</li>
            <li> I use to get it for half that at a beauty store.</li>
            <li> Mines stop Working in less than a month</li>
            <li> In the end, this flat iron was a complete disappointment:  1.)</li>
            <li> my hair will be damp, but there are days when I&#x27;m in a big hurry that I end up straightening my hair while still damp (still not a good thing to do).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually opposed to the idea of putting a straightener on wet hair, but because of the steam feature, it allows me to do that without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m often left holding the iron at an uncomfortable angle that makes me feel like I&#x27;m not effectively straightening my hair or I place my hand too far up</li>
            <li> and I have long, thick, curly/frizzy hair.   </li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to as it feels a bit awkward at first</li>
            <li> I got this for a few bucks less than the stores offer, I got it because I know it works</li>
            <li> With a little finesse, it will though.  </li>
            <li> but It does tend to pull a little.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this guy</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get the roots of my hair completely dry, but it does the trick and it saves a step in my overall hair \\&quot;routine\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Usually I blow dry my hair and then use my CHI Turbo iron on small sections.  </li>
            <li> , I thought maybe it won&#x27;t be any worse than my previous flat iron (Conair I</li>
            <li> One thing to be wary of is if the hair at the roots is too wet there will be a lot of steam (!)</li>
            <li> I also have quite a few split ends, but I don&#x27;t know if I can blame that on the straightener.</li>
            <li> Then, using this tool, I had my hair completely dried and styled in about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is thin enough (1 in.)</li>
            <li> Even thought the plates aren&#x27;t very big, it does the job for my thick thick hair.</li>
            <li> If I used to take at least 2 hours straightening my hair with this one I take only a hour, hour and half!!!</li>
            <li> It works on my thick hair extremely well.</li>
            <li> it came with a small traveling one.</li>
            <li> I was given this straightner as a gift last chirstmas and was skeptical of it.</li>
            <li> It does what it says,but its not a magical wand.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want stick-straight hair, you can also turn it over or under to add a small of wave or curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> [if not more because let&#x27;s face it</li>
            <li> , so I hope this one works just as well.... :-/</li>
            <li> THIS heats up with in less then a minute!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not sit too flat, so it is difficult to have it sit upright.</li>
            <li> other bad thing about this flat iron is that my hair sometimes gets caght beside the plates.</li>
            <li> Grabbing the \\&quot;baby hair\\&quot; near forehead and temples is impossible.  </li>
            <li> and they can be hard to straighten.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s confusing for some people though, because my friends tried to use it and had no idea</li>
            <li> just goes against my common sense-</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for that I would give at least 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have medium length thick hair prone to frizziness</li>
            <li> but it works for my sister too who has wavy, extremely thick hair, but she has a relaxer.</li>
            <li> She has thick curly hair and it works well for her.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, if your hair is thick (like mine)</li>
            <li> no more!  </li>
            <li> I was in need of a flat iron because I can not go a day without one or else my hair looks bad.</li>
            <li> poor quality, poor design, hard to hold</li>
            <li> Before it is too late!</li>
            <li> Although it is very hard to get out of the packaging</li>
            <li> but my daughters is very thick</li>
            <li> I bought this after my CON AIR straightener got broken....</li>
            <li> Sometimes the plates will snag ONE strand of hair and it HURTS worse than burning yourself</li>
            <li> , I used to HATE to wash my hair same day</li>
            <li> Do you hate the hassle of having to blow dry your hair before you can straighten it?</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, wavy and difficult to style!</li>
            <li> So dont expect to look like u came from an expensive salon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so sorry that happened to you</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get terrible results, fly-aways, and from what I&#x27;ve always been told, you should never flat-iron wet hair because it is basically boiling the strands.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t expect that from Remington&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> read a comment from someone that the steam badly burned their scalp.</li>
            <li> so it wont damage my hair too bad than it already is.</li>
            <li> u wouldn&#x27;t disappointed</li>
            <li> I use a spray on glosser that has an olive oil base that I love.&lt;br /&gt;Second, there are steam holes on the side of the straightener.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> boy was I wrong!!!</li>

            <li> Heats up fast, works well on my already pretty straight hair. Seems like a repackage though. There was some sticky residue on it, probably hairspray, that cleaned off easily.</li>
            <li> poor quality, poor design, hard to hold</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron for the price.  It start quick and it has an auto shut off, which I really needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not sit too flat, so it is difficult to have it sit upright. With a little finesse, it will though.  Recommend for sure!</li>
            <li> I like this product and have been using it for many months. It is easy to handle and gets the job done quickly without damaging my hair. I would purchase this product again and have recommended to friends who also are happy with it. This company makes durable products.</li>
            <li> First let me point out that you should never use any sort of hair styling iron on wet hair because you will basically end up damaging your hair to some degree (but given that I am half black, I was essentially born with damaged hair).  Anyways, I must put oil in my hair prior to straightening &amp; let it soak in otherwise my hair will be damp, but there are days when I&#x27;m in a big hurry that I end up straightening my hair while still damp (still not a good thing to do). Since this product advertises using it on wet hair is okay, I thought maybe it won&#x27;t be any worse than my previous flat iron (Conair I think?--I purchased it during a hair emergency moment).  In the end, this flat iron was a complete disappointment:  1.) I understand the top plate is supposed to be engineered to allow for water to be released as vapor through those holes, but the 2 small indentations where these vapor holes are place prevent my hair from coming out very straight. To give you a visual, imagine using one of those crimping irons from the 90&#x27;s--Not cool.  2.) I&#x27;m not used to the handle being so short, or with the iron not opening so wide compared to my previous one. I&#x27;m often left holding the iron at an uncomfortable angle that makes me feel like I&#x27;m not effectively straightening my hair or I place my hand too far up that I burn myself.  3.) I was also a little annoyed that the normal setting when turning it on is always at the mid 15 with wet setting applied, I just wish it would remember the settings you last had so you don&#x27;t constantly have to change it every time. Not a big deal, just a minor complaint really.  4.) &amp;&amp; another reviewer said the plates are merely coated, not exactly pure ceramic--not sure of the validity but I&#x27;ve used coated plates before with no problem, but this one definitely feels a bit \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;.  Apart from that, I was pleased with the digital setting seeing as this was the first time I used an iron like that, previously I had been using a dial-setting to adjust the heat on all my previous flat irons. I also like the beeping to let you know it&#x27;s been on too long in case you want to keep it on or let it turn off. Regardless, I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair for so long &amp; basically understand all too well about working with what you&#x27;ve got (my uniquely half asian/half black hair taught me that) so I&#x27;m making this iron work for me. I&#x27;ve only used it for 1 day but I&#x27;m praying it won&#x27;t conk out on me in less than 2 years. At the same time, I&#x27;m hoping I can stand to use it because it has upped my straightening time to 1:15 hrs, plus it was a gift from the bf so I&#x27;m trying hard to fight the urge to replace it with something better.</li>
            <li> I tried both the wet and dry settings after reading many great reviews on this iron. One reviewer recommended reading the instructions to get better results. I have medium length thick hair prone to frizziness and I live in a humid climate. My hair did seem less wavy than it does when I only blow dry, but I was disappointed that my hair is not as straight as it was with my former straightner that died after 5 good years. I agree with other reviewers who say after straightening, hair has a straw-like quality, and is not shiny or healthy looking (part of the reason I straighten). Strangely, for me the iron flattens but does not straighten hair. It is still wavy, just less puffy. I am looking for another affordable straightener that will produce better results.</li>
            <li> Remington Wet 2 Straight 1\\&quot; Slim Plate Wet/Dry Ceramic Hair Straightening Iron with Tourmaline is a very good product, I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron a few months ago to use on my hair, which is not particularly curly but sometimes will have a little wave (or do whatever it wants on the ends, which I prefer to be straight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was difficult at first to get the wet-to-straight thing down, but I finally did manage to get this iron to work on wet hair; the trick for me was not going too fast and waiting in between passes a bit to let the iron get back up to temperature. Unfortunately, it is, of course, necessary to set the iron at a higher temperature when using it on wet hair, and so it&#x27;s probably necessary to pay attention and turn it down a bit after the hair gets dry so you don&#x27;t damage it as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m speaking of dry hair, I get much better results when I flat iron my hair when it&#x27;s dry. If I flat iron it from a wet state, it doesn&#x27;t get as straight as I want, but it&#x27;s a good start; I normally have to come back later and finish it off, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other bad thing about this flat iron is that my hair sometimes gets caght beside the plates. I also have quite a few split ends, but I don&#x27;t know if I can blame that on the straightener. (By the way, if you are flat ironining and not using a heat protectant, you should.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good flat iron for the price, and it&#x27;s nice to be able to use it on wet hair when I need to, but I&#x27;m considering purchasing a higher-quality ceramic flat iron, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be looking for the ability to flat iron wet hair.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent styling tool!  I love the adjustable heat settings, because even as I straighten my hair, untouched parts go from wet to damp.  I love that I never have to put any extra heat on my hair.      My hair is fine and very frizzy and curly.  This will keep it straight for twenty-four hours, which is amazing.  It means that I can straighten my hair before bed, wake up, and go with only minimal touch-ups.  As the mother of two children, one of them a young infant, I need all the help I can get in saving time.  Not having to dry my hair before straightening it is a real help.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She really loves it.  Her hair looks great.</li>
            <li> it leaves your hair straight without it looking dry or damaged.  it is also small which makes it easy to travel with. definately the best straightener i have</li>
            <li> My 21-year old daughter has very long hair and said it works great.  We returned the Conair we bought at Target because it didn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t work on my daughters hair so i&#x27;m out of the money i spent plus i had to go buy a different one</li>
            <li> Plates don&#x27;t meet right, so you can&#x27;t grab smaller sections of hair. Grabbing the \\&quot;baby hair\\&quot; near forehead and temples is impossible.  Maybe it was just lack of quality control and mine was messed up? I got it at ulta and at the time it came with a small traveling one. The smal one doesn&#x27;t have this problem. It did have the potential to be good, plates are pretty long, it&#x27;s digital but I can&#x27;t give more than 2 stars if doesn&#x27;t do the job right. I have never used it to dry my hair; this is absolutely nonsense - hair needs to be dry in order to remain straight.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best straightener I have used.  I have a hot tools one that is a little too big, and can make my hair get really dry, and also another straightener that makes my hair very frizzy.  This straightener on the other hand, keeps your hair safe and non damaged when used dry.  I have medium thickness hair, and love using this at around 15-18 heat level.  I haven&#x27;t tried it with wet hair, since I have seen how most of the negative reviews on this straightener is when it is used with damp hair.  It is perfect for dry hair, because the size is easy to use and hold without getting it too close to the face.  I don&#x27;t think this straightener has a certain thing to help it stand, so it eventually tips over or lands on the side when I put it on the table, but it doesn&#x27;t damage anything since the non metal plastic is covering up the side, not allowing the metal to touch surface.</li>
            <li> My wife liked it and uses it in a regular basis. If she is happy,  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I almost always use this as a regular straightener, not so much for the wet to straight aspect. It does work that way, but it leaves hair somewhat frizzy and not super straight and sleek like I would want my straightener to. It does work amazingly as a normal straightener though.&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you do use it as wet to straight, watch where you put your fingers, because (duh) steam is created from the wet hair, and there is a definite possibility of burning yourself if you aren&#x27;t paying attention.</li>
            <li> Siempre compro รฉste tipo de planchas que permiten tener tu cabello mojado y secarlo instantรกneamente, asรญ no necesitas airear el pelo para que estรฉ seco y usar una plancha corriente. Uso remington wet2straight desde hace 7 aรฑos y la primera plancha que comprรฉ se me daรฑรณ hace tan solo 6 meses (6.5aรฑos de uso) aunque no por causas atribuibles a su fabricaciรณn, sino porque รฉste modelo ya viejito era de los que no tenรญan el cable \\&quot;loco\\&quot; que gira en todas las direcciones, el arreglo me costรณ Usd12 y sigue funcionando! Recomiendo ampliamente รฉste tipo de planchas, tengo en todos los tamaรฑos, con cuerpo curvo, anchas y delgadas, protege mi cabello de la horquilla y el desgaste, soy fan #1!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other&#x27;s reviews...I still use my old one. It leaves my hair kind of frizzy even with the wet 2 straight function.</li>
            <li> This does a great job. It cut down my hair routine a lot. My hair always looked great using this.</li>
            <li> Do you hate the hassle of having to blow dry your hair before you can straighten it? Do you want softer, smoother and shinier hair? Well, I have got your solution; yes you guessed it, Remington Wet 2 Straight Slim Plate Straightening Iron! Just the fact that you are reading this review lets me know that you are interested in this product. So I am here to tell you why you should order it today! Not only is it at an affordable price of only $34.99. But, it is also less time consuming. You may be wondering, what makes this straightener different from any other one? Well, there are a few reasons that not only make it different, but more convenient as well.&lt;br /&gt;  One of the reasons has to be its ability to dry and style your hair at the same time. One thing I dislike and try to keep myself from doing is blow drying my hair. I personally find it time consuming and it damages your hair. Yes, I know I can buy products to prevent that from happening. But, again, I value my time and cannot afford to blow dry my hair for a good thirty minutes. This straightener saved me from having to blow dry my hair since it dries it as I am styling it. The digital controls make it extremely easy for you to adjust the heat to whatever temperature you would like, which can go up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Another thing I love about this straightener is that its slim plate makes it perfect for you to not only straighten your hair. But, curl it as well! Simply look up tutorials on YouTube and how to curl your hair with a straightener and you will get the hang of it with some practice. And once you do get the hang of it, it can take you about twenty minutes to curl your hair.  Of course the time may vary depending on the length of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;  I first purchased this straightener as a freshman in highschool and I am currently a freshman in College. It still works as great as it did when I first purchased it. I personally love it and do not plan on buying a different one. If you are a college student like me, who is looking for a straightener that will leave your hair still looking good after class, this is the product for you. Every college student can agree that time management is huge in college. You need something that can leave your hair looking spot-on while still taking away the least amount of your precious time. This straightener takes only thirty seconds to heat up. And it will start beeping once it is done heating up.&lt;br /&gt;  Everyone always has so much running through their minds so it can be easy sometimes to forget to do something. At times I have so much going on I run out the door and forget to turn off my straightener. Later I find myself contemplating if I did or did not turn it off. But, then I remember that the straightener automatically shuts off after sixty minutes. So I do not have to worry about burning down my apartment one of these days that I forget to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;  Remington is a trusted brand that has been around for over seventy years. The wet to straight slim plate straightener can dry and style your hair at the same time. Another reason is it will not damage your hair as much as any other straightener would. The steam hydration therapy will protect your hair. The best part has to be that it will save you time and money! After I purchased my straightener I no longer needed a blow dryer or a curling iron. Because the straightener can blow dry your hair while styling it. And, if you feel like curling your hair the straightener can do that as well. So, keeping all that in mind, why are you still reading this? Order yours today! Before it is too late!</li>
            <li> I have had this for about 3 years, now. It&#x27;s finally loosing life. This is a great straightener. Obviously it&#x27;s going to take longer to straighten wet hair, that&#x27;s common sense. I have never had a problem with this. I would very much suggest getting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand-Remington wet 2 straight for 6 years now! I&#x27;m black with very curly pass shoulder length hair, all natural no chemicals besides conditioners and shampoos lol.  Over the 6 years, I have had two of them, the first one my dog chewed the cord so Had to buy a new one.  Ive had the newer one for about 4-5 years now so I think I need a new one lol even though it still works great.  Now, I will admit it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone because they are not use to the wet to straight thing, they try to dry the hair then straighten on the second round but it works for my sister too who has wavy, extremely thick hair, but she has a relaxer. We both swear by them!  It takes me about 2 hours to straighten my hair but I get it really straight no one can get my hair straighter than me.  It also stays straight until I wash it so about a week or a week and 1/2.</li>
            <li> All the reviews are RIGHT!!! It&#x27;s all true!!!! This is a LIFESAVER!!!! I have super thin shoulder length hair, but am still always looking for shortcuts. This morning, I let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes, just long enough to have some stringy, kinky, frizzy curls starting to develop. Then, using this tool, I had my hair completely dried and styled in about 7 minutes. WONDERFUL!!! ANd, it&#x27;s shiny, and smooth....WONDERFUL. Just take your time, you have to run the iron along your hair SLOOOOOOOWWWWWLY, to allow it to suck out all the moisture. You&#x27;ll be amazed, as you see nappy, curly wet hair go in, and sleek, straight, frizz-free hair come out.  I&#x27;ve had the expensive flat irons, and this is by far my favorite tool yet, at an unbeatable price. its GENIUS.</li>
            <li> I alos use the larger iron that&#x27;s over 2 inches thick - Same brand. I love this brand because it can style wet! I have had 5 or 6 different hair irons over the years and I would say Remington is number one. I am very please. Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this yesterday, and while at first I was overjoyed, I realized that it doesn&#x27;t seem to protect the hair in any way. While it irons my hair even better than my old straightener, especially when wet, both my mom and a friend agree that it seems to be damaging my hair, and it gets so burned you can smell it. Definitely use a heat protectant.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is not worth getting. It stopped working after 3 months of use. I have never had a hair straightener do this!!</li>
            <li> Great straightener.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I like this item.  I thought it would be more like the one my mother has; but its OK.  I would rate this item at 4 stars.  It drys the hair, but it gets extremely HOT.  So I set it at a very low temperature.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my CON AIR straightener got broken.... this is my best acquisition!! I have a curly and coarse hair, and I found in this product the best way to make my hair look soft, silky and straight.   It really heats up in 30 seconds and the steam helps out to get your hair straight it shorter time. So straightening with this not only gets your hair soft and silky as you save time. If I used to take at least 2 hours straightening my hair with this one I take only a hour, hour and half!!!</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this on wet hair and dry it straight.  It is difficult to get the roots of my hair completely dry, but it does the trick and it saves a step in my overall hair \\&quot;routine\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I use it everyday with wet or dry hair, the results are OUTSTANDING for my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable Price Point.</li>
            <li> Ok, so don&#x27;t expect this to be better than the chi or some other expensive hair straightner, it&#x27;s only $30! It&#x27;s great; it gets the job done.     Dry setting:    I have thick/wavy hair that frizzes and poofs. This iron keeps it from poofing, although it doesn&#x27;t get it slick-straight. The dial for heat is very reliable, although the best setting is 25 without the steam, because that&#x27;s about 350ยบ, the recommended heat setting. It&#x27;s confusing for some people though, because my friends tried to use it and had no idea how! They were burned because when this straightner turns on it goes directly to the wet setting.     Wet setting:    It doesn&#x27;t straighten, but dries. It&#x27;s a heck of a lot easier to use than a blow drier! The only reason why it doesn&#x27;t straighten is just my hair, because of the steam it frizzes cause that&#x27;s just what my hair does in humidity! But if you want to take a shower, and then straighten your hair, this is great. You just have to dry it first with the wet setting and then turn it back to the dry setting when it&#x27;s finished drying your hair.     One last thing, this straightener&#x27;s plates are only COATED with ceramic! So be warned! I hear it chips off easily.</li>
            <li> This straightening iron really does make your hair go from wet to dry , but my hair feels crispy now. It also pulls your hair while your straightening.</li>
            <li> This iron really does work on wet hair.  It is a bit bulky but seems to work well for a 25 dollar iron.  It is not as smooth or nearly as narrow as the 100 dollar irons.  The only drawback is that sometimes a hair or two gets snagged on the ends of the plates and gets pulled out.  This may be due to the texture of my hair, though.  If nobody else has reported that their hair gets pulled then this is a really good product.</li>
            <li> perfect i love the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this hair straightener. It works on my thick hair extremely well.</li>
            <li> Love this straight before this one I had my other one for 4 to 5 years it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair like the other ones I love that I don&#x27;t have to wait for my hair to be completely dry to strain it ..</li>
            <li> I usually pay more for my flat irons but my friend has this one and loves it. It does what it says and straightens wet hair but I find it makes my hair look frizzy. As a regular flat iron it doesn&#x27;t straighten very well. I would rate it as just &#x27;ok&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I love this tool.  I have one and so does my daughter. It heats up super fast, and the diffrent heating settings works for wet or dry hair as well as for all types of hair mine is very fine so I need less heat but my daughters is very thick so the higher settings are better. We both get so many complements on our hair since we&#x27;ve been using them and again because of the setting (15 levels) I do not see alot of damage being done like I have with other hot irons.  I would definetly recommend this to anyone who likes having their hair straight in no time at all :)</li>
            <li> well worth the price. i have used it a couple of times and still getteing the hang of it. i have relaxed thick hair, the first time when i washed and used the hair straightner for a while the settings were too high so it wasn&#x27;t coming out as i hoped, or seen when my hair dresser uses it on my hair. after lowering the temp, it got better. sure it would have been salon quality if i realised the wet/dry settings. cant&#x27;t wait to wash my hair and try it again.</li>
            <li> Even thought the plates aren&#x27;t very big, it does the job for my thick thick hair. Although I don&#x27;t use it to get my hair wet to straight -it just goes against my common sense-, there is still a dry setting on the instructions that come with it. It&#x27;s very easy to use; it beeps when you turn it on/off, it beeps when it reaches the heat setting you want, and best of all it beeps after 30 minutes just in case you leave it on (and you can press any button to keep it on if you&#x27;re not quite done yet!).</li>
            <li> durable and high quality.  It heats up fast and I really liked the separate setting for dry or wet hair.  The ability to fully adjust the heat is a nice feature.  A light and beep let you know when the heat has reached the desired setting.  Very high quality product.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap-o straightening iron I got from a drugstore and it did a great job.  After going to the salon and having my stylist straighten my hair, I decided to do a little research and invest in a slightly better iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, so I never go beyond the lowest setting (350).  This heats up FAST, but watch out, because the sides of the iron (near the plates) get almost as hot as the plates themselves.  I&#x27;ve gotten too close to my ears and it&#x27;s not fun.  Sometimes the plates will snag ONE strand of hair and it HURTS worse than burning yourself (what&#x27;s up with that?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those two little downsides are minor.  This iron straightens quickly and easily, and cools relatively quickly too.  Sometimes I use the &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; setting, though it&#x27;s never done anything special for me.  Lastly, I don&#x27;t know why they advertise it as WET 2 STRAIGHT, because I would NOT RECOMMEND USING THIS ON WET HAIR.  You&#x27;ll get terrible results, fly-aways, and from what I&#x27;ve always been told, you should never flat-iron wet hair because it is basically boiling the strands.  Test it on your own hair, but as for mine-- I dry thoroughly first and then straighten.</li>
            <li> My older sister owns this straightener, and after using it a few times, decided I wanted one of my own. It heats quickly and stays hot. I like the thinner plates because it allows more manueverability close to my scalp without burning myself. I also love the steam feature. I&#x27;m usually opposed to the idea of putting a straightener on wet hair, but because of the steam feature, it allows me to do that without damaging my hair. I was worried about the straightener being so hot at first because I didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair, but I&#x27;ve been using it regularly since August and haven&#x27;t noticed any problems.     I can&#x27;t believe people pay upwards of $100 for hair straighteners. This is a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> The plates don&#x27;t touch closer to the chord part and so have to really press down. I ended up giving these away because didn&#x27;t feel quality was that great.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener  I have ever got. Even when I&#x27;m using it to straighten my wet hair it works great. Although its not slick straight it makes it some what straighter because I have ringlet curly hair and they can be hard to straighten. I LOVE it. I would recomemed anyone who has curly hair to  buy this one, it works great on our kind of hair. Its really epic!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 14 year old thinking the 1\\&quot; slim would be best for her to handle over the 2\\&quot;plate and it was so much easier she loves it!!!  I LOVE THIS TOO, not only do I not hear her complain about bad hair days when she cant get her hair straight, she uses it with ease!!! I LOVE IT TOO, I used to HATE to wash my hair same day I went anywhere, I needed time for my top layer of hair to calm down a day or so before it looked smooth or go and spend 35.00 to have it blown out professionally! no more!  THIS heats up with in less then a minute!! Both our hair is to the middle of our backs, and with a matter of 6-8 passes on over our hair we are salon perfect!! Knowing how great it works, its worth double this price, I have a second one in wait incase she takes hers to a sleep over, so I wont be with out one!! BUY IT! its GREAT!!! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I bought 2, one for myself and one for my daughter-in-law</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of broken items come from amazon honestly. But this one was cracked inside where the display was, and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. Maybe mail damage, who knows, but not a big deal since it was only $20. I didn&#x27;t have time to send it back.</li>
            <li> This the best iron flat I&#x27;ve ever had! I use mine already for 2 years and it&#x27;s still works great. Bought another one for my friend because she had expensive Italian flat iron and wasn&#x27;t happy so I bought for her Remington wet 2 straight and she is so happy and love it too.  Buy this remington wet 2 straight ceramic straightening iron and I pro mss u wouldn&#x27;t disappointed</li>
            <li> I received this for X-mas 2007 and loved it so I got one for my niece X-mas 2008.  She has thick curly hair and it works well for her.  Get inexpensive hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron and lasts a few years !</li>
            <li> As dry it works perfectly! I am not so sure about the wet part (maybe it works better for thin hair and mine is curly and thick) but, great price and the ceramic material really protects the hair from damaging.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair iron. It works perfectly for doing bangs and getting rid of those little curls. I also like the option of using it on wet hair - even though that&#x27;s not a very good idea on a regular basis, it&#x27;s nice to be able to do it occassionally. Also, I like the automatic shut off and how you can lock it closed. I was going to buy one from revlon but chose this one because of those saftey features.</li>
            <li> I wish somebody would recomend this thing long time ago. The result is so good and no trouble to use it at all, it&#x27;s actually pleasent.</li>
            <li> I got this hair straightener for Christmas two months ago and I absolutely love it.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to my old flat iron.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It has several heat settings, so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m burning my hair.  I usually use it on dry hair because its saves time and is easier to do.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If used properly on wet hair, you&#x27;ll be happy with the results. It takes a bit longer when straightening wet hair and you have to be patient because you have to hold the iron in each section before sliding it down some more.  Its a lot easier if you have someone straighten your hair FOR you when its wet because the steam can easily burn you and after a while your arms will get tired. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this product is how quickly it heats up (in seconds) and beeps to let you know its ready. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Its worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various different flat irons to straighten my hair and so far this one has been the best. It DOES straighten wet hair, though I do not know how well it works on dry hair because I have not put it to that use as of yet. My hair is the straightest it has ever been (even more so than a time I had it straightened at a salon). My hair is not at all dry, not frizzy and it looks great. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t expect that from Remington&lt;br /&gt;First it&#x27;s hard to straight your hair and Second &amp;#34;wet to dry&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t work at all !!!!! Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I love that curling iron, it really does it&#x27;s work, I don&#x27;t even need to use it on a high volume it does the work regardless.</li>
            <li> Not a bad Iron but It does tend to pull a little. If it wasn&#x27;t for that I would give at least 4 stars. Price isn&#x27;t bad would recommend if You didn&#x27;t have to use it every day.</li>
            <li> I towel dry my hair, put in products and use the tool. Works just like it says and great for the price. Saved me so much $$ with getting my hair done professionally, I can do it myself. So happy!</li>
            <li> This is my second one. My first one lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, coarse hair that is difficult to straighten.  Usually I blow dry my hair and then use my CHI Turbo iron on small sections.  The whole process takes over an hour to do and even then I have some sections that are not straight.  After reading the great reviews on the Remington Wet 2 Straight iron I decided to buy it.  I&#x27;ve used it twice so far (3 days apart, as I don&#x27;t wash/straighten every day) and I LOVE it!  It takes me 25-30 minutes to go from damp hair to straight, shiny, silky hair, with NO frizz or curls.  After I get out of the shower I put my hair up in a microfiber towel while I do my makeup.  Then I take my hair down, use a little Paul Mitchell Super Skinny, and I use my regular hair dryer only to briefly dry the roots of my hair at the crown (I saw this suggestion on a YouTube video!).  I do this less than 30 seconds.  Then I start using the iron on small sections of hair, using a clip to put up the top layers.  One thing to be wary of is if the hair at the roots is too wet there will be a lot of steam (!) and this can be extremely hot &amp; possibly burn you, so you have to be careful about that ~ that is why I dry the roots w/ the dryer for a few seconds before starting.  I usually swipe the iron near the roots 3-4 times and then bring the iron through the rest of that section of hair ~ I repeat going over the whole section of hair about 3 times.  Then I move on to the next section.  When I am done my hair is fully dry and the results are beautiful!  My hair has never gotten this straight before.  I&#x27;m amazed this iron does a better job than my CHI, at a fraction of the price, and it has cut my hair styling time in half.  I highly recommend it!  I bought the 1\\&quot; version because I think it is easier to do the roots than using the 2\\&quot; version, but that&#x27;s just my preference.</li>
            <li> Works great for the hair.</li>
            <li> Got it in great time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it did not take as long as expected to straighten my hair.  I spent a total of maybe 30-45 minutes, and my hair reaches my waist; not bad at all.  The good thing is that unlike a blowdryer, this is not noisy so I can sit and watch TV at the same time I am straightening to entertain myself, all without having the volume blocked by a noisy blowdryer.  I was pleasantly surprised to find my hair stick straight and shiny and smooth, since I figured it would damage my hair.  I have used the iron at least 3 times since purchase on wet hair and it works pretty good.  I finish up the scalp, that may stay moist at times, with an ionic blowdryer in 5 minutes and it looks as if I had spent a few hours at the salon.  It is thin enough (1 in.) that you can get up to the scalp but there are parts of your head that are unreachable and either you need to have someone do it for you or you can use a blowdryer like I did.  It is very hard to maintain straight, non-frizzy, smooth hair in Florida where the humidity levels are always about 90%, this is a lot cheaper than a salon and pain-free unlike those round brushes they use at the salons that pull out a third of your hair from the scalp!</li>
            <li> it works fine. but could be more better.</li>
            <li> This iron works perfectly. It straightens dry hair, and it drys wet hair. With a little bit more patience after your hair is dry you continue to use it until your hair is straight. Straightening takes more than 5 minutes and a little more patience. If you have both of these, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have very culry thick hair and tried different straightner&#x27;s in the past. I was given this straightner as a gift last chirstmas and was skeptical of it. I finally opened it in April after my current hair straightner at the time, broke and man was I upset that I had not opened it sooner! This straightner is amazing and makes my hair look full, shiny, healthy and cut my drying time almost in half. I get compliments, still today, about how good my hair looks. People do not believe me when I say that I do not have naturally straight hair. I would defintly spend $$ buying this.</li>
            <li> I bought for my daughter and it worked for about 2 months and just stopped when it did work it was great and did a good job. I think a my have gotten a defiactive one cause my girl friend who recommend it to me has one for over 14 months and hers is fine.</li>
            <li> Just b careful with the steam you can burn yourself. Besides that i luv this product. I like the fact that you can costumize it to your hair. Make sure you buy some kind of flat iron cream, if not you might burn all your hair off. It does what it says,but its not a magical wand.You&#x27;re not a wizard, or magician.So dont expect to look like u came from an expensive salon.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, processed by color and it is fine hair but a lot of it!  This tool has come in very handy for me to skip the blow-drying process but I still find when I use it all the way out to the ends of my hair, it is dry.  It is a great tool for straightening if one cannot afford the flat iron that leaves about 3% moisture in your hair shaft (even after completely &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; drying it) as it costs $300-$400 or more - of course!  Another reason why the salon makes you look like a million before you get up the next day and have to do it yourself!  Well, this is very good product.</li>
            <li> good product with great price ... Thanks for cooperating</li>
            <li> BEST HAIR STRAIGHTENER YOU WILL EVER PURCHASE!!!!!!! WHO NEEDS A HOT TOOLS WHEN YOU CAN PURCHASE THIS REMINGTON WHICH WORKS BETTER THEN A HOT TOOLS.... AND IS A FRACTION OF THE PRICE!</li>
            <li> I had one like 4 years ago this one is more modern i guess works just as well tho . Straightens my hair REALLY GOOD ! When its wet its good cause it has steam holes so its gets rid of all the water without burning it and it leaves your hair so sleek and nice and flowy i just love it and when your hair is dry its even better cause you could do it so fast my hair is long and i finish in less then a hour</li>
            <li> Well this is review of observation of my friend that use the hair thing, she has a very curly hair and this machine smooth her hair very well but she use a hair cream special for it... high recommend of  brand.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair straight out of the shower in conjunction with Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Smoothing Serum. It saves me so much time doing my hair in the mornings. It hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair and actually it leaves it quite shiny and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a comment from someone that the steam badly burned their scalp. The only way that I can see that happening is if they use the product incorrectly. You always have to hold it with the steam vents facing away from your head, otherwise the steam vents into your hair and could potentially burn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this but I find that I&#x27;m not really saving any time as it takes double as long as a hair dryer to actually get your hair dry.  You also can&#x27;t get too close to the scalp or it burns so I end up using a blast of hair dryer at the end anyway.</li>
            <li> After years of spending too much money trying everything I could find, using this iron along with CHI Iron Guard not only straightens my hair, but also keeps it straight. My hair is very fine, and I&#x27;ve never had a lot of it. To make matters worse, while it looks nice when I style it, it kinks up if I let it dry on its own, and frizzes up in humid weather regardless of how nice it looks when I walk out the door.    I bought and returned Revlon and Conair irons before solving my hair problems with the Remington. I wear my hair short, which is why I purchased the 1\\&quot; Slim Plate model. Here&#x27;s what it&#x27;s done for me.    I love to ride and always wear a helmet, leaving me with a severe case of \\&quot;helmet hair\\&quot; after every ride. Even worse, helmets cause my thin hair to get wet and kink up when my head perspires in hot weather. This no longer happens. After using the Wet 2 Straight iron with the CHI Iron Guard, my hair actually stays pretty  straight other than a few curled up ends. While it may not look perfect, I no longer feel embarrassed when I remove my helmet.     Even better, I no longer have to wash and straighten my hair every morning. It looks fine when I wake up. After a quick shower, I just run my fingers through my hair, and I&#x27;m ready to go. If you don&#x27;t want stick-straight hair, you can also turn it over or under to add a small of wave or curl. I don&#x27;t use it on wet hair, so I can&#x27;t speak to that. However, I have used it on hair that&#x27;s barely damp, and it worked just fine. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair, yet another blessing for someone whose hair is easily damaged (I use about the mid-high 15 setting).     Note: It does take a little getting used to as it feels a bit awkward at first (it&#x27;s a bit bulky &amp; heavy), but to me, it&#x27;s well worth the effort. If you have hair like mine, you&#x27;ll bless the day you purchased this hair straightening iron!

            <li> My hair was still slightly damp at the top once I finished, but I was happy to wait for 10 minutes for it to dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I love it that I can straighten my hair even if it&#x27;s little wet and still look great!</li>
            <li> I Love the fact that I can use it on wet or dry hair. It heated up quick, and I can finish getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist for 20+ yrs. I&#x27;ve used several flat Irons. For the price and quality. The Remington Iron is excellent.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised when this device dried my hair just as the description claimed it would. It is easy to use, heats up amazingly fast, and made my hair shine. I have already recommended it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> It seems like it came from Mexico..hence the Spanish written all over it. I like it because I&#x27;ve had this straightener before, but it smells when you turn it on. Also, it makes my lights flicker, haha. Overall, a good product since I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores anymore. Sucks the price is so much. I use to get it for half that at a beauty store.</li>
            <li> Its a good straightener. But im really disapointed i didn&#x27;t recieve the &amp;#34;Bonus mini straightener&amp;#34; that was the whole reason I chose this one. I would give 5 stars if it wasnt for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter when she was in 7th grade and she&#x27;s starting her Senior year next month. We&#x27;ve both used it EVERY DAY since purchase and it just recently started to fall apart. It still heats up perfectly, but the top plate is loose and coming off (I think the screws inside loosened up. Not bad after 1800 days of use.) I fully intend to buy this exact same item again.</li>
            <li> Good straightened....not great on wet hair.  That being said, if you just dry it slightly, it works fine.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had an older version (bought 2010) of this straightener. After many years of use and abuse by me and 3 teen girls it was time to replace. I had no qualms in replacing it with the same model. I have medium length semi wavy hair and this product does a fantastic job of straightening. Heats up quickly - a plus with last minute out the door teens and an auto shut off - again-a plus with last minute out the door teens :)  The slim plate allows me to get the straightener close to my roots. (I use a lower temp for that to avoid an accidental burn of the scalp.) The price is very reasonable and it shipped out quickly.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite flat iron ever. It is very slim and easy to manuever but still gets the job done. It heats up within thirty seconds and has the automatic shut-off which is a must. I have yet to try it with wet hair because I dont want to damage my hair, but other than that it is a great iron and leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightner about a week ago.  I&#x27;m 13 and have been straightening my hair for about 2 years.  It&#x27;s naturally pretty wavy and medium thickness.  My old straightner really killed it.  A lot of people I know have this straightner, including my sister.  My other straightner was about $70 so when i tried this much cheaper one, I was so suprised about how well it worked.  It really did the job and didn&#x27;t damage my hair.  It makes my hair much silkier and shiny to.  I deff recomend this to anyone.  It&#x27;s great and amazing for it&#x27;s price.  Save you money so you can save up for a Chii or Solia.  But for a year or so, this straightner will deffinity do the job. (:</li>
            <li> great price and great and easy product to use! light, realy quick to warm up  and to control the heat</li>
            <li> Works well... Was a gift for my gf and she has Nil complaints</li>
            <li> Used my daughter&#x27;s and had to get one for myself.  It works well and does the job.  I do use a culing iron more often but this does do the trick wehn I need it.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because the price. I should have known a flat iron that costs as little as this one did would break. I was so ticked off when right before an important interview, this thing didn&#x27;t heat up. With no time to go to buy a replacement, I had to go to interview  with a rat&#x27;s nest on my head.</li>
            <li> I really love it, and I mean it, this iron is what I was looking for, heats really fast and you can set it to different temperatures depending on your needs. It gets my hair straight as I needed and is lightweight and very slick.&lt;br /&gt;I Love it and  recommend it.</li>
            <li> This iron works as good as the &#x27;expensive&#x27; one I previously bought.  I have not yet used the wet-to-dry feature, as I have been told it is very damaging to your hair, but on slightly damp hair it works great!</li>
            <li> Awesome flat-iron. I&#x27;ve had it for a while now, because I&#x27;m a slacker about reviews, but this thing is great. I purchased two - one for me and one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> This does the job, but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s as high of quality as the (several) I&#x27;ve had in the past.  I wish I knew if the design had changed or if mine is a one-off issue.</li>
            <li> brand new and works great</li>
            <li> This straightener packs a wallop. I love it. It straightens my hair fast and really nice. It gets really hot though. The handles stay cool but you can burn yourself very easily on the heat alone. Be careful.</li>
            <li> Its a nice buy for the price. Although I don&#x27;t find any difference b/w the wet and the dry options. I like the digital temp control. Gets heated fast. Best part is that the hair don&#x27;t get stuck. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I owned this straightener for five years until it recently broke on me (the plate came loose). I loved it, it did a very nice job and lasted forever. I had an expensive iso that broke within the first 6 months after one drop on the floor. This thing has gone through many drops, and daily use. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I NEVER write product reviews but I felt the need to write about this straightener. I got the 2 inch Remington wet 2 straight straightener for Christmas in 2010 and it is by far the best present I got. My hair is thick, wavy and difficult to style! I didn&#x27;t think this would really work and honestly the thought of putting my wet hair in a straightener kind of scared me(I like my hair and didn&#x27;t want to burn it!) but I gave it a try and now I love it! I would totally recommend this product to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a couple of tips for people who are either considering this straightener or people who have it. First, as with all straighteners I would recommend using a heat protectant (this just helps protect your hair from drying out and becoming frizzy). I use a spray on glosser that has an olive oil base that I love.&lt;br /&gt;Second, there are steam holes on the side of the straightener. These are to be pointed AWAY from your head! I read reviews from people who said they burned their heads and I&#x27;m so sorry that happened to you (I&#x27;ve gotten steam burns while cooking before and they really hurt!) but if you point the side with the holes away from your head you will be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Third, if your hair is thick (like mine) you&#x27;ll probably want to first separate your hair into sections (I usually separate mine into 3 sections, the left side, right side and the back).  Then take the first section of hair and use a hair clip to pin part of it up so you can straighten it layer by layer from bottom to top. I have friends who have thinner hair and they are lucky enough to be able to straighten all their hair at once but I am sadly not one of those people. However, with a little time and patience your hair can look just as beautiful as theirs [if not more because let&#x27;s face it thick hair is totally GORGEOUS! ;-) ]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you make your decision because I understand the importance of hair care products! And whether you choose to buy the Remington wet 2straight straightener or not I hope you are able to find the perfect straightener for you! (But honestly I think you should get this one cause it&#x27;s pretty awesome)</li>
            <li> Mines stop Working in less than a month</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m an African American female and my natural hair texture is very thick! This definitely does illuminate the blow dryer if that&#x27;s what your looking for! I know because I wet my hair and used it! So u get the dry hair along with the straightener! Also, this also has the option to straighten your hair without the stem for wet hair! I honestly bought this product for a weave that doesn&#x27;t get straighten with regular hair straighteners. I haven&#x27;t tried this on the weave hair that I bought but I am almost sure that it works because this is the straightener that other females that bought the particular weave that I am about to install in my hair! I&#x27;m very pleased. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> This was bought for my son.  He really loves this one as opposed to the previous Conair that I bought for him.  This one is thinner, heats up much faster and the size provides him with a way to quickly straighten his hair.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly even though this flat iron is inexpensive it works very well.  I own a higher end flat iron I paid over $100 for and it doesn&#x27;t do as a nice of job on my hair as the Remington.  Just be sure to keep the steam holes facing outward away from the head and it&#x27;ll work beautifully.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take a month for me to get it,It was on time at my door and am just in love with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener after my old one, that I&#x27;d been using for years, cracked and started pulling my hair out. I only use it for my bangs, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot. My old straightener was another cheap model (I got it from WalMart for about $15), so I was expecting this one to suffice. The problem is that there is little insulation between the hot plates and the outside of the device. Because the plates don&#x27;t meet all the way down (only at the very tip), you have to try to force it down by hand for equal heating. The lack of insulation can easily cause burns. I&#x27;ve burned my fingers multiple times. I only gave it 1 star because I would never buy it again. I would also urge others not to buy it.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever. Love how it is small and tiny and can be packaged to go anywhere!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about this stuff but my girlfriend said it worked great and made her hair shine. Hasn&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> Okay so I was completely skepital about buying any straightner because my hair is naturally straight and I didn&#x27;t think a straightener would make a difference....boy was I wrong!!! After reading a ton of reviews, I chose this one because it took the work out of having to blow dry my hair. This is my first straightener and I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but I absolutely love it. The digital temperature is so easy to use and it heats up so quick. Not only do I not have to worry about not blow drying my hair but this straightener makes my hair unbelievably soft and shiny. Definitely worth it and couldn&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;am in australia,i&#x27;m just wondering if i can get that product or if you can send me this product here in australia? thanks -maria</li>
            <li> I bought it knowing how great it is because my sister got one and she talks nothing but good things about this iron. And I do like it too!!  It does work. I iron my hair while it&#x27;s still wet and voila it&#x27;s straightened. It&#x27;s really fast too, I spend less time getting ready.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with the product, when connected to first use, something exploded in it and does not turn over, I hope your answer.</li>
            <li> this straightener arrived, and i love it! this is the second wet 2 straight, and i love it. works amazing.</li>
            <li> I love wet 2 straight. I had my last one for 5 years and it finally went out. This one works even better!! Buy It!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for a few bucks less than the stores offer, I got it because I know it works, my original one was the 2 inch lasted about seven years.</li>
            <li> Works great. No issues. I used this many times, straight out of the shower on soaking wet hair. It straightens and dries it very nicely. I did use products to reduce the drying effects of using the hot iron. It makes the straightening iron glide and give some shine to the hair. For the tough strands that don&#x27;t want to straighten out smoothly, I used a higher heat setting and it helped.</li>
            <li> I need to dry my hair before using the iron, I ordered this item and it arrived in a different box than the box on pictures, it made me believe that it is a refurbrished item, althought this iron has a hight temperature and you save time.</li>
            <li> Had this hair straighter for years. Eventually it had to be replaced, but I bought it again because its just that good!</li>
            <li> This is my first flat iron and it works well on my hair.  However, the power button and heat buttons on the side are so tiny and recessed into the handle, that they are impossible to press easily.  I had to hit the power button six times with different fingers at different angles before it would go off. Who designed this?</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I feel like before I retire old trustee he deserves a good review. I got this flat iron my freshman year of high school and I&#x27;m now in college and the only reason I&#x27;m getting a new flat iron is because this one is starting to smell like burnt things. Still works as well as the day I got it!</li>
            <li> I borrowed this from a friend to see how well I liked it before telling my family that I would like it for christmas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used it the first time this morning and I have long, thick, curly/frizzy hair.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When my hair was wet I split it into 5 sections. The first swipe I did on my first section made my hair look really curly and frizzy.  But by the third swipe it was smooth and straight.  I have never seen my hair lay so nice and it did not get any curl back after 4 hours which my hair usually does. It is also soft and very shiney, which with my blow dryer and straightner it was usually corse and dry. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It took me about the same amount of time that it would doing my other routine but I am sure the more you use it the better you get and the faster it will work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I&#x27;m mixed with Italian and Black. My hair is curly/wavy/thick. When my hair is dry, it only takes maybe 3x going over  on the same piece of hair before it&#x27;s VERY straight. I love this flat iron. It takes me a short time to straighten my entire head of hair (which is super thick and curly). It&#x27;s worth the money. It&#x27;s not expensive at all and it&#x27;s crazy how this works better for my hair then other flat irons which cost in the 100$ range. I love it.</li>
            <li> well i got the item i found out i was supplied with a socket plug and till i couldnt find in the stores with this kind of plug.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend actually broke my other flat iron that I was using which was a pro tools flat iron. Somehow he seemed to step on it even though it wasn&#x27;t on the floor. I was in need of a flat iron because I can not go a day without one or else my hair looks bad. I looked around on here for a good deal, and I also had some gift certificates on hand as well. I noticed there was a two dollar coupon on it, and I looked at it too see if I wanted to get it. I looked at all of the reviews on it and thought that maybe I shouldn&#x27;t get it because some of them weren&#x27;t that great. But since my hair is damaged, I need a flat iron with tourmaline and ceramic so it wont damage my hair too bad than it already is. Well, I just got this flat iron today. Literally I just flat ironed my hair with it and it is a really good flat iron. I&#x27;ve had like four flat irons since I was 12 years old. This flat iron really heats up quick, and I really love how I can change the temperature of the flat iron. My last one didn&#x27;t do this, so I have no clue how high the heat was on it. But this one actually took about a lot of the frizz that I sometimes get after flattening my hair. My hair is really wavy, and it took out my waves just flattening a piece one time. I still have to keep trying it out to make sure that I really want it, but I do believe that it may just stay at my house. I also noticed while flattening my hair that it didn&#x27;t snag/ break my hair at all. My old one used to do that soo much that I would loose three or four hairs because it snagged so badly. I will re-write at the end of next week in case if I come into that I don&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li> I bought a chi and it didnt quite do anything for my hair so started using m y daughters which is this one and i fell in love with it i had to get my own!!</li>
            <li> I had this straightener for probably a year or two. It was awesome  did a great job straightening semi-thick loose curls. That is until it caught on fire.&lt;br /&gt;I went to use it and I plugged it in and the inside just went up I unplugged it and called the company. I probably would have gotten it replaced if I would have sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it worked good on your hair lol</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!!  I have long naturally curly hair (3C hair type) and this allows me to wear my hair straight without having to blow dry and flat iron, thus, saving me about an hour in styling time.  It gets very hot, maintains heat, and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Producto en buenas condiciones, entregado a tiempo, califica con las expectativas que se requiriรณ, tomare en cuenta a los vendedores para las prรณximas compras de este tipo de producto.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing straightener it straigtens hair quickly. Even toough it is small it is mighty. It also heats up very quickly. Although it is very hard to get out of the packaging</li>
            <li> I opened the box and found it looking used. It had what looked like hair product residue along the sides and the edges were all scuffed. The cord was also wrapped in a spiral so now it&#x27;s like a spring cord. After cleaning it I turned it on and it seemed to work. But I ordered a new straightener and it did not appear to be so. My last straightener like this one I loved, so I hope this one works just as well.... :-/</li>
            <li> Packaging/Delivery was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron curls and straightens the hair with great shine and really locks in the moisture in your hair regardless of the hair type. Easy temperature settings to control and glides through my hair smoothly. The blow drier setting straightens my curly hair as if was on the straightening setting very safely on the lowest setting I prefer ( the popping noise is normal when your hair is damp and never use it on soaking wet hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product and great seller to purchase it from.</li>
            <li> I am just getting into flat irons for the first time in my life. My first attempt was with a Conair mini flat iron and the whole experience left a sour taste in my mouth. Not so much because of the flat iron itself but because of the process involved. I had to blow dry my hair first and then flat iron and lets just say that when I was done, there was a lot of breakage and my hair didn&#x27;t even look flat ironed enough so the hours invested felt pointless. I may very well just stretch out my fro with a blow dryer and be on my merry way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost gave up on flat ironing as a styling option but decided look up steam flat irons when a thought occurred to me, since my hair can really only be managed when wet, why not get a water friendly flat iron, a wet to dry? Enter the super light and easily wieldable 1\\&quot;, slim but long plated Remington Wet 2 Straight. This left my hair STRAIGHT AND SHINY! It dries hair very quickly too, in 1-2 swipes! It has been 4 days now and my hair is still straight and shiny! The whole process just took an hour because I am new to flat ironing so it will get much shorter with practise! And I only used between 340-380 degrees. Also, I didn&#x27;t even detangle my hair and it looks like this. Imagine what it would look like if I took the time to detangle in sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: when flat ironing on wet or damp hair, do not go too close to the root on your first swipe because the evaporating steam will burn your scalp! I would start halfway, or a quarter way from the root and then work up closer to the root to avoid steam burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is perfect!! I just can&#x27;t see any other flat iron including the more expensive ones catering to my hair needs like this one does. I had virtually no breakage from it and I am just a beginner! Even the most difficult clothing materials can be ironed straight when wet or damp. Clearly, that also applies here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE January 12, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no heat damage in sight. How awesome is that for a newcomer and I hear about heat damage from my friends who get theirs done in salons. I highly recommend this flat iron to anyone with my hair type.</li>
            <li> This straightener does work, however I used it on my own hair and it does pull a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The one I have for $19.99 works better.</li>
            <li> I only wish I would have saved myself the money and gone to Amazon and trolled the reviews before buying my other ones at Walmart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener is amazing. I&#x27;ve only used on my dry hair but that alone has been a great experience. None of the other straighteners I bought before worked even remotely as well and this was about the same price! I&#x27;ve got super fine straight hair but often times after sleeping on it wet I wake up with flyaways. A little bit of this guy and we&#x27;re ready to hit the town!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A GREAT buy for me!</li>
            <li> The product in a cheap &amp;#34;Curling Iron&amp;#34; box with a sticker on it that obviously printed in China, pretty sure it was a counterfeit knock-off.  It would  not even turn on except for a few seconds of display flashing let alone heat up,  straight to the garbage with this, Amazon rarely drops the ball but did with this.</li>
            <li> Excellent straight iron. Heats up fast. I had an older model for 4 years and it finally gave out so I had to replace with a new one.</li>
            <li> I bought this Straightener for my daughter. she was very happy with it and told me that it is better than any other straighteners she has ever owned in the $50 and below price range.  She has had it for about a year now and it&#x27;s still working good. It heats well and straightens good. It does tend to make your hair look dry though instead of shiny. That is the only reason I am giving it a 4 star.</li>
            <li> The straightner works great on my daughter&#x27;s very thick hair.  The only problem is that it was advertised as being purple, but when we received it, it was actually black.</li>
            <li> could be better, could be worse</li>
            <li> Amazing, works perfectly.</li>
            <li> very good product, description is the same that the seller, work pefect</li>
            <li> Would not even power on. My daughter used an Amazon gift card received for Christmas to get this and now will need to be returned.. Hope they are not all like this one.</li>
            <li> My daughter is extremely thrilled with this product</li>
            <li> Lesson learned- don&#x27;t skimp on a flat iron. This product was cheaply made, never stayed on for more than 30 seconds and occasionally sent off sparks. I returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and customer service. Received product one day early and in perfect new condition. This flatiron heats up quickly and hair stays straightened longer. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is very good.i liked it very much,does not take much time to set my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Even I can set my wet hair too.i will recommend this.</li>
