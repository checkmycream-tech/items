            <li>This thing really does a great job on the face.</li>
            <li>will purchase more</li>
            <li>However, it works just as fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a great improvement in my skin tone and overall appearance.</li>
            <li>I order a smaller needle size than I wanted, but works just great now</li>
            <li>It just feels like a smooth plastic roller.</li>
            <li>It seemingly stimulates the facial tissue resulting in a more rested and healthy appearance.</li>
            <li>Super.</li>
            <li>Be very gentle with it in delicate areas, but you will be impressed!  </li>
            <li>Great roller, but wish they&#x27;d made the cradle that it sits in as narrow as the roller</li>
            <li>Ease of handling  Price is very reasonable  </li>
            <li>I ordered this dermarroller because is small enough to reach places the others don&#x27;t, and I am very impressed because not just that&#x27;s that</li>
            <li>Very nice product to use in hard to reach areas like around eyes, mouth, nasal area.</li>
            <li>The smaller size makes it easy to use  around the fouth and nose area and between the eyes to treat the 11&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product. ....</li>
            <li>I am new to using this on my eye area but its like the one for my face.</li>
            <li>This is the only roller that even with gentle pressure, I could actually hear it puncturing the skin.  </li>
            <li>This had zero flaws in the needles and is much easier to use than a regular wide one around nose and eyes.</li>
            <li>I used it between my eyebrows (where I have a small scar), on my laugh lines, and around the edges of my mouth.  </li>

            <li> This micro roller is small enough to use safely near the eye region.  </li>
            <li> I found this to be much more painful than the regular size roller.</li>
            <li> is more painful.</li>
            <li> The white holder is too thick.</li>
            <li> it has less needles that might be the reason</li>
            <li> this little sucker is SHARP!  </li>
            <li> This is very small to the area around the eye.</li>
            <li> Not a good design and needles gave me a rash.</li>

            <li> I am pleased with the results of the Eye Roller.  This micro roller is small enough to use safely near the eye region.  It seemingly stimulates the facial tissue resulting in a more rested and healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> I found this to be much more painful than the regular size roller. However, it works just as fine it has less needles that might be the reason is more painful.</li>
            <li> This is very small to the area around the eye. The package is really good. I just started using it haven&#x27;t seen result yet.</li>
            <li> This had zero flaws in the needles and is much easier to use than a regular wide one around nose and eyes. Super.</li>
            <li> Great roller, but wish they&#x27;d made the cradle that it sits in as narrow as the roller, still it is a superb roller!  Be warned that this one is micro-needling at its finest...this little sucker is SHARP!  Be very gentle with it in delicate areas, but you will be impressed!  I used it between my eyebrows (where I have a small scar), on my laugh lines, and around the edges of my mouth.  This is the only roller that even with gentle pressure, I could actually hear it puncturing the skin.  Nicely packaged, too!  Five stars!</li>
            <li> This thing really does a great job on the face. The smaller size makes it easy to use  around the fouth and nose area and between the eyes to treat the 11&#x27;s. Mine are almost gone unless I squint a lot during the day.</li>
            <li> I love this! It is the perfect size for using around the eyes and around the mouth. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> The construction. Ease of cleaning  strength of needles.  Color nice. Ease of handling  Price is very reasonable  will purchase more</li>
            <li> Very nice product to use in hard to reach areas like around eyes, mouth, nasal area. Like that these are very fine needles!!</li>
            <li> Works well around eyes and nose. I&#x27;d purchase again!</li>
            <li> I am new to using this on my eye area but its like the one for my face. Hope to see results soon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t feel the needles on the 0.25 mm roller, so I don&#x27;t think it will do anything. It just feels like a smooth plastic roller. I got it to use around my eyes. I&#x27;m going to order the 1.0 mm. I have a larger 1.0 mm roller that I use on the rest of my face, and it does have an effect.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I can get to the corner of my nose. The white holder is too thick. Not a good design and needles gave me a rash.</li>
