            <li>Great fun for the skincare junkie</li>
            <li>&quot; They said it is okay to see blood -- and in fact this is how they determine that microneedling was effective.</li>

            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Although I got this product for free or discounted price,  I ensure that my thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It came in with a nice package and container to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>I must admit I was a little scared, but curiosity got the best of me and I am glad it did!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to try this!  </li>
            <li>I love this one it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great price and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of research before buying THIS ONE, and I was impressed with the quality, nice case, good quality and professional presentation.</li>
            <li>I love them for my stretch marks and fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and get used to.</li>
            <li>They are needles, so make sure to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>so far so good, i hope it improves even more over time.</li>
            <li>Also you better not have a fear of needles, this is full of them.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store.  </li>
            <li>and I can see a difference in the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>I use them for my fine lines and cellulite.  </li>
            <li>Love it and got it in the mail fast!!</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product and what it has done for my face.</li>
            <li>The bearings roll smoothly.</li>
            <li>I use the derma roller once a week, then follow it up with hyluaronic acid then an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>you place is light as a feather.</li>
            <li>I started to actually enjoy the feeling of using it, after I had rolled it on my face for a minute.</li>
            <li>It is too early to tell how well this works, but I am hopeful, and so far quite impressed!</li>
            <li>good quality, need to use it softly.</li>
            <li>it will worth it though!  </li>
            <li>but I know it could be better if I was consistent with using it.</li>
            <li>my first advice is use it lightly!</li>
            <li>and I was actually excited to try it although I was hesitant it will work.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I see a difference in the amount of cellulite on the leg</li>
            <li>so I am excited to see what a month of use will do.</li>
            <li>What an amazing new product.  </li>
            <li>Clean face and tool with rubbing alcohol before use to prevent any infections.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for a brand new product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for minimizing fine wrinkles, laugh lines, and scars/blemishes.</li>
            <li>Should be good enough.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to share your personal derma roller with other people, so make sure you buy one for your friends and family members so they can try out this awesome product.</li>
            <li>You have earned a loyal customer for life.</li>
            <li>Helps with dark spots on facem great product</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does hurt that much.</li>
            <li>Definitely make sure and use the vitamin c serum afterwards!</li>
            <li>very well made product!!</li>
            <li>To be honest this was my last resort.</li>
            <li>Still worth the money.</li>
            <li>After use my face feels fresh and revitalized.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure how to use this, or how frequent, so I looked up \\&quot;microneedling\\&quot; on Google Scholar.</li>
            <li>Takes about 10 minutes just to do that much of my body, so it is kind of time consuming for a busy person.</li>
            <li>i did not know what to expect when i ordered this, and wow this is a a interesting feeling using it&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>but people saying its pain free and doesnt hurt well it does its more of an annoyance when you get used to it especially on the face.</li>
            <li>so 1mm is about right for home use, without it hurting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely helped erase fine lines and wrinkles from my face!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping also</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is by far the best skin care device I have ever had.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, your face will feel as if you went face first into a poison ivy plant.  </li>
            <li>There is a visual reduction of the scaring I have, and this combined with the moisturizer has left my face feeling quite nicely (and the wife cant keep from rubbing on my &#x27;baby butt smooth face&#x27; now).  </li>
            <li>At first i thought it was going to hurt with all those needles</li>
            <li>This is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>At first, I&#x27;ll admit, this thing scared the bejeezus out of me.</li>
            <li>My skin totally felt better once the redness had faded.</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Most scars will need a total of 4 treatments &#x3D; 4 months to see results.    </li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t mind using this first thing in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if I see improvements, but I&#x27;m willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>If you are using this for the first time, I suggest the pressure</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit scared, it looks like there are a million needles sticking out of it.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to do your homework on the proper use of product, you can find a ton of videos and instructions on the web.</li>
            <li>You MUST follow the exact directions.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>I put on HA peptide serum first, then worked it into the skin with the roller.</li>
            <li>I have more than one roller to target the different areas of the body that I want to work on.  </li>
            <li>I tried several times, feels good, but because short period, have not seen any change yet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really write that many reviews until months later, but I needed to come on here and find the &amp;#34;peptide&amp;#34; advice in some review or another.</li>
            <li>So far so good, i have used it only 4 times so far, i will keep everyone updated, i need to give it at lease a month</li>
            <li>Micrneedling more frequently (daily, every other day, twice a week or once a week) will do more damage than harm.</li>
            <li>These rollers if used properly and consistently can make a huge difference in the look and feel of your skin.</li>
            <li>I suffer from large pores and acne scars.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and been looking for a product that will address my issue.</li>
            <li>Though Im not one for beauty products, I do have to say, I have become smitten with this handy little tool.  </li>
            <li>I was a little scared to use this kind of product</li>
            <li>Who wants to stab their face with 600 needles really?</li>
            <li>Since I have got this my fave has become so much clearer because I get them before they get to be a problem.</li>
            <li>I really want to try it on my legs to see if it does what it claims but really think they should include some encouraging words in the box to convince consumers it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Very ouchy</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !</li>
            <li>Working better than expected.</li>
            <li>Promising.</li>
            <li>She highly recommended the product so can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to get the proper size for your skin.</li>
            <li>I used it on my hands, but it really drew blood there.</li>
            <li>She said it takes 3 months to really see how this increasing the collagen and reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see future results and continue using this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased thus far, though I will note that it does leave a lingering tingle in your face for a few hours, which just tells me its got elevated blood circulation, and it does leave a rosey hue to your skin...</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about this product but after trying it only a few times on my face, I am pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>Surprising enough, it also came sterilized and wrapped up tight.</li>
            <li>I think it will work better starting around 40, doing is regularly.</li>
            <li>But I do have high hopes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not as bad as I thought it would be, My face felt awesome after doing this.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, costs so much less to do at home than going to a pro.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say I am a fan of the whole concept and have been getting good results paired with vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>It has cleared my acne scars almost completely!</li>
            <li>Do not do them back to back and make sure you give your skin enough time toheal.</li>
            <li>When i first got it i was scared to try it out as i am not used to any product that has to deal with tiny needles.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Microneedling leads to the release of growth factors which stimulate the formation of new collagen (natural collagen) and elastin in the papillary dermis.</li>
            <li>When the product arrived I was surprised at how it was packaged.  </li>
            <li>So far-</li>
            <li>I have used this roller for 3 days so far</li>
            <li>Im surprised and amazed to use discover and use this.</li>
            <li>I am going on 39 years young this year</li>
            <li>Is for adult use.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin i would avoid using n</li>
            <li>I have used this on a scar at the nasal labia fold and so far, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes.  </li>
            <li>Either I&#x27;m not rolling it proper or expecting too much</li>
            <li>I have used this roller for 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li>After using this product 1x/day just over 1 week, I have already seen noticable difference in the overall lift of my face, it is much tighter.</li>
            <li>The seller is very prompt with replying to any situation that may arise,  my first one I will admit seemed to have 1 of the needle tracks misaligned slightly, thus leaving small scratches, but the seller replaced it 100% free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a small difference in my skin with texture and fine lines</li>
            <li>When I pulled the roller out, It looked as if the handle was split open, however upon closer inspection, it just needed to be snapped back together, as the design of the handle has a removable head so that other rollers (not included with this package) can be changed out easily.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if the needles are titanium, they don&#x27;t seem that precise, but I will use Peroxide to rise them off after each use.</li>
            <li>In addition, new capillaries are formed-this neovascularisation and neocollagenesis following treatment leads to reduction of scars.\\</li>
            <li>Teen should use with adult supervision.</li>
            <li>So be careful of how much pressure you apply.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t use such a light touch that it tickles, but you also shouldn&#x27;t press so hard that you require a blood transfusion.</li>
            <li>Be careful about how much pressure you apply especially on bone areas like the bridge of the nose and forehead.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and have really started to see a difference!</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that this product is much larger than other Derma Rollers so that it covers larger areas.</li>
            <li>I could feel it working immediately and was very surprised that the discomfort was minimal with all of those needles.  </li>
            <li>I only use my once every 3-4 weeks and long with a vitamin oil, but I love this on seriously!</li>
            <li>I like this product just wish it was a little wider as it takes a while to do a whole body section.</li>

            <li> It came in with a nice package and container to keep it clean.</li>

            <li> I spent a lot of research before buying THIS ONE, and I was impressed with the quality, nice case, good quality and professional presentation.</li>
            <li> I love them for my stretch marks and fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and get used to.</li>
            <li> They are needles, so make sure to keep them clean.</li>
            <li> so far so good, i hope it improves even more over time.</li>
            <li> Also you better not have a fear of needles, this is full of them.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store.  </li>
            <li> and I can see a difference in the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> I use them for my fine lines and cellulite.  </li>
            <li> Love it and got it in the mail fast!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and what it has done for my face.</li>
            <li> The bearings roll smoothly.</li>
            <li> I use the derma roller once a week, then follow it up with hyluaronic acid then an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> you place is light as a feather.</li>
            <li> I started to actually enjoy the feeling of using it, after I had rolled it on my face for a minute.</li>
            <li> It is too early to tell how well this works, but I am hopeful, and so far quite impressed!</li>
            <li> good quality, need to use it softly.</li>
            <li> it will worth it though!  </li>
            <li> but I know it could be better if I was consistent with using it.</li>
            <li> my first advice is use it lightly!</li>
            <li> and I was actually excited to try it although I was hesitant it will work.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I see a difference in the amount of cellulite on the leg</li>
            <li> so I am excited to see what a month of use will do.</li>
            <li> What an amazing new product.  </li>
            <li> Clean face and tool with rubbing alcohol before use to prevent any infections.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for a brand new product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for minimizing fine wrinkles, laugh lines, and scars/blemishes.</li>
            <li> Should be good enough.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to share your personal derma roller with other people, so make sure you buy one for your friends and family members so they can try out this awesome product.</li>
            <li> You have earned a loyal customer for life.</li>
            <li> Helps with dark spots on facem great product</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does hurt that much.</li>
            <li> Definitely make sure and use the vitamin c serum afterwards!</li>
            <li> very well made product!!</li>
            <li> To be honest this was my last resort.</li>
            <li> Still worth the money.</li>
            <li> After use my face feels fresh and revitalized.  </li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure how to use this, or how frequent, so I looked up \\&quot;microneedling\\&quot; on Google Scholar.</li>
            <li> Takes about 10 minutes just to do that much of my body, so it is kind of time consuming for a busy person.</li>
            <li> i did not know what to expect when i ordered this, and wow this is a a interesting feeling using it&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> but people saying its pain free and doesnt hurt well it does its more of an annoyance when you get used to it especially on the face.</li>
            <li> so 1mm is about right for home use, without it hurting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely helped erase fine lines and wrinkles from my face!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping also</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is by far the best skin care device I have ever had.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, your face will feel as if you went face first into a poison ivy plant.  </li>
            <li> There is a visual reduction of the scaring I have, and this combined with the moisturizer has left my face feeling quite nicely (and the wife cant keep from rubbing on my &#x27;baby butt smooth face&#x27; now).  </li>
            <li> At first i thought it was going to hurt with all those needles</li>
            <li> This is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> At first, I&#x27;ll admit, this thing scared the bejeezus out of me.</li>
            <li> My skin totally felt better once the redness had faded.</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Most scars will need a total of 4 treatments &#x3D; 4 months to see results.    </li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t mind using this first thing in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if I see improvements, but I&#x27;m willing to try anything.</li>
            <li> If you are using this for the first time, I suggest the pressure</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit scared, it looks like there are a million needles sticking out of it.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to do your homework on the proper use of product, you can find a ton of videos and instructions on the web.</li>
            <li> You MUST follow the exact directions.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> I put on HA peptide serum first, then worked it into the skin with the roller.</li>
            <li> I have more than one roller to target the different areas of the body that I want to work on.  </li>
            <li> I tried several times, feels good, but because short period, have not seen any change yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really write that many reviews until months later, but I needed to come on here and find the &amp;#34;peptide&amp;#34; advice in some review or another.</li>
            <li> So far so good, i have used it only 4 times so far, i will keep everyone updated, i need to give it at lease a month</li>
            <li> Micrneedling more frequently (daily, every other day, twice a week or once a week) will do more damage than harm.</li>
            <li> These rollers if used properly and consistently can make a huge difference in the look and feel of your skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from large pores and acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and been looking for a product that will address my issue.</li>
            <li> Though Im not one for beauty products, I do have to say, I have become smitten with this handy little tool.  </li>
            <li> I was a little scared to use this kind of product</li>
            <li> Who wants to stab their face with 600 needles really?</li>
            <li> Since I have got this my fave has become so much clearer because I get them before they get to be a problem.</li>
            <li> I really want to try it on my legs to see if it does what it claims but really think they should include some encouraging words in the box to convince consumers it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Very ouchy</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Working better than expected.</li>
            <li> Promising.</li>
            <li> She highly recommended the product so can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to get the proper size for your skin.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hands, but it really drew blood there.</li>
            <li> She said it takes 3 months to really see how this increasing the collagen and reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see future results and continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased thus far, though I will note that it does leave a lingering tingle in your face for a few hours, which just tells me its got elevated blood circulation, and it does leave a rosey hue to your skin...</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about this product but after trying it only a few times on my face, I am pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> Surprising enough, it also came sterilized and wrapped up tight.</li>
            <li> I think it will work better starting around 40, doing is regularly.</li>
            <li> But I do have high hopes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not as bad as I thought it would be, My face felt awesome after doing this.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, costs so much less to do at home than going to a pro.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I am a fan of the whole concept and have been getting good results paired with vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> It has cleared my acne scars almost completely!</li>
            <li> Do not do them back to back and make sure you give your skin enough time toheal.</li>
            <li> When i first got it i was scared to try it out as i am not used to any product that has to deal with tiny needles.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Microneedling leads to the release of growth factors which stimulate the formation of new collagen (natural collagen) and elastin in the papillary dermis.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived I was surprised at how it was packaged.  </li>
            <li> So far-</li>
            <li> I have used this roller for 3 days so far</li>
            <li> Im surprised and amazed to use discover and use this.</li>
            <li> I am going on 39 years young this year</li>
            <li> Is for adult use.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin i would avoid using n</li>
            <li> I have used this on a scar at the nasal labia fold and so far, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes.  </li>
            <li> Either I&#x27;m not rolling it proper or expecting too much</li>
            <li> I have used this roller for 2 weeks so far</li>
            <li> After using this product 1x/day just over 1 week, I have already seen noticable difference in the overall lift of my face, it is much tighter.</li>
            <li> The seller is very prompt with replying to any situation that may arise,  my first one I will admit seemed to have 1 of the needle tracks misaligned slightly, thus leaving small scratches, but the seller replaced it 100% free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a small difference in my skin with texture and fine lines</li>
            <li> When I pulled the roller out, It looked as if the handle was split open, however upon closer inspection, it just needed to be snapped back together, as the design of the handle has a removable head so that other rollers (not included with this package) can be changed out easily.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the needles are titanium, they don&#x27;t seem that precise, but I will use Peroxide to rise them off after each use.</li>
            <li> In addition, new capillaries are formed-this neovascularisation and neocollagenesis following treatment leads to reduction of scars.\\</li>
            <li> Teen should use with adult supervision.</li>
            <li> So be careful of how much pressure you apply.</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t use such a light touch that it tickles, but you also shouldn&#x27;t press so hard that you require a blood transfusion.</li>
            <li> Be careful about how much pressure you apply especially on bone areas like the bridge of the nose and forehead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and have really started to see a difference!</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this product is much larger than other Derma Rollers so that it covers larger areas.</li>
            <li> I could feel it working immediately and was very surprised that the discomfort was minimal with all of those needles.  </li>
            <li> I only use my once every 3-4 weeks and long with a vitamin oil, but I love this on seriously!</li>
            <li> I like this product just wish it was a little wider as it takes a while to do a whole body section.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get to use it, why waste money going to all expensive practices out there when they make products like this at such amazing prices.</li>
            <li> It clearly tells you how to use this bad boy, and it tells you to make sure you use a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> So far I have noticed a slight difference.</li>
            <li> Well, I can see if I order the serum and use the roller I can do the same thing at home at my leisure or every single day if I want, and save literally thousands of dollars and tons of time.</li>
            <li> I can see using this if I was extremely bothered by cellulite or stretch marks, but right now it will go in my beauty drawer for a few years down the road.</li>
            <li> I have only notice minimal</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it very long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to help heal my scar areas from a few major surgeries I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I will also try on little bald areas, but it seems to get stuck in the hair except in bare areas.</li>
            <li> I have used on face, scalp for hair growth and loose skin on stomach and decollete.</li>
            <li> (you&#x27;re only supposed to use it about once a month- or less).</li>
            <li> It will feel like you have a slight sunburn and your face will be a bit red</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer to the touch, and although I&#x27;ve had acne scarring in the past, I&#x27;ve been using less foundation!</li>
            <li> I was afraid of this at first after I had used it a few times not so much ...</li>
            <li> The HA serum was inside the needle and she went poking around my entire face sticking little pricks of the NA into my face.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t be surprised when the needles go dull.  </li>
            <li> I have to say the first time I used the roller it felt a little funny, but it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> I have to say the first time I used the roller it felt a little funny, but it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> Im a guy, and pink frilly tools are not my thing, but I figured,</li>
            <li> And the feeling defiantly doesn&#x27;t hurt like I expected.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not really convinced it&#x27;s titanium, loooks like silver to me) before and after every use to avoid bacterial growth.</li>
            <li> I only use it once a week because I did notice it felt like it dried my skin out</li>
            <li> This Derma Roller arrived as expected and as promised.</li>
            <li> but there will be changes in the next few weeks and months to come.</li>
            <li> However, after using this product only a few times, I noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I find it just a little uncomfortable but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> If you have to go to work or do other things during the day then I suggest using it at night as your skin will be a little red from using this product.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than Thermage or other laser treatments.</li>
            <li> What did you expect, them to stay sharp forever?  </li>
            <li> I had a lot of dark spots and acne scars and this helped make them disappear.</li>
            <li> I have an old scar on my knee and it had decreased in size and is a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It sort of reminds me of a tingly feeling when your leg is half asleep.</li>
            <li> It feels like I have a slight sunburn</li>
            <li> Which is a problem I was having with my previous derma rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a quick overnight cure you have to be patient and diligence about using it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was a bit afraid but you get used of it</li>
            <li> I see a little improvment.</li>
            <li> It is hundreds of little needles.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared of all the needles</li>
            <li> Hurts a little</li>
            <li> It does pinch a little, but after a while you come to like the feel, it reminds you no pain ...</li>

            <li> My sister threw this out because it came from another country and she couldn&#x27;t read the instructions.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I recieved this item for product review.  Im a guy, and pink frilly tools are not my thing, but I figured, what the heck, I have a wife that could test it if I need her too.  When the product arrived I was surprised at how it was packaged.  It comes to you in the same type of packaging bag you would find on sterile medical equipment.  Inside that packaging the derma roller sits in a nice plastic container for storage.  When I pulled the roller out, It looked as if the handle was split open, however upon closer inspection, it just needed to be snapped back together, as the design of the handle has a removable head so that other rollers (not included with this package) can be changed out easily.  So I begin rolling this thing around my face, as my goal for use is acne scaring from when I was younger.  BIG MISTAKE!  Please read the directions (Remember Im a guy, we never do)  It clearly tells you how to use this bad boy, and it tells you to make sure you use a moisturizer.  If you don&#x27;t, your face will feel as if you went face first into a poison ivy plant.  After listening to the hysterical laughter from my wife, she informed me of my mistake.  Though Im not one for beauty products, I do have to say, I have become smitten with this handy little tool.  There is a visual reduction of the scaring I have, and this combined with the moisturizer has left my face feeling quite nicely (and the wife cant keep from rubbing on my &#x27;baby butt smooth face&#x27; now).  Now on to the balding spots!  It is too early to tell how well this works, but I am hopeful, and so far quite impressed!</li>
            <li> Boy oh boy where to start. I suffer from large pores and acne scars. I&#x27;ve tried 10 layers of makeup and every beauty secret supposedly out there. To be honest this was my last resort. Who wants to stab their face with 600 needles really? Desperation got the best of me and I ordered this product. I can honesty say I&#x27;m glad I did. These aren&#x27;t the needles like I was thinking. And the feeling defiantly doesn&#x27;t hurt like I expected. It sort of reminds me of a tingly feeling when your leg is half asleep. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and am starting to notice stubble changes. Pretty good for a brand new product. I&#x27;m excited to see future results and continue using this product. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product and what it has done for my face. It has cleared my acne scars almost completely!</li>
            <li> I love this because I have acne and blackhead and clogged pores and this clears them all out. I have tried so many things before for this and it never worked. Since I have got this my fave has become so much clearer because I get them before they get to be a problem. I would recommend this to anyone who has problems with acne, or pimples or blackheads try it you will love it.</li>
            <li> If you been considering plastic surgery, think no more! This dermaroller is definitely the product for you! Seriously, this is by far the best skin care device I have ever had. It&#x27;s definitely helped erase fine lines and wrinkles from my face! Love it! *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> This is the scariest beauty product I have ever received. Nicely packaged but scared to use it. I really want to try it on my legs to see if it does what it claims but really think they should include some encouraging words in the box to convince consumers it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to try this!  So far- I have only notice minimal pain- it will worth it though!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> At first i thought it was going to hurt with all those needles but it didnt all i did it all over my face following the instructions of the box my face was red for a couple a minutes applied some moisturizer and bam its been three days since i have been using it and my skin is feeling and looking smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Great product to try out or to give as gifts!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for those who like to try out beauty products!</li>
            <li> I was afraid of this at first after I had used it a few times not so much ... I can see results around eyes!</li>
            <li> This is exactly as described. It came perfectly packaged and amazing quality. I can&#x27;t wait to get to use it, why waste money going to all expensive practices out there when they make products like this at such amazing prices.</li>
            <li> Great product!! And great service!!</li>
            <li> The needles can&#x27;t penetrate any deeper than the 1mm so I am able to use this one aggressively.  It feels like I have a slight sunburn so I know something is happening.&lt;br /&gt;A 1.5 or 2 might draw blood so 1mm is about right for home use, without it hurting.  It is slightly uncomfortable but that is necessary to change the texture of the skin.  I like it, a great tool for those of us not inclined and/or unwilling to spend a fortune at the dermatologist. It will take longer but that&#x27;s ok with me.</li>
            <li> So amazing, I wish I could use it more often (you&#x27;re only supposed to use it about once a month- or less). Still worth the money. Great fun for the skincare junkie, I follow it with Mario Badescu vitamin C serum, my face is red for several hours after so I do it at night, I wear a good moisturizer to bed and my skin looks amazing in the morning.</li>
            <li> The 1.0 mm needles are the size you want if you are planning to attack stretch marks or cellulite. The Derma Roller comes with a storage case, and don&#x27;t forget to wash after every use - you are puncturing your skin if you are using it properly. You shouldn&#x27;t use such a light touch that it tickles, but you also shouldn&#x27;t press so hard that you require a blood transfusion. Yes, you will occasionally see pin pricks of blood. I did not use this model on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used my Derma Roller once, because micro-needling should not be done every day. You need time for your skin to heal so that you can see honest results. The bearings roll smoothly. Be sure to apply a moisturizer or serum after finishing your treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my inspection and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Living my derma roller! Thank u!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best roller of the 3 I tried. Use with hyerlonic acid for best results and watch the u-tube videos for techniques. I have used on face, scalp for hair growth and loose skin on stomach and decollete.</li>
            <li> I tried several times, feels good, but because short period, have not seen any change yet.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product.  After use my face feels fresh and revitalized.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results!</li>
            <li> Love this product have now used it twice and I am a believer.  It has made my skin so smooth and soft.  I could feel it working immediately and was very surprised that the discomfort was minimal with all of those needles.  It is very easy to do and I look forward to the results.</li>
            <li> Helps with dark spots on facem great product</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this product is much larger than other Derma Rollers so that it covers larger areas. I&#x27;ve seen a small difference in my skin with texture and fine lines but I know it could be better if I was consistent with using it.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store.  The needles don&#x27;t break or bend.</li>
            <li> Very ouchy but does what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> At first, I&#x27;ll admit, this thing scared the bejeezus out of me. A ton of tiny needles meant to roll over my skin. I&#x27;m seriously a pain wuss. Well I sucked it up and used it. Be warned, you&#x27;ll bleed, you&#x27;ll feel stinging, and your face will be red for about a day or so. Don&#x27;t press too hard. I made that mistake in some areas. My skin totally felt better once the redness had faded. I use this once a week to try to stave off horrible lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received at promotional price for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Love love love these derma rollers! I&#x27;m using it to help heal my scar areas from a few major surgeries I&#x27;ve had. So far so good! Just please make sure you read the instructions to their entirety.  I made the mistake of skimming through them and um ya not a good idea lol... Not that I&#x27;ve read the instructions and I am following them, I am starting to see some results.</li>
            <li> A little scared to use at first, but it was not that bad. I see a little improvment.</li>
            <li> my first advice is use it lightly! The difference this makes after just one use is amazing! Definitely make sure and use the vitamin c serum afterwards! It will feel like you have a slight sunburn and your face will be a bit red so I would suggest doing it at night. It really does work! Love love love it! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and have really started to see a difference!</li>
            <li> This does a great job.  Some practice is needed to get the pressure right, but it works very nicely.</li>
            <li> only used 1 time will try again</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I will put 600 needles on my face! The needles do not hurt at all. It seems work as advertised.</li>
            <li> good quality, need to use it softly.</li>
            <li> It tingles haven&#x27;t used daily will update when I do</li>
            <li> it seems to tighten up the skin.  It causes circulation and circulation&lt;br /&gt;causes healing.</li>
            <li> Painful with oil and without</li>
            <li> I have large pores and been looking for a product that will address my issue. A friend of mine gave this to me as a gift and I was actually excited to try it although I was hesitant it will work. To my surprise, it did! After a couple of weeks I noticed how my pores appear to be a bit smaller, still noticeable but definitely smaller. I will continue using this and hope it will make my pores even smaller.  I even purchased another one for my husband.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time.  Didn&#x27;t hurt at all and you can see the pinkness coming back in your complexion. Will do on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> I have used this roller for 3 days so far and I am loving the results!  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my face feel after using!!!  BYE BYE wrinkles  :)</li>
            <li> I was little afraid to use this product because of the needles. It doesnt hurt but I can definitely feel it. It has improved wrinkles on my forehead. I never heard about this product and then I got this to give my honest opinion. Im surprised and amazed to use discover and use this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my acne scars (boxcar type) on my cheeks. wasn&#x27;t sure how to use this, or how frequent, so I looked up \\&quot;microneedling\\&quot; on Google Scholar. The studies I found used microneedling with 1.0 - 1.5 mm needles, with intervals a minimum of 4-6 WEEKS. Read: ONCE A MONTH at the earliest. It takes our skin about 21 days to heal itself, and even longer to start producing collagen. Micrneedling more frequently (daily, every other day, twice a week or once a week) will do more damage than harm. Most scars will need a total of 4 treatments &#x3D; 4 months to see results.    PRINCIPLE: During treatment, the needles pierce the stratum corneum, creating holes without damaging the epidermis. \\&quot;Microneedling leads to the release of growth factors which stimulate the formation of new collagen (natural collagen) and elastin in the papillary dermis. In addition, new capillaries are formed-this neovascularisation and neocollagenesis following treatment leads to reduction of scars.\\&quot; They said it is okay to see blood -- and in fact this is how they determine that microneedling was effective. I suppose if you don&#x27;t see any, you probably did not penetrate the skin deep enough to stimulate collagen production.    POST-CARE: The subjects in the study were adviced to use antibiotics on their face for two to three days after the procedure. This makes sense, since we are purposefully \\&quot;damaging\\&quot; the skin. Sun exposure was avoided. SUNSCREEN IS MANDATORY to avoid post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.    Needless to say, sterilize the roller (I&#x27;m not really convinced it&#x27;s titanium, loooks like silver to me) before and after every use to avoid bacterial growth. I have a UV toothbrush sterilizer that came with my sonicare toothbrush, which I use on my roller sometimes as well.    Microneedling with dermaroller can be combined with chemical peels, microdermabrasion, and fractional resurfacing, to maximize the benefits. Do not do them back to back and make sure you give your skin enough time toheal.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about this product but after trying it only a few times on my face, I am pleased with the results so far.  I&#x27;m also using it my tummy to see if it will help with stretch marks and tightening up post-baby skin.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference already in my face . Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Love this! I find it just a little uncomfortable but it is worth it! Have noticed a good improvement in fine lines and acne scars. Have only been using a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I am going on 39 years young this year and i do have some acne scars as well as a scar from a spider bite on my face. I wanted to try this product to try and help my skin on my face. When i first got it i was scared to try it out as i am not used to any product that has to deal with tiny needles. I followed the instructions to find out that it does not hurt to use it. Yes it does make your skin red but that is o.k. I am a stay at home mom so i don&#x27;t mind using this first thing in the morning and at night. If you have to go to work or do other things during the day then I suggest using it at night as your skin will be a little red from using this product. You can use moisturizer afterwards as the product suggests to do so. I will continue using this product to see the end results of it.</li>
            <li> I love this lil device! It has helped my skin improve in texture and brightness. I had a lot of dark spots and acne scars and this helped make them disappear. I already convinced my cousin to buy it b/c of its effectiveness</li>
            <li> Great product, executes amazingly.</li>
            <li> I have been derma rolling for awhile now but only using a bigger needle one. I loved it so I decided to buy a smaller one for every couple of day use instead every couple of weeks. I love this one it is easy to use. I know it looks painful but its not. Do research before using derma rollers.  This one is well made and no bent needles like others I have purchased. It makes my skin feel and look better.</li>
            <li> This is the second derma roller I&#x27;ve purchased, one for me and one as a gift. These rollers if used properly and consistently can make a huge difference in the look and feel of your skin. My skin is much softer to the touch, and although I&#x27;ve had acne scarring in the past, I&#x27;ve been using less foundation! I use the derma roller once a week, then follow it up with hyluaronic acid then an oil free moisturizer. I would recommend for minimizing fine wrinkles, laugh lines, and scars/blemishes.</li>
            <li> Working better than expected. I have an old scar on my knee and it had decreased in size and is a lot less noticeable. Is for adult use. Teen should use with adult supervision.</li>
            <li> great quality product</li>
            <li> great product!! i used it last night and i already see a difference!!! very well made product!! easy to use!</li>
            <li> OUCH OUCH OUCH!! I used this for about two weeks on one leg. I used it on my thigh, bottom, and back of my leg. I am pretty sure I see a difference in the amount of cellulite on the leg I used it on but OUCH! It is hundreds of little needles. I can see using this if I was extremely bothered by cellulite or stretch marks, but right now it will go in my beauty drawer for a few years down the road. Takes about 10 minutes just to do that much of my body, so it is kind of time consuming for a busy person. I will say it works, but to me, beauty is not pain. not yet anyways!</li>
            <li> Promising. Hoping it will reduce acne scars.  I was a little scared of all the needles but it really isn&#x27;t bad!! Time will tell if I see improvements, but I&#x27;m willing to try anything. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great quality! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I use it on my face. After I use it on my face I apply my skin care products. I haven&#x27;t used it very long so I don&#x27;t know for sure if it&#x27;s going to do anything or not. But I do have high hopes.</li>
            <li> I like this product just wish it was a little wider as it takes a while to do a whole body section. It is somewhat calming especially if you have someone else do it for you. I could see a small difference after a week of use so I am excited to see what a month of use will do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now and I can honestly say it helps. It did take some time to see results but my skin has changed on my face. Easy to use and get used to. I only use it once a week because I did notice it felt like it dried my skin out but that could just be from using the roller. I also like how it comes with a container to store it in when your done. Will definitely getting another one once this one is time to be replaced.</li>
            <li> This Derma Roller arrived as expected and as promised. Surprising enough, it also came sterilized and wrapped up tight. First time using was an experienced. Understood the instructions and especially when stating about applying pressure. If you are using this for the first time, I suggest the pressure you place is light as a feather. There is a difference to be seen! Thank you for this product and great delivery!</li>
            <li> I started using this a couple of months ago and by the way it did not help me at all .It was a waste of money and time .DO NOT BYE THIS PRODUCT. All it did was scratch up my skin and make me bleed.It just made my situation worst. Instead of getting rid of marks it produced scars 😡.</li>
            <li> this dose help but if you have sensitive skin i would avoid using n the face&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;br /&gt;i received this in return for my review</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She saw me using mine and wanted one. Great price and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> So far so good, i have used it only 4 times so far, i will keep everyone updated, i need to give it at lease a month</li>
            <li> This is one of the most interesting beauty products I have tried. I must admit I was a little scared, but curiosity got the best of me and I am glad it did! I have to say the first time I used the roller it felt a little funny, but it wasn&#x27;t painful. I started to actually enjoy the feeling of using it, after I had rolled it on my face for a minute. Everyone should try this product at least once in their life. I have been using it for several weeks and I can see a difference in the fine lines on my face. This would also make a great gift for any beauty product lovers in your life. You don&#x27;t want to share your personal derma roller with other people, so make sure you buy one for your friends and family members so they can try out this awesome product.</li>
            <li> Love it and got it in the mail fast!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen results from the 1.0inch derma. I only use my once every 3-4 weeks and long with a vitamin oil, but I love this on seriously! Do more research on derma rollers, results can take some time and it&#x27;s not recommended to be used everyday, at least this size.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using if on my thighs for my cellulite along with a serum and in just a couple of weeks I noticed a huge difference!  I would definitely recommend this product to any one with cellulite concerns!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was a bit afraid but you get used of it and it works great. It&#x27;s been 2 months since my purchase and have no complains. A++</li>
            <li> Great item, great price! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought.  I actually heard about this product from a friend.  She highly recommended the product so can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
            <li> Love it, love the feeling</li>
            <li> It works as promised. It is cheaper than Thermage or other laser treatments. It takes time. Don&#x27;t rush it. There is a wait time between uses to allow for healing. I do it at night, apply a face oil, go to sleep and by morning the redness is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use on broken skin, acne, etc. Clean face and tool with rubbing alcohol before use to prevent any infections. Apply a face oil, serum or cream after use. I use it on my face and neck. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this Derma Roller is that it has the 600 needles. It doesn&#x27;t hurt when rolling. I use it on my stomach to hopefully rid some of my stretch marks. So far I have noticed a slight difference. I am hoping for a more noticeable change in the days to come. I use the derma roller in the morning and in the evening. I use the derma roller when I am apply moisturizer as the derma roller helps the moisturizer absorb better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The derma roller itself is well made, durable, and the pins are durable and have not bent. Which is a problem I was having with my previous derma rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to get your skin looking back to the way it was when you were younger this derma roller will help. Not over night but there will be changes in the next few weeks and months to come.</li>
            <li> I love this derma roller. I will continue to use it to get the results that I want. It&#x27;s a good idea to look at some videos for instruction.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit scared, it looks like there are a million needles sticking out of it. I have only been using it a week, but I do notice a difference. I will add that if you use it with lotion it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!</li>
            <li> I seem to collect these things. I love them for my stretch marks and fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I finally used my derma roller as I was afraid to do so. I Have never used a priduct like this before, but I am soo happy I did..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not as bad as I thought it would be, My face felt awesome after doing this. Can&#x27;t wait to do it again.</li>
            <li> It works! I see a big improvement on my belly. Skin is tightening and the stretch marks are fading. Hooray. Love it</li>
            <li> Great product!  Easy to use, costs so much less to do at home than going to a pro.  Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The needles were not punching into the skin.  I was just getting indentations. I don&#x27;t see any results. Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> Great buy. Works as stated. It takes a few minutes to get used to it but after you get used to the feeling it really feels great.</li>
            <li> this is a very interesting product. i did not know what to expect when i ordered this, and wow this is a a interesting feeling using it&lt;br /&gt;on your skin. so far so good, i hope it improves even more over time.</li>
            <li> What an amazing new product.  This has worked wonders on my bags and wrinkles. I have been using my own for quite some time now and my friends all notice great results. I am THRILLED. I will indeed be gifting these to my friends. Compact, slick and sturdy design.  packaging and presentation are jaw dropping and the customer service is unparalleled. Kudos to the derma roller for stretch marks and keep it up.  You have earned a loyal customer for life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and It does help. It took sometimes to see the result. Easy to use and does hurt that much. I use it once a week with serum. It came in with a nice package and container to keep it clean. I like it so I purchased a big one for the body as well</li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon said these don&#x27;t work but I&#x27;m gonna disagree. I&#x27;ve had this spot on my leg that working out wasnt fixing I use this tool it&#x27;s almost gone. Hurts a little it&#x27;s not horrible. If you have cellulite issues you&#x27;ll like it</li>
            <li> I have used this on a scar at the nasal labia fold and so far, I haven&#x27;t seen any changes.  Either I&#x27;m not rolling it proper or expecting too much so I&#x27;ll keep on trying and see if there is any improvement.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd purchase of a derma roller as I found having different sizes for different parts of face &amp; body is helpful. Needless to say I am a fan of the whole concept and have been getting good results paired with vitamin C serum. Just be sure to do your homework on the proper use of product, you can find a ton of videos and instructions on the web. It&#x27;s important to get the proper size for your skin. I received this at a reduced cost in exchange for an honest review which I was happy to do this being my favorite brand.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Very fast shipping also</li>
            <li> Works great! You MUST follow the exact directions.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday. Yes, I can see that it brings redness to the skin, so this should do something. I used it on my hands, but it really drew blood there. but only once on my face. I was using it medium strength, I think. I put on HA peptide serum first, then worked it into the skin with the roller. Now, I had the HA done by a pro using needle pokes all over the face. The HA serum was inside the needle and she went poking around my entire face sticking little pricks of the NA into my face. She said it takes 3 months to really see how this increasing the collagen and reduces wrinkles. A friend sent me there and she was a regular...at 32! It was like $100 per treatment. Well, I can see if I order the serum and use the roller I can do the same thing at home at my leisure or every single day if I want, and save literally thousands of dollars and tons of time. I spent a lot of research before buying THIS ONE, and I was impressed with the quality, nice case, good quality and professional presentation. Not sure if the needles are titanium, they don&#x27;t seem that precise, but I will use Peroxide to rise them off after each use. Should be good enough. I don&#x27;t really write that many reviews until months later, but I needed to come on here and find the &amp;#34;peptide&amp;#34; advice in some review or another. I think it will work better starting around 40, doing is regularly. I believe it does, in fact, help the skin. I will also try on little bald areas, but it seems to get stuck in the hair except in bare areas. GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b2129ef95c64a7eb452c04bff83f109a]] I use them for my fine lines and cellulite.  I have more than one roller to target the different areas of the body that I want to work on.  It gives you a youthful look.  It helps get rid of stretch marks.  I need help in that area after having 3 children. These rollers can help with acne too!!  They are needles, so make sure to keep them clean. They are like a razor and don&#x27;t last forever.  So don&#x27;t be surprised when the needles go dull.  What did you expect, them to stay sharp forever?  Will the razor you shave your legs with last forever?!? NO.  Make sure to replace your Roller to have an effective skin care regimen.  You deserve it!! I know I do!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful way to exfoliate and bring all kinds of circulation to the surface of the skin. You can feel the needles poking. So be careful of how much pressure you apply. Also you better not have a fear of needles, this is full of them. It&#x27;s not a quick overnight cure you have to be patient and diligence about using it. Be careful about how much pressure you apply especially on bone areas like the bridge of the nose and forehead. It does pinch a little, but after a while you come to like the feel, it reminds you no pain ... No gain. There is a GAIN.</li>
            <li> Love it...just use it every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Dont know if it works yet but people saying its pain free and doesnt hurt well it does its more of an annoyance when you get used to it especially on the face.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I have never heard of this product. I read it over and was skeptical. Was thinking, \\&quot;No pain, no gain\\&quot;!I It does hurt a little but no more than microdermabrasion.  However, after using this product only a few times, I noticed a difference in my skin. It makes my skin tighter and I can notice the deep wrinkle in my forehead improving with each use. I only wish I had discovered this product sooner! Although I got this product for free or discounted price,  I ensure that my thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
            <li> I was little afraid to use this product because of the needles. I have to say the first time I used the roller it felt a little funny, but it wasn&#x27;t painful. I have used this roller for 2 weeks so far and I am loving the results! I noticed a difference in my skin. It makes my skin tighter. What an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to use this kind of product but this one is great. It&#x27;s smaller so I can manipulate it to cover all areas. I can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> After using this product 1x/day just over 1 week, I have already seen noticable difference in the overall lift of my face, it is much tighter. I am very pleased thus far, though I will note that it does leave a lingering tingle in your face for a few hours, which just tells me its got elevated blood circulation, and it does leave a rosey hue to your skin...I also apply vitamin E oil when done. The seller is very prompt with replying to any situation that may arise,  my first one I will admit seemed to have 1 of the needle tracks misaligned slightly, thus leaving small scratches, but the seller replaced it 100% free.</li>
            <li> The results take sometime. but this derma roller&lt;br /&gt;Actually works!</li>
