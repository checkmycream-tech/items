            <li>What a great job it does!.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Great Hair Day covers the bald spots perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Fills it in beautifully.</li>
            <li>Does a beautiful job.</li>
            <li>If you DO have thinning hair, it does a great job of adhering to your scalp to make your hair look thicker (I can tell at my part line).</li>
            <li>A great product to help fill in thinning places at my temples.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great camouflage.  </li>
            <li>In which case, it would probably work great to cover thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>My hair color is probably best described as &amp;#34;bright light auburn&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this; it was &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Loved Joan, and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The powder is very easy to apply and blends in nicely.</li>
            <li>Hair thinning on top.</li>
            <li>I thought the compact was too brown for my red hair,but it blended perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>Have used it and the brunette color in combination together and love the results...</li>
            <li>The red color is perfect for my light auburn hair</li>
            <li>and it is more of a brown/auburn color, rich in color;</li>
            <li>Washes out easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s actually a pretty nice powder,  </li>
            <li>Been using Joan River&#x27;s Great Hair Day in Red for over 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I apply with a light hand so it coordinates with my hair.</li>
            <li>wish Amazon would allow us to give a review for the specific product we purchased - specifically the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; Joan River&#x27;s Great Hair Day powder - rather than just the brand.</li>
            <li>particular product makes an excellent eyebrow filler for me, as I actually like my eyebrows to be darker than my hair (and they are not).</li>
            <li>i was concerned this wouldnt be good for my red hair</li>
            <li>and I bought some for my sister-in-law who has light brown hair and the color is right for both of us.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff and will definitely buy more.  </li>
            <li>Super noticeable.</li>
            <li>Great for when im travelling and also due for a coloring!</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Just the right shadowing to cover my scalp where my hair is thinning.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is so strong this product can&#x27;t be used by someone like me who is sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>Needs more red.</li>
            <li>I wish it had been more red.</li>
            <li>I like this product much better than the cream versions on the market; it blends in so well with my hair that it instantly makes my hair look thicker.  </li>
            <li>If you have large bald spots, however, it will not cover all of that.  </li>
            <li>A million times more effective than my expensive hair replacement.</li>
            <li>Well, I have light auburn hair and there was NO red in this product.</li>
            <li>My hair grows so fast I have to dye it every 4 weeks</li>
            <li>I would recommend this highly!</li>
            <li>A real boon to her life.</li>
            <li>You could really tell I was using it.  </li>
            <li>it really does help your hair look fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite go to&#x27;s...especially for someone with hair loss due to thyroid issues!  </li>
            <li>It is not really for a lot of gray coverage, in my opinion, but works great for covering the roots, especially in a pinch, such as if you don&#x27;t have new color product for a while.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been very unsuccessful in matching - or even coming close to matching - my red hair.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this product works as well as it does.</li>
            <li>It is very red, but also has a brown undertone - hence the auburn - but is also too light for any of the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; powders, sprays or fibers that I&#x27;ve tried so far - which all seem to be dark brown with a hint of red in them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>one makes a very nice but expensive eyebrow color - unless you happen to have VERY dark auburn hair.</li>

            <li> Hair thinning on top. Fills it in beautifully. Doesn&#x27;t come off until you wash it out.</li>
            <li> Well, I have light auburn hair and there was NO red in this product. It rally is as brown as picture. Bummed.</li>
            <li> Does a beautiful job.</li>
            <li> Needs more red. Moster brown</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this product works as well as it does. I don&#x27;t have thinning hair, but I was looking for a temporary red powder to cover grey roots. The powder is very easy to apply and blends in nicely. If you DO have thinning hair, it does a great job of adhering to your scalp to make your hair look thicker (I can tell at my part line). The powder isn&#x27;t sticky or clumpy and definitely lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so strong this product can&#x27;t be used by someone like me who is sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> I wish it had been more red. The dye did brush on well, but by the end of the day - not so noticeable.</li>
            <li> A great product to help fill in thinning places at my temples.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on an TV add. It is advertized as help for thinning hair. They mentioned briefly covering gray/white roots in between coloring. My hair grows so fast I have to dye it every 4 weeks and its damaging not too mention $$. I figured it was worth a try. What a great job it does!.  I thought the compact was too brown for my red hair,but it blended perfectly. Washes out easily. I would recommend this highly!</li>
            <li> Saved my wife from wigs. A real boon to her life.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff and will definitely buy more.  It does not look fake, rub off or get on your clothing.  It stays until you wash it out and helps me to color less often. The red color is perfect for my light auburn hair and I bought some for my sister-in-law who has light brown hair and the color is right for both of us. It has an ingredient that is also supposedly helpful to your hair, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic!  I have thinning hair at the front of my head and a widening center part.  Great Hair Day covers the bald spots perfectly.  The color matches my auburn hair to a T.</li>
            <li> i was concerned this wouldnt be good for my red hair but i bought the one they said works on all colors and it works like a charm. Great for when im travelling and also due for a coloring!</li>
            <li> Been using Joan River&#x27;s Great Hair Day in Red for over 3 years.  It&#x27;s a great camouflage.  Just the right shadowing to cover my scalp where my hair is thinning.  Love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> A million times more effective than my expensive hair replacement.</li>
            <li> Great product! It could save you an extra week from going to the hair dresser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months since I ordered this product. If I had remembered how expensive it was,  I probably would have sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually a pretty nice powder,  but the color does not match my hair at all. So far I have been very unsuccessful in matching - or even coming close to matching - my red hair. My hair color is probably best described as &amp;#34;bright light auburn&amp;#34;. It is very red, but also has a brown undertone - hence the auburn - but is also too light for any of the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; powders, sprays or fibers that I&#x27;ve tried so far - which all seem to be dark brown with a hint of red in them.&lt;br /&gt;This particular product makes an excellent eyebrow filler for me, as I actually like my eyebrows to be darker than my hair (and they are not). I apply with a light hand so it coordinates with my hair. It stays on well.&lt;br /&gt;I wish Amazon would allow us to give a review for the specific product we purchased - specifically the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; Joan River&#x27;s Great Hair Day powder - rather than just the brand. It would make it easier to check reviews on what we&#x27;re actually looking for.&lt;br /&gt;This one makes a very nice but expensive eyebrow color - unless you happen to have VERY dark auburn hair. In which case, it would probably work great to cover thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this; it was &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  However, now that I have had the opportunity to use it for almost a year, I do find it is a go-to product for me.  It is not really for a lot of gray coverage, in my opinion, but works great for covering the roots, especially in a pinch, such as if you don&#x27;t have new color product for a while.  I have the RED and it is more of a brown/auburn color, rich in color; but, definitely not a bright red.</li>
            <li> I like this product much better than the cream versions on the market; it blends in so well with my hair that it instantly makes my hair look thicker.  Product lasts until you wash it out.  My only disappointment is that the brush pictured was not included in the package.  When I ordered this product through a catalog, the brush was included for the same price.  What gives here???</li>
            <li> You could really tell I was using it.  Super noticeable.</li>
            <li> Loved Joan, and I love this product.  It lasts forever, and it definitely covers the areas where I can see my scalp...without running or being an obvious cover...I pray it stays in stock after Joan&#x27;s passing.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite go to&#x27;s...especially for someone with hair loss due to thyroid issues!  Again, dab, though. It&#x27;s not a replacement hair system.  It is only meant to create an illusion in spots if used correctly.  If you have large bald spots, however, it will not cover all of that.  It&#x27;s simply not built for that!</li>
            <li> Had ordered this last summer to help that look of thinning hair.  Have used it and the brunette color in combination together and love the results... it really does help your hair look fuller and thicker. Haven&#x27;t had issues of it running when I workout and sweat, which was I was a little nervous about, but it hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me.  Will purchase again in future.</li>
