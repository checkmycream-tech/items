            <li>it was a nice shop, it was a gift for a friend and he like it, thanks for all.</li>
            <li>The scent itself is very nice, a surprise as I took a gamble based on listed ingredients and reviews, as I also have Curious, Believe and In Control, which I love, and I was looking for another exotic/spicy.</li>

            <li>You&#x27;d think Amazon would make it right!</li>
            <li>This one has a sweet scent that goes with my personality.</li>
            <li>more so been the processing as I think I did receive free standard shipping so that is ok.     </li>
            <li>had!&lt;br /&gt;It has a sweet and yummy scent..</li>
            <li>recommend it for those who like sweet and spicy but not over powering or too musky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is NOTHING sweet about the fragrance in the bottle I received.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is NOTHING sweet about the fragrance in the bottle I received.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad scent.</li>
            <li>first, all I got was a strong smell of citrus.</li>
            <li>there is just something about the smell of it that I love I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Citrus (orange), sweet, warm vanilla, amber, and a woodsy musk - definitely a \\&quot;winter fragrance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE LOOK ON HER FACE</li>
            <li>but I did think it was kind of gross.</li>
            <li>Took a chance with this because I&#x27;m a fan of the original &amp;#34;Fantasy&amp;#34; and it certainly did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>, that has been moulded to the shape of the perfume bottle/lotion in the box - always - with ever other fragrance I have ever purchased, and that is a good many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very large quantity for the price.</li>
            <li>so I actually wish it was a little stronger but over all very happy with</li>
            <li>Totally recommend this to teens, young adults and adults that are young at heart :) super love this</li>
            <li>After the first spray it just smells like leftover alcohol from the perfume.</li>
            <li>Overall its just an ok scent</li>
            <li>Will last me months:)  </li>
            <li>Not at all what I expected &amp; of course I can&#x27;t return it because it is considered hazardous.</li>
            <li>This actually way better than</li>
            <li>First and foremost, let me just say that I DID NOT buy this perfume because Britney Spears name is slapped all over it, because let&#x27;s face it, we all know this girl didn&#x27;t make this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, now that I&#x27;m off my soapbox...</li>
            <li>this perfume is really one of my favorites!  </li>
            <li>I grow to love perfumes that I didn&#x27;t like, initially.</li>
            <li>There was red stuff all over the bottle around the top, it had not been used or leaking</li>
            <li>I was so upset as I&#x27;ve waited a VERY long time to find this perfume as it contains the \\&quot;Stargazer Lily\\&quot; which is my favorite flower.     </li>
            <li>When I received this it smelt like pure rubbing alcohol with just a hint of flowers or something.</li>
            <li>I happen to like certain citrus scents on my skin, but something just smelled off about it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty orange - neither entirely realistic nor too synthetic - with a hint of cloves and vanilla cupcakes.</li>
            <li>It came very fats and was very affordable -- thank you.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li>Also, I really wanted that spicy orange cake that everybody talked about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To smell anything at all, you have to put your nose straight to where you sprayed, and you cannot smell much even then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took off the cellophane and the box had again been tampered with, ok, and when I open it the perfume was almost completely sideways</li>
            <li>the aesthetics of the bottle, is more than half of the excitement...getting something shiny, new and pretty.</li>
            <li>&amp; it was decent</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this perfume</li>
            <li>I highly suggest that if you are looking for what I was.</li>
            <li>I knew this was going to smell different, but decided it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing the original Fantasy and Radiance in the future, but highly unlikely from here unless they somehow have amazing customer service willing to rectify the situation.  </li>
            <li>I wore it to work right after I purchased it and got several compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a nice little winter fragrance, definitely one I reach for around the holidays.</li>
            <li>Orange citrus scent with a woody dry down amazing scent</li>
            <li>At first I had thought well, it could&#x27;ve gotten jostled in shipping, no big deal.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long, it smells cheap and it&#x27;s for kids/teens.</li>
            <li>i love the way it smells, it comes unwrapped, so be careful to keep it wrap so it won&#x27;t loose the smell</li>
            <li>I wanted something a little bit more mature, but still with a similar line of thought.</li>
            <li>I ended up trying another perfume, Jessica Simpson \\&quot;Fancy,\\&quot; which is similar to Fantasy except with a little bit more of a mature mixture.</li>
            <li>The item I received was in the cellophane, YET it was not sealed and had clearly been opened.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this Britney Spears perfume before and it is by far</li>
            <li>This has been happening to me a lot frequently.</li>
            <li>So far have bought Fantasy, Midnight Fantasy, Circus, In Control and Cosmic Radiance.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have that wow factor with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of the bottle I received is EXTREMELY weak, which is odd, seeing as how most reviews I read spoke to how strong a fragrance it is.</li>
            <li>Normally, you have to spray several times before anything will come out of a new bottle of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not smell spicy to me, it smells like alcohol with a slight sent of sweet.</li>
            <li>Got this as a Mother&#x27;s day gift, not a fan of how short lasting the scent is, but it is pretty smelling.</li>
            <li>o_O</li>

            <li> I will be purchasing the original Fantasy and Radiance in the future, but highly unlikely from here unless they somehow have amazing customer service willing to rectify the situation.  </li>
            <li> I wore it to work right after I purchased it and got several compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a nice little winter fragrance, definitely one I reach for around the holidays.</li>
            <li> Orange citrus scent with a woody dry down amazing scent</li>
            <li> At first I had thought well, it could&#x27;ve gotten jostled in shipping, no big deal.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long, it smells cheap and it&#x27;s for kids/teens.</li>
            <li> i love the way it smells, it comes unwrapped, so be careful to keep it wrap so it won&#x27;t loose the smell</li>
            <li> I wanted something a little bit more mature, but still with a similar line of thought.</li>
            <li> I ended up trying another perfume, Jessica Simpson \\&quot;Fancy,\\&quot; which is similar to Fantasy except with a little bit more of a mature mixture.</li>

            <li> I have bought this Britney Spears perfume before and it is by far</li>

            <li> So far have bought Fantasy, Midnight Fantasy, Circus, In Control and Cosmic Radiance.  </li>

            <li> Normally, you have to spray several times before anything will come out of a new bottle of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not smell spicy to me, it smells like alcohol with a slight sent of sweet.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Mother&#x27;s day gift, not a fan of how short lasting the scent is, but it is pretty smelling.</li>

            <li> \ o_O /</li>
            <li> This perfume, oddly enough, gives me a feeling that all is right or at least fixable in the world.</li>
            <li> packaging is suspicious, as there was a loose bottle of perfume, and small bottle of lotion, both clunking around in a large &#x27;Hidden Fantasy&#x27; box, with no other packaging, save the loose items had been wrapped in tissue paper.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Weak, can barely smell, but what you can, smells NOTHING like the description, or ANY favourable review I have read.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the cap was half off.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Britney Spears hidden fantasy</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it seems to dissipate after a few hours.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge and I was originally disappointed to have to wait a week even if it was on prime.  </li>

            <li> This has become one of my everyday perfume along with paris hilton perfume Heiress.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it 12 times onto a paper towel, in the hopes that perhaps it was just the few sprays that were \\&quot;off\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It smells pretty bad to me.</li>
            <li> I think I may have received an unauthentic item, but I am not sure that can even happen, if Amazon itself is the seller??&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is gross, possibly fake</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is gross, possibly fake</li>

            <li> packaged so sloppily.  </li>

            <li> u can&#x27;t go wrong with this item</li>
            <li> I had never tried this perfume before so it was a blind purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Will always buy my perfumes from amazon from now on. There like $30 cheaper and you get the same product. I took a chance on this perfume because I had never smelt it before, but boy it smells great. This is my going out perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchase a Britney fragrance. This one has a sweet scent that goes with my personality. I used to use circus and I loved it. I will keep trying all Britney perfumes</li>
            <li> I have bought this Britney Spears perfume before and it is by far my FAVORITE scent out of her fragrances and I love all of them! there is just something about the smell of it that I love I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recomended the product</li>
            <li> Unisex.. So guys I recommend you try this scent.. Orange citrus scent with a woody dry down amazing scent</li>
            <li> this parfum is perfect for every one, of any age group, sells great and last for hours.... smell like cake cookies with a fresh fruity sexy aroma EXCELLIENT</li>
            <li> This perfume, oddly enough, gives me a feeling that all is right or at least fixable in the world. I&#x27;ve no idea why this scent evokes that imagery for me. It&#x27;s a pretty orange - neither entirely realistic nor too synthetic - with a hint of cloves and vanilla cupcakes. It has an incredibly calming and mood-boosting effect on me like nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the more puzzling because I couldn&#x27;t identify a Britney Spears song if you paid me to, don&#x27;t like her public persona, and think the bottle is ugly. And I&#x27;m not a teenager. Nonetheless, I will always have a bottle of this on hand!</li>
            <li> I am a hardcore Amazon shopper, and also a Primer member.  I have honestly never had a bad experience until this, I am very sorry to say.  I also am not one to typically \\&quot;bitch\\&quot; or write nasty review about silly things but I believe this is warranted.  The shipping itself seemed to take a very long time,  that may have more so been the processing as I think I did receive free standard shipping so that is ok.     Now, to I was actually upset about.  The package was stated as \\&quot;NEW\\&quot;.  The item I received was in the cellophane, YET it was not sealed and had clearly been opened.  At first I had thought well, it could&#x27;ve gotten jostled in shipping, no big deal.  I took off the cellophane and the box had again been tampered with, ok, and when I open it the perfume was almost completely sideways and the cap was half off. The top portion of what was meant to secure it was bent.  Then when I took out the perfume itself, there are several marks on the glass.  I&#x27;m not talking fingerprints that can be removed, I&#x27;m referring to scratches, scrapes, indents etc in the glass itself. (I&#x27;m trying to find where I can upload the pics I took).    For me, as a perfume collector...the aesthetics of the bottle, is more than half of the excitement...getting something shiny, new and pretty. I was so upset as I&#x27;ve waited a VERY long time to find this perfume as it contains the \\&quot;Stargazer Lily\\&quot; which is my favorite flower.     I have never had such a poor experience, not even on EBAY, or here with things listed as Pre-Owned.      The scent itself is very nice, a surprise as I took a gamble based on listed ingredients and reviews, as I also have Curious, Believe and In Control, which I love, and I was looking for another exotic/spicy. I will be purchasing the original Fantasy and Radiance in the future, but highly unlikely from here unless they somehow have amazing customer service willing to rectify the situation.  They aren&#x27;t blacklisted by me, but I am extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> this product was wonderful and smells great. It came very fats and was very affordable -- thank you.</li>
            <li> Came on time, very nicely priced for a large bottle of perfume and my boyfriend &amp; I absolutely love the smell :)</li>
            <li> completely original and in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance purchased for my daughter, great bargain for the size bottle.</li>
            <li> Love the smell,The bottle is beautiful..Brittney Spears has the best perfumes out there :D Would recommend to anyone! If you like this will also like Midnight Fantasy,And Fantasy...All of her others are awesome too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful surprise. Took a chance with this because I&#x27;m a fan of the original &amp;#34;Fantasy&amp;#34; and it certainly did not disappoint. Last all day just like fantasy...</li>
            <li> Smells sexy and the wife loves it. Happy wife, happy life!</li>
            <li> Got this as a Mother&#x27;s day gift, not a fan of how short lasting the scent is, but it is pretty smelling.</li>
            <li> i love the way it smells, it comes unwrapped, so be careful to keep it wrap so it won&#x27;t loose the smell</li>
            <li> After the first spray it just smells like leftover alcohol from the perfume. Not pleasant...Overall its just an ok scent</li>
            <li> i got this from Kmart.com with out knowing what it smelled like and i love it it smells like oranges i am a bot and i do wear my idols perfumes and no i am not gay bottom line buy the freaking thing</li>
            <li> Very large quantity for the price. Smells very good and lasts a long time. One spray should last an entire day.</li>
            <li> Great Parfum by Britney Spears.  Has a unique scent.  Very pleasant and get a lot of compliments on the scent.  One of her better scents.</li>
            <li> I Just order this on the 10th of December and it came the next day and I choose free shipping so I was Pleasantly surprised, and the perfume smells delicious!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all what everyone hyped it up to be. I&#x27;m disappointed with it and wish I had fone to an actual retailer so that I had the opportunity to sample it. It doesn&#x27;t last long, it smells cheap and it&#x27;s for kids/teens.</li>
            <li> I love Britney Spears perfume, so I wanted to try this one out  I ordered the Britney Spears hidden fantasy and I love it!  It has a good, strong scent and the bottle is HUGE!  Will last me months:)  I would definitely order off of here again</li>
            <li> This is a nice little winter fragrance, definitely one I reach for around the holidays. On me it is cinnamon, cloves, vanilla cake, and orange. Smells just like a holiday baked good, I can&#x27;t stop smelling my wrists when I wear it. The wear on this is fantastic, and when it does start to fade you&#x27;ll still detect the orange notes on your skin.</li>
            <li> i tried it at my friends and loved the smell.... the bottle was a great price for what I paid.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for a while. Finally purchased it. I was looking for something that smelled similar to Dior Hypontic Poison - and found a site that told me this scent was a good alternative.  This is very very similar - but at a fraction of the cost. My only complaint is it seems to dissipate after a few hours. It might just be my body chemistry - but it seems the smell totally disappears after a couple of hours. Citrus (orange), sweet, warm vanilla, amber, and a woodsy musk - definitely a \\&quot;winter fragrance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS SCENT OF PERFUME WE GOT HER FOR CHRISTMAS I ACTUALLY PICKED UP THE 3.4 OUNCE BOTTLE FOR UNDER 20 BUCKS....WELL WORTH THE LOOK ON HER FACE</li>
            <li> This is d most amazing scent ive ever had!&lt;br /&gt;It has a sweet and yummy scent.. Totally recommend this to teens, young adults and adults that are young at heart :) super love this</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It does not smell spicy to me, it smells like alcohol with a slight sent of sweet. It smells pretty bad to me. I had high hopes for this perfume but it turned out really bad. I let my mom smell it she said it smelled good to her, so I guess to each their own on this one.</li>
            <li> Got a great deal on a 1 oz in the store and thought I&#x27;d try it even though I hadn&#x27;t smelled it before.  I really like it.  Smells like orange and cinnamon but it&#x27;s a lighter scent.  I wore it to work right after I purchased it and got several compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I need to spray a lot on to smell it so I actually wish it was a little stronger but over all very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for those who like sweet and spicy but not over powering or too musky.</li>
            <li> birthday present for my daughter who loves this fragrance.  Excellent price.</li>
            <li> I had smelt this in the store awhile back &amp; it was decent so when I received an Amazon gift card I decided to get myself some perfume. When I received this it smelt like pure rubbing alcohol with just a hint of flowers or something. Not at all what I expected &amp; of course I can&#x27;t return it because it is considered hazardous. LOL Why is it hazardous if it is perfume &amp; NOT alcohol. You&#x27;d think Amazon would make it right!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this for my niece , who loves this perfume, and was a lot more expensive everywhere else.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for a young lady and she is very pleased with it!! It was beautifully packaged for giving as a gift.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy Britney Spears&#x27; \\&quot;Fantasy\\&quot; perfume. Unfortunately, I got a little sick of it, since it&#x27;s so sweet. I wanted something a little bit more mature, but still with a similar line of thought. I knew this was going to smell different, but decided it was worth a shot. After looking this up on a fragrance website, I decided to give it a shot.  Unfortunately, it smells just eh. I put it on and I don&#x27;t really care for it. It smells somewhat like citrus combined with chemicals on me. This wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. I happen to like certain citrus scents on my skin, but something just smelled off about it.  I ended up trying another perfume, Jessica Simpson \\&quot;Fancy,\\&quot; which is similar to Fantasy except with a little bit more of a mature mixture. I highly suggest that if you are looking for what I was.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. This has become one of my everyday perfume along with paris hilton perfume Heiress. This actually way better than</li>
            <li> Always a fan of this perfume.  Great scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume, Thank you</li>
            <li> todo bien excelente vendedor me llego lo solicitado y en perfectas condiciones.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, let me just say that I DID NOT buy this perfume because Britney Spears name is slapped all over it, because let&#x27;s face it, we all know this girl didn&#x27;t make this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, now that I&#x27;m off my soapbox... this perfume is really one of my favorites!  I wear Hanae Mori, Euphoria, Amor Amor; I like the strong, clean scents and nothing fruity or nana-like.  When I stumbled upon this perfume years ago at Kohls (maybe?) I really liked it and it struck me as a unique scent.  It&#x27;s not overpowering but also doesn&#x27;t fade within a couple of hours and I get tons of compliments on it.  I even bought a bottle for my mother for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Someone once described this as a warm spicy creamsicle. And it totally is. It&#x27;s very spicy but has a creamy base with orange to it. Doesn&#x27;t last all day, but majority of the day</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;m not a fan of Citrus, AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;And I bought this perfume blindly because I love Fantasy and Midnight Fantasy. Also, I really wanted that spicy orange cake that everybody talked about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, all I got was a strong smell of citrus. I didn&#x27;t like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it again, I got used to it and actually grew to like it..a lot. It started smelling like an Orange Panetone cake, an Italian pastry. Very delicious. Go figure. This has been happening to me a lot frequently. I grow to love perfumes that I didn&#x27;t like, initially.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume and by far the best Britney has out. I&#x27;m a Burbury/Vera wang-princess/bath and body works thousand wishes kinda girl and this is my #1 pick of all. Quality made and the scent lasts for days. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I tried this scent since I love the original Fantasy spray by Britney. This smells very warm like cinnamon. I don&#x27;t wear it outside of my home but I use it now as air  freshner during the winter months.</li>
            <li> it was a nice shop, it was a gift for a friend and he like it, thanks for all. bye</li>
            <li> There was red stuff all over the bottle around the top, it had not been used or leaking so I was confused as to what else it could be from, in the end I am happy with it but I did think it was kind of gross.</li>
            <li> This is too citrus.I thought that I would like this as I read the notes and it has orange and clove in it.It has no staying power and smells like weak flowers and citrus.Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I think I may have received an unauthentic item, but I am not sure that can even happen, if Amazon itself is the seller??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is suspicious, as there was a loose bottle of perfume, and small bottle of lotion, both clunking around in a large &#x27;Hidden Fantasy&#x27; box, with no other packaging, save the loose items had been wrapped in tissue paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never once seen a perfume set (which I didn&#x27;t even purchase - I purchased a bottle listed as 3.4oz, but received this set, containing a 3.3oz bottle.) packaged so sloppily.  There is ALWAYS an insert, that has been moulded to the shape of the perfume bottle/lotion in the box - always - with ever other fragrance I have ever purchased, and that is a good many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube of lotion that came appears to have been used.  It is not sealed in any way, shape, or form, and lotion is gunked all up into the lid, and all around the area from which it extrudes.  I cannot figure out how to add photos, or I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle of perfume sprayed instantly, which is indicative of it having been sprayed previously.  Normally, you have to spray several times before anything will come out of a new bottle of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is absolutely NO WAY the bottle I received is \\&quot;Eau De Parfum\\&quot; - NONE.  Impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the bottle I received is EXTREMELY weak, which is odd, seeing as how most reviews I read spoke to how strong a fragrance it is. To smell anything at all, you have to put your nose straight to where you sprayed, and you cannot smell much even then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What fragrance you are able to smell, is awful - like straight up alcohol, and something.... bitter that sticks in the back of your throat, and makes you want to cough, if that makes any sense.  I sprayed it 12 times onto a paper towel, in the hopes that perhaps it was just the few sprays that were \\&quot;off\\&quot;.  Nope.  Weak, can barely smell, but what you can, smells NOTHING like the description, or ANY favourable review I have read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NOTHING sweet about the fragrance in the bottle I received.  Nothing.  Not even a little tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NOTHING citrus about the fragrance in the bottle I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NOTHING \\&quot;oriental\\&quot; about the fragrance in the bottle I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is gross, possibly fake (I sure hope it&#x27;s fake), probably USED, and I can&#x27;t even return it?!?!?  \ o_O /rable review I have read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NOTHING sweet about the fragrance in the bottle I received.

            <li> This bottle is huge and I was originally disappointed to have to wait a week even if it was on prime.  But it arrived this morning and it came with an additional tube of Body Souffle so it was a big gift set - awesome!  So far have bought Fantasy, Midnight Fantasy, Circus, In Control and Cosmic Radiance.  I love her mix of flowers - musks and fruits - delicious!  Buying again for sure - best deal so far!</li>
            <li> This is a great price for the money and it smells so good u can&#x27;t go wrong with this item</li>
            <li> I had never tried this perfume before so it was a blind purchase. Not a bad scent. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get it again though. It just doesn&#x27;t have that wow factor with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell, but the longevity could be better. Not my favorite Britney Spears perfume, but not the worst either.</li>
            <li> This almost reminds me Sandalwood scented oils for warmers  or diffusers</li>
