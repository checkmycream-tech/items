            <li>Best of all of s the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is best used with the complementary shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells GREAT!</li>
            <li>The size is perfect.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li>♥</li>
            <li>The scent is delicious and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li>The pump is perfect-</li>
            <li>The price is very good for the quality of this product too.</li>
            <li>Smells great, works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good conditioner and doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies, so I say, Yea!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also brought out a beautiful coppery color and shine in my hair that I never knew I had.  </li>
            <li>is a great distribution channel; the price is great and it ships promptly</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is great.  </li>
            <li>It is really great for your hair.</li>
            <li>The product is great.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t have very good slip;  I have to use alot to be able to detangle my shoulder length curly hair.  </li>
            <li>IT MIGHT BE A GOOD CONDITIONER,</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love everything about this product!</li>
            <li>Love Nature&#x27;s gate!</li>
            <li>this product smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shampoo at a great price.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that this product exists.</li>
            <li>love to use and the economy size of 32oz is really the best value for your $$.  </li>
            <li>the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, but I have yet to get the &amp;#34;Herbal&amp;#34; variety when I order it.</li>
            <li>The pump top broke off and opened up.</li>
            <li>I saved most of it and use it, but it seems like it takes a lot to cover my hair and</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my hair, too.</li>
            <li>One pump is the perfect amount for my very long hair.  </li>
            <li>It has great slip and it seems to actually &amp;#34;expand&amp;#34; (for want of a better term) the wetter your hair is.  </li>
            <li>whatnot it smells like really strong potpurri.  </li>
            <li>The scent is also extremely strong, so if you&#x27;re looking for something milder, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I suppose because my hair is somewhat fine.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner itself is fine.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and well nourished.</li>
            <li>This is a great, natural conditioner that has just the right nutrients for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;ve used other Nature&#x27;s Gate shampoos &amp; conditioners before and have been really happy with the products.</li>
            <li>Goes with the shampoo review, I love this stuff so much I buy it in bulk!</li>
            <li>Smell great and keeps my long hair detangled.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a very strong smell, which normally I like in a conditoner, but because it is made of herbs and flowers and</li>
            <li>I actually KNOW what the ingredients are, and they&#x27;re good for me - not toxic to my body and environment.</li>
            <li>Other than the pump, this product is great.</li>
            <li>Natures Gate has great products but this one is too heavy on the scent.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I find that the pump is helpful while standing in the shower; however, you have to pump a lot to get the right amount to condition your hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a gentle way to clean and nourish your hair.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I believe if the pump hole were bigger that this would be a much better package.</li>
            <li>as it is a medium brown color not the creamy white most conditioners are....</li>
            <li>I feel like it isn&#x27;t conditioning so much as perfuming.</li>
            <li>I tried tons and tons of hair conditioners and none really improved the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>hair is dark brown and very fine; this conditioner works gently and makes it shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I am allergic to many other products that make my scalp break-out; these 2 products are so gentle that I have no adverse</li>
            <li>love the smell although it doesn&#x27;t do a lot of conditioning.i mix it up with another less fragrant brand of conditioner...</li>
            <li>The first time I got a very menthol-y tea tree scent that was firmer than toothpaste, and the second time I got sunflower and pomegranate, which is also much thicker than the herbal.</li>
            <li>That being said, while using the conditioner in the shower, the aroma is a little strong however, once your hair is rinsed and dried, you&#x27;re left with a warm, spicy scent.  </li>
            <li>I usually end up using it after I use my first conditioner that actually makes my hair feel soft and manageable to get that lovely scent.</li>
            <li>I always thought I had pretty dull light brown hair, but using this conditioner along with the shampoo has given my hair color</li>
            <li>At first it took a little getting used to the feeling of the conditioner on my hair -- I was so used to the automatic silky feeling of other, more chemical-ridden conditioners -- but</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I can brush my through my hair without any problems and it feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I smell like an old woman.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the nag champa incense I like so much which totally appeals to my boho side.  </li>
            <li>As for performance, it leaves my course, wavy hair with soft, bouncy defined waves.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used in conjunction with Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Daily Cleansing Shampoo and by the next day my hair looks super greasy and isn&#x27;t easily brushed.</li>
            <li>Damaged in shipping,but luckily it was in a plastic ziploc or it would have been a mess.</li>
            <li>but it certainly doesn&#x27;t work on dry curly hair.</li>
            <li>Love the way it leaves my hair only negative comment is the pump.</li>
            <li>The first time you see it you may be a little surprised</li>
            <li>and it left this really old smell on my hair that kinda reminded me of a nursing home.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, other products from Natures Gate don&#x27;t disappoint, but I really regret buying this &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair (African American) and it doesn&#x27;t try out my hair and actually encourages my curls!</li>
            <li>THAT IT IS A PLAIN CONDITIONER TO BE USED AFTER SHAMPOOING YOUR HAIR FIRST.  </li>

            <li> I have natural hair (African American) and it doesn&#x27;t try out my hair and actually encourages my curls!</li>
            <li> THAT IT IS A PLAIN CONDITIONER TO BE USED AFTER SHAMPOOING YOUR HAIR FIRST.  </li>
            <li> other people complained that it does not provide enough conditioner on one pump and that is because you don&#x27;t need that much conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Not thick or creamy like other conditioners (Jason, NYM, Avalon Organics) and seems difficult to completely rinse out.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> highly, highly recommend (and this is coming from someone who was very skeptical about natural beauty products).</li>
            <li> With other products, I can wait a day or two between washing (since over-washing isn&#x27;t always so good for hair) and not look terrible.</li>
            <li> And I completely approve of it ecologically, HOWEVER, the Herbal scent is quite disgusting.</li>
            <li> This is a little frustrating, because other varieties of Nature&#x27;s Gate conditioner have totally different consistencies and properties.</li>
            <li> Or don&#x27;t put any fragrances in it at all because that is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure about the texture or how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> A year ago, I tried to go blonde... hated it and decided to get my hair dyed back to brunette.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hair is really thick</li>
            <li> Dear Nature&#x27;s Gate, please step up your scent game</li>
            <li> I agree with someone else&#x27;s review that this product smells awful- between an old lady perfume &amp; a mans cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so unlike the other conditioners out there, that are made with crap.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the pump doesn&#x27;t prime well</li>
            <li> Works well, smells weird (think herbal baby powder), takes a ZILLION pumps to coat hair.</li>
            <li> All, I can say is that my household loves this conditioner and the smell is bad at all.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT WAS A CLEANSING CONDITIONER SIMILAR TO WEN.  AFTER RECEIVING, I FIND OUT THAT IT IS A PLAIN CONDITIONER TO BE USED AFTER SHAMPOOING YOUR HAIR FIRST.  NO WHERE ON THE BOTTLE DOES IT SAY \\&quot;CLEANSING CONDITIONER\\&quot;, BUT AFTER CONTACTING SELLER, THEY WERE INSISTING I HAD RECEIVED THE CORRECT PRODUCT.  IT MIGHT BE A GOOD CONDITIONER,IF THATS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR,BUT IT IS NOT A CLEANSING CONDITIONER. BE CAREFUL,VERY MISLEADING.</li>
            <li> Natures Gate has great products but this one is too heavy on the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Wen user for 15 years, but when I decided to go gray, Wen wasn&#x27;t working for me. I still wanted a non-sulfate shampoo and conditioner. This is perfect for me. My hair feels clean, soft and smooth. Best of all of s the price. It costs one third of what I paid for the more expensive conditioners.</li>
            <li> Moistened up my hair. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> this product smells amazing. However, I&#x27;m not sure about the texture or how it makes my hair feel. I feel like it isn&#x27;t conditioning so much as perfuming. I usually end up using it after I use my first conditioner that actually makes my hair feel soft and manageable to get that lovely scent. Probably won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle way to clean and nourish your hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark brown and very fine; this conditioner works gently and makes it shine.&lt;br /&gt;It is best used with the complementary shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;While I am allergic to many other products that make my scalp break-out; these 2 products are so gentle that I have no adverse effects.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great distribution channel; the price is great and it ships promptly</li>
            <li> love the smell although it doesn&#x27;t do a lot of conditioning.i mix it up with another less fragrant brand of conditioner...this way, it works for me.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, but I have yet to get the &amp;#34;Herbal&amp;#34; variety when I order it. This is a little frustrating, because other varieties of Nature&#x27;s Gate conditioner have totally different consistencies and properties. The first time I got a very menthol-y tea tree scent that was firmer than toothpaste, and the second time I got sunflower and pomegranate, which is also much thicker than the herbal. Let&#x27;s see if the third time&#x27;s a charm...</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s so unlike the other conditioners out there, that are made with crap. I actually KNOW what the ingredients are, and they&#x27;re good for me - not toxic to my body and environment. Plus, this product works so well. My hair is smooth and well nourished. It smells GREAT! I love everything about this product! The price is very good for the quality of this product too. You just can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I find that the pump is helpful while standing in the shower; however, you have to pump a lot to get the right amount to condition your hair.  I believe if the pump hole were bigger that this would be a much better package.</li>
            <li> Damaged in shipping,but luckily it was in a plastic ziploc or it would have been a mess. The pump top broke off and opened up. I saved most of it and use it, but it seems like it takes a lot to cover my hair and the smell is very strong. Not enough conditioning for me and my hair is a bit frizzy using this.</li>
            <li> All, I can say is that my household loves this conditioner and the smell is bad at all. This is our second purchase and I believe this is the brand we will stick with. The size is perfect.</li>
            <li> A year ago, I tried to go blonde... hated it and decided to get my hair dyed back to brunette. Unfortunately, my hair is really thick and I would struggle to brush it after every wash because of the severe damage. I tried tons and tons of hair conditioners and none really improved the condition of my hair. Until this. WOW. I can brush my through my hair without any problems and it feels so soft. I will forever be buying this. I am thrilled that this product exists.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. It&#x27;s like the texture of hair dye.This product feels slippery yet does zero conditioning. I bought this with the purpose of using it as a cleansing conditioner to combat tangles &amp; dryness. It says it is a detangler for all hair types but it certainly doesn&#x27;t work on dry curly hair. It does nothing to detangle my hair. I have to struggle with my wide-toothed comb in the shower to finally detangle my curls. I agree with someone else&#x27;s review that this product smells awful- between an old lady perfume &amp; a mans cologne. It&#x27;s asphyxiating in the shower. Hopefully, other products from Natures Gate don&#x27;t disappoint, but I really regret buying this &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo at a great price. Smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> I like that this conditioner is all natural(no chemicals, parabens, sulfates, etc.) but it doesn&#x27;t have very good slip;  I have to use alot to be able to detangle my shoulder length curly hair.  Also, it has a very strong smell, which normally I like in a conditoner, but because it is made of herbs and flowers and whatnot it smells like really strong potpurri.  Just my opinion.  It is a heavier conditioner than I need I suppose because my hair is somewhat fine.  It didn&#x27;t do the job that I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is fine. And I completely approve of it ecologically, HOWEVER, the Herbal scent is quite disgusting. I smell like an old woman. It&#x27;s musty and Everyone I&#x27;ve come into contact with hates it. If given the chance, BUY ANOTHER SCENT!! Unless you want to smell like grandma.</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve used other Nature&#x27;s Gate shampoos &amp; conditioners before and have been really happy with the products. I decided to try out this regular daily conditioner and I&#x27;m sorry but it smells godawful. Used it once and it left this really old smell on my hair that kinda reminded me of a nursing home. Dear Nature&#x27;s Gate, please step up your scent game lol. Or don&#x27;t put any fragrances in it at all because that is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works wonderfully.  Really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t purchased this conditioner from Amazon (yet!), I do use NGs Herbal Daily conditioner almost daily and have for over a year now.  I actually use this to co-wash with and I love it.  The first time you see it you may be a little surprised (I was!) as it is a medium brown color not the creamy white most conditioners are....don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s supposed to be like this.  A little goes a long way.  It has great slip and it seems to actually &amp;#34;expand&amp;#34; (for want of a better term) the wetter your hair is.  As for the scent, I guess it is an acquired taste, so to speak.  It reminds me of the nag champa incense I like so much which totally appeals to my boho side.  That being said, while using the conditioner in the shower, the aroma is a little strong however, once your hair is rinsed and dried, you&#x27;re left with a warm, spicy scent.  As for performance, it leaves my course, wavy hair with soft, bouncy defined waves.  Combine this with the argan oil I use as a finishing product and I have zero frizz.  This conditioner is definitely one of my beauty staples!  ♥</li>
            <li> I just got it! So I am looking forward to trying it!</li>
            <li> This is a great, natural conditioner that has just the right nutrients for your hair.  At first it took a little getting used to the feeling of the conditioner on my hair -- I was so used to the automatic silky feeling of other, more chemical-ridden conditioners -- but once I began rinsing it felt so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also brought out a beautiful coppery color and shine in my hair that I never knew I had.  I always thought I had pretty dull light brown hair, but using this conditioner along with the shampoo has given my hair color dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend (and this is coming from someone who was very skeptical about natural beauty products).</li>
            <li> Goes with the shampoo review, I love this stuff so much I buy it in bulk! The scent is delicious and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. Smell great and keeps my long hair detangled. Unfortunately, the pump doesn&#x27;t prime well and I end up having to transfer the product to a squeeze bottle. Other than the pump, this product is great.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells weird (think herbal baby powder), takes a ZILLION pumps to coat hair.</li>
            <li> love to use and the economy size of 32oz is really the best value for your $$.  Love the scent and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my hair, too.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is great.  It leaves my hair even smoother and softer then I ever imagined.  The pump is perfect- other people complained that it does not provide enough conditioner on one pump and that is because you don&#x27;t need that much conditioner.  One pump is the perfect amount for my very long hair.  The smell is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Love Nature&#x27;s gate! It is really great for your hair. I have natural hair (African American) and it doesn&#x27;t try out my hair and actually encourages my curls!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to almost everything, and even though fragrance is included, it&#x27;s the last ingredient on the list.  It&#x27;s a good conditioner and doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies, so I say, Yea!</li>
            <li> The product is great. Love the way it leaves my hair only negative comment is the pump. Its of inferior quality.</li>
            <li> I buy this repeatedly</li>
            <li> Not thick or creamy like other conditioners (Jason, NYM, Avalon Organics) and seems difficult to completely rinse out. I&#x27;ve used in conjunction with Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Daily Cleansing Shampoo and by the next day my hair looks super greasy and isn&#x27;t easily brushed. With other products, I can wait a day or two between washing (since over-washing isn&#x27;t always so good for hair) and not look terrible. The scent is also extremely strong, so if you&#x27;re looking for something milder, look elsewhere.</li>
