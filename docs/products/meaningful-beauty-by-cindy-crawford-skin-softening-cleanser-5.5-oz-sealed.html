            <li>I love that my skin isn&#x27;t drying out this winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for three years and my skin is sooo soft and supple and flawless thanks to meaningful beauty.</li>
            <li>I tried this product yesterday for the first time and it burned lightly on my skin...</li>

            <li>Always have plenty of the other products that come in the Meaningful Beauty package but never enough of this daily cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is worth the price; only half as much at the stores.</li>

            <li> Been using this for years and it has totally changed my skin for the better.  I love it and will always use it.</li>
            <li> Great price for the size.  Great shipping time.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. Good cleanser. The moisturizer products are good too. Buy through Amazon though. Cheaper and you don&#x27;t have the commitment of Meaningful Beauty.</li>
            <li> Love love love! Changed my skin!</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I read so many negative (painfully so) reviews listed under this product.  This is a gentle, effective facial cleanser, which is exactly what I want.  My skin is sensitive, and practically anything can cause my skin to flake or to be blotchy with reddened areas.  This tames all that nonsense.  My skin is soft, touch-able, and smooth enough for any makeup application, although now I use mostly a tinted moisturizer.  While I don&#x27;t think the purpose of this product is to prevent wrinkles, I can say my skin looks pretty good...for being 60-ish...</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these products, but hate their normal distribution system. Wonderful we can get on Amazon.</li>
            <li> love all products.  I have sensitive skin and this works great!</li>
            <li> This one of the better products on the market without breaking your pocketbook.  I have been using this for years now, ever since Ms. Crawford introduced it on her infomercial.  The product does not itch even if you have sensitive skin like I do.  I use it morning and night, then I follow the steps for moisturizing with the whole system</li>
            <li> I have tried all the name brand products and this is the only one that has made a noticeable improvement in my skin.  I wish I would have started using it years ago.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cleanser. My skin feel smooth, soft and hydrated after using it! I love that my skin isn&#x27;t drying out this winter.</li>
            <li> Always have plenty of the other products that come in the Meaningful Beauty package but never enough of this daily cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is worth the price; only half as much at the stores.</li>
            <li> I tried this product yesterday for the first time and it burned lightly on my skin... I tried it tonight again (just in case) and it burned again.  Not comfortable with this reaction on my skin.  I will return it.  Awful product.</li>
