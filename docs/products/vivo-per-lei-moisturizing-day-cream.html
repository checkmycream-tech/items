            <li>The package is quite charming and the moisturizer itself smells heavenly.</li>
            <li>It came on time and in good order.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>this is a good moisturizer for the face.</li>
            <li>A surprising side benefit: it heals the roughness that gardening causes to my fingertips.</li>
            <li>However, as menopause hit me this winter, I struggled to find a moisturizer that would soak in and do a good job.  </li>
            <li>It may be a good face cream for $10, but it is not vivo per lei.</li>
            <li>I loved this cream.</li>
            <li>I think this is a knock off, but it&#x27;s still good for the price.</li>
            <li>All the Vivo items are good</li>
            <li>the smell so good.</li>
            <li>service and good product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so oily so good for summer</li>
            <li>Everyone should go for and the price is soooooooooooo good.</li>
            <li>, the quality is exceptional.  </li>
            <li>Exceptional price for an exceptional product .  </li>
            <li>so I loved this purchase, it is the cheapest that I found, although I probably would have paid more!</li>
            <li>Very light on your skin, feels great.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, and feeling is better.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product it is economical and great ingredients!</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing on the skin.  </li>
            <li>When I got up to the room I tried the day creme, and It was amazing.  </li>
            <li>The day cream goes on light and smells great.  </li>

            <li>A great light daytime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The day cream leaves a nice moisturizer on your skin without grease.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer gives your skin a nice glow, and have received compliments; must be the seaweed.</li>
            <li>The texture felt nice though.</li>
            <li>Liked that I didn&#x27;t pay mall kiosk price for this.</li>
            <li>so I am unsure how effective it is as of yet.  </li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of my grandma...</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Liked it but said I would never get it again.</li>
            <li>My wife received 2 or 3 sample packets and she liked the results so</li>
            <li>and I liked the way it felt on my skin</li>
            <li>If you do not like a smell to your product you might not like it, but, to me the smell is a nice smell and does not bother me.</li>
            <li>My face liked it</li>
            <li>It felt nice on my skin...but made me itch after 4 days.</li>
            <li>Day Cream is not greasy and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is effective all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice smell.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any kind of acne break out either .</li>
            <li>The set was originally $150.00!?!  </li>
            <li>The cream itself is very good, although there hasn&#x27;t been time to use it very much.</li>
            <li>Also, I live in Australia and even though it said 3 weeks for delivery this arrived within a week - AWESOME service as well!!</li>
            <li>The fragance is wonderful and my skin feels so very, very soft.  </li>
            <li>Very modestly priced and a perfect cream.</li>
            <li>Having said this, I have combination skin and this proves to be a great night cream for me with out leaving my skin oily</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I found this to be an excellent product, absorbed quickly without a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>This is great for whoever has oily skin, as it goes right into your skin.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect, very light and soft.</li>
            <li>Got this originally as a Christmas gift from a store in California and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I also use the vivo peeling which is great for breakouts but not necessary to see great results with the cream...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found it at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Item arrived on time, was well packaged and the great customer service is greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li>So I knew it was too good to be true to get it for $12.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was too good to be true</li>
            <li>its very smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a very light and creamy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Originally bought this while on a trip to Hawaii, paid WAY too much but loved how it leaves my face feeling great.</li>
            <li>Very happy with purchase and happy not to deal with shady kiosk people.</li>
            <li>Feels nice, smells fine.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love</li>
            <li>This product, for me, if great for the winter but not so much in the summer.</li>
            <li>, i wish they had something with more moisture in it, my skin seems to suck it up... but love the results</li>
            <li>and my skin is clearing up, and looks more even toned.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found the product here.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>

            <li>I love all their products.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Vivo Per Lei on my face is the most inviting moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It was really overwhelming</li>
            <li>I was buying this at a kiosk in my mall and it was 8x more costly.</li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>I love this product and so glad I can purchase it online at a reduced rate.</li>
            <li>Like Many Others I Found Out Of This Product Through A Vendor At A Kiosk</li>
            <li>Absolutly The Most Fully Functiining Cream I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>As much as I love this product, I will never purchase it again anywhere but Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I order products, I always look for this line as an add-on just to be sure I never run out.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>But she was able to get her set for $75.00 because the boxes were damaged.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would check Amazon to see if I could snag a better deal and voila, I did.  </li>
            <li>A much better deal than the mall.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and scent of this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Cant complain , I love it :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>you use the better</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Purchasing a lotion without SPF means I have to add sunscreen on top of it.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s too many layers for</li>
            <li>After the day was over and a mass amount of sweating had been done, i wanted nothing more then to wash the makeup, sweat, dirt and downtown ickiness off my face.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, light weight.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this.  </li>
            <li>Love this day cream as well as the night cream.  </li>
            <li>You will find better products here in the U.S., over the counter in a drug store.</li>
            <li>not that I don&#x27;t love my grandma, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition</li>
            <li>am buying more from the line.&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>Glad I could find it on line to buy because I had bought it in the mall on a trip.</li>
            <li>I chose to rate this product with a 5 star, and happy that I found it online to purchase it cheaper because the mall prices are very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have given it four stars because it does not have UV protection like many moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love with it and rationed the amount I used so as to prolong the amount of time I was able to use it, because I thought that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it.</li>
            <li>Try your self and u will love it</li>
            <li>Amazons got you. :)</li>

            <li>When I opened the jar it had a strong smell, but what the heck lets give it a try.</li>
            <li>Strong smell.</li>

            <li>It is light and not greasy and seems to moisten well.  </li>
            <li>I actually feel like I can be proud of my skin.</li>

            <li>It has helped smooth my skin a bit.  </li>
            <li>Go to the mall and this cream goes for $80, so much more worth it on here</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting such great results.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance that is not overpowering, and it does not feel greasy when you use it.</li>
            <li>And I adore its consistency and light scent.</li>
            <li>I sure did, but I still thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Cause basically its a cheap over scented lotion that will break you out.</li>
            <li>This product is so light and non greasy, can be used for day or night.</li>
            <li>Especially reading the overwhelmingly great reviews.</li>
            <li>I had been looking recently for a great day cream that was not heavy and good underneath my makeup.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin so smooth .</li>
            <li>and my skin feels good and soft.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a nice cream, smooth &amp; you don&#x27;t need to use much -</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the cream makes my skin feel so soft and smell so good.</li>
            <li>This facial cream has an wonderful scent, texture and really makes your face feel moisturized for&lt;br /&gt;quite</li>
            <li>It has a fairly strong fragrance, but otherwise not bad.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant scent and goes on smoothly, just need a little amount.  </li>
            <li>It has a light &amp; clean feel on your face.  </li>
            <li>I took it for granted that the day cream would be as good as the eye cream, but it smells so strong that I can only use it on my legs and feet.  </li>
            <li>this is our first time using this type of cream and we love it.</li>
            <li>so I compared the ingredients and the original</li>
            <li>This is a rich creamy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I originally bought at mall kiosk.</li>
            <li>the original and legititmate product does not contain this so this must be a knockoff.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>My sister claimed since using the set her rosacea has diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li>Super, super!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product originally @</li>
            <li>It might be too rich for me.</li>
            <li>The original price was that of the highest end creams on the market.</li>
            <li>It was very enjoyable to say I got the product for 13 bucks on amazon and just completely tell them off as I walked away.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since my Dad gifted me my first jar in 2012.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is not the original, its made in japan.</li>
            <li>bought this as a gift for friends, it is a quality brand with significant results&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is clean to use and clean on the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li>Shipping from the company I ordered on Amazon was fantastic and I quickly received the package.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better price than OROGOLD for the same amazing results.</li>
            <li>kinda greasy, if you have dry skin it will be great, as for me</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft after using but I honestly haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27; s just a cream, nothing special about it</li>
            <li>Still, it makes my skin feel so soft and amazing,</li>
            <li>so I decided to check Amazon to see if they carried it at a more reasonable price and they did.  </li>
            <li>Love the whole line of products</li>
            <li>but it is keeping my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The shipping was reasonable and the packaging was safe.</li>
            <li>okay, don&#x27;t really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Such a good line of products that my girlfriend tried &amp; recommended to me.  </li>
            <li>So much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Now, I am going back to the Shiseido Bio-Performance line for good.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this cream, and it is much cheaper than prices in the mall.</li>
            <li>vivo is my face cream so light yet powerful on skin.</li>
            <li>The only good thing was it was a product I never would have known about.</li>
            <li>but I didnt feel it good enough for winter season.</li>
            <li>Product is good, but personally can&#x27;t use it often.</li>
            <li>Premier, I&#x27;m here if you need a true testimonial or model for your product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with this moisturizer when I found it at the mall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably fine for most people that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling nourished, soft, and with consistent use, my skin looks more supple and healthy.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, packaging was adequate.</li>
            <li>It is key to use the facial peeling if you have skin like mine to get the best effect.  </li>
            <li>super bummed.</li>
            <li>you for your quick response.</li>
            <li>This is great for everyday use and keeps my skin smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li>Had the moisturizing cream and eye treatment applied at a local mall several months ago and was impressed.  </li>
            <li>I have a mild case of rosacea.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, too.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and so smooth to use.  </li>
            <li>i hadn&#x27;t ever really found a face cream that i liked enough to buy more than once</li>
            <li>Have used this product several times and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive skin, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Good for dry skin and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I am 53 YO and this has made my skin very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and it looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love it so far!</li>
            <li>My pores are much smaller now that I am able to keep my skin moisturized without clogging them up!  </li>
            <li>I really like it, it just gets absorbed by the skin, i do not like stuff that does not blend easily.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li>It does not cause any irritation, is light weight yet very moisturizing and does not contain any SPF.</li>
            <li>that the container is 1/3 filled the texture is much thicker than the one I bought before.  </li>
            <li>The moisturing creams (Day and Night) are a great disappointment to be honest they are a GREAT GREAT DISAPPOINTMENt.  </li>
            <li>I began using this product with the face peel gel, the peel works great, but this moisturizer clogs my pores and has a heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>According to her it goes on smoothly, is quickly absorbed and leaves her face feeling silky.</li>
            <li>Female, 62 and loving it.  </li>
            <li>This is such a nice product.</li>
            <li>I was a sun person most of my adult life and was getting sun spots....</li>
            <li>Received my product  was really pleased with it, can notice a difference in my skin in the last two weekd, fantastic product, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I personally love this sent and have sensitive skin and have had no problem with it</li>
            <li>I gave it a four star because the second time I bought it it didn&#x27;t seem to give me the same amazing results as the first time but it was still pretty good.</li>
            <li>The price on amazon can&#x27;t be beat and the cream is well worth it.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue behind and is great morning and evening!</li>
            <li>I do recommend for people with oily skin, I am 49 and after using my face felt young. :)</li>
            <li>if you have problem skin this is worth whatever you have to pay for it.</li>
            <li>Vivo per Lei Day Moisturizer Cream is a powerful rejuvenating Anti- aging combination.</li>
            <li>A powerful rejuvenating Anti- aging combination.</li>
            <li>But the peeling gel is a bit under expectation, while all the other products are good buys.</li>
            <li>Gave as a gift and it was greatly appreciated and was excited to get it.  </li>
            <li>goes a long ways they the facial  peel is very good too.</li>
            <li>The cream is very light and not greasy, and feels much better on my somewhat oily skin than my previous moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This has a wonderful effect, sort of plumping up my aging skin, and making it feel less fragile.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed easily and your face is so soft and not oily at all.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item a few months ago and liked it!  </li>
            <li>I have tried lots of products with Vitamin A, and many other types of minerals for all different prices and nothing is a good as this product.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and break out easily.  </li>
            <li>Good for Dry older Skin.</li>
            <li>decided to buy a cheap, light, simple day-to-day face</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>This cream is much greasier and of a much more pungent fragrance, and does not apply anywhere near the same as the authentic version.</li>
            <li>Ordered 3 and the first 2 were delivered today.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice per week and love how it deep cleans and exfoliates my face leaving it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing cream makes your skin soft, silky smooth and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>It feels so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I Wasn&#x27;t Willingly Going To Pay $60 For A Jar</li>
            <li>I was looking around and found this product at first i was hesitant but</li>
            <li>I fell into the Kiosk trap at my local mall and actually love this product line.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this cream when my sister came over for a visit.  </li>
            <li>I too bought the first jar in the mall in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>First purchased at much higher price before finding on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I will start using it more often to see if it helps my skin look younger and softer</li>
            <li>, it contains several oils, including mineral oil, that I am sure would make me break out if I were to apply it on my face.</li>
            <li>so I looked on Amazon and low and behold there is was and to top it off</li>
            <li>But it really has helped the wrinkles!</li>
            <li>On the Vivo Per Lei website there is absolutely no ingredient information, just a strange infomercial and incredibly inflated prices going all the way up to 250 dollars.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>It was packed so pretty.</li>
            <li>I love this facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes and is the right consistency.  </li>
            <li>One is in a nice box as in the photo and the other is in bubble wrap/plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth all day long without that greasy feeling you get with most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin looks and feels after using this product: soft, moist and young.</li>
            <li>Found it here for much cheaper than the first jar we bought at a women&#x27;s show.</li>
            <li>Very luxurious and pretty.</li>
            <li>Pretty much if I don&#x27;t throw it away, I&#x27;m planning to use it as a hand cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a good Dead Sea mosturizer that wasn&#x27;t going break my bank account, and found one!</li>
            <li>This stuff is just as good, if not better</li>
            <li>This brand is readily available at the mall for 25-40 dollars depending on how low the sales people are willing to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure luxury.</li>
            <li>and it certainly has helped my face bloom.</li>
            <li>The price was considerably less, but still the same great product.</li>
            <li>Helps with the fine lines, especially around the eyes and mouth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivered fast</li>
            <li>The consistency of the cream is much like Ponds.</li>
            <li>I really like the lightness and non-greasiness of the moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like it, BUT for the price and going forward..  </li>
            <li>This moisturizing cream does moisturize really well</li>
            <li>This was very upsetting to me</li>
            <li>so it will either go to someone else who wants to try it or to the trash.</li>
            <li>Very luxurious feeling moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I really just did not like the smell.</li>
            <li>I really like this day cream and the cleanser that goes with it.  </li>
            <li>thanks God I bought this.</li>
            <li>This face cream is soothing and hydrates my face really well.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much healthier since I started using Vivo Per Lei.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>My face is much smoother now.</li>
            <li>The container it came in was over filled, so I can only assume it was replaced with another type of cream.</li>
            <li>I was on vacation in Las Vegas staying at a very well known hotel.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light, absorbs into my skin well, and seems to be already minimizing some of my deeper lines, after only about a month of use.</li>
            <li>Extremely reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>it really didn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>I thought while this was creamy, it was also very perfumed.</li>
            <li>Since using this product my skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li>If your&#x27; re looking for a daily cream that is light in texture and scent, this is it.</li>
            <li>The medicated face wash that I use tends to leave the corners of my mouth and eyes very flaky, so I need to have a reliable moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This feels very silky on my skin and stays that way until evening when I cleanse my face.  </li>
            <li>Bought this at a kiosk in the mail and paid 3 times as much.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to soak in but instead remained on the surface of my skin which made too much make up stick to my face for an unnatural look.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for the product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li>I hate creams that feel greasy, but this moisturizer is perfect because it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or grease.</li>
            <li>When I was able to purchase the same name and size on-line for considerable saving, I ordered two.</li>
            <li>Face feels good after applying, and it is a good makeup base.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is packaged well even without gift options and serves as a very economically efficient present</li>
            <li>I began breaking out within 2 days of using this, and trust me, its not the right time of the month for unexpected acne.</li>
            <li>This is not the same cream as the original</li>
            <li>Think this product was not the original but a generic form.</li>
            <li>Wish it had a different fragrance scent, but after the moisturizer is absorbed into the skin the results rate higher than the smell.</li>
            <li>I have been using a different face moisturizer for years that I&#x27;m happy with, but wanted to give this one a try after getting a small sample at a mall.</li>
            <li>Oh my this stuff has high fragrance, and it really makes me break out.</li>
            <li>Should have know if I can&#x27;t try first, clear sign to \\&quot;HURRY</li>
            <li>I am a daily user of this product and I must say as a 42 year old woman who most would guess in her early 30s</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;nt be surprised if the first ingredient was perfume in this stuff.</li>
            <li>Had dsome old cream to use up first, but I think I will like it.</li>
            <li>They could tone down the fragrance,or better yet, no fragrance at all.</li>
            <li>and skin is soft again and not tough!</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with the facial peel and it leaves my skin as smooth as my 14 month old&#x27;s butt...</li>
            <li>I have used more expensive moisturing products, but this one is better.</li>
            <li>It did not irritate my sometimes very sensitive skin, but it also didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>The price was too high at the kiosk.  </li>
            <li>but I would highly recommend this for any age.</li>
            <li>I highly reccoment this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I use it as NIGHT cream and not DAY cream because it does not have SPF which I highly recommend for everyone to use on their skin during the day..</li>
            <li>All of them highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li>Its light, but moisturizing and works really well with the other products I use on my face.</li>
            <li>This is the only day cream I use now that Amazon has it for such an amazing low price.</li>
            <li>PLEASE DONT BUY FROM SALES GURU HE SELLS THE FAKE ONE Product works great for my skin</li>
            <li>In general, I pretty like their lines of products.</li>
            <li>Vivo is one of my favorite brands of dead sea products.  </li>
            <li>your skin is normal to greasy</li>
            <li>and when I wake up in the morning i normally find a colony of zit friends and grease all over.</li>
            <li>It is a dead sea product and I&#x27;ve come to love their items.</li>
            <li>This cream has transformed my skin to now being perfectly normal with no sensitivity - to me</li>
            <li>: Use daily on freshly cleansed skin.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 3 stars and not 4 because is good but not great, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Does even better for way less cost!</li>
            <li>(my hubby actually says it reminds him of juicy coutour perfume only not as strong)</li>
            <li>It goes on light and a little goes a long way and makeup  goes on smoothly without any&lt;br /&gt;blotching.  </li>
            <li>Would like a new bottle</li>
            <li>I tried the more expensive version of this - Oro Gold, which I bought in Vegas for a huge amount of money.  </li>
            <li>The sales practice at mall kiosk is dishonest, very pushy and price is almost 5 times more than the price here.  </li>
            <li>Nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li>I recommend these products to young and older women.</li>
            <li>Same smooth texture, same scent.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp; it works well on my skin.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not sure if there should have been more cream in the jar?  </li>
            <li>The price on amazon is a fraction of the mall price and it&#x27;s the exact same product!</li>
            <li>Since I started using the Vivo Per Lel Peel once a week and the toner and moisturizer daily, my face looks so much better than it did with my other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Let me just say I don&#x27;t really know what I put I my face that morning, but it went right back into the box and sent back.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and a little dab on your chin, nose, both cheeks, and forehead go a really long way.</li>
            <li>First of all, I would rather they&#x27;d spent more on the product &amp; less on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I saw a booth at a mall near where I live selling Vivo Per Lei and \\&quot;Premier\\&quot; Skin care products for 80 dollars and up.</li>
            <li>Specially created using pure, natural minerals from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased this product at a kiosk in a local mall but the price was substantially more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right cream for my 60-year old face - with patches of oily and dry skin, but this just seems to be the cream my skin needs.</li>
            <li>Using Vivo Per Per Lei Day Moisturizer Cream will also provide you a certain sun protection ( SPF-10) as it is formulated with several natural sun protection ingredients.</li>
            <li>this is the exact same I highly recommend this product I also use the facial peel and the body scrub and lotion and amazon</li>
            <li>I no longer have to use cream or pills to clear up my Roseca.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and not grease.</li>
            <li>I have replaced my old skin care with these products</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for nearly 2 yrs and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this day cream, I have noticed a marked difference in the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Although I have sensitive skin, the fragrance does not bother it.</li>
            <li>I am *mature*</li>
            <li>but I also have issues with acne and my whole life has been a battle of finding a lotion that isn&#x27;t too greasy but that actually works...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too light or too heavy.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your face and neck feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Do not use if you have sensitive skin or are opposed to fragrances in face cream.</li>
            <li>So far I like these products.&lt;br /&gt;.Vivo</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t get it near your eyes as I had chapped eyelids.  </li>
            <li>The smell is putrid (smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume), but that&#x27;s why you wear it at night at bedtime.</li>
            <li>leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy at all</li>
            <li>Purchased the same product from Amazon and saved so much money.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I am 74 years old.</li>
            <li>makes my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I like this moisturizer to use during the winter months, kept my skin very moisturized and glowing, it seems a bit greasy, but during winter I don&#x27;t mind because my skin get so irritated because of the cold, and this cream kept it well behave during those winter months, will not be using it in the summer, because I&#x27;M PRONE TO BREAKOUTS, and I feel this will cause them if I used it during the summer.so far a good product and well priced.</li>
            <li>Does not cause break outs yet leaves your soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to anyone with mature skin</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old</li>
            <li>After one month of using it, my skin is soft and smooth and does not feel dried out by night time.  </li>
            <li>Bought the moisturizing cream (expensive) and loved it.  </li>
            <li>face cream is heavily perfumed-not good for anyone&#x27;s face &amp; has a ridiculously long list  ingredients ,  the worst ones at the top &amp; the most important much farther down.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry harsh climate this works better than creams I&#x27;ve paid 2-3 times the amount for.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly the same, had the same smell, feel, etc.</li>
            <li>tried this product at one of the kiosks and it was way different than the watered down cheap product I got in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe high end malls allow such scamming.  </li>
            <li>I originally paid $50 at the mall and my last Amazon shipment was less than $10 as an add-on product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product I have very sensitive dry skin and have a hard time with products</li>
            <li>However, that&#x27;s probably not due to the product - my skin doesn&#x27;t react well to anything.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re just wasting your money purchasing anything for your face if you don&#x27;t use a broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It is light and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>high end&#x27; product can be sold for $5.99 when even St. Ives products are more expensive.  </li>
            <li>Very expensive there but have started buying here and same great product without mall price</li>
            <li>Left my face so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I will be 60 years old next month.  </li>
            <li>Will order again in the near future.</li>
            <li>To my surprise the minimal i put on covered my whole face.</li>
            <li>Back when I was around 11-12 years old</li>
            <li>my skin wasn&#x27;t broken out, wasn&#x27;t greasy and most of all the softest ive ever felt it.</li>
            <li>An ideal base for make-up.</li>
            <li>Ive previously used various types of lotions without success.</li>
            <li>It is the same scent added to the Vivo body butter which is too strong to wear on face; well at least it is for me.  </li>
            <li>I then searched on here and found the exact same product for much less.</li>
            <li>(it is a little greasy, but for older women with mature skin</li>
            <li>The most dramatic difference was the next morning when i woke up</li>
            <li>It left my face looking a little shiny, which was okay since my skin is very dry, but that might not work as well for other skin types.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I hate heavy creams and this is so light, but effective on keeping my skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for my wife who, for reasons unknown to me, cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li>If you have a dry complexion, i completely endorse this cream.</li>
            <li>My significant other raves about this product, she uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li>I normally have to be very careful of what face wash and moisturizer i use.</li>
            <li>Well worth the discounted price found on Amazon - I use mine daily in the morning and it has lasted 2 months so far - probably at least another month to go!</li>
            <li>Just use it like you would those little sample packets - you don&#x27;t need much at all to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li>Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have extremely dry skin or live in an extremely dry place.</li>

            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> this is a good moisturizer for the face.</li>
            <li> A surprising side benefit: it heals the roughness that gardening causes to my fingertips.</li>
            <li> However, as menopause hit me this winter, I struggled to find a moisturizer that would soak in and do a good job.  </li>
            <li> It may be a good face cream for $10, but it is not vivo per lei.</li>
            <li> I loved this cream.</li>
            <li> I think this is a knock off, but it&#x27;s still good for the price.</li>
            <li> All the Vivo items are good</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not so oily so good for summer</li>
            <li> Everyone should go for and the price is soooooooooooo good.</li>
            <li> , the quality is exceptional.  </li>
            <li> Exceptional price for an exceptional product .  </li>

            <li> Very light on your skin, feels great.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, and feeling is better.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product it is economical and great ingredients!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> A great light daytime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The day cream leaves a nice moisturizer on your skin without grease.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer gives your skin a nice glow, and have received compliments; must be the seaweed.</li>
            <li> The texture felt nice though.</li>
            <li> Liked that I didn&#x27;t pay mall kiosk price for this.</li>
            <li> so I am unsure how effective it is as of yet.  </li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of my grandma...</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Liked it but said I would never get it again.</li>
            <li> My wife received 2 or 3 sample packets and she liked the results so</li>
            <li> and I liked the way it felt on my skin</li>
            <li> If you do not like a smell to your product you might not like it, but, to me the smell is a nice smell and does not bother me.</li>
            <li> My face liked it</li>
            <li> It felt nice on my skin...but made me itch after 4 days.</li>
            <li> Day Cream is not greasy and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is effective all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any kind of acne break out either .</li>
            <li> The set was originally $150.00!?!  </li>
            <li> The cream itself is very good, although there hasn&#x27;t been time to use it very much.</li>
            <li> Also, I live in Australia and even though it said 3 weeks for delivery this arrived within a week - AWESOME service as well!!</li>
            <li> The fragance is wonderful and my skin feels so very, very soft.  </li>
            <li> Very modestly priced and a perfect cream.</li>
            <li> Having said this, I have combination skin and this proves to be a great night cream for me with out leaving my skin oily</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I found this to be an excellent product, absorbed quickly without a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> This is great for whoever has oily skin, as it goes right into your skin.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect, very light and soft.</li>
            <li> Got this originally as a Christmas gift from a store in California and loved it.  </li>
            <li> I also use the vivo peeling which is great for breakouts but not necessary to see great results with the cream...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found it at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time, was well packaged and the great customer service is greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li> So I knew it was too good to be true to get it for $12.</li>

            <li> its very smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is a very light and creamy moisturizer.</li>

            <li> This product, for me, if great for the winter but not so much in the summer.</li>
            <li> , i wish they had something with more moisture in it, my skin seems to suck it up... but love the results</li>

            <li> Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei on my face is the most inviting moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It was really overwhelming</li>
            <li> I was buying this at a kiosk in my mall and it was 8x more costly.</li>
            <li> I am in love.</li>
            <li> I love this product and so glad I can purchase it online at a reduced rate.</li>
            <li> Like Many Others I Found Out Of This Product Through A Vendor At A Kiosk</li>
            <li> Absolutly The Most Fully Functiining Cream I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> As much as I love this product, I will never purchase it again anywhere but Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I order products, I always look for this line as an add-on just to be sure I never run out.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> But she was able to get her set for $75.00 because the boxes were damaged.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would check Amazon to see if I could snag a better deal and voila, I did.  </li>
            <li> A much better deal than the mall.</li>

            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Purchasing a lotion without SPF means I have to add sunscreen on top of it.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s too many layers for</li>
            <li> After the day was over and a mass amount of sweating had been done, i wanted nothing more then to wash the makeup, sweat, dirt and downtown ickiness off my face.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, light weight.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this.  </li>
            <li> Love this day cream as well as the night cream.  </li>

            <li> not that I don&#x27;t love my grandma, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition</li>
            <li> am buying more from the line.&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Glad I could find it on line to buy because I had bought it in the mall on a trip.</li>
            <li> I chose to rate this product with a 5 star, and happy that I found it online to purchase it cheaper because the mall prices are very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have given it four stars because it does not have UV protection like many moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I immediately fell in love with it and rationed the amount I used so as to prolong the amount of time I was able to use it, because I thought that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it.</li>

            <li> Strong smell.</li>

            <li> Go to the mall and this cream goes for $80, so much more worth it on here</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting such great results.</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance that is not overpowering, and it does not feel greasy when you use it.</li>
            <li> And I adore its consistency and light scent.</li>
            <li> I sure did, but I still thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Cause basically its a cheap over scented lotion that will break you out.</li>
            <li> This product is so light and non greasy, can be used for day or night.</li>
            <li> Especially reading the overwhelmingly great reviews.</li>
            <li> I had been looking recently for a great day cream that was not heavy and good underneath my makeup.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so smooth .</li>
            <li> and my skin feels good and soft.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a nice cream, smooth &amp; you don&#x27;t need to use much -</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the cream makes my skin feel so soft and smell so good.</li>
            <li> This facial cream has an wonderful scent, texture and really makes your face feel moisturized for&lt;br /&gt;quite</li>
            <li> It has a fairly strong fragrance, but otherwise not bad.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant scent and goes on smoothly, just need a little amount.  </li>
            <li> It has a light &amp; clean feel on your face.  </li>
            <li> I took it for granted that the day cream would be as good as the eye cream, but it smells so strong that I can only use it on my legs and feet.  </li>
            <li> this is our first time using this type of cream and we love it.</li>
            <li> so I compared the ingredients and the original</li>
            <li> This is a rich creamy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I originally bought at mall kiosk.</li>
            <li> the original and legititmate product does not contain this so this must be a knockoff.</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> My sister claimed since using the set her rosacea has diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li> Super, super!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product originally @</li>
            <li> It might be too rich for me.</li>
            <li> The original price was that of the highest end creams on the market.</li>
            <li> It was very enjoyable to say I got the product for 13 bucks on amazon and just completely tell them off as I walked away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since my Dad gifted me my first jar in 2012.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is not the original, its made in japan.</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for friends, it is a quality brand with significant results&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is clean to use and clean on the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li> Shipping from the company I ordered on Amazon was fantastic and I quickly received the package.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better price than OROGOLD for the same amazing results.</li>
            <li> kinda greasy, if you have dry skin it will be great, as for me</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft after using but I honestly haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; s just a cream, nothing special about it</li>
            <li> Still, it makes my skin feel so soft and amazing,</li>
            <li> so I decided to check Amazon to see if they carried it at a more reasonable price and they did.  </li>
            <li> Love the whole line of products</li>
            <li> but it is keeping my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The shipping was reasonable and the packaging was safe.</li>
            <li> okay, don&#x27;t really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Such a good line of products that my girlfriend tried &amp; recommended to me.  </li>
            <li> So much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Now, I am going back to the Shiseido Bio-Performance line for good.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream, and it is much cheaper than prices in the mall.</li>
            <li> vivo is my face cream so light yet powerful on skin.</li>
            <li> The only good thing was it was a product I never would have known about.</li>
            <li> but I didnt feel it good enough for winter season.</li>
            <li> Product is good, but personally can&#x27;t use it often.</li>
            <li> Premier, I&#x27;m here if you need a true testimonial or model for your product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this moisturizer when I found it at the mall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably fine for most people that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling nourished, soft, and with consistent use, my skin looks more supple and healthy.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, packaging was adequate.</li>
            <li> It is key to use the facial peeling if you have skin like mine to get the best effect.  </li>
            <li> super bummed.</li>
            <li> you for your quick response.</li>
            <li> This is great for everyday use and keeps my skin smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li> Had the moisturizing cream and eye treatment applied at a local mall several months ago and was impressed.  </li>
            <li> I have a mild case of rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping, too.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced and so smooth to use.  </li>
            <li> i hadn&#x27;t ever really found a face cream that i liked enough to buy more than once</li>
            <li> Have used this product several times and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive skin, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I am 53 YO and this has made my skin very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and it looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love it so far!</li>
            <li> My pores are much smaller now that I am able to keep my skin moisturized without clogging them up!  </li>
            <li> I really like it, it just gets absorbed by the skin, i do not like stuff that does not blend easily.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li> It does not cause any irritation, is light weight yet very moisturizing and does not contain any SPF.</li>
            <li> that the container is 1/3 filled the texture is much thicker than the one I bought before.  </li>
            <li> The moisturing creams (Day and Night) are a great disappointment to be honest they are a GREAT GREAT DISAPPOINTMENt.  </li>
            <li> I began using this product with the face peel gel, the peel works great, but this moisturizer clogs my pores and has a heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> According to her it goes on smoothly, is quickly absorbed and leaves her face feeling silky.</li>
            <li> Female, 62 and loving it.  </li>
            <li> This is such a nice product.</li>
            <li> I was a sun person most of my adult life and was getting sun spots....</li>
            <li> Received my product  was really pleased with it, can notice a difference in my skin in the last two weekd, fantastic product, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I personally love this sent and have sensitive skin and have had no problem with it</li>
            <li> I gave it a four star because the second time I bought it it didn&#x27;t seem to give me the same amazing results as the first time but it was still pretty good.</li>
            <li> The price on amazon can&#x27;t be beat and the cream is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue behind and is great morning and evening!</li>
            <li> I do recommend for people with oily skin, I am 49 and after using my face felt young. :)</li>
            <li> if you have problem skin this is worth whatever you have to pay for it.</li>
            <li> Vivo per Lei Day Moisturizer Cream is a powerful rejuvenating Anti- aging combination.</li>
            <li> A powerful rejuvenating Anti- aging combination.</li>
            <li> But the peeling gel is a bit under expectation, while all the other products are good buys.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and it was greatly appreciated and was excited to get it.  </li>
            <li> goes a long ways they the facial  peel is very good too.</li>
            <li> The cream is very light and not greasy, and feels much better on my somewhat oily skin than my previous moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful effect, sort of plumping up my aging skin, and making it feel less fragile.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed easily and your face is so soft and not oily at all.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item a few months ago and liked it!  </li>
            <li> I have tried lots of products with Vitamin A, and many other types of minerals for all different prices and nothing is a good as this product.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and break out easily.  </li>
            <li> Good for Dry older Skin.</li>
            <li> decided to buy a cheap, light, simple day-to-day face</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> This cream is much greasier and of a much more pungent fragrance, and does not apply anywhere near the same as the authentic version.</li>
            <li> Ordered 3 and the first 2 were delivered today.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice per week and love how it deep cleans and exfoliates my face leaving it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing cream makes your skin soft, silky smooth and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> It feels so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I Wasn&#x27;t Willingly Going To Pay $60 For A Jar</li>
            <li> I was looking around and found this product at first i was hesitant but</li>
            <li> I fell into the Kiosk trap at my local mall and actually love this product line.  </li>
            <li> I first tried this cream when my sister came over for a visit.  </li>
            <li> I too bought the first jar in the mall in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> First purchased at much higher price before finding on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I will start using it more often to see if it helps my skin look younger and softer</li>
            <li> , it contains several oils, including mineral oil, that I am sure would make me break out if I were to apply it on my face.</li>
            <li> so I looked on Amazon and low and behold there is was and to top it off</li>
            <li> But it really has helped the wrinkles!</li>
            <li> On the Vivo Per Lei website there is absolutely no ingredient information, just a strange infomercial and incredibly inflated prices going all the way up to 250 dollars.</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> It was packed so pretty.</li>
            <li> I love this facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes and is the right consistency.  </li>
            <li> One is in a nice box as in the photo and the other is in bubble wrap/plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth all day long without that greasy feeling you get with most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin looks and feels after using this product: soft, moist and young.</li>
            <li> Found it here for much cheaper than the first jar we bought at a women&#x27;s show.</li>
            <li> Very luxurious and pretty.</li>
            <li> Pretty much if I don&#x27;t throw it away, I&#x27;m planning to use it as a hand cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a good Dead Sea mosturizer that wasn&#x27;t going break my bank account, and found one!</li>
            <li> This stuff is just as good, if not better</li>
            <li> This brand is readily available at the mall for 25-40 dollars depending on how low the sales people are willing to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure luxury.</li>
            <li> and it certainly has helped my face bloom.</li>
            <li> The price was considerably less, but still the same great product.</li>
            <li> Helps with the fine lines, especially around the eyes and mouth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivered fast</li>
            <li> The consistency of the cream is much like Ponds.</li>
            <li> I really like the lightness and non-greasiness of the moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like it, BUT for the price and going forward..  </li>
            <li> This moisturizing cream does moisturize really well</li>
            <li> This was very upsetting to me</li>
            <li> so it will either go to someone else who wants to try it or to the trash.</li>
            <li> Very luxurious feeling moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I really just did not like the smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this day cream and the cleanser that goes with it.  </li>
            <li> thanks God I bought this.</li>
            <li> This face cream is soothing and hydrates my face really well.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much healthier since I started using Vivo Per Lei.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> My face is much smoother now.</li>
            <li> The container it came in was over filled, so I can only assume it was replaced with another type of cream.</li>
            <li> I was on vacation in Las Vegas staying at a very well known hotel.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s light, absorbs into my skin well, and seems to be already minimizing some of my deeper lines, after only about a month of use.</li>
            <li> Extremely reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> it really didn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> I thought while this was creamy, it was also very perfumed.</li>
            <li> Since using this product my skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li> If your&#x27; re looking for a daily cream that is light in texture and scent, this is it.</li>
            <li> The medicated face wash that I use tends to leave the corners of my mouth and eyes very flaky, so I need to have a reliable moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This feels very silky on my skin and stays that way until evening when I cleanse my face.  </li>
            <li> Bought this at a kiosk in the mail and paid 3 times as much.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to soak in but instead remained on the surface of my skin which made too much make up stick to my face for an unnatural look.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> I hate creams that feel greasy, but this moisturizer is perfect because it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or grease.</li>
            <li> When I was able to purchase the same name and size on-line for considerable saving, I ordered two.</li>
            <li> Face feels good after applying, and it is a good makeup base.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is packaged well even without gift options and serves as a very economically efficient present</li>
            <li> I began breaking out within 2 days of using this, and trust me, its not the right time of the month for unexpected acne.</li>
            <li> This is not the same cream as the original</li>
            <li> Think this product was not the original but a generic form.</li>
            <li> Wish it had a different fragrance scent, but after the moisturizer is absorbed into the skin the results rate higher than the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using a different face moisturizer for years that I&#x27;m happy with, but wanted to give this one a try after getting a small sample at a mall.</li>
            <li> Oh my this stuff has high fragrance, and it really makes me break out.</li>
            <li> Should have know if I can&#x27;t try first, clear sign to \\&quot;HURRY</li>
            <li> I am a daily user of this product and I must say as a 42 year old woman who most would guess in her early 30s</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;nt be surprised if the first ingredient was perfume in this stuff.</li>
            <li> Had dsome old cream to use up first, but I think I will like it.</li>
            <li> They could tone down the fragrance,or better yet, no fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> and skin is soft again and not tough!</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the facial peel and it leaves my skin as smooth as my 14 month old&#x27;s butt...</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive moisturing products, but this one is better.</li>
            <li> It did not irritate my sometimes very sensitive skin, but it also didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> The price was too high at the kiosk.  </li>
            <li> but I would highly recommend this for any age.</li>
            <li> I highly reccoment this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use it as NIGHT cream and not DAY cream because it does not have SPF which I highly recommend for everyone to use on their skin during the day..</li>
            <li> All of them highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li> Its light, but moisturizing and works really well with the other products I use on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the only day cream I use now that Amazon has it for such an amazing low price.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DONT BUY FROM SALES GURU HE SELLS THE FAKE ONE Product works great for my skin</li>
            <li> In general, I pretty like their lines of products.</li>
            <li> Vivo is one of my favorite brands of dead sea products.  </li>
            <li> your skin is normal to greasy</li>
            <li> and when I wake up in the morning i normally find a colony of zit friends and grease all over.</li>
            <li> It is a dead sea product and I&#x27;ve come to love their items.</li>
            <li> This cream has transformed my skin to now being perfectly normal with no sensitivity - to me</li>
            <li> : Use daily on freshly cleansed skin.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars and not 4 because is good but not great, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Does even better for way less cost!</li>
            <li> (my hubby actually says it reminds him of juicy coutour perfume only not as strong)</li>
            <li> It goes on light and a little goes a long way and makeup  goes on smoothly without any&lt;br /&gt;blotching.  </li>
            <li> Would like a new bottle</li>
            <li> I tried the more expensive version of this - Oro Gold, which I bought in Vegas for a huge amount of money.  </li>
            <li> The sales practice at mall kiosk is dishonest, very pushy and price is almost 5 times more than the price here.  </li>
            <li> Nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I recommend these products to young and older women.</li>
            <li> Same smooth texture, same scent.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; it works well on my skin.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Not sure if there should have been more cream in the jar?  </li>
            <li> The price on amazon is a fraction of the mall price and it&#x27;s the exact same product!</li>
            <li> Since I started using the Vivo Per Lel Peel once a week and the toner and moisturizer daily, my face looks so much better than it did with my other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Let me just say I don&#x27;t really know what I put I my face that morning, but it went right back into the box and sent back.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and a little dab on your chin, nose, both cheeks, and forehead go a really long way.</li>
            <li> First of all, I would rather they&#x27;d spent more on the product &amp; less on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I saw a booth at a mall near where I live selling Vivo Per Lei and \\&quot;Premier\\&quot; Skin care products for 80 dollars and up.</li>
            <li> Specially created using pure, natural minerals from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased this product at a kiosk in a local mall but the price was substantially more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right cream for my 60-year old face - with patches of oily and dry skin, but this just seems to be the cream my skin needs.</li>
            <li> Using Vivo Per Per Lei Day Moisturizer Cream will also provide you a certain sun protection ( SPF-10) as it is formulated with several natural sun protection ingredients.</li>
            <li> this is the exact same I highly recommend this product I also use the facial peel and the body scrub and lotion and amazon</li>
            <li> I no longer have to use cream or pills to clear up my Roseca.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and not grease.</li>
            <li> I have replaced my old skin care with these products</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for nearly 2 yrs and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this day cream, I have noticed a marked difference in the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Although I have sensitive skin, the fragrance does not bother it.</li>
            <li> I am *mature*</li>
            <li> but I also have issues with acne and my whole life has been a battle of finding a lotion that isn&#x27;t too greasy but that actually works...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too light or too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your face and neck feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Do not use if you have sensitive skin or are opposed to fragrances in face cream.</li>
            <li> So far I like these products.&lt;br /&gt;.Vivo</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t get it near your eyes as I had chapped eyelids.  </li>
            <li> The smell is putrid (smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume), but that&#x27;s why you wear it at night at bedtime.</li>
            <li> leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy at all</li>
            <li> Purchased the same product from Amazon and saved so much money.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I am 74 years old.</li>
            <li> makes my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer to use during the winter months, kept my skin very moisturized and glowing, it seems a bit greasy, but during winter I don&#x27;t mind because my skin get so irritated because of the cold, and this cream kept it well behave during those winter months, will not be using it in the summer, because I&#x27;M PRONE TO BREAKOUTS, and I feel this will cause them if I used it during the summer.so far a good product and well priced.</li>
            <li> Does not cause break outs yet leaves your soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone with mature skin</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old</li>
            <li> After one month of using it, my skin is soft and smooth and does not feel dried out by night time.  </li>
            <li> Bought the moisturizing cream (expensive) and loved it.  </li>
            <li> face cream is heavily perfumed-not good for anyone&#x27;s face &amp; has a ridiculously long list  ingredients ,  the worst ones at the top &amp; the most important much farther down.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry harsh climate this works better than creams I&#x27;ve paid 2-3 times the amount for.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly the same, had the same smell, feel, etc.</li>
            <li> tried this product at one of the kiosks and it was way different than the watered down cheap product I got in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe high end malls allow such scamming.  </li>
            <li> I originally paid $50 at the mall and my last Amazon shipment was less than $10 as an add-on product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product I have very sensitive dry skin and have a hard time with products</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s probably not due to the product - my skin doesn&#x27;t react well to anything.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re just wasting your money purchasing anything for your face if you don&#x27;t use a broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It is light and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> high end&#x27; product can be sold for $5.99 when even St. Ives products are more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive there but have started buying here and same great product without mall price</li>
            <li> Left my face so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I will be 60 years old next month.  </li>
            <li> Will order again in the near future.</li>
            <li> To my surprise the minimal i put on covered my whole face.</li>
            <li> Back when I was around 11-12 years old</li>
            <li> my skin wasn&#x27;t broken out, wasn&#x27;t greasy and most of all the softest ive ever felt it.</li>
            <li> An ideal base for make-up.</li>
            <li> Ive previously used various types of lotions without success.</li>
            <li> It is the same scent added to the Vivo body butter which is too strong to wear on face; well at least it is for me.  </li>
            <li> I then searched on here and found the exact same product for much less.</li>
            <li> (it is a little greasy, but for older women with mature skin</li>
            <li> The most dramatic difference was the next morning when i woke up</li>
            <li> It left my face looking a little shiny, which was okay since my skin is very dry, but that might not work as well for other skin types.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I hate heavy creams and this is so light, but effective on keeping my skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife who, for reasons unknown to me, cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li> If you have a dry complexion, i completely endorse this cream.</li>
            <li> My significant other raves about this product, she uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I normally have to be very careful of what face wash and moisturizer i use.</li>
            <li> Well worth the discounted price found on Amazon - I use mine daily in the morning and it has lasted 2 months so far - probably at least another month to go!</li>
            <li> Just use it like you would those little sample packets - you don&#x27;t need much at all to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have extremely dry skin or live in an extremely dry place.</li>
            <li> I left a 3 star because I am not sure this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I take my skincare very seriously &amp; this product seemed to fit the bill</li>
            <li> I purchased both at a mall last year and even though I paid a small fortune for it, I really like what it does for my skin.  </li>
            <li> It also smells really nice, so it&#x27;s not an unpleasant experience to put this</li>
            <li> It will last a long time</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff has the most unbelievably overpowering perfumy scent - I can&#x27;t believe people wear this on their faces.</li>
            <li> This is good cream and in spite of bad publicity about knock offs, it is the same as the over priced sold in malls where they warn you against buying other than from them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the salt from the Dead Sea that dries all of the unnecessary oils and produces a more youthful look to you.</li>
            <li> It contains pure Dead Sea Minerals along with active ingredients; Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Green Tea and Natural Sun Protection.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to use it because I was afraid it would cause me to breakout, of which it never did:)  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance stays a long time and made my eyes water.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes you skin all day long.</li>
            <li> Feels like it&#x27;s been on shelf for a long long time.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel silky and soft and doesn&#x27;t get heavy and clog pores.  </li>
            <li> i thought eh well guess ill be battling dry skin the next few days more than i have been.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used others that worked better that were less expensive.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this with the skin peel based on other customer reviews.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy and goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I only buy it with every other order of lotion.</li>
            <li> Plenty of other creams equivalent to this such as Loreal for $17., Avenno &amp; Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase again with the other products for the eyes by this company.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get dry patches that even after using other facial systems would still be showing up when I put my foundation on.</li>
            <li> I also have combo skin (dry in some spots, oily in others.)</li>
            <li> I also shower/clean my face a lot and that may be part of the reason why my skin is on the dry side.</li>
            <li> I have an oily t-zone but tend to be quite dry everywhere else and breakout when I use lotions that moisturize the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry that I have to use a moisturizer</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> Acne face washes or scrubs dry out my skin in one wash.</li>
            <li> It Makes my face feel moist without being dry.  </li>
            <li> face is generally dry in some areas (chin, cheaks) and oily in others (nose, forehead, neck)</li>
            <li> Would not recommend for anybody, even people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> When i first tried it, i thought it was gonna be too oily because the lotion seemed very thick, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Well, fast forward to nearly two decades, a random kiosk salesman sold me this cream a few months ago, and it turned out to be surprisingly similar to this illicit cream from Germany, if not exactly the same.</li>
            <li> but I would&#x27;nt dare put this foreign, unknown, likely skin damaging garbage onto my face again.</li>
            <li> The product is not the same but appears to be refilled with regular lotion or at least cut with a basic lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and there are very few face creams I can use on my face without breaking out in a rash.  </li>
            <li> Either I was left still feeling tight and dry or the moisturizer would sit on my face without soaking in.  </li>
            <li> I was in Sedona and the air was very dry</li>
            <li> My face is very dry during the winter months and this cream is what saves me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have suffered from rosacea on my cheeks for years, but after using this product, I find that my facial redness has also decreased.</li>
            <li> and it has helped with the dry areas other moisturizer have failed.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> Big thumbs down!</li>
            <li> Mine has absolutely no fragrance.</li>
            <li> The eye treatment bottle was almost empty.</li>
            <li> A Few Weeks Back</li>
            <li> Each time I passed by the gift shop that was selling this product, they were handing out samples and trying to drag me into the shop.  </li>
            <li> This gift was some facial cream with Dead Sea Minerals in it.</li>
            <li> Nice upscale base for the price.</li>
            <li> This small jar will last a long time!</li>
            <li> It works well with my foundation, and I have noticed that my face looks softer than it used to with the other moisturizer that I used to use.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy it again, but would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> refuse to buy any other types of creams..</li>
            <li> She cannot find it at local merchants, at least not reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> lifting serum was empty and other dried up so can&#x27;t use it What a rip no replacement or refund</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s the real deal or a fake product.  </li>
            <li> Go talk them down at the kiosk.</li>
            <li> I only need to use a small amount and my face stays hydrated all day!  </li>
            <li> My skin is Bi-polar to the tenth degree; it&#x27;s bone dry in the winter &amp; an oil slick in the summer.</li>
            <li> Got a 2for1 less than their online price.  </li>
            <li> Received a previously used product.  </li>
            <li> Half</li>
            <li> I am wearing less makeup than I ever had.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this and the Gtatiae line for about a year and a half</li>
            <li> Went on Amazon and bought for a lot less then in Vegas.</li>
            <li> I also found with this product that I tend to not break out as often as I do with previous moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I use face washes that contain benzoyl peroxide which can dry out my face pretty bad sometimes.</li>
            <li> ..my age is 44, I&#x27;m very active in kickboxing, trail running and strength exercises.</li>
            <li> i felt bad digging a finger full out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a real product or a fake</li>
            <li> It can feel a little greasy on my chin</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always looking for a cream that is not greasy since my face is a little on the oily side.  </li>
            <li> This product is a little bit oily so my summer skin can&#x27;t handle it</li>
            <li> I tend to seek out moisturizers that are a little heavier.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a little to greasy.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I will update this review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It soaks in, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this brand is overated, I purchased a few products of this brand ( a toner, the peeling and the mosturising cream and none delivered, there is no change to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding face creams that do not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> The jar and lid are round.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizer are to heavy</li>
            <li> I found it in Las Vegas and had trouble finding it here at home.</li>
            <li> When I got home, found out it was not available in my area.</li>
            <li> Tired this same product in Las Vegas and got results.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> I found this heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> Harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> so buy something less expensive and get the same results.  </li>
            <li> My skin is always dry and that has gotten worse as I age.</li>
            <li> My skin, which has always been ( blessed by genes) blemish &amp; break-out fee, aging well &amp; always well cared for, suddenly started having random breakouts.</li>
            <li> I usually take the sample packets with me when I travel.  </li>
            <li> Its not authentic</li>
            <li> and i apply bb cream after it, the bb cream doesnt show the color as they usually do, so i apply this at night.</li>
            <li> Check out my comments on Dead Sea Night Cream Complex for all the 10 STAR comments on Premier&#x27;s skin line products.  </li>
            <li> I have never in my life felt like that before, except for about a week in the late 90s.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 40s</li>
            <li> A lot of people complained of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> but it was too late &amp; too costly to return</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t cause problems for delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least 6 weeks</li>
            <li> had a terrible problem with adult onset acne (deep cysts that were causing scars) and this product does not aggravate my condition at all - in fact, my acne has improved dramatically since I started using it!  </li>
            <li> you can find mine at the rubbish dump if you dont believe me go ahead and try it, its probably next to a dirty diper</li>
            <li> This delicate moisturizer helps improve blood circulation, relaxes the appearance of expression lines, reduces wrinkles and restores softness, smoothness and radiance.</li>
            <li> After getting suckered into buying the night cream on major discount of $99 at Century City Mall, I learned my lesson reading Amazon reviews because I wanted the Day Cream as well and wasn&#x27;t going to pay such an outrageous amount of money.</li>
            <li> I went on Amazon while I was staying there, and found it way less expensive.  </li>
            <li> it was MUCH LESS expensive.</li>
            <li> I would hate to make claims of false products if they are in fact real, but I have my doubts.  </li>
            <li> One of the three boxes was damaged before shipment, which was not good, as they were intended as gifts.</li>
            <li> It is not particularly pleasant, either.</li>
            <li> I put very little on because it looked so expensive</li>
            <li> This is a very thick cream.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated and had practically given up until I found this little gem!</li>
            <li> Was introduced to this at a Kiosk in Las Vegas, but it was ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample in Vegas at the Venetian, but I found it too expensive.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t see how this &#x27;expensive&#x27; &#x27;</li>
            <li> The ingredients are undisclosed and I was unable to find them anywhere.</li>
            <li> This one is fake.</li>
            <li> I then found it on their manufacture&#x27;s website for $45, so needless to say I was upset about the way they mark up their products with their mall vendors.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> Knew it was very expensive.  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing lacked the fragrance that I was used to in this product</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in it ordered 3</li>
            <li> I had terrible breakout because of it.  </li>
            <li> but they were selling it at an outrageous price there</li>
            <li> I have horrible skin and it doesn&#x27;t respond well to any face creams.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good product.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered fast</li>
            <li> I have finally found something that works for me, without any side effects.  I will continue recomme.ding it to all.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife who, for reasons unknown to me, cannot live without it.  She cannot find it at local merchants, at least not reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I do NOT like this cream. I ordered it because a friend of a friend thought it was really great...well I don&#x27;t thk so!!</li>
            <li> excellent very good product this is our first time using this type of cream and we love it.Very good price.</li>
            <li> Love this day cream. Makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the facial peel and it leaves my skin as smooth as my 14 month old&#x27;s butt... This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the good reviews on this web site. I&#x27;m glad I did. My skin feels soft and not grease. I use it everyday. I&#x27;m very happy I found a nice product for a very good price. Will recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> The day cream leaves a nice moisturizer on your skin without grease.  It is clean to use and clean on the surface of your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin responds well to the combination of was, toner, and this moisturizer. It can feel a little greasy on my chin si I apply, then wipe with cotton I used for toner. Perfecto! People always compliment my skin and state how I don&#x27;t look my age att all!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality,great coverage and not oily goes on smoothly and makeup does not sweat.I will definitely re-order and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  Received sample in Las Vegas and loved it.  Searched Amazon and found Vivo Per Lei for a great price.  Perfect moisturizer under your foundation.  Very light and smooth.  Faith in Pueblo CO</li>
            <li> I was given samples of the product in Las Vegas and was very impressed.  The price was too high at the kiosk.  Found the best price and service at Best Price Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Love the cream! On time and great deal!</li>
            <li> Ordered 3 and the first 2 were delivered today.  One is in a nice box as in the photo and the other is in bubble wrap/plastic bag.  see photo of 2 items.  Both items were sold by Amazon - not a 3rd party.</li>
            <li> There was no safety seal on this product to indicate that it was not used/tampered prior to arrival. Otherwise, packaging was adequate.</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt; I use it twice per week and love how it deep cleans and exfoliates my face leaving it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Got this originally as a Christmas gift from a store in California and loved it.  Knew it was very expensive.  Was almost out so I decided to check Amazon to see if they carried it at a more reasonable price and they did.  Got a 2for1 less than their online price.  Their box looked the same, the upc code was the same, the cream felt different on my skin so I compared the ingredients and the original did contain SEA SALT where this one just contained SALT.  So I compared each ingredient and they were NOT THE SAME.  Went on Vivo&#x27;s web site and they do not list their products ingredients.  Don&#x27;t know if this is a wholesale wannabe product but I was disappointed. Would not buy again</li>
            <li> The moisturizing cream makes your skin soft, silky smooth and lasts all day.  Love all  Vivo products.  I am now hooked!  And will con&#x27;t to order it here at Amazon</li>
            <li> I like it .  It is light and not greasy and seems to moisten well.  Better than over-the-counter products I purchased before.</li>
            <li> Received a previously used product.  Half the moisturizer was gone.</li>
            <li> So silky ,creamy! I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to this at a Kiosk in Las Vegas, but it was ridiculously expensive. Besides, the pressure-filled sales pitch turned me off.   The cream is very light and not greasy, and feels much better on my somewhat oily skin than my previous moisturizer. My skin does seem smoother and softer than it used to. Well worth the discounted price found on Amazon - I use mine daily in the morning and it has lasted 2 months so far - probably at least another month to go! Just use it like you would those little sample packets - you don&#x27;t need much at all to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with the facial peeling, cleanser, and toner this stuff is wonderful.  I actually feel like I can be proud of my skin.I have never in my life felt like that before, except for about a week in the late 90s.  I tend to get dry patches that even after using other facial systems would still be showing up when I put my foundation on. Not with these Vivo Per Lei Products.  It is key to use the facial peeling if you have skin like mine to get the best effect.  I am in my late 40s but I would highly recommend this for any age. I have started my teenage daughter on it too.</li>
            <li> I left a 3 star because I am not sure this is the real thing.  The jar as pictured is how it came. Not sure if there should have been more cream in the jar?  Can you look at the pic and let me know if your jar looked like this when you opened it? A lot of people complained of the fragrance. Mine has absolutely no fragrance. I will continue to use and see if it does anything for me. I will update this review in a few weeks. BTW it says it was made in Japan. The consistency of the cream is much like Ponds.</li>
            <li> I received a Vivo sample while on vacation. I tried the product when I got home and then had to buy a full-size jar. I really like the lightness and non-greasiness of the moisturizing cream. It feels great on my skin. It also keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upper 40&#x27;s and I&#x27;m always looking for a cream that is not greasy since my face is a little on the oily side.  It&#x27;s a wonderful creame.  Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This is my every day go to moisturizer!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used before....yet this IS the best deal I found....removes dead skin from face leaving it so smooth</li>
            <li> Very disappointing lacked the fragrance that I was used to in this product I&#x27;m very disappointed in it ordered 3 they&#x27;re all the same</li>
            <li> It&#x27; s just a cream, nothing special about it so buy something less expensive and get the same results.  It smells good though.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream along with the vit c serum. I use it together and then add sunblock. its very smooth on my skin. doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This product is too oily for my acne-prone skin.  I had terrible breakout because of it.  The sales practice at mall kiosk is dishonest, very pushy and price is almost 5 times more than the price here.  Avoid this product line.</li>
            <li> I started using this line from mall. Very expensive there but have started buying here and same great product without mall price</li>
            <li> Good product feels good on my face and is not to greasy</li>
            <li> Great smell and wonderfull feeling. I highly reccoment this to anyone. The smell is great, and feeling is better. Thanks</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The eye treatment bottle was almost empty. Would like a new bottle</li>
            <li> I love it. Left my face so soft and moisturized. I would purchase in the future again.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this moisturizer!  If you try it I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;And the facial peel that they make is even more amazing!</li>
            <li> This product, for me, if great for the winter but not so much in the summer. My skin is Bi-polar to the tenth degree; it&#x27;s bone dry in the winter &amp; an oil slick in the summer. This product is a little bit oily so my summer skin can&#x27;t handle it but in the winter, it is PERFECT. If you have a dry complexion, i completely endorse this cream.</li>
            <li> great cream for the price, i wish they had something with more moisture in it, my skin seems to suck it up... but love the results</li>
            <li> good cream great price</li>
            <li> I bought a jar @ LA county fair. I ordered this one for my mom.  The price is great and product arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this with the skin peel based on other customer reviews.  It is totally worth the money.  I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and break out easily.  I also have combo skin (dry in some spots, oily in others.) Even my oily areas are not greasy or over-moisturized.  I have only used it for 3 days now and my skin is clearing up, and looks more even toned.  I am wearing less makeup than I ever had.  I will be using this always!!!</li>
            <li> I will def be ordering this again I&#x27;ve bought 3 already do not buy from mall kiosk this is the exact same I highly recommend this product I also use the facial peel and the body scrub and lotion and amazon is def the place to get this</li>
            <li> Bought this product from a lady in the local mall. Helped my roseca. I am glad I found the product here. I no longer have to use cream or pills to clear up my Roseca. Now when I have my picture taken my face is not red.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing on the skin.  I look in the mirror and can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the same skin!  I have replaced my old skin care with these products and I absolutely love it!  Will never go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> Do not buy!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product at one of the kiosks and it was way different than the watered down cheap product I got in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good priced face peel try the one from The Face Shop... It&#x27;s been as good as the one at the kiosk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for buying it online, don&#x27;t do it</li>
            <li> This is a rich creamy moisturizer. Non drying. I really like it, BUT for the price and going forward..  I will stick with my Ponds Rejuveness. Does even better for way less cost!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Its light, but moisturizing and works really well with the other products I use on my face.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in Vegas and loved it but they were selling it at an outrageous price there so I did what I always do, checked on Amazon and not only did they have this product, but the price is not even in the same ball park..This appears to be legit and not a knock off of the product, smells and feels the same on my skin as the sample did..Having said this, I have combination skin and this proves to be a great night cream for me with out leaving my skin oily etc..I use it as NIGHT cream and not DAY cream because it does not have SPF which I highly recommend for everyone to use on their skin during the day..Overall, I recommend..</li>
            <li> Vivo is one of my favorite brands of dead sea products.  I love the way my skin feels after using this product.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was a nonbeliever but this product, after using it for only two weeks,&lt;br /&gt;soften the wrinkles around my mouth.  I was given compliments like&lt;br /&gt;my face looked different, like it was air brushed. I was asked if a switched my makeup and if so, to what. I got compliments that I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;usually get.  I will be 60 years old next month.  Trying is believing.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this cream by a friend and I love it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing cream does moisturize really well and my skin feels good and soft.  I will continue to use this product it is economical and great ingredients!</li>
            <li> I take my skincare very seriously &amp; this product seemed to fit the bill but it wasn&#x27;t as I believed. First of all, I would rather they&#x27;d spent more on the product &amp; less on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;This face cream is heavily perfumed-not good for anyone&#x27;s face &amp; has a ridiculously long list  ingredients ,  the worst ones at the top &amp; the most important much farther down. My skin, which has always been ( blessed by genes) blemish &amp; break-out fee, aging well &amp; always well cared for, suddenly started having random breakouts. This was very upsetting to me but it was too late &amp; too costly to return so it will either go to someone else who wants to try it or to the trash. Big thumbs down!</li>
            <li> I received a sample packet of this cream from my mom-in-law.  I usually take the sample packets with me when I travel.  I was in Sedona and the air was very dry so I decided to try this cream.  I love it.  It feels so smooth and soft.  I have horrible skin and it doesn&#x27;t respond well to any face creams.  This one didn&#x27;t break my skin out.  I bought this item as soon as I returned from vacation.  Very luxurious feeling moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I love all their products. I have sensitive skin and vivo per lei products work great. I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> This was a repurchase. I originally bought at mall kiosk. Love this moisturizer. Good for dry skin and not greasy. Very happy with purchase and happy not to deal with shady kiosk people.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample in Vegas at the Venetian, but I found it too expensive. I was happy to find it on Amazon for a fraction of the price. This moisturizer gives your skin a nice glow, and have received compliments; must be the seaweed. Wish it had a different fragrance scent, but after the moisturizer is absorbed into the skin the results rate higher than the smell.</li>
            <li> My grandson and I both use it and both like it.  It really works.  Price is very good each time I have ordered,</li>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei on my face is the most inviting moisturizer.  It soaks in, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It is superb.  I have fair, sensitive skin, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This feels fantastic on my skin.  I will place another order as soon as I can. Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li> 3rd time refill purchased, enjoy very much &amp; love it -- easy to use, the texture is smooth and the smell is great</li>
            <li> Good Day Cream.  Worth the money.  It lasts a long time.  Good for Dry older Skin. Will order again in the near future.</li>
            <li> After getting suckered into buying the night cream on major discount of $99 at Century City Mall, I learned my lesson reading Amazon reviews because I wanted the Day Cream as well and wasn&#x27;t going to pay such an outrageous amount of money. I can&#x27;t believe high end malls allow such scamming.  I won&#x27;t go back to Century City mall because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day cream is excellent and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.  Also, when flying on planes, the jar stays sealed and doesn&#x27;t leak.  Shipping from the company I ordered on Amazon was fantastic and I quickly received the package. I give 4 stars instead of 5 because I don&#x27;t think Vivo Per Lei company should allow scammers who sell the product and lie at the kiosks of well known malls.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a year and it&#x27;s the best! Not greasy and goes a long way!  Love the whole line of products</li>
            <li> this product contains proplene glycol &#x3D; ALCOHOL why would that be in a moisturizing day cream? the original and legititmate product does not contain this so this must be a knockoff. super bummed.</li>
            <li> This face cream is very good if you have dry skin. It is a moisturizing cream and you feel and can see the difference&lt;br /&gt;immediately.</li>
            <li> I really just did not like the smell. It was really overwhelming so I never even actually used it. The texture felt nice though.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that temporarily dries out every time I wash my face. I hate creams that feel greasy, but this moisturizer is perfect because it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or grease.</li>
            <li> ..my age is 44, I&#x27;m very active in kickboxing, trail running and strength exercises. My skin is always dry and that has gotten worse as I age. Since I exercise a lot I also shower/clean my face a lot and that may be part of the reason why my skin is on the dry side. Anyway, this moisturizer works well, makes my skin feel great, relaxed and vibrant. It does not cause any irritation, is light weight yet very moisturizing and does not contain any SPF.</li>
            <li> My significant other raves about this product, she uses it everyday.  According to her it goes on smoothly, is quickly absorbed and leaves her face feeling silky.</li>
            <li> This is the only day cream I use now that Amazon has it for such an amazing low price. Silky and delightfully smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the way it leaves my skin, feels smooth and silky, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts its not oily and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This brand is readily available at the mall for 25-40 dollars depending on how low the sales people are willing to go. The price on amazon is a fraction of the mall price and it&#x27;s the exact same product!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for nearly 2 yrs and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s the right cream for my 60-year old face - with patches of oily and dry skin, but this just seems to be the cream my skin needs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  Female, 62 and loving it.  Very good clean product.  Will continue to buy it online.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this day cream, I have noticed a marked difference in the condition of my skin.  I only need to use a small amount and my face stays hydrated all day!  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I really like it, it just gets absorbed by the skin, i do not like stuff that does not blend easily. but this one is very nice.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this in Las Vegas and searched online to find it when I got home. It is a very light and creamy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like this day cream and the cleanser that goes with it.  I was buying this at a kiosk in my mall and it was 8x more costly.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DONT BUY FROM SALES GURU HE SELLS THE FAKE ONE Product works great for my skin I like its fragrance. I use their day, night cream and pack. All of them highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is not the same cream as the original my wife has in her jar. Smell, texture, and results are so different. Something amiss here!</li>
            <li> As with all Vivo Per Lei products I&#x27;ve used, the quality is exceptional.  Although I have sensitive skin, the fragrance does not bother it.</li>
            <li> I am a daily user of this product and I must say as a 42 year old woman who most would guess in her early 30s I am in love. Its light, easy to apply and gives my face lots of moisture without being greasy.</li>
            <li> This probably my amazon find of the year! I ordered based on reviews and price and I was not disappointed. The package is quite charming and the moisturizer itself smells heavenly. Ive previously used various types of lotions without success. I have an oily t-zone but tend to be quite dry everywhere else and breakout when I use lotions that moisturize the rest of my face. I was so frustrated and had practically given up until I found this little gem! I use morning and night and my skin feel supple and smooth without feeling greasy. I love this product and will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this moisturizer! I have only been using it for two weeks but it is keeping my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to let you know product was received and it is in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your quick response. I love this product and so glad I can purchase it online at a reduced rate.</li>
            <li> Like Many Others I Found Out Of This Product Through A Vendor At A Kiosk A Few Weeks Back Unfortunatly I Wasn&#x27;t Willingly Going To Pay $60 For A Jar So I Set Out On A Mission To Net Surf Until I Found The Product At A Bargain And That I Did.Absolutly The Most Fully Functiining Cream I&#x27;ve Yet To Try On My Face</li>
            <li> This brand make you feel your skin clean and is very light you even don&#x27;t feel it even when you put over it sun block</li>
            <li> I tried this as a sample at a mall kiosk and they were asking 10X the price! I tend to seek out moisturizers that are a little heavier. I want my skin to feel moisturized all day/night, not just at application. This one is great because it goes on silky and leaves no residue or tight/filmy feeling. It&#x27;s light and silky but provides more moisture than just about anything else I&#x27;ve found for day wear.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry harsh climate this works better than creams I&#x27;ve paid 2-3 times the amount for. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this and it&#x27;s better price than OROGOLD for the same amazing results. I was looking around and found this product at first i was hesitant but thanks God I bought this. The shipping was reasonable and the packaging was safe.</li>
            <li> okay, don&#x27;t really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> This cream seem to do the trick.  I like it for a basic day moisturizer.  It came on time and in good order.</li>
            <li> Great day cream! I&#x27;d been looking for a good Dead Sea mosturizer that wasn&#x27;t going break my bank account, and found one! Goes on smooth, don&#x27;t need allot to cover face/neck. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I fell into the Kiosk trap at my local mall and actually love this product line.  I am *mature* and this provides a great moisturizer as well as a foundation for makeup.  While I can&#x27;t say I look 10 years younger, I feel like I do and that is what counts.  As much as I love this product, I will never purchase it again anywhere but Amazon.  I originally paid $50 at the mall and my last Amazon shipment was less than $10 as an add-on product.  Whenever I order products, I always look for this line as an add-on just to be sure I never run out.</li>
            <li> this brand is overated, I purchased a few products of this brand ( a toner, the peeling and the mosturising cream and none delivered, there is no change to my skin.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and no scent...I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a year (initially bought at the mall for $30) and it&#x27;s great! My skin is so dry that I have to use a moisturizer daily but I also have issues with acne and my whole life has been a battle of finding a lotion that isn&#x27;t too greasy but that actually works...THIS is it!  And my skin has been clearer since I&#x27;ve been using it. I also use the vivo peeling which is great for breakouts but not necessary to see great results with the cream...I only buy it with every other order of lotion.</li>
            <li> My sister uses it religiously to treat her acne and moisturizer her face. She has the night cream too.</li>
            <li> This face cream helps a lot with dryness. I use face washes that contain benzoyl peroxide which can dry out my face pretty bad sometimes. This face cream is soothing and hydrates my face really well. I also have acne prone skin and it does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Very light on your skin, feels great. I also use the night cream only have to use a dab goes a long ways they the facial  peel is very good too. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing cream</li>
            <li> I gave this as a birthday gift and my friend loved it!  He uses it all the time and the price on Amazon beats the price in the malls.</li>
            <li> I used this moisturizer in Afghanistan and it help with keeping my face from breaking out. I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great Product leave skin soft and clean</li>
            <li> My mom loves this cream. Found it here for much cheaper than the first jar we bought at a women&#x27;s show.</li>
            <li> I first tried this cream when my sister came over for a visit.  She had told me that she purchased her set from a kiosk in the mall.  The set was originally $150.00!?!  But she was able to get her set for $75.00 because the boxes were damaged.  Once I tried the peel and the cream I was hooked.  My sister claimed since using the set her rosacea has diminished significantly.  I was nervous to use it because I was afraid it would cause me to breakout, of which it never did:)  I thought I would check Amazon to see if I could snag a better deal and voila, I did.  At the time of this purchase I only paid $18.00 for the set.  A much better deal than the mall.</li>
            <li> I tried the more expensive version of this - Oro Gold, which I bought in Vegas for a huge amount of money.  This stuff is just as good, if not better</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get results.  My skin is extremely dry.  This is a great cream for that.  Skin looks great all day.  No need to touch up during the day.  They could tone down the fragrance,or better yet, no fragrance at all. People who like fragrance should just buy parfum or cologne.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice product. I have had trouble finding face creams that do not irritate my eyes. This one is perfect. I too bought the first jar in the mall in Las Vegas. I&#x27;ve bought several jars from Amazon since at such a great savings This day cream and the night cream are perfect. My skin is so much healthier since I started using Vivo Per Lei.</li>
            <li> sent it back, it burned my face up.  Its not authentic</li>
            <li> my mother loves this, great value, beautiful packaging, excellent ingredients.  (it is a little greasy, but for older women with mature skin this is a plus)</li>
            <li> Loved the packaging!  Very luxurious and pretty. I felt so pampered.  Nice subtle scent. Glides on effortlessly and does not leave skin feeling greasy. Nice upscale base for the price. I have almost used up my current supply and will probably re-order. Makes my skin look and feel moist.</li>
            <li> This is good cream and in spite of bad publicity about knock offs, it is the same as the over priced sold in malls where they warn you against buying other than from them.</li>
            <li> Such a good line of products that my girlfriend tried &amp; recommended to me.  I bought it for myself &amp; as a gift to another friend.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and scent of this product. I put it on at night and my face feels great in the morning. I am in my 50&#x27;s and I find I need a &#x27;Heavier&amp;#34; moisturizer.  Vivo does the trick. It&#x27;s not too light or too heavy.</li>
            <li> In the middle on this one. Feels nice, smells fine. Liked that I didn&#x27;t pay mall kiosk price for this. Don&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I am 53 YO and this has made my skin very soft and smooth! I was a sun person most of my adult life and was getting sun spots.... they have faded! and skin is soft again and not tough!</li>
            <li> I like this cream, the way it feel on my face is smooth easy absorbed and smell good. Use it day and night.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was much more affordable than going to Vegas and buying it over there! Item arrived on time, was well packaged and the great customer service is greatly appreciated! Thanks so much. You&#x27;ve made a life-long customer!</li>
            <li> Received my product  was really pleased with it, can notice a difference in my skin in the last two weekd, fantastic product, would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years. Love it!</li>
            <li> smells like the samples they handed out at the rip off kisoks. Cant complain , I love it :)</li>
            <li> My face is much smoother now. Since I started using the Vivo Per Lel Peel once a week and the toner and moisturizer daily, my face looks so much better than it did with my other moisturizers. You can not beat the Amazon price either.</li>
            <li> After purchasing the Vivo Day Cream from a mall kiosk, I loved it! So I knew it was too good to be true to get it for $12. It is not the same! The smell of the stuff I purchased from Amazon was way to strong for a face cream. Let me just say I don&#x27;t really know what I put I my face that morning, but it went right back into the box and sent back. The container it came in was over filled, so I can only assume it was replaced with another type of cream. I also purchased the night cream and facial peel but sent it back with the rest because I wouldn&#x27;t know if I was being duped. So , if you love this wonderful cream like I do. Go talk them down at the kiosk. The cream sent to me was sold by: Beauty Collection.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I have sensitive skin and it is the only one that has not caused me to break out.  My skin feels very soft and it looks healthy.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Just the like the night cream except for the day.  Helps with the fine lines, especially around the eyes and mouth</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  This is very nice and makes my face feel soft.  Great price too. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> A very light fresh smellling effective cream.  I have been using it for 5 months and see a noticible difference in wrinkles especially in the neck area and around mouth.  First purchased at much higher price before finding on Amazon.</li>
            <li> this is a good moisturizer for the face. Thinner you use the better it is. It will last a long time so I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. Pleasant scent and not heavy or greasy. Leaves your face and neck feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and love it for the smooth skin it leaves me.</li>
            <li> This is great for everyday use and keeps my skin smooth and supple.  It is also non-greasy.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  My wife just loves this stuff.  She says it holds in moisture and works to get rid of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream from cosmetics4less and I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s the real deal or a fake product.  The jar and lid are round.  Authorized sellers of this product show square jars.  Also, the product title name on the box of authorized sellers says &#x27;moisturizing day cream&#x27;.  Mine says &#x27;day moisturizer cream&#x27;.  There is a sticker on the back of both boxes (I purchased facial peeling &amp; day cream.) that says made in japan, but I have read this product it supposed to be from Israel.  I just don&#x27;t see how this &#x27;expensive&#x27; &#x27;high end&#x27; product can be sold for $5.99 when even St. Ives products are more expensive.  Also, I read people were concerned that the ingredients aren&#x27;t listed anywhere, but the ingredients are listed on both boxes of the items I purchased.  I like the facial peeling.  It has helped smooth my skin a bit.  I just received the day cream so I am unsure how effective it is as of yet.  I would hate to make claims of false products if they are in fact real, but I have my doubts.  I&#x27;m hoping others could have some input on this as well to assuage my fears.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar it had a strong smell, but what the heck lets give it a try. What a big mistake that was. The fragrance stays a long time and made my eyes water. My forehead broke out and along the sides of my face did too. Do not use if you have sensitive skin or are opposed to fragrances in face cream. This cream is also oily feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is very good, although there hasn&#x27;t been time to use it very much. One of the three boxes was damaged before shipment, which was not good, as they were intended as gifts.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  Purchasing a lotion without SPF means I have to add sunscreen on top of it.  That&#x27;s too many layers for me.&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is normal to greasy I don&#x27;t recommend this cream.  It left my face looking a little shiny, which was okay since my skin is very dry, but that might not work as well for other skin types.&lt;br /&gt;In a market saturated moisturizing lotions, this is just not the best option.</li>
            <li> This is great for whoever has oily skin, as it goes right into your skin. Go to the mall and this cream goes for $80, so much more worth it on here, you can get 6 for that price!!! I&#x27;m a bargain hunter so I loved this purchase, it is the cheapest that I found, although I probably would have paid more!</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of products with Vitamin A, and many other types of minerals for all different prices and nothing is a good as this product. I was on vacation in Las Vegas staying at a very well known hotel.  Each time I passed by the gift shop that was selling this product, they were handing out samples and trying to drag me into the shop.  When I got up to the room I tried the day creme, and It was amazing.  I was going to buy a jar but they were selling it for $100!  I went on Amazon while I was staying there, and found it way less expensive.  I have been buying it ever since from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I found this to be an excellent product, absorbed quickly without a greasy feeling.  Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> I was out of town one weekend for a bridal shower. I was staying with one of my best friends. After the day was over and a mass amount of sweating had been done, i wanted nothing more then to wash the makeup, sweat, dirt and downtown ickiness off my face. I normally have to be very careful of what face wash and moisturizer i use. Acne face washes or scrubs dry out my skin in one wash. Moisturizer are to heavy and when I wake up in the morning i normally find a colony of zit friends and grease all over. Its a battle i cant seem to win. To my awesomeness i went to grab my bag only to find i forgot my face wash and lotion. What she had was a acne face wash i thought eh well guess ill be battling dry skin the next few days more than i have been. I used the face wash and asked if i could then borrow some type of moisturizer. She handed me a jar of this. I put very little on because it looked so expensive i felt bad digging a finger full out. To my surprise the minimal i put on covered my whole face. My skin instantly felt smoother and felt well the only way i can explain it is springy. The most dramatic difference was the next morning when i woke up my skin wasn&#x27;t broken out, wasn&#x27;t greasy and most of all the softest ive ever felt it. I immediately went home and researched this product only to find out that product on the manufacture&#x27;s website it was outrage!!! I then searched on here and found the exact same product for much less. I would recommend this product to anyone! Just beware it does have a scent to it. I personally love this sent and have sensitive skin and have had no problem with it</li>
            <li> I like this cream, it&#x27;s light, absorbs into my skin well, and seems to be already minimizing some of my deeper lines, after only about a month of use. Face feels good after applying, and it is a good makeup base. Only thing I would change is the fragrance.  No need for it.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this moisturizer. It smells nice, light weight. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover. I can wear it without make up.</li>
            <li> watchproducts watch out for this I am so upset&lt;br /&gt;The lifting serum was empty and other dried up so can&#x27;t use it What a rip no replacement or refund</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this.  The fragance is wonderful and my skin feels so very, very soft.  Super, super!</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful effect, sort of plumping up my aging skin, and making it feel less fragile. A surprising side benefit: it heals the roughness that gardening causes to my fingertips.</li>
            <li> This day moisturizer is really great. It smells amazing and a little dab on your chin, nose, both cheeks, and forehead go a really long way.</li>
            <li> Using in combination to the night cream. It moisturizes you skin all day long. Extremely reasonably priced. Don&#x27;t spend a fortune for this at the mall, order it online! The is a true value product!</li>
            <li> I will start using it more often to see if it helps my skin look younger and softer i always like using skin products</li>
            <li> In general, I pretty like their lines of products. But the peeling gel is a bit under expectation, while all the other products are good buys.</li>
            <li> Love this day cream as well as the night cream.  I purchased both at a mall last year and even though I paid a small fortune for it, I really like what it does for my skin.  I hate heavy creams and this is so light, but effective on keeping my skin soft and hydrated.  I have received compliments that I look 10 years younger than my age.  When I ran out, I looked on Amazon as a maybe and that turned out to be the best search I&#x27;ve done.  So much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Keep your money in your pocket.  This product was shipped from somewhere in Turkey.  You will find better products here in the U.S., over the counter in a drug store.</li>
            <li> It was just like using soap to wash your face it really didn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> I like all the Vivo products. Excellent quality. Leaves skin soft and fresh. I recommend these products to young and older women.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff has the most unbelievably overpowering perfumy scent - I can&#x27;t believe people wear this on their faces. It is not particularly pleasant, either. It kind of reminds me of my grandma... not that I don&#x27;t love my grandma, but I don&#x27;t want to smell like her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it contains several oils, including mineral oil, that I am sure would make me break out if I were to apply it on my face. However, on the plus side, I can use it as a body moisturizer until it&#x27;s gone, and it works well for that.</li>
            <li> So far I like these products.&lt;br /&gt;.Vivo&lt;br /&gt;I am buying more from the line.&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li> I could feel my skin soaking it up and becoming noticeably smoother.</li>
            <li> I wish that someone had mentioned that Vivo Per Lei Moisturizing Day Cream is scented.  It is the same scent added to the Vivo body butter which is too strong to wear on face; well at least it is for me.  I bought the Vivo Per Lei eye cream which is great and not scented at all.  I took it for granted that the day cream would be as good as the eye cream, but it smells so strong that I can only use it on my legs and feet.  For those who has low tolerance in fragranted cosmetic or skin care products, stay away from this item.  Now, I am going back to the Shiseido Bio-Performance line for good.</li>
            <li> I would be lost without this product!  I found it in Las Vegas and had trouble finding it here at home. I started to run out so I looked on Amazon and low and behold there is was and to top it off it was MUCH LESS expensive. I have been using this and the Gtatiae line for about a year and a half and I get so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your face feeling like silk.  It is absorbed easily and your face is so soft and not oily at all.  I have been using it for well over a year.  Glad I could find it on line to buy because I had bought it in the mall on a trip.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who adores these products. I thought while this was creamy, it was also very perfumed. It did not irritate my sometimes very sensitive skin, but it also didn&#x27;t do much for me. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a real product or a fake and I wouldn&#x27;t trust it sunscreen-wise!</li>
            <li> I chose to rate this product with a 5 star, and happy that I found it online to purchase it cheaper because the mall prices are very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> kinda greasy, if you have dry skin it will be great, as for me I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a little to greasy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product originally @ a mall. I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  The price was considerably less, but still the same great product. Since using this product my skin has improved so much. I have given it four stars because it does not have UV protection like many moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Vivo moisturizing day and night cream work well in my skin.  I love the smooth look that I have when I use under my make-up.  The night cream moisturizes my skin well I sleep.</li>
            <li> When vacationing in Las Vegas last year, I stumbled upon a salon that offered free sample of the marvelous moisturizer. When I got home, found out it was not available in my area. Low and behold, Amazon saved the day. Very modestly priced and a perfect cream. Use with the sea salt face wash and your skin will feel 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> Nive cream and especially because scammers at the Flamingo Las Vegas wanted $175.00 for a jar of this stuff.  Yes, it&#x27;s a nice cream, smooth &amp; you don&#x27;t need to use much - just don&#x27;t get it near your eyes as I had chapped eyelids.  Plenty of other creams equivalent to this such as Loreal for $17., Avenno &amp; Neutrogena.  All are about the same - Loreal is gentler.</li>
            <li> I love trying new things this is a great product and at a good price compared to other. Must try product!!!!</li>
            <li> Back when I was around 11-12 years old my family and I hosted an exchange student from Germany. When she came she brought a gift for me. This gift was some facial cream with Dead Sea Minerals in it. I immediately fell in love with it and rationed the amount I used so as to prolong the amount of time I was able to use it, because I thought that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it. Well, fast forward to nearly two decades, a random kiosk salesman sold me this cream a few months ago, and it turned out to be surprisingly similar to this illicit cream from Germany, if not exactly the same. Same smooth texture, same scent. I LOVE this cream, and it is much cheaper than prices in the mall. If your&#x27; re looking for a daily cream that is light in texture and scent, this is it. It leaves my skin feeling nourished, soft, and with consistent use, my skin looks more supple and healthy. For an added benefit, pair it with Vivo Per Lei Facial Peel.</li>
            <li> The day cream goes on light and smells great.  Works well under my makeup and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li> amazing just love it! vivo is my face cream so light yet powerful on skin. Try your self and u will love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the salt from the Dead Sea that dries all of the unnecessary oils and produces a more youthful look to you. The smell is putrid (smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume), but that&#x27;s why you wear it at night at bedtime. So awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought a vivo per lei \\&quot;set\\&quot; (milk cleanser, toner, day cream and peel) They are ALL amazing &amp; I was quite impressed by the results. But here I am reviewing only the cream so here goes: I had DEEP forehead wrinkles that this cream and peel have drastically reduced. It is heavier than I prefer in a day cream so I stick to using it only on the \\&quot;problem area\\&quot; (for me, the forehead) during the day and then using it as a nightcream instead. It also has a lovely perfumey smell which my husband &amp; I both quite enjoy (my hubby actually says it reminds him of juicy coutour perfume only not as strong) however, I imagine that could bother some people as alot of folks prefer unscented products which this is definitely not. But it really has helped the wrinkles! And I have to mention the peel because its my favorite product in the set!!! My skin has dramatically improved overall with its use. Do Not buy this at inflated mall kiosk prices. Amazons got you. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this at the mall (scammed!) last year. Liked it but said I would never get it again. However, as menopause hit me this winter, I struggled to find a moisturizer that would soak in and do a good job.  Either I was left still feeling tight and dry or the moisturizer would sit on my face without soaking in.  This works.  After one month of using it, my skin is soft and smooth and does not feel dried out by night time.  The fragrance is light and enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was too good to be true and it is, as the product that arrived was definitely not the same face cream as I purchased from the vivo per lei storefront in Waikiki. This cream is much greasier and of a much more pungent fragrance, and does not apply anywhere near the same as the authentic version. It may be a good face cream for $10, but it is not vivo per lei. The packaging is spot on, but the product inside is a knock off.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  The medicated face wash that I use tends to leave the corners of my mouth and eyes very flaky, so I need to have a reliable moisturizer.  This product works, however, I wish it were thicker.</li>
            <li> very good product and works for my mom&#x27;s dry skin</li>
            <li> This feels very silky on my skin and stays that way until evening when I cleanse my face.  I love it so far!</li>
            <li> leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated. It has a great scent and it won&#x27;t make you break out. 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting such great results. It is making my scars disappear. It has made me look younger. It also works great for under eye circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product.  Very reasonably priced and so smooth to use.  I absolutely love the product and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I loved this cream. I gave it a four star because the second time I bought it it didn&#x27;t seem to give me the same amazing results as the first time but it was still pretty good. Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have extremely dry skin or live in an extremely dry place.</li>
            <li> Had the moisturizing cream and eye treatment applied at a local mall several months ago and was impressed.  Bought the moisturizing cream (expensive) and loved it.  Very pleasant scent and goes on smoothly, just need a little amount.  Checked the Internet and ordered both products for a fraction of the price paid at the mall!  Will continue to order the products on line from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, and excellent cream. I use it every day, and I like the way it leaves my face.&lt;br /&gt;From now on, it&#x27;s the only cream that I will use.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this face cream while in Vegas and just loved it!!  The price, on Amazon, is much better than what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works wonderfully. I love it! It has a light fragrance that is not overpowering, and it does not feel greasy when you use it. It works well with my foundation, and I have noticed that my face looks softer than it used to with the other moisturizer that I used to use. I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t cause problems for delicate skin. It moisturizes. Is wonderful beneath makeup. And I adore its consistency and light scent.</li>
            <li> This is my second order for this product . Exceptional price for an exceptional product .  I will be ordering again in about 6 months .</li>
            <li> I love this cream and I can buy it cheaper here on amazon than at the mall. My only wish is that the cream had an SPF of some sort. Otherwise, the cream makes my skin feel so soft and smell so good.</li>
            <li> No difference to my face..oily..i wont rebuy!!</li>
            <li> My wife received 2 or 3 sample packets and she liked the results so I&lt;br /&gt;looked online and found this item along with a &amp;#34;Vivo Night Cream&amp;#34; and&lt;br /&gt;ordered both products.  She has been using this along with the Night&lt;br /&gt;Cream and is satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I think this is a knock off, but it&#x27;s still good for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a few months ago and liked it!  However, I just received my re-order and found out not only that the container is 1/3 filled the texture is much thicker than the one I bought before.  Feels like it&#x27;s been on shelf for a long long time.  Calling Amazon Customer for a return.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s amazing.  My skin feels wonderful. I would recommend it to anyone, as well as, giving it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have always used moisturizers that contain SPF, but I was given samples of this cream and I liked the way it felt on my skin&lt;br /&gt;better than what I have been using.  It goes on light and a little goes a long way and makeup  goes on smoothly without any&lt;br /&gt;blotching.  I would definitely purchase again with the other products for the eyes by this company.  The price on amazon can&#x27;t be beat and the cream is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of rosacea.  I have better results with vivo than the prescription.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time.  It Makes my face feel moist without being dry.  Always keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping and another great product from Vivo Per Lei!  This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue behind and is great morning and evening!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in Vegas and used it. I have oily skin and it made my face feel great and not oily. My makeup went on better and my face felt brighter. I thought maybe it was just the dryer climate so I asked for a sample to take home and used it. Loved it and living in a very humid climate still worked just like in Vegas. Went on Amazon and bought for a lot less then in Vegas. Product was exactly the same, had the same smell, feel, etc. I love the way it makes my skin feel. If you do not like a smell to your product you might not like it, but, to me the smell is a nice smell and does not bother me. I do recommend for people with oily skin, I am 49 and after using my face felt young. :)</li>
            <li> Did not work like it was said to do.  Very disappointing.  Tired this same product in Las Vegas and got results.  Think this product was not the original but a generic form.</li>
            <li> The price is perfect for this wonderful product. This is the best moisturizer I have ever used.  You should try it</li>
            <li> This is a very nice moisturizer and smells great.  My face liked it but my chin did not.  It might be too rich for me.</li>
            <li> The moisturing creams (Day and Night) are a great disappointment to be honest they are a GREAT GREAT DISAPPOINTMENt.  I have been using it for at least 6 weeks (thought I give it enough time before I judged it fairly)not seen any improvement. What a waste of time and money.  Also can&#x27;t send it back unless not used.  Didn&#x27;t see that one coming.  Should have know if I can&#x27;t try first, clear sign to \\&quot;HURRY UP AND SEND IT BACK\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have seen visible difference in my skin. Great product.My skin feels softer and looks so much better. More youthful</li>
            <li> It is not heavy at all and I wear it under my foundation and it feels great and smells great too.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin looks and feels after using this product: soft, moist and young. I also love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my must have products. So pleased I found it here. I also found it at a great value.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. Works well under my make-up. Makes your face feel like it has been clothed in silk. It&#x27;s pure luxury. Moisture lasts all day without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Bought this at a kiosk in the mail and paid 3 times as much.  The only good thing was it was a product I never would have known about. Purchased the same product from Amazon and saved so much money.  I like the day and night moisturizers.  My skin feels soft and supple.  I am 74 years old.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars and not 4 because is good but not great, in my opinion. I have been using a different face moisturizer for years that I&#x27;m happy with, but wanted to give this one a try after getting a small sample at a mall. It is a good product and it smells wonderful. Not sure if I would buy it again, but would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is basically a perfume. The entire thing is a scam as well if you ask me. The ingredients are undisclosed and I was unable to find them anywhere. Don&#x27;t you want to know what you&#x27;re putting onto your face? I sure did, but I still thought it was worth a try. The savings on this product looked like such an incredible steal! The original price was that of the highest end creams on the market. On the Vivo Per Lei website there is absolutely no ingredient information, just a strange infomercial and incredibly inflated prices going all the way up to 250 dollars. I saw a booth at a mall near where I live selling Vivo Per Lei and \\&quot;Premier\\&quot; Skin care products for 80 dollars and up. It was very enjoyable to say I got the product for 13 bucks on amazon and just completely tell them off as I walked away. Basically you could be putting anything on your face, I would&#x27;nt be surprised if the first ingredient was perfume in this stuff. Cause basically its a cheap over scented lotion that will break you out. To get rid of it I am using it as a neck moisturizer just for the fragrence but I would&#x27;nt dare put this foreign, unknown, likely skin damaging garbage onto my face again.</li>
            <li> It felt nice on my skin...but made me itch after 4 days. Can you say breakout? I did but thankfully it&#x27;s went away after I stopped using the product.It&#x27;s probably fine for most people that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive moisturing products, but this one is better. Love the smell and doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy.</li>
            <li> i hadn&#x27;t ever really found a face cream that i liked enough to buy more than once but I love this cream!!.&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to buy any other types of creams.. theyre just not the same as Vivo Per Lei&lt;br /&gt;my face is generally dry in some areas (chin, cheaks) and oily in others (nose, forehead, neck) but this cream is soo luxurious. When i first tried it, i thought it was gonna be too oily because the lotion seemed very thick, but it&#x27;s not. It feels like silk on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the night cream, toner, and the facial peeling!</li>
            <li> This product is so light and non greasy, can be used for day or night. I will definitely re-order and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Love the moisturizer. It is light and a little goes a long way. I am extremely happy with the product and will order again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since my Dad gifted me my first jar in 2012.&lt;br /&gt;I had a terrible problem with adult onset acne (deep cysts that were causing scars) and this product does not aggravate my condition at all - in fact, my acne has improved dramatically since I started using it!  My pores are much smaller now that I am able to keep my skin moisturized without clogging them up!  Coupled with regular use of Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling gel my skin looks better than is has in a decade! :)&lt;br /&gt;The Day Cream is not greasy and smells nice.  I&#x27;ve tried the night cream too, which is thicker and has a stronger fragrance, but it did clog my pores so I use the day cream at night too.  Shop around for the best price, but if you have problem skin this is worth whatever you have to pay for it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, so thought this would be excellent. Especially reading the overwhelmingly great reviews. I found this heavy and greasy. Didn&#x27;t seem to soak in but instead remained on the surface of my skin which made too much make up stick to my face for an unnatural look. Would not recommend for anybody, even people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Have used this product several times and I am very pleased with the results.  Would recommend to all who wish to keep their skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> makes my face feel so soft. it&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li> Had dsome old cream to use up first, but I think I will like it. All the Vivo items are good</li>
            <li> This facial cream has an wonderful scent, texture and really makes your face feel moisturized for&lt;br /&gt;quite some time after use.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased this product at a kiosk in a local mall but the price was substantially more. When I was able to purchase the same name and size on-line for considerable saving, I ordered two. The product is not the same but appears to be refilled with regular lotion or at least cut with a basic lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate what I received a ZERO STAR if possible.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product I have very sensitive dry skin and have a hard time with products either they are to moisturizing or not enough.  This one is perfect.  I will not use anything else.  I have been using this cream since spring of 2012</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft after using but I honestly haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin. However, that&#x27;s probably not due to the product - my skin doesn&#x27;t react well to anything. I was hoping this product would be different but oh well. Still, it makes my skin feel so soft and amazing, (you know, the parts not covered in acne.) Haha!</li>
            <li> Very good for day skin. Just love the smell</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the product.  I&#x27;ve used others that worked better that were less expensive.</li>
            <li> Harsh on my skin. Broke out with a rash. Strong smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face cream for about a year now and I love it.  It makes my face feel silky and soft and doesn&#x27;t get heavy and clog pores.  My face is smoother now than it&#x27;s been in quite a while.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It was packed so pretty. I used this moisturizer at night because when i used it for morning and i apply bb cream after it, the bb cream doesnt show the color as they usually do, so i apply this at night. the smell so good.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer to use during the winter months, kept my skin very moisturized and glowing, it seems a bit greasy, but during winter I don&#x27;t mind because my skin get so irritated because of the cold, and this cream kept it well behave during those winter months, will not be using it in the summer, because I&#x27;M PRONE TO BREAKOUTS, and I feel this will cause them if I used it during the summer.so far a good product and well priced.</li>
            <li> dont buy this it is not the original, its made in japan. you can find mine at the rubbish dump if you dont believe me go ahead and try it, its probably next to a dirty diper</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for friends, it is a quality brand with significant results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is packaged well even without gift options and serves as a very economically efficient present</li>
            <li> I love this facial moisturizer. Does not cause break outs yet leaves your soft and supple. Wonderful fragrance. Yes I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> As you know, in most cases you get what you pay for.  This product line performs and you will notice a difference with daily use. Don&#x27;t forget....any skin program is null and void if you don&#x27;t use sunscreen 365 days a year. You&#x27;re just wasting your money purchasing anything for your face if you don&#x27;t use a broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and does exactly what they say.  It is a wonderful moisturizer and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Met all expectations.  Gave as a gift and it was greatly appreciated and was excited to get it.  Person had a sample and was happy to get this for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; it works well on my skin. It has a light &amp; clean feel on your face.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is a dead sea product and I&#x27;ve come to love their items. I like the smell and it has helped with the dry areas other moisturizer have failed.&lt;br /&gt;Fast service and good product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years.This one is fake.It&#x27;s smell different. Doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well.Make sure that Vivo produck was made in Israel.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturiser, great coverage and not oily goes on smoothly and makeup does not sweat.  Would recommend this product to anyone with mature skin</li>
            <li> This is the BEST facecream I have ever used and even better it is great value for money.  My skin is extremely sensitive and there are very few face creams I can use on my face without breaking out in a rash.  This cream has transformed my skin to now being perfectly normal with no sensitivity - to me this is heaven.  Also, I live in Australia and even though it said 3 weeks for delivery this arrived within a week - AWESOME service as well!! Love you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like it.It seems very good on skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is effective all day. You should have some by oneself.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this while on a trip to Hawaii, paid WAY too much but loved how it leaves my face feeling great.</li>
            <li> I use this product when getting dressed in the morning and it keeps my face moisturized all day. I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> Big fan of this product. Have been using it for almost a year and it certainly has helped my face bloom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice smell. It&#x27;s not so oily so good for summer but I didnt feel it good enough for winter season.</li>
            <li> A great light daytime moisturizer.  I&#x27;m so happy I found it at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any improvement on my skin. It&#x27;s actually dry out my skin. Never Again</li>
            <li> I had been looking recently for a great day cream that was not heavy and good underneath my makeup. This product is perfect, very light and soft. I also use it with the night cream</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and it feels great&lt;br /&gt;No irritation</li>
            <li> Thanks. Product is good, but personally can&#x27;t use it often. It has a fairly strong fragrance, but otherwise not bad.</li>
            <li> My favorite  day cream ever . Never greasy , soaks in fast and works great under make up . Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any kind of acne break out either . My face is very dry during the winter months and this cream is what saves me.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t be with out it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Quick shipping, too.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used so far. It retains moisture in the skin and is hypoallergenic. It makes the skin feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon.com is an added plus.</li>

            <li> I began using this product with the face peel gel, the peel works great, but this moisturizer clogs my pores and has a heavy fragrance. I began breaking out within 2 days of using this, and trust me, its not the right time of the month for unexpected acne. Pretty much if I don&#x27;t throw it away, I&#x27;m planning to use it as a hand cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.  It really moisturizes and is the right consistency.  I&#x27;m going to buy more.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer!  Does not make your face feel greasy.  Love the smell! This small jar will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Oh my this stuff has high fragrance, and it really makes me break out. It even made me break out on my chest, and I don&#x27;t get chest acne. This is a very thick cream. If I did not have acne prone skin I would continue usage.</li>
            <li> Bought three products from Vivo Per Lei Fromm Amazon. Very satisfied wit every aspect of the transactions and products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and I&#x27;ve been feeling my skin getting drier by the day.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy a cheap, light, simple day-to-day face moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect to put make up on top of, didn&#x27;t give me a single zit and I felt my skin more hydrated in the 1st time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid, it was much more than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I became I huge fan!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 jars.  What does that tell you?  Check out my comments on Dead Sea Night Cream Complex for all the 10 STAR comments on Premier&#x27;s skin line products.  Premier, I&#x27;m here if you need a true testimonial or model for your product.  You will swear I am not a day over 30.  I&#x27;m over 50............</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this moisturizer when I found it at the mall. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth all day long without that greasy feeling you get with most moisturizers. I also found with this product that I tend to not break out as often as I do with previous moisturizers. I have very sensitive skin and have suffered from rosacea on my cheeks for years, but after using this product, I find that my facial redness has also decreased. I have tried everything to correct my skin problems, I even went to a dermatologist and used their products to no avail; the only thing it did was make me greasy and cause severe acne breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel so much better about my skin using this product, it&#x27;s been a life changing experience. It also smells really nice, so it&#x27;s not an unpleasant experience to put this on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say I was extremely happy with the price I paid for this product on Amazon.com. When I bought this in the mall, I paid $65 for this. I then found it on their manufacture&#x27;s website for $45, so needless to say I was upset about the way they mark up their products with their mall vendors. So I was overjoyed when I received this product as part of an online deal for $7.95. Totally made my day!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone should go for and the price is soooooooooooo good. Thanks for the product. Love it ! I have been using this since October 2012 till now and i like it it makes my skin so smooth .</li>
