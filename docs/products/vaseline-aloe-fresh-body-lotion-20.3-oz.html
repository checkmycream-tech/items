    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best lotion with added spf that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>It works great and gives me some piece of mind that I have some SPF coverage every day.</li>
            <li>My skin has been feeling/looking great since I used this combo.</li>
            <li>Works great and makes me feel good that I have spf protection.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>, if you don&#x27;t mind the texture, I will say that it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>It does some kind of barely-noticeable skin-shrinking voodoo that, while probably preferable most places, is not the best thing for a body part that grows in size over a short period of time.</li>
            <li>so I was very pleased that it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is very light.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it on amazon.com</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>DO NOT pay more than $6 online for this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion ever.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have gotten complements on the smell of the lotion and just love the size and that it has SPF.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells wonderful but the actual moisturizing benefits are average at best.</li>
            <li>My hubby never used any cream on his scream even during winter, but since I bought this product, its become a life-style; its not greasy, it absorbs fast and the smells so good.</li>
            <li>Other than that the scent is great!</li>
            <li>It prevents those T-shirt tan lines for those who tan easily.</li>
            <li>I am Latino and can tan easily.</li>
            <li>I soaks in quickly, is moisturizing yet very light.</li>
            <li>It is a very large bottle, so it is a very good deal for simple commute from work to home on body application.</li>
            <li>very nice every-day lotion with only a light sent.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the normal scent of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>using this lotion help me keep my skin tone fair enough ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to add a couple drops of essential oil (tea tree or something easy to blend) to make it even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to go back to using large cheap bottles of cocoa butter, they moisturize my skin much better and are a fraction of the price of this lotion.</li>
            <li>Nice and fresh,absorbs well.love the SPF,a must!!plus no mineral oil in it.that is hard to find ,seems most lotions have it,and it makes one break out .great</li>
            <li>Love it because it goes on easily like regular lotion and moisturizes while giving adequate sun protection for daily in/out of the building use.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll definitely want something better.</li>
            <li>Much better smell than Eucerin SPF Daily Moisturizing lotion...</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion--it has aloe and SPF 15.</li>
            <li>My peins, not so much.</li>
            <li>So I use the Likas Papaya soap to get rid of dead skin cells and to have nice glowing natural light skin and use this lotion daily for spf protection and to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>the only SPF body lotion I&#x27;ve liked so far is Aveeno, I think I&#x27;ll switch back to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have paid closer attention to the price as I just paid more than double the cost locally.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes your skin a little bit, sure, but you&#x27;ll have the urge to reapply by the time you&#x27;re done</li>
            <li>Not thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li>For the beach or longer periods outdoors I would use a different sunblock with higher SPF.</li>
            <li>lotion so far!</li>
            <li>I do seasonal job at hot dog stand, so my skin basically got dark really fast.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try out an SPF lotion as an alternative to the cocoa butter I normally moisturize with daily.</li>
            <li>New product instantly.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling particularly moisturized and if you have very dry skin</li>
            <li>The reason that I only gave it 4 stars is because I am unclear on whether it is a broad spectrum sunscreen or not.</li>

            <li> The bottle says \\&quot;Broad Spectrum\\&quot; protection, maybe I received a slightly different product than other reviewers.</li>
            <li> In the winter , dry weather you might need a richer daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> my hands don&#x27;t feel softer and the greasy feel never completely soaks in.</li>
            <li> this is not what you want for long times in the sun.</li>
            <li> I got some last summer and had a very difficult time finding more.</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry and ashy after using this lotion for a week that I tossed it in the trash.  </li>
            <li> It has baffled me for a while, why, when we all know that the sun is the major skin ager, that there are not more choices of body lotion with a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I put faith in the name Vaseline, but apparently it doesn&#x27;t mean what it used to mean.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight but moisturizes like a heavy lotion.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it at the usual pharmacies</li>
            <li> Can hardly find this, except on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s and have combination skin.</li>
            <li> I usually hate scented anything</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The bottle says \\&quot;Broad Spectrum\\&quot; protection, maybe I received a slightly different product than other reviewers. Overall I like the product but I am giving it 4 stars because as soon as I go swimming with it on (even if applied much earlier) my skin feels slippery and it wears off. Other than that the scent is great! Much better than the normal scent of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion--it has aloe and SPF 15. I got some last summer and had a very difficult time finding more. Glad to find it on amazon.com</li>
            <li> My girlfriend like this all over her body. My peins, not so much. It does some kind of barely-noticeable skin-shrinking voodoo that, while probably preferable most places, is not the best thing for a body part that grows in size over a short period of time.</li>
            <li> It works great and gives me some piece of mind that I have some SPF coverage every day. Also, does not discolor clothing and is not oily.</li>
            <li> I do seasonal job at hot dog stand, so my skin basically got dark really fast. using this lotion help me keep my skin tone fair enough ;)</li>
            <li> Love it because it goes on easily like regular lotion and moisturizes while giving adequate sun protection for daily in/out of the building use. It prevents those T-shirt tan lines for those who tan easily. For the beach or longer periods outdoors I would use a different sunblock with higher SPF. I couldn&#x27;t find it at the usual pharmacies so I was very pleased that it was available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try out an SPF lotion as an alternative to the cocoa butter I normally moisturize with daily. This lotion smells wonderful but the actual moisturizing benefits are average at best. This doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling particularly moisturized and if you have very dry skin you&#x27;ll definitely want something better. It moisturizes your skin a little bit, sure, but you&#x27;ll have the urge to reapply by the time you&#x27;re done applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d skip this unless you are adamate about having SPF 15 in your lotion. I&#x27;m going to go back to using large cheap bottles of cocoa butter, they moisturize my skin much better and are a fraction of the price of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s and have combination skin. I love this product. I soaks in quickly, is moisturizing yet very light. It does not cause breakouts. The reason that I only gave it 4 stars is because I am unclear on whether it is a broad spectrum sunscreen or not.</li>
            <li> This product sells out at local stores like Target and Walmart, so I purchase this online.  I should have paid closer attention to the price as I just paid more than double the cost locally.  DO NOT pay more than $6 online for this product.</li>
            <li> I wish we could get this locally.  I use it everyday.  It has no tanning lotion smell.  I lover it.</li>
            <li> this stuff manages to feel both greasy and watery at the same time. my hands don&#x27;t feel softer and the greasy feel never completely soaks in. it literally just feels like regular &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; type sunscreen with no moisturizer. the only SPF body lotion I&#x27;ve liked so far is Aveeno, I think I&#x27;ll switch back to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, if you don&#x27;t mind the texture, I will say that it smells nice. I usually hate scented anything but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Nice and fresh,absorbs well.love the SPF,a must!!plus no mineral oil in it.that is hard to find ,seems most lotions have it,and it makes one break out .great lotion so far!</li>
            <li> It is a very large bottle, so it is a very good deal for simple commute from work to home on body application.</li>
            <li> Can hardly find this, except on Amazon.  My favorite lotion ever.  Not thick or greasy.  Absorbs immediately.  Nice smell.</li>
            <li> My hubby never used any cream on his scream even during winter, but since I bought this product, its become a life-style; its not greasy, it absorbs fast and the smells so good. I also use it on my son&#x27;s face and hands after applying his Burts bee just to protect his skin from sun. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion with added spf that I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s lightweight but moisturizes like a heavy lotion. It&#x27;s perfect. I use it on my kids every morning before they go to school.</li>
            <li> This is actually a review of one bottle I purchased from Walmart.  I put faith in the name Vaseline, but apparently it doesn&#x27;t mean what it used to mean.  My skin was so dry and ashy after using this lotion for a week that I tossed it in the trash.  This lotion is not moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> this is not what you want for long times in the sun. It is very light. I use it daily when I am inside and add to it if I go out. In the winter , dry weather you might need a richer daily moisturizer. Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> very nice every-day lotion with only a light sent.  Works great and makes me feel good that I have spf protection.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I am Latino and can tan easily. That being said, I don&#x27;t like having tan lines nor do I like tanning. So I use the Likas Papaya soap to get rid of dead skin cells and to have nice glowing natural light skin and use this lotion daily for spf protection and to moisturize my skin. I have gotten complements on the smell of the lotion and just love the size and that it has SPF. My skin has been feeling/looking great since I used this combo.</li>
            <li> It takes a brand name to add SPF to a moisturizer? It has baffled me for a while, why, when we all know that the sun is the major skin ager, that there are not more choices of body lotion with a sunscreen. I get the choice part, but if I am going out with the knowledge I may catch some rays, would I not both screen and moisturize?</li>
            <li> Much better smell than Eucerin SPF Daily Moisturizing lotion... And cheaper. I&#x27;m going to add a couple drops of essential oil (tea tree or something easy to blend) to make it even better. Viola! New product instantly. Note: Scent is not an issue for me, I just want something that&#x27;s not so &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34;  but with SPF you can&#x27;t avoid that.</li>
    </ol>
