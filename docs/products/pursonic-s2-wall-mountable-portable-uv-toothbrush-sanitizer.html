    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It would be perfect if it was electrical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be wonderful if they recognized that there are variable sizes and would allow for adjustment.</li>
            <li>I used this product for a year, and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This seems to be the best UV sanitizer on the market.  </li>
            <li>I AM HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush sanitizer is great.</li>
            <li>All in all this a great affordable product.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great, although there are a couple of things I wish</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li>one has worked perfectly reliably for me for over a year now, and the &amp;#34;heads up&amp;#34; / wall-mount-capable design is more sanitary and practical in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Micro professor loved it</li>
            <li>I can store my shaver in there which is good,</li>
            <li>This is a good sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product, great purchase.</li>
            <li>This works great and love the fact that you can put more than just your toothbush in it.  </li>
            <li>The experts recommend replacing toothbrushes after an illness, but honestly those recommendations must have come before the ~$20 tooth brush heads (we have 2 sonic care brush heads used in our UV sterilizer).</li>
            <li>Nice option to mount on your wall in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>EASY TO INSTALL!</li>
            <li>Good idea but cheaply made, look for something better.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>and this seems so much more sanitary.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS, EVERYONE THAT SEES IT</li>
            <li>Would be even better if it came with a socket to plug in a wall wart.</li>
            <li>They went out of way to make sure this product works and IT DOES.  </li>
            <li>I love that there is also a place for the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Just do it gradually to make sure there&#x27;s still some contact with the door.</li>
            <li>: I have had this product for awhile now, and its working pretty good.</li>
            <li>Most products don&#x27;t have an AC adaptive so purchase of batteries gets costly and company wants to make sure they give you the exceptional service and quality product that works for your situation.</li>
            <li>but if you hold the top of the unit when opening the door (to give it some stability) then it opens fine.</li>
            <li>Ideally the bottom would be completely open for ventilation, unless you have a lot of crud circulating in the air, where a sealed box has its advantages.</li>
            <li>Sometimes have to close it more than once for the light to come on.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product and company highly for their exceptional CS in order to make sure product works to highest value.  </li>
            <li>on the other side, this works best with toothbrushes that have a wider neck.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much it is actually sterilizing or not, but it looks good, easy to mount, and I like how it is an enclosed box that holds everything nice and neat</li>
            <li>The brush holder on the inside slips out easily for cleaning.</li>
            <li>It installed easily and is convenient.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use (just close the door to turn it on, and it auto-shuts off when finished)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>It is easy to mount on the wall, and to remove from the mounting for battery changing (although my batteries are still fine)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part is that the toothbrush or razor is not meant to be upside down.</li>
            <li>I like the design and would be willing to pay more for a product with a more reliable switch.</li>
            <li>The light goes on but runs out of battery very quickly (always seem to be changing them).</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic junk.</li>
            <li>The latch doesn&#x27;t always make contact therefore the UV light doesn&#x27;t come on defeating the purpose.</li>
            <li>It is rather cheaply made.</li>
            <li>so I suspect that the plastic was weakened by the continuing exposure to UV light.  </li>
            <li>Cleaned with vinegar, disinfect  but once the light is on it</li>
            <li>but I know that the light goes on</li>
            <li>But when I close the lid it turns on the light (to sanitize the remaining, already clean, brushes in the unit).</li>
            <li>Worth the price!  </li>
            <li>) Clean the bottom of the tray periodically if you find stuff collecting there.</li>
            <li>Really cool.</li>
            <li>But for the price totally cool.</li>
            <li>This is good if there is only one toothbrush</li>
            <li>Its just that the light doesn&#x27;t pop on right away sometime.</li>
            <li>It makes my toothbrush smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The product seemed to work fine the first 2-3 weeks then just didn&#x27;t turn on.  </li>
            <li>and I feel this is a great product and way to keep germs down.</li>
            <li>I really like knowing that our toothbrushes are enclosed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and easy to install on the wall.</li>
            <li>(Not worried much about pathogens on the drying material, that is what the UV-C light is for - just use something</li>
            <li>It MIGHT work okay for a while for some items but might NOT work okay at all for other items.  </li>
            <li>Right from the start</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.</li>
            <li>DOA did not work right out of the box.</li>
            <li>bakes it right into the plastic.</li>
            <li>The first one I am able to place high enough that it will stay most of the time.</li>
            <li>be nice to have toothbrushes and toothbrush heads clean and hidden from germs floating around the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Probably</li>
            <li>I do live in a moist climate where toothbrushes shouldn&#x27;t be stored in plastic, even though there are air holes, but the light seemed to have no effect except giving the toothbrushes a funny UV smell.  </li>
            <li>last sanitizer I bought - more of a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>As a family of five with a child that has an immune system disorder, it&#x27;s imperative that we try in every way to eliminate as many viruses as possible.  </li>
            <li>The first one I had for 2 years when the bulb went out.</li>
            <li>I thought it was working at first.  </li>
            <li>The light also got dim and died within a year.  </li>
            <li>After 13 months the small plastic tab on the top of the plastic door which activates the &amp;#34;on cycle&amp;#34; switch broke off -- so the unit won&#x27;t turn on any more.</li>
            <li>Love this item - especially when you read about all the germs and bacteria that are attracted to your toothbrush.</li>
            <li>For extra protection I still put the toothbrushes in boiling water for 60 seconds just in case :)</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says and does it well..</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that once in a while the door is touchy, but otherwise works great!</li>
            <li>However, the only problem I have with this is that sometimes when you close the door, the sanitizing light does not come on right away.  </li>
            <li>(Pretty much resolved now, yay.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The UV light only exposes the top part of the rack, so when I want to sanitize my night-time mouth guard, I have to prop it above the rack.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>After coming through a period of almost a month of \\&quot;revolving viruses\\&quot;, that started with our little one, and rotated through the family and back around again, this is great for peace of mind.</li>
            <li>Absolute JUNK.Broken when it got here.</li>
            <li>Not what one wants from a &amp;#34;sanitizer&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well to sanitize my toothbrush and tongue cleaner.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I really expected better quality.</li>
            <li>One has worked very well.</li>
            <li>The only thing that bothers me is that when you close the door that actives the UV light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on a search for a real one.</li>
            <li>That can really drain the batteries and wear on the UV lamp.</li>
            <li>But all in all we really like it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like this.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The 5 holders inside make it well worth the money as you can be sure multiple items are sanitized at the same time.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the Pursonic takes only 4 batteries where my CVS unit takes six which means a stronger light ( I assume).</li>
            <li>I will be looking for a similar design, but with more reliablility as far as reviews are concerned</li>
            <li>I feel better knowing that my toothbrush is sanitized, as opposed to just using a toothbrush cover that basically keeps the bristle wet (yuck!).  </li>
            <li>The other requires a whack on the top to turn on.</li>
            <li>and I clean it out regularly to avoid that.</li>
            <li>This has been sitting in our bathroom, keeping our entire family&#x27;s toothbrushes clean and sanitized.</li>
            <li>Time will tell as to how much of the UV lamp life is really reduced by the frequent run times.</li>
            <li>I also shaved down the top bump, but be very careful if you do this not to damage the contact that turns on the UV light.</li>
            <li>So far the battery has held up reasonably well.</li>
            <li>This unnecessarily runs the cleaning cycle and provides no ventilation, which I don&#x27;t think is a good idea.</li>
            <li>So while it is pretty stury, appears to work and has all in all a good design, all of that is irrelevant if  you  have to buy a new one every year.</li>
            <li>the adhesive on the back isn&#x27;t even strong enough to hold it to the wall.  </li>
            <li>Five sets of new batteries.  </li>
            <li>My unit (unlike many other reviewed units here) actually worked half-way decently for 13 months.  </li>
            <li>this is pretty big.  </li>
            <li>Worked well until either light or battery went dead after 3 months...</li>
            <li>But a rubber band temporarily fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>However, it does give me peace of mind and it seems that the amount of colds and sore throats we have had has completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I use heavy duty velcro to secure it to a tile wall.</li>
            <li>Five months old.</li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far it hasnt worked...</li>
            <li>Working well so far.  </li>
            <li>So far I have no issues with this product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t shave it off completely though.</li>
            <li>Keeping my dental implements sanitary is important to me because I&#x27;ve had some dental infection and periodontitis issues in the past.</li>
            <li>Only 2 of the 4 items I placed in the Pursonic item were held securely, the other 2 items were constantly falling off the peg bar.  </li>
            <li>This is the second one the first worked about as long.</li>
            <li>For the price charged it really should last for several years ...</li>
            <li>;)about it you could run the sanitize cycle, open it for a while to let things dry out, then close it again.</li>
            <li>For the second one I had to create something to prop it up so it could be high enough.</li>
            <li>About 6 months later the switch stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>Batteries seem to last well so far.</li>
            <li>In those 13 months I changed the 4 AA batteries which power it 3 times -- that&#x27;s not great, but not terrible.  </li>
            <li>Battery does not last very long and don&#x27;t know how well it cleans since the inside of it can get pretty gross.</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that the UV light should be manual, not automatic.</li>
            <li>Apparently the toothbrushes they used daily were having the mold scrubbed off in their mouths as I brushed their teeth.  </li>
            <li>I like this product and if you find that the door doesn&#x27;t open easily enough you can easily whittle down the small circular bump on the bottom where that part of the door is held shut.</li>

            <li> Not what one wants from a &amp;#34;sanitizer&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well to sanitize my toothbrush and tongue cleaner.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I really expected better quality.</li>
            <li> One has worked very well.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothers me is that when you close the door that actives the UV light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on a search for a real one.</li>
            <li> That can really drain the batteries and wear on the UV lamp.</li>
            <li> But all in all we really like it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like this.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The 5 holders inside make it well worth the money as you can be sure multiple items are sanitized at the same time.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the Pursonic takes only 4 batteries where my CVS unit takes six which means a stronger light ( I assume).</li>
            <li> I will be looking for a similar design, but with more reliablility as far as reviews are concerned</li>
            <li> I feel better knowing that my toothbrush is sanitized, as opposed to just using a toothbrush cover that basically keeps the bristle wet (yuck!).  </li>
            <li> The other requires a whack on the top to turn on.</li>
            <li> and I clean it out regularly to avoid that.</li>
            <li> This has been sitting in our bathroom, keeping our entire family&#x27;s toothbrushes clean and sanitized.</li>
            <li> Time will tell as to how much of the UV lamp life is really reduced by the frequent run times.</li>
            <li> I also shaved down the top bump, but be very careful if you do this not to damage the contact that turns on the UV light.</li>
            <li> So far the battery has held up reasonably well.</li>
            <li> This unnecessarily runs the cleaning cycle and provides no ventilation, which I don&#x27;t think is a good idea.</li>
            <li> So while it is pretty stury, appears to work and has all in all a good design, all of that is irrelevant if  you  have to buy a new one every year.</li>
            <li> the adhesive on the back isn&#x27;t even strong enough to hold it to the wall.  </li>
            <li> Five sets of new batteries.  </li>
            <li> My unit (unlike many other reviewed units here) actually worked half-way decently for 13 months.  </li>
            <li> this is pretty big.  </li>
            <li> Worked well until either light or battery went dead after 3 months...</li>
            <li> But a rubber band temporarily fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> However, it does give me peace of mind and it seems that the amount of colds and sore throats we have had has completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I use heavy duty velcro to secure it to a tile wall.</li>
            <li> Five months old.</li>
            <li> So far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far it hasnt worked...</li>
            <li> Working well so far.  </li>
            <li> So far I have no issues with this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t shave it off completely though.</li>
            <li> Keeping my dental implements sanitary is important to me because I&#x27;ve had some dental infection and periodontitis issues in the past.</li>
            <li> Only 2 of the 4 items I placed in the Pursonic item were held securely, the other 2 items were constantly falling off the peg bar.  </li>
            <li> This is the second one the first worked about as long.</li>
            <li> For the price charged it really should last for several years ...</li>
            <li> ;)about it you could run the sanitize cycle, open it for a while to let things dry out, then close it again.</li>
            <li> For the second one I had to create something to prop it up so it could be high enough.</li>
            <li> About 6 months later the switch stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Batteries seem to last well so far.</li>
            <li> In those 13 months I changed the 4 AA batteries which power it 3 times -- that&#x27;s not great, but not terrible.  </li>
            <li> Battery does not last very long and don&#x27;t know how well it cleans since the inside of it can get pretty gross.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the UV light should be manual, not automatic.</li>
            <li> Apparently the toothbrushes they used daily were having the mold scrubbed off in their mouths as I brushed their teeth.  </li>
            <li> I like this product and if you find that the door doesn&#x27;t open easily enough you can easily whittle down the small circular bump on the bottom where that part of the door is held shut.</li>
            <li> While the promotional hype suggests it&#x27;s good for tooth brushes, razor blades &amp; other small bathroom hygiene items that you would like to continually sanitize -- the small peg bar that holds items to be sanitized is not very versatile.  </li>
            <li> Did not last very long.</li>
            <li> you could run the sanitize cycle, open it for a while to let things dry out, then close it again.</li>
            <li> I had to change the batteries once so far, its only been a few months.</li>
            <li> It cuts down on the need to clean the device and other icky things that I read in reviews for similar products.  </li>
            <li> After about one month it started to keep a really strange smell.  </li>
            <li> deep x 4 3/4&amp;#34; wide x 8&amp;#34; tall  (the bottom 5&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The batteries only last one month or less depending on the batteries you use and how often you brush your teeth, and in my household</li>
            <li> If I go to brush my teeth, I open the S2 and pull out the brush, then close the lid to keep the other brushes sanitary.</li>
            <li> It is reliable so far (I&#x27;ve had it a month and a half and used it about every other day)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I dry the handle and shake the brush head out</li>
            <li> and so air circulates a bit to allow the brushes/heads/etc to dry out completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes that just sat there, apparently dry and being light-&amp;#34;sanitized&amp;#34</li>
            <li> could use a slightly easier to open door, but that&#x27;s a minor issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea but seems to be poorly designed and very poorly built.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;A) Do not place sopping-wet toothbrushes in it and then leave them closed inside for a long time.</li>
            <li> But one thing that really concerns me is that i am finding this weird white residue on the bottom of the inside of the unit.</li>
            <li> I leave the door &amp;#34;cracked open&amp;#34; until I&#x27;m ready to do a sanitize cycle so it does not run unnecessarily</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t make a habit of hanging sopping-wet brushes in it and leaving it closed, it should take a while before it needs cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably works well; however, I use the larger toothbrush and it will not fit well into the toothbrush holders.  </li>

            <li> Other reviewers have noted a problem with the switch.</li>
            <li> The unit is small enough to put in a suitcase if you want to travel with it as well.</li>

            <li> It can hold my small night-time mouth guard, although larger ones may not fit (dimensions at bottom of review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Does its job, but be on the lookout for the batteries going dead.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had to change it a few times already since we bought it about 6 months</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really cool. Couple of problems the sticky thingy doesn&#x27;t hold it to the wall well and the door sometimes doesn&#x27;t close and thus it sometimes doesn&#x27;t turn on. But for the price totally cool. Micro professor loved it</li>
            <li> Worked well until either light or battery went dead after 3 months...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much it is actually sterilizing or not, but it looks good, easy to mount, and I like how it is an enclosed box that holds everything nice and neat</li>
            <li> Absolute JUNK.Broken when it got here. Cheap plastic junk.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect if it was electrical. The batteries only last one month or less depending on the batteries you use and how often you brush your teeth, and in my household it&#x27;s a lot so this did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> Keeping my dental implements sanitary is important to me because I&#x27;ve had some dental infection and periodontitis issues in the past. (Pretty much resolved now, yay.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last sanitizer I bought - more of a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; - not only broke in short order, it shares a terrible enclosed &amp;#34;head down&amp;#34; design with various other products that often results in the bottom tray of the device collecting massive amounts of dirty slime that is hard to clean out. Ugh. Not what one wants from a &amp;#34;sanitizer&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has worked perfectly reliably for me for over a year now, and the &amp;#34;heads up&amp;#34; / wall-mount-capable design is more sanitary and practical in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those reviewers that have had issues with collected gunk or battery life, I have 3 suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) Do not place sopping-wet toothbrushes in it and then leave them closed inside for a long time. Common sense. I dry the handle and shake the brush head out well and/or dab it with some tissue or towel before placing it inside. (Not worried much about pathogens on the drying material, that is what the UV-C light is for - just use something clean)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B) No need to fully close it every time you return a brush/head inside. This unnecessarily runs the cleaning cycle and provides no ventilation, which I don&#x27;t think is a good idea. I leave the door &amp;#34;cracked open&amp;#34; until I&#x27;m ready to do a sanitize cycle so it does not run unnecessarily and so air circulates a bit to allow the brushes/heads/etc to dry out completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) Clean the bottom of the tray periodically if you find stuff collecting there. Ideally the bottom would be completely open for ventilation, unless you have a lot of crud circulating in the air, where a sealed box has its advantages. If you don&#x27;t make a habit of hanging sopping-wet brushes in it and leaving it closed, it should take a while before it needs cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you wanted to be totally OCD about it you could run the sanitize cycle, open it for a while to let things dry out, then close it again. ;)about it you could run the sanitize cycle, open it for a while to let things dry out, then close it again. ;)</li>
            <li> This works great and love the fact that you can put more than just your toothbush in it.  My only complaint is that once in a while the door is touchy, but otherwise works great!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Pursonic S2 Toothbrush Sanitizer\\&quot; we bought from Amazon is of poor quality. Right from the start the \\&quot;On\\&quot; switch did not work properly. But a rubber band temporarily fixed the problem. About 6 months later the switch stopped working completely. Also the reflecting mirror showed signs of degradation. The 90 days warranty was not applicable. I would NOT recommend this device.</li>
            <li> I love this it is comforting to know that my tooth brushes are being sterilized.  I would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas present. It didn&#x27;t work right out of the box. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I put this item up on the wall as soon as I received it.  It works really well to sanitize my toothbrush and tongue cleaner.  I feel better knowing that my toothbrush is sanitized, as opposed to just using a toothbrush cover that basically keeps the bristle wet (yuck!).  I also like that it has a place to put your toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I use this on my toothbrushes and tongue scraper.  It gives me peace of mind to know that I am not introducing yucchy bacteria into my mouth.  Worth the price!  Only four stars because, as another reviewer noted,  it only exposes the upper portion of the toothbrush to the UV rays.</li>
            <li> As a family of five with a child that has an immune system disorder, it&#x27;s imperative that we try in every way to eliminate as many viruses as possible.  I&#x27;m not sure if this actually does what it claims to do, as I am not a scientist.  However, it does give me peace of mind and it seems that the amount of colds and sore throats we have had has completely disappeared.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> For the price, I really expected better quality. The latch doesn&#x27;t always make contact therefore the UV light doesn&#x27;t come on defeating the purpose. I don&#x27;t know if the one I got was defective, or the design overall is bad. Returned it</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have had. The first one I had for 2 years when the bulb went out. I don&#x27;t like leaving my toothbrushes out in the open and this seems so much more sanitary. I have not had an issue with mold and I clean it out regularly to avoid that. The brush holder on the inside slips out easily for cleaning. I use heavy duty velcro to secure it to a tile wall.</li>
            <li> i like this one because it can be drilled into the wall, andfits multiple items. The best part is that the toothbrush or razor is not meant to be upside down. meaning the water that drips off can pool in the bottom, and then defeats the purpose of this item. it will just have your toothbrush soaking in that water after a while.</li>
            <li> I just purchased two. One has worked very well. The other requires a whack on the top to turn on. I use them flat on a counter; not sure if I&#x27;ll mount them. Other reviewers have noted a problem with the switch. I hope both continue to work for at least a year. I like the design and would be willing to pay more for a product with a more reliable switch. They need four AA batteries, which don&#x27;t come with the sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Probably works well; however, I use the larger toothbrush and it will not fit well into the toothbrush holders.  I would have preferred an on/off switch rather than the close the door to turn on.</li>
            <li> Battery does not last very long and don&#x27;t know how well it cleans since the inside of it can get pretty gross.</li>
            <li> Did not last very long. Stopped working within months. Waste of money and very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.  Five months old. Five sets of new batteries.  No longer works. Save your money.  Save your money!!</li>
            <li> This item was used by two adults and lasted two months.  Good idea but cheaply made, look for something better.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, great purchase.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS, EVERYONE THAT SEES IT ASK WHER I GOT IT FROM ,AND WANT ONE. I AM HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
            <li> It makes my toothbrush smell fresh and clean. I had to change the batteries once so far, its only been a few months. I can store my shaver in there which is good, cause i feel like bacteria stays on the wet blades. Since water brings bacteria to items. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I have had this product for awhile now, and its working pretty good. But one thing that really concerns me is that i am finding this weird white residue on the bottom of the inside of the unit. i dont know what is it, but it is very gross.</li>
            <li> Batteries last about a week with twice daily use.</li>
            <li> It gives me such peace of mind to know that my brushes are being sanitized between brushings!  Does its job, but be on the lookout for the batteries going dead.  We&#x27;ve had to change it a few times already since we bought it about 6 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con:&lt;br /&gt;The door is hard to open.  It takes some force.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Sometimes have to close it more than once for the light to come on. Batteries seem to last well so far. Would be even better if it came with a socket to plug in a wall wart. Maybe I will just add one.</li>
            <li> this is pretty big.  the adhesive on the back isn&#x27;t even strong enough to hold it to the wall.  thinking of returning.</li>
            <li> I chose this specific product because it seemed to be the only one that stores the toothbrushes heads up.  It cuts down on the need to clean the device and other icky things that I read in reviews for similar products.  I really like knowing that our toothbrushes are enclosed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and easy to install on the wall.</li>
            <li> After receiving a defective product, customer service department (MBR Brooks company) went out of way to replace this product and also added an AC adapter for time waiting on replacement.  They went out of way to make sure this product works and IT DOES.  It sanitizes both toothbrush and shaving razors.  The timer helps to keep product sanitized .  Would recommend this product and company highly for their exceptional CS in order to make sure product works to highest value.  Most products don&#x27;t have an AC adaptive so purchase of batteries gets costly and company wants to make sure they give you the exceptional service and quality product that works for your situation.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush sanitizer is great. It works for electric toothbrushes as well as regular ones. I&#x27;ve noticed other people say the door is hard to open but if you hold the top of the unit when opening the door (to give it some stability) then it opens fine. I like the toothpaste holder as well. The only thing that bothers me is that when you close the door that actives the UV light. Once you take your toothbrush out and use it you can&#x27;t close the door unless you want to sanitize it all over again. This is good if there is only one toothbrush but if you have multiples ones in there you will be unnecessarily sanitizing those. The unit is small enough to put in a suitcase if you want to travel with it as well. All in all this a great affordable product.</li>
            <li> Fits a good amount inside, but gets really nasty after awhile. toothbrush is always wet inside.  The light goes on but runs out of battery very quickly (always seem to be changing them). I&#x27;m still on a search for a real one. larger &amp; sturdy, not plastic &amp; nasty.</li>
            <li> I like having one place to put my toothbrushes in. I love that there is also a place for the toothpaste. I know it&#x27;s a small thing but it helps to organize my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Now on the other side, this works best with toothbrushes that have a wider neck. Of course neither of mine do. The first one I am able to place high enough that it will stay most of the time. For the second one I had to create something to prop it up so it could be high enough. And then I have to close the door veeeery carefully or they&#x27;ll both fall down and I have to do it all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be wonderful if they recognized that there are variable sizes and would allow for adjustment.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a year, and was very happy with it. But once the year mark arrived, it just stopped working. All of the sudden,and it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is a likely solution. So while it is pretty stury, appears to work and has all in all a good design, all of that is irrelevant if  you  have to buy a new one every year. I will be looking for a similar design, but with more reliablility as far as reviews are concerned</li>
            <li> so far it hasnt worked...</li>
            <li> This has been sitting in our bathroom, keeping our entire family&#x27;s toothbrushes clean and sanitized. After coming through a period of almost a month of \\&quot;revolving viruses\\&quot;, that started with our little one, and rotated through the family and back around again, this is great for peace of mind. The experts recommend replacing toothbrushes after an illness, but honestly those recommendations must have come before the ~$20 tooth brush heads (we have 2 sonic care brush heads used in our UV sterilizer). So far the battery has held up reasonably well. The only complaint is that the UV light should be manual, not automatic. Here is why. If I go to brush my teeth, I open the S2 and pull out the brush, then close the lid to keep the other brushes sanitary. But when I close the lid it turns on the light (to sanitize the remaining, already clean, brushes in the unit). Then, if my wife or daughter come in to brush their teeth before I am done, the cycle repeats again. For each \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; the unit essentially runs twice, for a family of 3, up to a dozen times a day, 6 in the morning and 6 again at night. That can really drain the batteries and wear on the UV lamp. But all in all we really like it. Time will tell as to how much of the UV lamp life is really reduced by the frequent run times.</li>
            <li> Do not buy.  It worked about 2 months then stopped working.  This is the second one the first worked about as long.</li>
            <li> DOA did not work right out of the box. Burning smell once batteries are inserted. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this in December and the lamp is already burned out. It is rather cheaply made. I would not advise buying it.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my worst purchases ever.  I thought it was working at first.  It installed easily and is convenient.  However my two children got extra toothbrushes at the dentist and I stored them inside the sanitizer after they&#x27;d only been used once.  Eventually I noticed that gray-black mold was growing all over the toothbrushes they didn&#x27;t use.  Apparently the toothbrushes they used daily were having the mold scrubbed off in their mouths as I brushed their teeth.  The toothbrushes that just sat there, apparently dry and being light-&amp;#34;sanitized&amp;#34; daily were disgusting.  I do live in a moist climate where toothbrushes shouldn&#x27;t be stored in plastic, even though there are air holes, but the light seemed to have no effect except giving the toothbrushes a funny UV smell.  The light also got dim and died within a year.  It was too late for me to do anything but throw it away, but I&#x27;d encourage you not to waste your money.</li>
            <li> My unit (unlike many other reviewed units here) actually worked half-way decently for 13 months.  In those 13 months I changed the 4 AA batteries which power it 3 times -- that&#x27;s not great, but not terrible.  After 13 months the small plastic tab on the top of the plastic door which activates the &amp;#34;on cycle&amp;#34; switch broke off -- so the unit won&#x27;t turn on any more. The unit was never dropped or had any impact -- so I suspect that the plastic was weakened by the continuing exposure to UV light.  While the promotional hype suggests it&#x27;s good for tooth brushes, razor blades &amp; other small bathroom hygiene items that you would like to continually sanitize -- the small peg bar that holds items to be sanitized is not very versatile.  Only 2 of the 4 items I placed in the Pursonic item were held securely, the other 2 items were constantly falling off the peg bar.  It&#x27;s a good idea but seems to be poorly designed and very poorly built.  It MIGHT work okay for a while for some items but might NOT work okay at all for other items.  For the price charged it really should last for several years ... not for a month or two ... or in my case even 13 months.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like this. After about one month it started to keep a really strange smell.  Cleaned with vinegar, disinfect  but once the light is on it bakes it right into the plastic.</li>
            <li> Love this item - especially when you read about all the germs and bacteria that are attracted to your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this is the door doesn&#x27;t close well. I&#x27;m scared of breaking it because of that. Thanks Grammya</li>
            <li> Great product for the price and does what you need it to do. Nice option to mount on your wall in your bathroom. The 5 holders inside make it well worth the money as you can be sure multiple items are sanitized at the same time.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the best UV sanitizer on the market.  I did a ton of research before buying.&lt;br /&gt;It works great, although there are a couple of things I wish could change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASING:&lt;br /&gt;1) It is reliable so far (I&#x27;ve had it a month and a half and used it about every other day)&lt;br /&gt;2) It is easy to use (just close the door to turn it on, and it auto-shuts off when finished)&lt;br /&gt;3) You can store your toothbrushes inside if you choose, and one tube of toothpaste on the side&lt;br /&gt;4) It is easy to mount on the wall, and to remove from the mounting for battery changing (although my batteries are still fine)&lt;br /&gt;5) It can hold my small night-time mouth guard, although larger ones may not fit (dimensions at bottom of review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANNOYING:&lt;br /&gt;1) The UV light only exposes the top part of the rack, so when I want to sanitize my night-time mouth guard, I have to prop it above the rack.&lt;br /&gt;2) When a very dirty item is sanitized, there is a dead-bacteria smell afterward, which can be removed with toothpaste, mouthwash, or denture cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIMENSIONS:&lt;br /&gt;UV lighted area above rack:  1&amp;#34; deep x 4 3/4&amp;#34; wide x 1 3/8&amp;#34; tall&lt;br /&gt;Total inner size:  1&amp;#34; deep x 4 3/4&amp;#34; wide x 8&amp;#34; tall  (the bottom 5&amp;#34; is 1 3/4&amp;#34; deep to accommodate thick or bent handles)&lt;br /&gt;Total outer size:  2 1/8&amp;#34; deep x 5 1/2&amp;#34; wide x 9 1/4&amp;#34; tall (includes wall mounting)</li>
            <li> Working well so far.  EASY TO INSTALL!</li>
            <li> Worked for 2 months and then died.&lt;br /&gt;Company do not provide even a warranty for 2 months&lt;br /&gt;Please do not buy and waste your money</li>
            <li> The unit functions well enough and I like the design (stands upright, a position which protects the UV bulb and reflector from dripping water damage from the toothbrushes; and the interior is fully covered and enclosed by the door, which helps keep out dust, etc.), However, I&#x27;m sensing that the sanitizing power is somewhat weaker than that of another unit I have, sold by CVS. I noticed that the Pursonic takes only 4 batteries where my CVS unit takes six which means a stronger light ( I assume). I&#x27;ll continue to observe, and update my review if called for.</li>
            <li> Very simple design and priced out well....&lt;br /&gt;No disappointment here.&lt;br /&gt;Will be nice to have toothbrushes and toothbrush heads clean and hidden from germs floating around the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Probably could use a slightly easier to open door, but that&#x27;s a minor issue.</li>
            <li> So far I have no issues with this product. I cant guarantee it is sanitizing but I know that the light goes on and hopefully it is doing its job. For extra protection I still put the toothbrushes in boiling water for 60 seconds just in case :)</li>
            <li> The product seemed to work fine the first 2-3 weeks then just didn&#x27;t turn on.  Thought that maybe just the batteries needed to be replace so I figured I would just change the batteries when I got a chance then my wife gave birth so I didn&#x27;t get to try changing the batteries till a week later and just my luck, the batteries were not the problem and I was already 2 days past my window to return the product.  Now it&#x27;s just an expensive toothbrush holder...</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. I could only wish they would creat one that had separate comparment for razors.  Does exactly what it says and does it well..</li>
            <li> I like this product and if you find that the door doesn&#x27;t open easily enough you can easily whittle down the small circular bump on the bottom where that part of the door is held shut. Don&#x27;t shave it off completely though. Just do it gradually to make sure there&#x27;s still some contact with the door. The same can be done with the middle part where the door latch makes contact. I also shaved down the top bump, but be very careful if you do this not to damage the contact that turns on the UV light. I&#x27;d also suggest using a different adhesive than the one in the box. It fell off my wall and it was the side stuck to this device that came unstuck, not the wall side. I remounted it with 3m picture hanging strips.</li>
            <li> I got it bc my kids are always sick and I feel this is a great product and way to keep germs down. The only problem I have it that its hard to open.</li>
            <li> This is a good sanitizer.  However, the only problem I have with this is that sometimes when you close the door, the sanitizing light does not come on right away.  I thought for awhile that I wasn&#x27;t closing the door properly but come to find out I was.  Its just that the light doesn&#x27;t pop on right away sometime.</li>
