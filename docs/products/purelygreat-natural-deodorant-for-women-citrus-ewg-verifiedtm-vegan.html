    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely impressed.</li>
            <li>Works all day for me and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>Great product, great seller</li>
            <li>Been using about a month and it works great.</li>
            <li>That would be a nice bonus!</li>
            <li>It works fairly well unless you are under stress.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and keeps me odor free for 24+ hours - even through a workout.</li>
            <li>but honestly...</li>
            <li>and my thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>It smells great and keeps me smelling fresh!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a layer of oil on top of another layer of thicker, Crisco-like stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m okay with that</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, natural alternative!  </li>
            <li>Wow, this is great stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>But, after several days of use, I am happy to report that it works better than any</li>
            <li>I have tried  many different natural deodorants,this one works the best and all the time.</li>
            <li>What can I say, natural deodorants just don&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>When I opened the jar for the first time, the oil on top splashed everywhere.</li>
            <li>Works great but not crazy about the fragrance, I prefer the teen boy sent.</li>
            <li>This deodorant really works and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this natural deodorant!!!</li>
            <li>: There&#x27;s a bit of adjustment you go through when switching to a natural deodorant (like getting used to sweating again), but once your body adapts to it, it&#x27;s more than fine.</li>
            <li>stuff smells exactly like citronella or &amp;#34;Off&amp;#34; from a spray can.</li>
            <li>It really irritated my underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for creating this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work so well for me as a deodorant, but it might for someone else.  </li>
            <li>The whole idea is to allow your body to sweat since it&#x27;s the way our bodies release toxins.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t shave my pits often so things get really hairy and</li>
            <li>admit that I had my doubts about this, after using so many different types of natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>Most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants will send you back to your commercial antiperspirant--drenched in a pool of smelly sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different brands and most recently I have been using this one from Purelygreat.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wake up with super gross stinky pits anymore,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shocked to find this to be the best natural deodorant I have ever had!</li>
            <li>Recently ran out and had to use another brand (old brand I used prior to this) and can tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I have been really trying to go the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; route as much as possible and Deodorant has been high on my list.  </li>
            <li>It is all natural and holds up to my tween&#x27;s smelly pits.</li>
            <li>Purelygreat Deodorant is a creamy, natural and aluminum-free deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone whose looking to go natural.</li>
            <li>natural deodorant is a creamy consistency and, although you can use the applicator, it&#x27;s just as easy to take a small amount and apply with your fingertips.  </li>
            <li>Kind of weird the way you have to put it on and can be messy but very worth it.</li>
            <li>I have also not experienced any itching or rashes, so it seems to be a very gentle yet powerful</li>
            <li>I was worried after reading reviews for a number of different natural deodorant products that my skin might become sensitive or develop a rash from the baking soda but after a month of daily use I haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li>This has been the same with all of the natural Deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>No skin irritiation, no excessive rubbing on, just a small dab with my finger and it rubs in really easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that if you&#x27;re thinking of switching to a natural deodorant, then, by all means try this product.</li>

            <li> I have tried other natural products but they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I think it works equally as well as the average commercial deodorant.</li>
            <li> I did get minor skin irritation</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it came in a bigger jar.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way, one jar is 45 grams and lasts about 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Something to keep in mind is that this is a Deodorant, not an Antiperspirant.  </li>

            <li> Now my jar is difficult to twist open, because it&#x27;s slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> started reapplying the product, no more irritation.</li>
            <li> which for me happens even after showering :(&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to trying in cooler weather to see if I really don&#x27;t have to use it every day.</li>
            <li> the jar is very small for the price.</li>
            <li> instructions say just smear one line down your pit, which I was skeptical about but sweaty or not I notice</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am a somewhat of an excessive sweater.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like this one at all. :(</li>
            <li> It leaves a stain on my clothes :(</li>

            <li> I think this works well...but honestly...the jar is very small for the price. I&#x27;ll look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This deodorant did not work for me. After one hour it was as if I had no deodorant at all. What can I say, natural deodorants just don&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li> This deodorant really works and I love the scent. It is all natural and holds up to my tween&#x27;s smelly pits.</li>

            <li> The jar I received is messy. There&#x27;s a layer of oil on top of another layer of thicker, Crisco-like stuff. When I opened the jar for the first time, the oil on top splashed everywhere. Now my jar is difficult to twist open, because it&#x27;s slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells exactly like citronella or &amp;#34;Off&amp;#34; from a spray can. You may like that, but I don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t like smelling like insect repellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on after my shower. Ouch. It really irritated my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work well. I just got out of the shower an hour ago and I can already tell it&#x27;s wearing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t work if you reapply. You have to shower again before reapplying or it just has no effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like this one at all. :(</li>
            <li> Finally found something that truly works!  Thank you for this amazing/awesome product!  I have been using this product for awhile with no issues just results.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is great stuff. I love this product. It smells wonderful and keeps me odor free for 24+ hours - even through a workout. I&#x27;m completely impressed. I was worried after reading reviews for a number of different natural deodorant products that my skin might become sensitive or develop a rash from the baking soda but after a month of daily use I haven&#x27;t had any problems. The only downside is that because this ships internationally from Canada the shipping is almost as expensive as the product. I guess next time I&#x27;ll just buy multiples in one shipment because I&#x27;m definitely going to be a life-long user.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked to find this to be the best natural deodorant I have ever had! It actually works for two days at a time. Thank you so much for creating this product. I&#x27;ve searched for years for something like this. I just wish I did not have to keep up with the wooden stick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a year.  Recently ran out and had to use another brand (old brand I used prior to this) and can tell a huge difference.  Will never run out again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works all day for me and smells awesome. My only complaint is that I wish it came in a bigger jar.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work so well for me as a deodorant, but it might for someone else.  Didn&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>

            <li> Great product, great seller</li>
            <li> I have been really trying to go the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; route as much as possible and Deodorant has been high on my list.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different brands and most recently I have been using this one from Purelygreat.&lt;br /&gt;This Purelygreat Deodorant is a creamy, natural and aluminum-free deodorant.  It smells great and keeps me smelling fresh!  It&#x27;s made with essential oils, baking soda, corn starch and vegetable glycerin so it allows your skin to breathe and release toxins.  It&#x27;s a great, natural alternative!  Also, a little goes a long way, one jar is 45 grams and lasts about 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Something to keep in mind is that this is a Deodorant, not an Antiperspirant.  Unfortunately, I am a somewhat of an excessive sweater.  So, I find myself still needing to supplement any Deodorant with my regular Antiperspirant as needed.  This has been the same with all of the natural Deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.  The whole idea is to allow your body to sweat since it&#x27;s the way our bodies release toxins. so I&#x27;m okay with that but sometimes I still need the Antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Kind of weird the way you have to put it on and can be messy but very worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this natural deodorant!!! I recommend it to anyone whose looking to go natural. I have tried other natural products but they didn&#x27;t work. I did get minor skin irritation so I stopped using it for two days then started reapplying the product, no more irritation. I love the scent. So I&#x27;m continuing to purchase this product!</li>
            <li> Works great but not crazy about the fragrance, I prefer the teen boy sent.</li>
            <li> Been using about a month and it works great. No skin irritiation, no excessive rubbing on, just a small dab with my finger and it rubs in really easy.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say just smear one line down your pit, which I was skeptical about but sweaty or not I notice no funk!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t shave my pits often so things get really hairy and the deodorant works regardless. I don&#x27;t wake up with super gross stinky pits anymore, which for me happens even after showering :(&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to trying in cooler weather to see if I really don&#x27;t have to use it every day. That would be a nice bonus!</li>
