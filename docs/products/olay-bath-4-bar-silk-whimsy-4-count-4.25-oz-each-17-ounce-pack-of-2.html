            <li>I loved this soap from the moment I found it and bought it.</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift and the recipient is thrilled to still find this discontinued product online.</li>
            <li>Also, with these, the nice scent dissipated within a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I love this bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>omg i love this</li>
            <li>love the silkiness and the aroma.  </li>
            <li>But for now, I love it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, mild scent and has the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; nubs on one side of the bar.  </li>
            <li>A very good soap for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The bar lathers well and let your skin feel comfortable afterwards.  </li>
            <li>its a rich lather</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean &amp; without dryness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love the smell and feel but it finishes within 3 days in my house... which is pretty quick..</li>
            <li>so it tends to go quickly...</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the way it treats my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>While this soap lathers up quite nicely, it doesn&#x27;t smell or feel the same as the one I purchased in the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>should be pink and smell GOOD.</li>
            <li>The soap has a nice lather and smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li>This is not the right soap in these pkgs.</li>
            <li>i bought two bars in a target several months ago, thinking I could go back and buy more if I liked</li>
            <li>but I expect that with the higher moisturizing ingredient content.</li>
            <li>I have no longer been able to find this in my local stores.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to most soaps and they dry my skin out</li>
            <li>This soap is much better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon, for stocking it.  </li>
            <li>Really a beauty bar in its self.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>When I know longer could find this soap, I was very upset.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>I even use it as a facial soap and it removes sunscreen and makeup very well.  </li>
            <li>Yes, they moisturize nicely while bathing, but all of them simply melt into an unusable mess within days -- and that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m trying to keep them out of the shower spray, and they&#x27;re allowed to dry on a soap rack for about 24 hours between showers.</li>
            <li>The same was true for the other soap Oil of Olay made, called Luscious Embrace.</li>
            <li>I ordered a whole bunch of this stuff so it would last me a long time.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s left in a soap dish it gets too soft and mushy.</li>
            <li>while it&#x27;s creamy, it disintegrates much quicker than other bars of soap.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, my face never feels tight after I use it.</li>

            <li> only \\&quot;con\\&quot; is that it does melt away a little faster</li>
            <li> These seem novel but do not really impress me and are not what I purchased this product for.  </li>
            <li> hope they keep making this &amp; the other varieties forever.</li>
            <li> There are other fragrances in this Olay line</li>

            <li> This is a sickly pale yellow soap with hardly any scent.</li>
            <li> i am addicted only buying this soap from now on</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this bath bar almost exclusively this past winter</li>
            <li> I have to order it on Amazon because Silk Whimsy is never available in the stores in my area!</li>
            <li> so I have a hard time with bath soups drying my skin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing overall, will not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> The price for 8 bars was extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> Sadly disappointed since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this bar of soap.  i bought two bars in a target several months ago, thinking I could go back and buy more if I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it, and could not find it anyway but on Amazon.  I prefer the bar soap to the liquid, so this is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> This soap is much better than I expected it to be. I am allergic to most soaps and they dry my skin out but this soap worked well</li>
            <li> This is the bar I use on my face every night.  It have worked so well that I started to use it in the shower. The bar lathers well and let your skin feel comfortable afterwards.  When used on my face it removes my makeup well.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this bath bar almost exclusively this past winter and I love it!  It has a nice, mild scent and has the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; nubs on one side of the bar.  These seem novel but do not really impress me and are not what I purchased this product for.  What impresses me is the lack of itchy, dry skin that I&#x27;ve had in past years from using a deodorizing bath soap. I used to use baby oil after my bath to prevent this and I&#x27;ve not needed to since using this bar, though I still use my lotion for the drier areas like my feet and hands, and legs after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; is that it does melt away a little faster but I expect that with the higher moisturizing ingredient content. It&#x27;s a wonderful bath bar! Try it.</li>
            <li> The soap has a nice lather and smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  It&#x27;s so soft it&#x27;s gone before you know it.</li>
            <li> A very good soap for dry skin. I even use it as a facial soap and it removes sunscreen and makeup very well.  Products was delivered on time. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have no longer been able to find this in my local stores.  Thanks, Amazon, for stocking it.  I love the scent and the way it treats my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> One thing that &amp;#34;rubbed off&amp;#34; from my divorce was this dang soap! It smells great. Leaves my skin clean &amp; without dryness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they keep making this &amp; the other varieties forever.</li>
            <li> I ordered a whole bunch of this stuff so it would last me a long time.  I can never find it at our stores, so when I find it I grab what I can. I will continue to order this in the future.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. It will last for a long time</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift and the recipient is thrilled to still find this discontinued product online.</li>
            <li> omg i love this it smells soooo amaazing and it has like these massage circles on the bar that feeels soooo good i am addicted only buying this soap from now on</li>
            <li> While this soap lathers up quite nicely, it doesn&#x27;t smell or feel the same as the one I purchased in the grocery store.  It isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;silky\\&quot; and the smell is different.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because Olay changed the formula, or if this soap is a \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; batch.</li>
            <li> This is not the right soap in these pkgs. should be pink and smell GOOD. This is a sickly pale yellow soap with hardly any scent. Sadly disappointed since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the best soup ever.  I am a ginger so I have a hard time with bath soups drying my skin.</li>
            <li> Really a beauty bar in its self.  love the silkiness and the aroma.  Works well on my body. Thanks.  will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When I know longer could find this soap, I was very upset. I loved this soap from the moment I found it and bought it. I made a point of stocking up with it. The same was true for the other soap Oil of Olay made, called Luscious Embrace. But that to, I can no longer find. My girlfriend mentioned the internet and that&#x27;s how I got it. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do,once I finish every bar I have of both kinds. The price for 8 bars was extremely expensive. I paid double the amount going through the internet. But for now, I love it. Nothing comes close to it. Why  they stopped putting it in stores? Clueless</li>
            <li> After learning that Olay tests on animals, I switched soaps.  Also, this soap does not last very long - while it&#x27;s creamy, it disintegrates much quicker than other bars of soap.</li>
            <li> I should know by now not to buy Olay, Caress, or Dove soaps.  Yes, they moisturize nicely while bathing, but all of them simply melt into an unusable mess within days -- and that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m trying to keep them out of the shower spray, and they&#x27;re allowed to dry on a soap rack for about 24 hours between showers. Also, with these, the nice scent dissipated within a couple of days. Very disappointing overall, will not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> This is not a soap that I leave in a soap dish at the sink for my hands, this is a soap that I use to wash my face and body in the shower. If it&#x27;s left in a soap dish it gets too soft and mushy. It is very moisturizing, my face never feels tight after I use it. There are other fragrances in this Olay line but this is my fave. I have to order it on Amazon because Silk Whimsy is never available in the stores in my area!</li>
            <li> Its honestly my fav soap!! i love the smell and feel but it finishes within 3 days in my house... which is pretty quick.. its a rich lather so it tends to go quickly... but besides that its wonderful!</li>
            <li> Wish they still made it!</li>
