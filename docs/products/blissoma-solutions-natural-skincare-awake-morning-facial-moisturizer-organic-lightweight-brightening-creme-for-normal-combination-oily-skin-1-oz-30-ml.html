    <ol>
            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>I have tried their cleanser and mask before and they were wonderful.</li>
            <li>For me, this product worked best as a day moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>I think it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks!  </li>
            <li>This one smells very bright and citrus-y.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is incredibly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s incredibly tacky.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Julie for a great skincare product.</li>
            <li>Great for oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, my makeup applies beautifully over this and it keeps my skin feeling good all day.  </li>
            <li>They have an amazing variety of products, and you&#x27;re bound to find some you like!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is amazing!  </li>
            <li>All are formulated with the best ingredients and have wonderful natural scents.  </li>
            <li>The smell literally woke me up and put me in a good mood.</li>
            <li>and I have loved all of it.</li>
            <li>All of Blissoma&#x27;s products are made with the highest quality ingredients (just read the list) and feels SO good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Their moisturizers are very light, so they&#x27;re great to use in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Great for pre mkleup application helping smooth out my skin!   </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do amazing things for me.  </li>
            <li>I actually really liked it but again, scented lotions for the face makes me leery.   </li>
            <li>This product has many good ingredients in it and it&#x27;s like supplying my skin the vitamins that needed.</li>
            <li>(Origins Brighter By Nature) because it&#x27;s much more moisturizing and my skin feels good when I wear this</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>And I have to say, it is just ok in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It made me feel like this product may be better off for people with oily skin as oppose to combination/normal.   </li>
            <li>like many moisturizers leave my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the scent of the Awake moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best facial moisturizers I have used.</li>
            <li>Then I apply something richer on top of it.</li>
            <li>I received a sample bottle of Awake and really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>The smell is interesting but I like how it is woodsy and earthy.</li>
            <li>kids work family sometimes is overwhelming</li>
            <li>They are phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and was concerned that using non-medicated products (without salicylic acid, etc.) would cause me to break out more.  </li>
            <li>On the contrary, my skin is smoother, brighter, and clearer than ever, and I know that I am using only the best ingredients on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked this product quite a bit, but I like the Smooth A+ Moisture Serum *</li>
            <li>more</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin has been better since I&#x27;ve been moisturizing both morning and night.  </li>
            <li>Welcome to our NEW Blissoma Product Review Program!</li>
            <li>I become more aware of my health more and more.</li>
            <li>The scent is not bad at all!</li>
            <li>It has a fantastic scent and feels great when you put it on - really light and not greasy and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It had a refreshing scent that smelled fresh, natural, and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I love the brand, love the pure ingredients.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone who would like a moisturizer that is light and works well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone skin, and this moisturizer is light and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>Both the sample and the postage will be free for the chosen Reviewers.    </li>
            <li>I think if you are younger and/or have oilier skin, Awake would be a great moisturizer for you.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean (which it is!)</li>
            <li>I need something more moisturizing for the winter, but I love how soothing it is on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The Awake Moisturizer is a nice lightweight moisturizer that leaves your skin soft and nourished.  </li>
            <li>Will update this review if I do purchase full size</li>
            <li>Will update this review if I do purchase full size  </li>
            <li>Despite the thickness, the lotion lives up to its claims that it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>First off, it does have a fairly strong scent which made me nervous at first.</li>
            <li>I personally like the Smooth A+ moisturizer a better, partly because it smells strongly like coriander and partly because it&#x27;s really calming on my skin.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer had a very creamy and smooth texture that felt lightweight on my face.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that this moisturizer is really too light for my skin type.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that company lists all ingredients; and that they are natural.</li>
            <li>and I love that this moisturizer absorbs completely into my skin.</li>
            <li>It was my choice to post a public review and all opinions of this product are my own.</li>
            <li>Wanting to use more natural skin care products, I switched to using all Blissoma products (cleanser, toner, moisturizer, mask) about six months ago.  </li>
            <li>I use it right after the toner as a serum.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s right in time for fall.</li>
            <li>Right after it&#x27;s rubbed into your skin</li>
            <li>However, I really like its algae-like texture and it absorbs to my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>What I love most about this product is that after I put it on my skin feels firm - not tight or aching for more moisture, but firm, like the ingredients are working their magic!</li>
            <li>Non irritating; pleasant smell and my skin is glowing!</li>
            <li>I love Awake Morning Facial Moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a product I enjoyed and will return to</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the better daytime moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Definitely one of the better daytime moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer does work exactly as claimed however the smell is unforgivable.</li>
            <li>You can become the first to test Blissoma products and review them.    </li>
            <li>I also use the Peace Evening Facial Creme and love that too.  </li>
            <li>I keep adding other products from their line and have truly been thrilled with all of them.</li>
            <li>First off, I have normal/dry skin which tends to lean more towards dry during the colder months.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and after 2 weeks of using this  moisturizer left my skin feeling clean, fresh, and looking flaw-free.</li>
            <li>It is super lightweight and completely absorbs into my skin almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Blissoma products, especially the rice cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Awake Morning Facial Moisturizer&#x27;s light lemony fragrance.  </li>
            <li>(check out the list of ingredients and you&#x27;ll know why)--that is very uplifting in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much smoother</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely come back and buy it with this kind of reasonable price.</li>
            <li>As I have to wear sunscreen and regularly wear make-up too, a light moisturizer for day is a must for me.</li>
            <li>I tried the re-formulated version so my moisturizer didn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li>When I got this I was immediately weary of the fact that it&#x27;s not so much a lotion consistency as it is a serum consistency.  </li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t think a liquidy moisturizer like this would be up to the task of moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used almost the whole sample I have to say...</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>all opinions of this product are my own.**ve used almost the whole sample I have to say...</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>However, while I can&#x27;t get over how fantastic the Rice cleaner is I do not like the Awake Morning Facial Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really need one</li>
            <li>First off, this was my first time trying any Blissoma product or a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away; my skin is soft and glowing without being overly oily.  </li>
            <li>fact that this does not have SPF in it was enough to make me decide not to buy this in full size.  </li>
            <li>This has taken a hefty toll on my facial skin and since I have been using this cream every day, I am starting to regain the healthy look that I had years ago.</li>
            <li>but I do enjoy the aroma therapy effect and the fresh feeling, not the cakey feeling that heavy lotions leave.</li>
            <li>I have been on a quest to find a moisturizer becasue as I get older</li>
            <li>Samples will be distributed free to a limited number of subscribers per offering.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend  any of the products from Blissoma.</li>
            <li>I think I need a little more nourishment and support as my skin ages</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m over 50, I bought the whole line for mature skin</li>
            <li>I got an opportunity to try this moisturizer which is for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>It was a strange feeling but not necessarily bad.</li>
            <li>I have been using Blissoma products for almost a year after falling in love with a small sample I received of their facial cleanser Fresh.</li>
            <li>The scent is so light that I don&#x27;t understand some of the other reviews about the odor.</li>
            <li>and I received a sample of the new version to try out.  </li>
            <li>We will periodically announce opportunities for a group of fans to test new or existing formulations.</li>
            <li>The product itself left my skin feeling fine but dry to the touch.</li>
            <li>I may just purchase a full size of this to use in the winter months or on days when I know I&#x27;m not really going to be outside much.  </li>
            <li>I may just purchase a full size of this to use in the winter months or on days when I know I&#x27;m not really going to be outside much.  </li>
            <li>It still has a scent--very natural and planty</li>
            <li>Aside from the consistency, I like knowing that this product is made with natural and good-for-my-skin ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and rubs in without feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>Well...as the title indicates, I was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>natural...</li>
            <li>It has that natural, herbal smell to it.  </li>
            <li>That fades but it doesn&#x27;t give you silky soft skin like some lotions</li>
            <li>For myself, I plan on sticking with Lift, the moisturizer in the mature line.</li>
            <li>After a week I barely notice it but for those who are sensitive, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving this four stars is because I really like my daytime moisturizers to have SPF in it.  </li>
            <li>But after putting it on, I barely even noticed it.</li>
            <li>Enter your complete Mailing Address information into the next screen so we will know where to mail your samples.</li>
            <li>The Peace cream has kind of a weird fragrance, but it&#x27;s been growing on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>Very soothing and definitely helps moisturizer my dry skin all day long.  </li>
            <li>super moisturizing)...I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s hard to describe.  </li>
            <li>It is much worse than simply a strong citrus smell.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild, and the lotion is quite thick.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that when I first opened it, the scent nearly knocked me over.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ll definitely come back and buy it with this kind of reasonable price.</li>
            <li> As I have to wear sunscreen and regularly wear make-up too, a light moisturizer for day is a must for me.</li>
            <li> I tried the re-formulated version so my moisturizer didn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li> When I got this I was immediately weary of the fact that it&#x27;s not so much a lotion consistency as it is a serum consistency.  </li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t think a liquidy moisturizer like this would be up to the task of moisturizing my skin.  </li>

            <li> I really need one</li>
            <li> First off, this was my first time trying any Blissoma product or a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away; my skin is soft and glowing without being overly oily.  </li>
            <li> fact that this does not have SPF in it was enough to make me decide not to buy this in full size.  </li>
            <li> This has taken a hefty toll on my facial skin and since I have been using this cream every day, I am starting to regain the healthy look that I had years ago.</li>
            <li> but I do enjoy the aroma therapy effect and the fresh feeling, not the cakey feeling that heavy lotions leave.</li>

            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving this four stars is because I really like my daytime moisturizers to have SPF in it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Blissoma Solutions products for over two years. All are formulated with the best ingredients and have wonderful natural scents.  Although I have fragrance sensitivities I never have problems with any of Blissoma Solutions products  I love Awake Morning Facial Moisturizer&#x27;s light lemony fragrance.  Thank you Julie for a great skincare product.</li>
            <li> So, I was sent a sample of this product to try it out. And I have to say, it is just ok in my opinion. It didn&#x27;t do amazing things for me.  First off, this was my first time trying any Blissoma product or a natural moisturizer. And let me just say, this is not like any other moisturizer that I have ever used before.   First off, it does have a fairly strong scent which made me nervous at first. I know I personally don&#x27;t care for any scented moisturizers on my face. But after putting it on, I barely even noticed it. I also did not try the previous formulation which is said to have had an even stronger scent. It should also be noted that it isn&#x27;t a bad smell. I actually really liked it but again, scented lotions for the face makes me leery.   The product itself left my skin feeling fine but dry to the touch. As in my face did not feel dry but when I touched with my fingers, it felt dry. It was a strange feeling but not necessarily bad. It made me feel like this product may be better off for people with oily skin as oppose to combination/normal.   I probably would not buy this product for myself mostly due to the fact that I wasn&#x27;t amazed by the product and therefore would not pay for it at it&#x27;s current price point. However, if you are really into trying organic skin care products or trying to convert to organic products, I&#x27;d recommend at least trying it.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Blissoma products, especially the rice cleanser.  The Awake Moisturizer is a nice lightweight moisturizer that leaves your skin soft and nourished.  It doesn&#x27;t feel oily, greasy or heavy like many moisturizers leave my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one previous gripe about this lotion was the smell and I received a sample of the new version to try out.  They&#x27;ve toned down the scent a lot without sacrificing the quality of the product.  It still has a scent--very natural and planty (check out the list of ingredients and you&#x27;ll know why)--that is very uplifting in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who would like a moisturizer that is light and works well.  Bonus for being organic.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and definitely helps moisturizer my dry skin all day long.  Great for pre mkleup application helping smooth out my skin!   Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the scent of the Awake moisturizer. It had a refreshing scent that smelled fresh, natural, and pleasant. The smell literally woke me up and put me in a good mood. This moisturizer had a very creamy and smooth texture that felt lightweight on my face. It also, brightened my complexion.  I have combination skin and after 2 weeks of using this  moisturizer left my skin feeling clean, fresh, and looking flaw-free. I didn&#x27;t have any complaints about this product. I would definitely consider purchasing this product and any other product by Blissoma. I would also recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best facial moisturizers I have used. Non irritating; pleasant smell and my skin is glowing! Love the fact that company lists all ingredients; and that they are natural. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have tried their cleanser and mask before and they were wonderful. I got an opportunity to try this moisturizer which is for normal to oily skin. I have used for about 3 weeks now and I have to say that this moisturizer is really too light for my skin type. However, I really like its algae-like texture and it absorbs to my skin quickly. I use it right after the toner as a serum. Then I apply something richer on top of it. This product has many good ingredients in it and it&#x27;s like supplying my skin the vitamins that needed. My skin looks so much smoother and I&#x27;ll definitely come back and buy it with this kind of reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I received a sample bottle of Awake and really enjoyed using it. The scent is not bad at all! It smells fresh and clean (which it is!) It absorbs quickly and provides a smooth base for makeup. Great for oily/combo skin. I need something more moisturizing for the winter, but I love how soothing it is on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For me, this product worked best as a day moisturizer. I have oily/combination skin and I love that this moisturizer absorbs completely into my skin. As I have to wear sunscreen and regularly wear make-up too, a light moisturizer for day is a must for me. I tried the re-formulated version so my moisturizer didn&#x27;t have much of a scent. Aside from the consistency, I like knowing that this product is made with natural and good-for-my-skin ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 weeks and it&#x27;s right in time for fall. It&#x27;s light weight but I don&#x27;t feel compelled to put a heavier moisturizer on afterwards. The smell is interesting but I like how it is woodsy and earthy. If you&#x27;re the flowery-perfume type, you may not enjoy this natural smell. What I love most about this product is that after I put it on my skin feels firm - not tight or aching for more moisture, but firm, like the ingredients are working their magic! In 4 weeks, I haven&#x27;t seen any big difference in my skin but I plan to continue to use it until the bottle is completely dry!</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin, and this moisturizer is light and non-irritating.  I love the brand, love the pure ingredients.  Their moisturizers are very light, so they&#x27;re great to use in the morning.  This one smells very bright and citrus-y.  To me it smells like vitamin c.  I personally like the Smooth A+ moisturizer a better, partly because it smells strongly like coriander and partly because it&#x27;s really calming on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a man and work long hours in the Florida sun. This has taken a hefty toll on my facial skin and since I have been using this cream every day, I am starting to regain the healthy look that I had years ago.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Everyone ahould buy thia product because who in this world is not stressed kids work family sometimes is overwhelming</li>
            <li> I love Awake Morning Facial Moisture. In the time I&#x27;ve had it, it&#x27;s evened out my skin tone a lot, I&#x27;m not nearly as red as the cold weather would like me to be. It&#x27;s not heavy and rubs in without feeling sticky. My only complaint is that when I first opened it, the scent nearly knocked me over. After a week I barely notice it but for those who are sensitive, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> As I approach my late 30&#x27;s I become more aware of my health more and more. When searching for a product for my face I came across this product and tried it out for a few weeks. I haven&#x27;t been using lotions or moisturizers long, so I don&#x27;t have a trained eye to notice any visual effects - but I do enjoy the aroma therapy effect and the fresh feeling, not the cakey feeling that heavy lotions leave. It&#x27;s definitely a product I enjoyed and will return to</li>
            <li> First off, I have normal/dry skin which tends to lean more towards dry during the colder months.  When I got this I was immediately weary of the fact that it&#x27;s not so much a lotion consistency as it is a serum consistency.  I got this in a sample size and it came with a dropper instead of a pump if that&#x27;s any indication to you of its consistency.  Like I said...I have drier skin and I really didn&#x27;t think a liquidy moisturizer like this would be up to the task of moisturizing my skin.  Well...as the title indicates, I was very pleasantly surprised.  This stuff is incredibly moisturizing.  I found myself reaching for this over my regular day moisturizer (Origins Brighter By Nature) because it&#x27;s much more moisturizing and my skin feels good when I wear this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is pea-soup green and smells...natural...the closest I can think of that&#x27;s mainstream would be Aveda products.  It has that natural, herbal smell to it.  When you rub it into your skin it initially becomes white before it blends into your skin...almost like it&#x27;s turning into a lotion.  Right after it&#x27;s rubbed into your skin it&#x27;s incredibly tacky.  That fades but it doesn&#x27;t give you silky soft skin like some lotions do...your skin just feels like skin...sort of dry (but your skin isn&#x27;t actually dry...like I said, super moisturizing)...I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s hard to describe.  Anyhow, my makeup applies beautifully over this and it keeps my skin feeling good all day.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of this as it&#x27;s a serum consistency so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving this four stars is because I really like my daytime moisturizers to have SPF in it.  Of course, a moisturizer is certainly not required to have SPF in it so it may be a bit unfair of me to take away one star for that but I do like SPF in my daytime moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this does not have SPF in it was enough to make me decide not to buy this in full size.  Well...that was my initial thought anyhow.  Now that I&#x27;ve used almost the whole sample I have to say...I REALLY like this moisturizer.  Definitely one of the better daytime moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.  I may just purchase a full size of this to use in the winter months or on days when I know I&#x27;m not really going to be outside much.  Will update this review if I do purchase full size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I was sent a sample of this by Blissoma for review purposes.

            <li> Pros: Lightweight, moisturizing, helps sooth irritated or acne prone skin, all natural, leaves absolutely no grease or residue on skin.     Cons: Terrible smell.     Over all thought of the brand/product. I adore Blissoma the Rice Cleanser (Been using it for 3 months) is a holy grail product that I cannot rave about enough! If your current skin care regime isn&#x27;t working I urge you to try this brand. Blissoma has transformed my acne prone skin.    However, while I can&#x27;t get over how fantastic the Rice cleaner is I do not like the Awake Morning Facial Moisturizer. The moisturizer does work exactly as claimed however the smell is unforgivable. It is much worse than simply a strong citrus smell. I honestly feel that it smells like a nasty indoor zoo exhibit. I will not purchase this product because of the scent, and I would advise you to be wary.    I received this product through Blissoma&#x27;s reviews program.

            <li> I have been using Blissoma products for almost a year after falling in love with a small sample I received of their facial cleanser Fresh. Since I&#x27;m over 50, I bought the whole line for mature skin and I have loved all of it. I keep adding other products from their line and have truly been thrilled with all of them. Upon receiving the sample of Awake, I started using it in my morning routine. It is super lightweight and completely absorbs into my skin almost immediately. The scent is so light that I don&#x27;t understand some of the other reviews about the odor. I think it is wonderful. All of Blissoma&#x27;s products are made with the highest quality ingredients (just read the list) and feels SO good on my skin. I think if you are younger and/or have oilier skin, Awake would be a great moisturizer for you. For myself, I plan on sticking with Lift, the moisturizer in the mature line. I think I need a little more nourishment and support as my skin ages but I highly recommend  any of the products from Blissoma. They are phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Wanting to use more natural skin care products, I switched to using all Blissoma products (cleanser, toner, moisturizer, mask) about six months ago.  I have combination skin and was concerned that using non-medicated products (without salicylic acid, etc.) would cause me to break out more.  On the contrary, my skin is smoother, brighter, and clearer than ever, and I know that I am using only the best ingredients on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the Awake Morning Facial Moisturizer a try for the past month.  The fragrance is mild, and the lotion is quite thick.  Despite the thickness, the lotion lives up to its claims that it absorbs quickly.  This product did not leave my skin shiny - even all day, no shine!  I liked this product quite a bit, but I like the Smooth A+ Moisture Serum *more* so I will probably switch back to that soon.  I also use the Peace Evening Facial Creme and love that too.  In fact, my skin has been better since I&#x27;ve been moisturizing both morning and night.  The Peace cream has kind of a weird fragrance, but it&#x27;s been growing on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Blissoma!  They have an amazing variety of products, and you&#x27;re bound to find some you like!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing!  I have combination skin and still have trouble with acne.  I have been on a quest to find a moisturizer becasue as I get older I really need one but everything makes me look oily and makes me break out. Then I tried Awake Morning Facial Moisturizer by Blissoma - I can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks!  I noticed a difference right away; my skin is soft and glowing without being overly oily.  I have been using it twice a day for about 10 days and I am so happy.  It has a fantastic scent and feels great when you put it on - really light and not greasy and it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.  I will definitely buy again and I am looking forward to trying the Blissoma cleanser next.</li>
