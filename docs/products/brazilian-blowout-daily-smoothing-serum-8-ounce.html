            <li>Love my Brazilian blowout and the products keep my hair looking shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Excellent prices, especially when compared to what salons charge!!!</li>
            <li>I have used this line for years and love it</li>
            <li>Love this product, helps subdue the frizzies.</li>
            <li>I just love this product, there nothing in the market to compare it to  I been doing hair for 28 years.</li>
            <li>Product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This by far is the best line I have found, it was a bit pricey to purchase all of the items, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>It was delivered fast and I loved the whole product!!!!</li>
            <li>For a good cheap hair product, this is the right choice.</li>
            <li>,, it&#x27;s better to use products without it to help to smooth and look of your hair.</li>
            <li>Smell is ok, but the shampoo doesn&#x27;t fully clean my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about a month, and still holding strong.  </li>
            <li>First time I use the product and is amazing</li>
            <li>My delivery was fast and I love the product!</li>
            <li>good prices and super fast delivery</li>
            <li>I tried sulfate free but it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>Great set especially if you have brazillian blowout done.  </li>
            <li>They work great and do make my treatments last longer.</li>
            <li>I needed a shampoo with no sulphates and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s light and and helps with the frizz as the blowout starts to come out.</li>
            <li>Love, love getting a Brazilian Blowout and these products are the best aftercare that helps the treatment lst as long as possible.</li>
            <li>i love how my hair feels with this products, and I love the fact that I had a brasilian blow out three months ago and thanks to this product my hair still looks like the first day!</li>
            <li>I have the original Brazilian Blowout and was advised to purchase their product line to maintain my treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally frizz free!! :-)</li>
            <li>But the shampoo and conditioner kind of hurt my scalp a little bit, which can&#x27;t be good.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, fast delivery, and the item met all requirements, truly outstanding.</li>
            <li>great for my dry hair</li>
            <li>Just as expected, great product</li>
            <li>To get that natural &amp;#34;no effort&amp;#34; nice curly tamed hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have super curly hair-tried a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>It is good, but you find alcohol I those products and if your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER !!!</li>
            <li>This set is really nice because you save money compared to the individual products.  </li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner are great products, and they really helped me keep my brazilian blowout much longer than expected!</li>
            <li>Thank you Maxine very much.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m not sure if it was the actual Brazilian Blowout Treatment that has made my hair so lovely, or if it is the shampoo, but I can certainly say I am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see what it does for me after the 12 weeks</li>
            <li>Love the product will definitely buy from this vendor again!</li>
            <li>First time I used it</li>
            <li>I havde tried many shampoos and confditioners that say they do what this product actually does!</li>
            <li>I have just ordered my second bottle of shampoo and conditioner because I love how my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li>My treatment is still intact thanks to this set !</li>
            <li>Overall I think this product is okay.</li>
            <li>My hair has most definitely improved.</li>
            <li>What I paid for the whole package is what I would have paid for in the salon for one bottle of shampoo!</li>
            <li>My first time using the serum.</li>
            <li>Other brands are more natural products and cheap it..</li>
            <li>I think I used too much</li>
            <li>Also it shipped fast and I will buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li>I have really frazzled hair and this helps make me presentable when I go to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair straight and shinier then ever.</li>
            <li>What I bought from beauty genesis was not the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>It was like gritty (like fine sand mixed in) and did not smell or feel the same as the authentic shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about you, but the reason I shop so much on Amazon is because I&#x27;m not home/available during normal store hours</li>
            <li>Better products for less.</li>
            <li>I have course, super curly hair that needs to be moisturized especially when chemically processed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It was reommended to me by a high end stylist.</li>
            <li>..love to use Brazilian Blowout on my hair as they are high quality and this set</li>
            <li>I Love the Brazilian Blowout Acai Hair Maintenance Set and after just a few uses I can feel the difference it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>but she has restored my faith that some places actually do the right thing.</li>
            <li>Leave your hair soft and shinny!</li>
            <li>My blow out did not last the full 3 months (only 2) .</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The product smells alright and does seem to make my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and has helped my dead ends</li>
            <li>Second time I used a small amount and much better results.</li>
            <li>It seems to work well, I don&#x27;t need to blow dry to make it straight which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>This product is superior for my heavy and thick hair.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>healthy &amp; Shiny!This product not only lives up to it&#x27;s name but the people behind it do also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very lightweight, keeps the frizz down, and my hair shines.</li>
            <li>I got a Brazilian blowout and bought the Brazilian Blowout products as I thought it would help prolong the effect of the chemical procedure, been using it for a few weeks but seems to have the same affect as any other shampoo that is sulfate free I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>

            <li> Well, I&#x27;m not sure if it was the actual Brazilian Blowout Treatment that has made my hair so lovely, or if it is the shampoo, but I can certainly say I am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be interested to see what it does for me after the 12 weeks</li>
            <li> Love the product will definitely buy from this vendor again!</li>
            <li> First time I used it</li>
            <li> I havde tried many shampoos and confditioners that say they do what this product actually does!</li>
            <li> I have just ordered my second bottle of shampoo and conditioner because I love how my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> My treatment is still intact thanks to this set !</li>
            <li> Overall I think this product is okay.</li>
            <li> My hair has most definitely improved.</li>
            <li> What I paid for the whole package is what I would have paid for in the salon for one bottle of shampoo!</li>
            <li> My first time using the serum.</li>
            <li> Other brands are more natural products and cheap it..</li>
            <li> I think I used too much</li>
            <li> Also it shipped fast and I will buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have really frazzled hair and this helps make me presentable when I go to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair straight and shinier then ever.</li>
            <li> What I bought from beauty genesis was not the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> It was like gritty (like fine sand mixed in) and did not smell or feel the same as the authentic shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but the reason I shop so much on Amazon is because I&#x27;m not home/available during normal store hours</li>
            <li> Better products for less.</li>
            <li> I have course, super curly hair that needs to be moisturized especially when chemically processed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It was reommended to me by a high end stylist.</li>
            <li> ..love to use Brazilian Blowout on my hair as they are high quality and this set</li>
            <li> I Love the Brazilian Blowout Acai Hair Maintenance Set and after just a few uses I can feel the difference it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> but she has restored my faith that some places actually do the right thing.</li>
            <li> Leave your hair soft and shinny!</li>
            <li> My blow out did not last the full 3 months (only 2) .</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The product smells alright and does seem to make my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and has helped my dead ends</li>
            <li> Second time I used a small amount and much better results.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well, I don&#x27;t need to blow dry to make it straight which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> This product is superior for my heavy and thick hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> healthy &amp; Shiny!This product not only lives up to it&#x27;s name but the people behind it do also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, keeps the frizz down, and my hair shines.</li>
            <li> I got a Brazilian blowout and bought the Brazilian Blowout products as I thought it would help prolong the effect of the chemical procedure, been using it for a few weeks but seems to have the same affect as any other shampoo that is sulfate free I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> Like how it takes me less time to blower dry it straight.</li>
            <li> To make the treatments last as long as possible I use their recommended products.  </li>
            <li> When this first happened I was going to just cut my loses and buy elsewhere</li>
            <li> I have wavy curly that looks dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li> I have used other &#x27;Brazilian&#x27; inspired&#x27; lines and all in one super expensive as seen on tv moisturizing cleansers</li>
            <li> Not as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have thick coarse long long hair.</li>
            <li> So I do have to add in a regular shampoo a few days a week to help that.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I started having extreme breakage.</li>
            <li> Not sure it helped make my Brazilian blow out last longer</li>
            <li> I originally bought them from the salon, and they too were very expensive.  </li>
            <li> The 3 products are suggested because you should deep condition at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Rub towards the end of your hair (ex ears down)</li>
            <li> and it made my hair sort of dull and flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the shampoo and conditioner with my previous blowouts, which work wells.</li>
            <li> but I felt like it made it too oily even with using a little (a pump size of a Nickle)</li>
            <li> The conditioner seemed to build up and leave my hair with a oily feeling after a few applications.</li>
            <li> This brazillian blowout  maked my hair very hard and dry.</li>
            <li> The product was not authentic.</li>
            <li> - I usually have oily reside still in my hair.</li>
            <li> Very heavy not like it was before.</li>
            <li> They are a miracle, but very expensive.  </li>
            <li> It bothered me so I wrote a review saying I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel dirty and nasty every time I washed it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m not sure if it was the actual Brazilian Blowout Treatment that has made my hair so lovely, or if it is the shampoo, but I can certainly say I am happy with the results.  If anything the shampoo has done its intended job to hold the Blowout in my hair.  It&#x27;s been about a month, and still holding strong.  Very happy with the product so far.  I&#x27;ll be interested to see what it does for me after the 12 weeks the treatment is supposed to last.  If it continues to make my hair actually non frizzy I&#x27;ll be a REALLY happy camper then!</li>
            <li> These products help a lot with my curly hair.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product !  Great price !&lt;br /&gt;VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SELLER !!!</li>
            <li> It is perfect.  Does just what I need.</li>
            <li> Makes my already oily hair more greasy.</li>
            <li> Love the product will definitely buy from this vendor again!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way. First time I used it I think I used too much and it made my hair sort of dull and flat. Second time I used a small amount and much better results.</li>
            <li> The product was not authentic. It was like gritty (like fine sand mixed in) and did not smell or feel the same as the authentic shampoo and conditioner. Ruined my blowout and hair!! I started having extreme breakage. DO NOT BUY!!!!! It doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair and it gets frizzy when its humid or rainy, UGH!!! I havde tried many shampoos and confditioners that say they do what this product actually does! I have just ordered my second bottle of shampoo and conditioner because I love how my hair looks and feels.This shampoo makes my hair look shinny and healthy!! Love it</li>
            <li> My treatment is still intact thanks to this set ! Will always reorder and especially from that seller</li>
            <li> Not as expected.  Better products for less.</li>
            <li> This brazillian blowout  maked my hair very hard and dry.</li>
            <li> Like how it takes me less time to blower dry it straight.</li>
            <li> It was reommended to me by a high end stylist. I thought I would like the effect it has on my hair but I felt like it made it too oily even with using a little (a pump size of a Nickle) I do have super curly hair-tried a keratin treatment. Overall I think this product is okay. I will try others. To get that natural &amp;#34;no effort&amp;#34; nice curly tamed hair.&lt;br /&gt;A tip for those who buy this product do not rub In conditioner into the scalp. Rub towards the end of your hair (ex ears down) it&#x27;ll help with an &amp;#34;oily look&amp;#34; shampoo is okay to rub in. Not fond of the smell it leaves.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel dirty and nasty every time I washed it. Felt like shampoo wouldn&#x27;t wash out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Leave your hair soft and shinny!</li>
            <li> It is good, but you find alcohol I those products and if your hair is dry.,, it&#x27;s better to use products without it to help to smooth and look of your hair. I am using them but I don&#x27;t buy it again. Other brands are more natural products and cheap it..</li>
            <li> Love all 3 products, especially love the serum. It makes my hair so soft and shiny. You will like the products too</li>
            <li> Okay, as a redhead with natural curly hair that can get frizzy, these 3 products are wonderful! I DO NOT HAVE A BRAZILIAN BLOWOUT - but use these products. My salon gave me the Serum to try. I brought it home and after using the Pro Babyliss, my hair looked better than when my salon blew it out! I love the fact that in using these 3 products together, I have NO FRIZZ - and don&#x27;t even need to use hairspray!</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse long long hair. I had an brazillian blow out and it was recommended I use these products. My blow out is fading but these products still help to get the semiclose results that my hair was at with the treatment. My blow out did not last the full 3 months (only 2) . These products were suppose to help maintain it for an extra month that did not happen. That being said I love the products they smell great and work amazingly well with my hair type. Also it shipped fast and I will buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I like the products, but the shampoo texture I was not to happy with.  It seems to work well, I don&#x27;t need to blow dry to make it straight which is a plus.  I gave it 3 stars because the scent could be better, I would like to have the scent last on my hair longer as well.</li>
            <li> The wife loves it, so I love it.</li>
            <li> if you can&#x27;t this treatment, just using the products does wonders!</li>
            <li> Great hair products for Brazilian Blowouts.</li>
            <li> i recomend these products! after washing my hair looks as if it had gone to the beauty salon. smells good.</li>
            <li> Love, love getting a Brazilian Blowout and these products are the best aftercare that helps the treatment lst as long as possible. Truly a god send</li>
            <li> It was delivered fast and I loved the whole product!!!!</li>
            <li> Great value. Saved a lot of $$ by buying the combo!!</li>
            <li> They are the only products you should use if you get a Brazilian Blowout. I tried sulfate free but it doesn&#x27;t work as well. The 3 products are suggested because you should deep condition at least once a week. It makes the Brazilian Blowout last longer.</li>
            <li> Good product and at a price that beats the hair salons! My girlfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for blowout hair, use sparingly and it will work its best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great vendor to work with as well.</li>
            <li> Since i star using it my hair is so different im so glad to have this product! Now my hair is shine and have no frizz</li>
            <li> This maintenance set is a great deal ..love to use Brazilian Blowout on my hair as they are high quality and this set&lt;br /&gt;Is everything I needed</li>
            <li> I have the original Brazilian Blowout and was advised to purchase their product line to maintain my treatment. I am really impressed with this product line. I have course, super curly hair that needs to be moisturized especially when chemically processed. This line cleanses and moisturizes.For me moisture is important, My hair feels amazing!! I have the shampoo, conditioner, masque, anti-frizz leave-in, straightening balm, and dry-oil. I have used other &#x27;Brazilian&#x27; inspired&#x27; lines and all in one super expensive as seen on tv moisturizing cleansers but you can&#x27;t use all of those with the Brazilian process as it strips out the straighter or doesn&#x27;t fully moisturize. This by far is the best line I have found, it was a bit pricey to purchase all of the items, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> If you have a Brazilian blow out this shampoo and conditioner is great for keeping the frizzes away. The smoothing cream is an added bonus!!</li>
            <li> Great set especially if you have brazillian blowout done.  This set makes it last longer. I just wished it came in bigger size bottles so  I didn&#x27;t have to order it so often.</li>
            <li> I love this product, all 3 of them. I do the Brazilian blowout treatment at the salon for my hair, so this works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> For a good cheap hair product, this is the right choice. It was cheap, fast delivery, and the item met all requirements, truly outstanding.</li>
            <li> If you only knew what my hair was like before I had this done you would understand how great this product is.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, excellent quality!!</li>
            <li> My hair has most definitely improved. It&#x27;s totally frizz free!! :-) Thank you Brazilian Blowout. I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I think this adds to the life of your Brazilian blowout. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite shampoo/conditioner though. Smell is ok, but the shampoo doesn&#x27;t fully clean my hair - I usually have oily reside still in my hair. So I do have to add in a regular shampoo a few days a week to help that. That is my biggest con with this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived damaged - the lid was cracked so I cannot close the shampoo bottle.</li>
            <li> I have had the Brazilian blowout treatments for several years now.  They are a miracle, but very expensive.  To make the treatments last as long as possible I use their recommended products.  I originally bought them from the salon, and they too were very expensive.  Once I found them for sale on Amazon I have been purchasing them on-line ever since.  They work great and do make my treatments last longer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and arrived on time</li>
            <li> I got a Brazilian blowout done and was advised to buy these products. Although they don&#x27;t smell great, they did keep my hair lusciously hydrated and frizz free. Its not that it smells bad,not just doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product I loved it will be planning to order it again works well with the Brazilian Blowout</li>
            <li> After having the Brazilian blowout you need to use the shampoo and conditioner.  They are very good for your hair, just like silk..</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner are great products, and they really helped me keep my brazilian blowout much longer than expected!</li>
            <li> Just as expected, great product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell. Didn&#x27;t like the product feel.</li>
            <li> This set is really nice because you save money compared to the individual products.  I have really frazzled hair and this helps make me presentable when I go to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the product, this is an excellent way to buy it!</li>
            <li> good prices and super fast delivery</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> This set was great!!!! I&#x27;m going to defiantly but from them again!</li>
            <li> The product smells alright and does seem to make my hair soft. I especially love the serum. But the shampoo and conditioner kind of hurt my scalp a little bit, which can&#x27;t be good. Also, I had to go pick up the package at the actual post office because they would not deliver without me being there to sign for it. I don&#x27;t know about you, but the reason I shop so much on Amazon is because I&#x27;m not home/available during normal store hours, hence, I can&#x27;t wait around for a package to be delivered either. Totally defeated the purpose of 2 day delivery!</li>
            <li> Love this product. My hair straight and shinier then ever.</li>
            <li> OMG.. First time I use the product and is amazing my hair never looked this beautiful, I LOVE it..soft and shinier. I will never change this product, I had tryed Wen is good but  never like Barazilian Blowout. Amazing how sof and healthy my hair looks. The Shipping was very fast, I am happy with the seller. 100% I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel great!</li>
            <li> My delivery was fast and I love the product!</li>
            <li> I love this . They deliver on time .</li>
            <li> I have wavy curly that looks dry and damaged.  This product makes it look healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li> Product is pretty good. I needed a shampoo with no sulphates and this fit the bill. The conditioner seemed to build up and leave my hair with a oily feeling after a few applications. I needed to use a diferent condtioner about every 3 or 4 washes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price. What I paid for the whole package is what I would have paid for in the salon for one bottle of shampoo! it smells great and makes my hair feel awesome.</li>
            <li> Great valu&amp;eacute; pack</li>
            <li> Great product.  Maintains your hair treatment longer</li>
            <li> luv luv luv the products. The value is very good compared to what I pay the hair dresser for these products.</li>
            <li> I Love this product! Recently however, I had an issue with how it was packaged. It bothered me so I wrote a review saying I was disappointed. A women named Maxine contacted me and asked if she could fix this issue and that she did. When this first happened I was going to just cut my loses and buy elsewhere but she has restored my faith that some places actually do the right thing. Thank you Maxine very much. I Love the Brazilian Blowout Acai Hair Maintenance Set and after just a few uses I can feel the difference it makes my hair feel healthy &amp; Shiny!This product not only lives up to it&#x27;s name but the people behind it do also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I always ordered Brazilian Blowout products and decided to switch to give Wen a try and (in my opinion) it did not compare to Brazilian Blowout. I will be ordering this again from Beauty Genesis!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for being Great Sales Reps!</li>
            <li> This product is superior for my heavy and thick hair. Very lightweight, keeps the frizz down, and my hair shines.</li>
            <li> i love how my hair feels with this products, and I love the fact that I had a brasilian blow out three months ago and thanks to this product my hair still looks like the first day!</li>
            <li> Love the product. Delivered in 2 days!</li>
            <li> great for my dry hair</li>
            <li> It smells good. Not sure it helped make my Brazilian blow out last longer .But could be I should&#x27;ve had a blow out sooner .</li>
            <li> Excellent product and well worth the money.  Awesome service from the vendor.</li>
            <li> Love my Brazilian blowout and the products keep my hair looking shiny and manageable.  Excellent products and reasonable price.!</li>
            <li> Love these hair products! Excellent prices, especially when compared to what salons charge!!!</li>
            <li> What I bought from beauty genesis was not the real stuff. I have used this line for years and love it but the stuff I bought here broke my hair!  I compared these bottles to what I bought at the salon and the texture and smell were both different. Beware who you buy this from!!!</li>
            <li> Great product line to enhance my Brazilian Blowout Treatment.</li>
            <li> Great price. Great product. Great shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, helps subdue the frizzies.</li>
            <li> Just as described, great price for all 3 items. I&#x27;ve used both the shampoo and conditioner with my previous blowouts, which work wells. My first time using the serum. I really like it; it&#x27;s light and and helps with the frizz as the blowout starts to come out. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I got a Brazilian blowout and bought the Brazilian Blowout products as I thought it would help prolong the effect of the chemical procedure, been using it for a few weeks but seems to have the same affect as any other shampoo that is sulfate free I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the same product from the salon. Very heavy not like it was before.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with the products.  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> These products work great for maintaining a true Brazilian Blowout treatment!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and has helped my dead ends</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anybody I love it great product makes your hair look wonderful</li>
            <li> I just love this product, there nothing in the market to compare it to  I been doing hair for 28 years.</li>
            <li> A great deal on the basics! Quality is great, shipping time is fast!</li>
