            <li>My hair is curly and it needs to be conditioned in order to look good, but it seems like it is drying out.</li>

            <li>I am SO glad I did too!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I find that when I use this and keep heat styling to a minimum, I can go up to 4 months without needing a trim for split ends which is amazing for me.</li>
            <li>stuff is amazing.</li>

            <li>Love Joico K-pak.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels silky smooth and amazing.  </li>
            <li>Love it, will order again.</li>
            <li>So glad you asked, Some one diluted the content to a watery substance.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better for making your hair fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love Joico K-Pak Recunstruct.</li>
            <li>I used this product as instructed and within a month my hair was looking so much more healthy.</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful turn around.</li>
            <li>She swears by this stuff (too many years of highlights)</li>
            <li>However, as far as performance, this shampoo/conditioner combo absolutely delivers and I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s on a quest for beautiful, healthy hair!</li>
            <li>I have wavy/curly hair that dries out at the ends easily.  </li>
            <li>It is really easy to use and works wonders.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and prone to breakage</li>
            <li>I have fine, dry, breakage prone hair and this conditioner is great at keeping it healthy.</li>
            <li>If you use this product alone, it will smooth but not moisturize.     </li>
            <li>Then, when I used it on my hair, it was confirmed.  </li>
            <li>but it seems genuine.</li>
            <li>I was excited that I found this product and at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Gigantic size, lasts a long time, works great on colored hair.</li>
            <li>I first found it through a salon I&#x27;ve used, but this is a much better price.</li>
            <li>The Joico conditioner has literally saved my hair from frying to a crisp many times.</li>
            <li>Yes this shampoo &amp; conditioner clean &amp; condition my hair, but not as well as the stuff I get from the salon.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR FAST SERVICE AND GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Best conditioner, least stinky keratin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many conditioners, masques, etc to help my very dry&lt;br /&gt;and over processed hair.  </li>
            <li>This particular conditioner seems to work best if it is allowed to soak into the hair - adding more as needed  - for at least 5-10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Great product to make your hair feel alive and not dead on the head.</li>
            <li>I love this product but will most likely just</li>
            <li>Three of us have thigh length hair or longer and our hair varies from straight and fine to mid-weight and curly.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>and this size is economical, too.</li>
            <li>but it is well worth it</li>
            <li>Than you know your getting the right product.</li>
            <li>I went one wash with just a regular shampoo and conditioner, no K-pak conditioner.....and let me tell you, my hair let me know right away that it needs K-Pak!!!    </li>
            <li>After using this, my hair is noticeably shinier, softer, smoother, fuller, more manageable, and just generally healthier looking.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other conditioners that sit on top of the hair, this one actually is absorbed as it soaks.  </li>
            <li>I started using it a couple of years ago and after the first couple washing I couldn&#x27;t believe how much stronger and healthier my hair was, and much shinier.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really smell much of a scent from it</li>
            <li>When using the real Joico product, this is not the case.  </li>
            <li>I dont like this conditioner as much as \\&quot;moisture recovery\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Using this stuff It has changed my hair so much.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t go back to the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>None of them did much of anything.  </li>
            <li>I did follow the instructions not to use too much of the conditioner as that is what really help your hair.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this exact Joico conditioner several times in the salon, and it is amazing, it works wonders on my dry and damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>After trying multiple products on the market, we found that the Joico (along with Biolage balm) works extremely well - leaving our hair truly conditioned and fairly tangle-free.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the banana coconut kind of smell that the real Kpak has when I&#x27;ve used it from salons in the past.</li>
            <li>The price is unbelievable for the amazing conditioner you get.</li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner are a little bit more moisturizing than what I&#x27;m used to using, but this hasn&#x27;t been an issue really.  </li>
            <li>Real Joico is creamy (it definitely does not run) and it has a distinct, banana-like smell with perhaps a hint of coconut (??).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; conditioner I would really recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li>However, when I bought this &amp;#34;so called&amp;#34; Joico condition from this Amazon vendor, I noticed right away that the smell and consistency is totally different from the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Breaking, drying, those little sproingy stick-like hairs that stick out of the side of your head that make you look like Albert Einstein&#x27;s lost love child?</li>
            <li>It is milky and not thick.</li>
            <li>I cringe to spend money on shampoo and conditioner, but the K-Pak is utterly and absolutely worth it in every way and you notice the results immediately.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser even pointed out new growth of hairs that were probably damaged by bleach.  </li>
            <li>The product contained in these bottles is fairly runny with an odd chunky texture, a different scent, and does not produce the same results.</li>
            <li>It says it right on the bottle, It can only be guaranteed if bought from a professional...</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo and conditioner for the first time on a whim, when I snagged some trial sizes at a local store.  </li>
            <li>i have used these products in the past and the reuslts should have been better.</li>
            <li>My first purchase was the smaller 10.1oz bottle.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I wasted my money on half a bottle instead of a full bottle.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve bleached your hair, then you know how hard it is to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>It definitely has not worked on my hair the way the real stuff does.  </li>
            <li>Although our hair is long, none of us have split-ends which is unusual for me as I used to get them years ago when I used other conditioners which prevented me from being able to grow my hair long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now branching out to their other products and haven&#x27;t found one that wasn&#x27;t worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this was a fake product.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because it&#x27;s more expensive than I&#x27;d like, and I&#x27;m not particularly crazy about the scent (it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, but I personally don&#x27;t think it smells great either).  </li>
            <li>My hair was damaged from all the coloring I had done, it was dry with split ends, the whole works.</li>
            <li>and I lost all that great elasticity and it started breaking badly again.</li>
            <li>I have long professionally colored and naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I could barely comb my hair after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>It was apparently an off brand that they pumped into a joico bottle.</li>
            <li>My hair is long (2 to 3 inches past my shoulders), fine, pin-straight, and tends to be on the oilier side.  </li>
            <li>my long hair is still soft &amp; shiney, no frizz.</li>
            <li>In between times of using the Joico K-Pak Revitaluxe Bio-Advanced Restorative Treatment, this Conditioner is the prefect product to condition my fine, thin hair.</li>

            <li> In between times of using the Joico K-Pak Revitaluxe Bio-Advanced Restorative Treatment, this Conditioner is the prefect product to condition my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped seal in conditioner and tame my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that moisturizes my dry, curly hair and restores the damage caused by a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate so run a little of this through my hair every time I shower instead of shampoo in order to protect it and not strip my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products that are more expensive but do not compare.</li>
            <li> You put in on your hair and it&#x27;s like the hair soaks it all in and becomes instantly soft and pliant in the shower just a few seconds after application.</li>
            <li> The REAL K-pak is thick, luxurious and smells like bananas.</li>
            <li> The real Joico K-pak smells like bananas, this one smelled slightly floral with a little hint of coconut.  </li>
            <li> This is a FAKE version of the real Joico product!!!  </li>
            <li> I have never found any other conditioner that comes close to doing what the Joico stuff does for my blonde treated hair.</li>
            <li> I am trying to go away from products that have cones in them as they dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dry &amp; has been breaking/splitting compared to when I use the salon purchased joico.</li>
            <li> hair does not look or feel dry or damaged anymore.  </li>
            <li> I use this K-Pak reconstruct conditioner product AFTER a deep conditioner (like Aussie 3min miracle) and it smoothes everything down.</li>
            <li> Shame on Warehouse Deals for Less for lying and charging good money for a product that is fake!!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because my mom ordered this same item and received the real product, while I ordered it several months later and received this cheap fake stuff.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t condition hair very well at all and is a thin consistency.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement - can&#x27;t speak for other hair types.</li>
            <li> and the result was the same if not better.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Joico before with amazon, and received the real product, but this time it was a fake.  </li>
            <li> Usually I sit under the dryer, but this time I just let it dry overnight  </li>
            <li> Many negative reviews on this site mention that this conditioner is runny or smells like it has gone bad.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self, but when it was shipped to me half of the bottle spilled out into the box</li>
            <li> I have ordered from amazon countless times, this was the first time i was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It can become a frizzy mess in summer humidity, but this product has helped make it manageable.</li>
            <li> (my hair is very long, thick, and wavy).</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to</li>
            <li> After a few uses, my hair became so manageable</li>
            <li> First time I was disappointed when order through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It has been around a long time, and when I was in the hairdressing world, it was quite expensive.</li>
            <li> it made my hair really hard</li>
            <li> at LEAST buy it from AMAZON themselves.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was thin and runny instead of being thick.  </li>
            <li> My hair has a tendency to break badly and I loose a lot of hair when washing and combing and what Reconstruct has done is make my hair elastic.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> The pump was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> Thin and runny...made my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> Tight curls and frizzy and nappy in the front and base.</li>
            <li> I think I got a fake.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product.  </li>
            <li> This product is fake.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Joico!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I used to lose handfulls which was very depressing.  </li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this but every time I use it, I&#x27;m stuck with horrible knots in my hair.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Wife loves her conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this Joico  conditioner product. It has been around a long time, and when I was in the hairdressing world, it was quite expensive. Still the same product, and a generous amount. Leaves your hair beautiful.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner, least stinky keratin.  Color therapy one is NOT even close to as good.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this but every time I use it, I&#x27;m stuck with horrible knots in my hair. The knots are so mangled I often have to cut them out. I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair..hope this helps!</li>
            <li> still trying the prodeuct</li>
            <li> Gigantic size, lasts a long time, works great on colored hair. Have been using this for 5 years &amp; even pushing 60 my long hair is still soft &amp; shiney, no frizz. Well worth it and this size is economical, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this was a fake product.  It doesn&#x27;t have the banana coconut kind of smell that the real Kpak has when I&#x27;ve used it from salons in the past. It doesn&#x27;t condition hair very well at all and is a thin consistency.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year at the recommendation of my stylist.  I have wavy/curly hair that dries out at the ends easily.  I have not had an issue since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo and conditioner for the first time on a whim, when I snagged some trial sizes at a local store.  I am SO glad I did too!  My hair is long (2 to 3 inches past my shoulders), fine, pin-straight, and tends to be on the oilier side.  It also breaks and falls out quite a bit.  I&#x27;ve been trying to make my hair stronger and healthier, so I thought I&#x27;d try this line.  And it works!  Both the shampoo and conditioner are a little bit more moisturizing than what I&#x27;m used to using, but this hasn&#x27;t been an issue really.  After using this, my hair is noticeably shinier, softer, smoother, fuller, more manageable, and just generally healthier looking.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because it&#x27;s more expensive than I&#x27;d like, and I&#x27;m not particularly crazy about the scent (it doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, but I personally don&#x27;t think it smells great either).  However, as far as performance, this shampoo/conditioner combo absolutely delivers and I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s on a quest for beautiful, healthy hair!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner</li>
            <li> I am trying to go away from products that have cones in them as they dry out my hair. It was beginning to feel like straw. This product has really helped seal in conditioner and tame my hair. I have long professionally colored and naturally wavy hair. It can become a frizzy mess in summer humidity, but this product has helped make it manageable. I use this K-Pak reconstruct conditioner product AFTER a deep conditioner (like Aussie 3min miracle) and it smoothes everything down. If you use this product alone, it will smooth but not moisturize.     After a few uses, my hair became so manageable I thought I didn&#x27;t need it. I went one wash with just a regular shampoo and conditioner, no K-pak conditioner.....and let me tell you, my hair let me know right away that it needs K-Pak!!!    Think of this product as a sealant. It seals in whatever you put on before it. It is milky and not thick. I don&#x27;t really smell much of a scent from it and I have the nose of a bloodhound. It is really easy to use and works wonders. I am sold on K-Pak and will continue to purchase it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the product it&#x27;s self, but when it was shipped to me half of the bottle spilled out into the box so I&#x27;m glad I wasted my money on half a bottle instead of a full bottle.</li>
            <li> Love Joico K-pak.  Keeps my hair soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that moisturizes my dry, curly hair and restores the damage caused by a flat iron. Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I live in a dry climate so run a little of this through my hair every time I shower instead of shampoo in order to protect it and not strip my hair.  My hair is fine and prone to breakage and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement - can&#x27;t speak for other hair types.</li>
            <li> Yes this shampoo &amp; conditioner clean &amp; condition my hair, but not as well as the stuff I get from the salon. Upon review of the bottles I received, I found that they claim to be distributed and manufactured in the EU not manufactured in the US like the stuff from the salon.  My hair has been dry &amp; has been breaking/splitting compared to when I use the salon purchased joico.</li>
            <li> This is a FAKE version of the real Joico product!!!  This Amazon Vendor, &amp;#34;Warehouse Deals for Less&amp;#34;, is a hoax.  I have purchased this exact Joico conditioner several times in the salon, and it is amazing, it works wonders on my dry and damaged hair.  However, when I bought this &amp;#34;so called&amp;#34; Joico condition from this Amazon vendor, I noticed right away that the smell and consistency is totally different from the real thing.  Then, when I used it on my hair, it was confirmed.  I could barely comb my hair after getting out of the shower.  When using the real Joico product, this is not the case.  My hair feels silky smooth and amazing.  Not with this knock off version.  Shame on Warehouse Deals for Less for lying and charging good money for a product that is fake!!</li>
            <li> Great product to make your hair feel alive and not dead on the head. My hair felt like straw before I used this product.</li>
            <li> Got conditioner and its not at all like the last conditioner I bought in store. Same brand and same style, color care. Smell and consistancy is totally different. Not happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a wonderful value.  I have used other products that are more expensive but do not compare.</li>
            <li> I think I got a fake. Doesn&#x27;t look, smell, or work the same way. DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> This is one of only (2) conditioners that we use regularly in our household.  Three of us have thigh length hair or longer and our hair varies from straight and fine to mid-weight and curly.  After trying multiple products on the market, we found that the Joico (along with Biolage balm) works extremely well - leaving our hair truly conditioned and fairly tangle-free.  We still need to follow up with a Joico&#x27;s de-tangler, though.  This particular conditioner seems to work best if it is allowed to soak into the hair - adding more as needed  - for at least 5-10 minutes.  Unlike other conditioners that sit on top of the hair, this one actually is absorbed as it soaks.  Although our hair is long, none of us have split-ends which is unusual for me as I used to get them years ago when I used other conditioners which prevented me from being able to grow my hair long.  Many negative reviews on this site mention that this conditioner is runny or smells like it has gone bad.  Real Joico is creamy (it definitely does not run) and it has a distinct, banana-like smell with perhaps a hint of coconut (??).</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  It leaves your hair soft and smooth.  I just used it last night and rolled my hair.  Usually I sit under the dryer, but this time I just let it dry overnight  and the result was the same if not better. My hair just flowed out of the rollers.</li>
            <li> The pump was broken when I got it. I love this product but will most likely just but it at the mall because then I will know that the pump actually works.</li>
            <li> The best condition ever!  My hair was so damaged by bleaching and i finally decided to let it grow out.  I swear this stuff helped and I am literally only losing 1-3 pieces of hair A DAY!  No joke.  I used to lose handfulls which was very depressing.  My hairdresser even pointed out new growth of hairs that were probably damaged by bleach.  2 things helped me get my hair back:  1) STOP bleaching it blonde 2) Use Joico products!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I first found it through a salon I&#x27;ve used, but this is a much better price. We use it for my super-curly daughter, my super-straight haired daughter, and myself, with waist-length wave. It works for all of us.</li>
            <li> I have used joico for quite a while now and I have never had any complaints about this product. As a matter of fact Joico is the greatest hair product I have ever used. I dont like this conditioner as much as \\&quot;moisture recovery\\&quot;. My hair is curly and it needs to be conditioned in order to look good, but it seems like it is drying out. It says it right on the bottle, It can only be guaranteed if bought from a professional... at LEAST buy it from AMAZON themselves. Than you know your getting the right product.</li>
            <li> I have fine, dry, breakage prone hair and this conditioner is great at keeping it healthy. I find that when I use this and keep heat styling to a minimum, I can go up to 4 months without needing a trim for split ends which is amazing for me. If you look at my hair sideways the ends split. To me, it smells like pineapple which I like, but isn&#x27;t overpowering and goes away as soon as you rinse it out. If you&#x27;re looking for a more \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; conditioner I would really recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT I WILL BUY AGAIN. THANKS FOR FAST SERVICE AND GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve bleached your hair, then you know how hard it is to keep it healthy. Breaking, drying, those little sproingy stick-like hairs that stick out of the side of your head that make you look like Albert Einstein&#x27;s lost love child? No? Just me? Anyhoo . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. You put in on your hair and it&#x27;s like the hair soaks it all in and becomes instantly soft and pliant in the shower just a few seconds after application. The Joico conditioner has literally saved my hair from frying to a crisp many times. It is a godsend. I have never found any other conditioner that comes close to doing what the Joico stuff does for my blonde treated hair. It&#x27;s known within my circle of friends (one who is a hairdresser) that if you&#x27;ve got blonde hair, you need to use the K-Pak and it&#x27;s not optional. I cringe to spend money on shampoo and conditioner, but the K-Pak is utterly and absolutely worth it in every way and you notice the results immediately.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time  I like the product</li>
            <li> Heard about Joico on the Dr. OZ show and decided to give it a try.  It made SUCH a difference in my hair!!  I&#x27;m now branching out to their other products and haven&#x27;t found one that wasn&#x27;t worth every penny.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I have ordered from amazon countless times, this was the first time i was disappointed.  I have ordered Joico before with amazon, and received the real product, but this time it was a fake.  The real Joico K-pak smells like bananas, this one smelled slightly floral with a little hint of coconut.  The conditioner was thin and runny instead of being thick.  Beware of ordering online..</li>
            <li> Love it, will order again.</li>
            <li> I agree with lots of others on here.  First time I was disappointed when order through Amazon.  This is a fake product.  It definitely has not worked on my hair the way the real stuff does.  Thin and runny...made my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product is fake. The company distributing this item is not the actual company, Joico. I have had trouble finding this product recently, since even salons can&#x27;t seem to get the real product. The REAL K-pak is thick, luxurious and smells like bananas. It&#x27;s an incredible product which works better on my hair than anything else I&#x27;ve tried (my hair is very long, thick, and wavy). The product contained in these bottles is fairly runny with an odd chunky texture, a different scent, and does not produce the same results. I am disappointed because my mom ordered this same item and received the real product, while I ordered it several months later and received this cheap fake stuff.</li>
            <li> So glad you asked, Some one diluted the content to a watery substance. WHY would you do that.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my hair for years. There is nothing better for making your hair fabulous! You can&#x27;t go wrong with Joico!</li>
            <li> In between times of using the Joico K-Pak Revitaluxe Bio-Advanced Restorative Treatment, this Conditioner is the prefect product to condition my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I love Joico K-Pak Recunstruct. I didn&#x27;t find any difference with this product and the one I purchased from a beauty supply shop. I was scared to order online but it seems genuine. Using this stuff It has changed my hair so much. I started using it a couple of years ago and after the first couple washing I couldn&#x27;t believe how much stronger and healthier my hair was, and much shinier. My hair has a tendency to break badly and I loose a lot of hair when washing and combing and what Reconstruct has done is make my hair elastic. It is actually stretchy if I pull on the strands and can stretch quite a bit before breaking.  I use the Reconstruct shampoo, Reconstruct conditioner and reconstructor. It does take a little getting used to but it is well worth it and I can&#x27;t go back to the cheap stuff. I did try the Joico Moisturizing in the blueish bottle and my hair didn&#x27;t like it at all and I lost all that great elasticity and it started breaking badly again. I am mixed for ethnic ladies who may be wondering. Tight curls and frizzy and nappy in the front and base.</li>
            <li> i think this product was expired. it made my hair really hard and i had to throw it away. i have used these products in the past and the reuslts should have been better.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many conditioners, masques, etc to help my very dry&lt;br /&gt;and over processed hair.  None of them did much of anything.  I was&lt;br /&gt;turned onto this product by my Sister and have never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;My hair does not look or feel dry or damaged anymore.  Try it, you&lt;br /&gt;won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I saw this product being recommended on a you tube video so I decided to try it. My first purchase was the smaller 10.1oz bottle. My hair was damaged from all the coloring I had done, it was dry with split ends, the whole works. I used this product as instructed and within a month my hair was looking so much more healthy. My husband couldn&#x27;t believe it. He says it&#x27;s like drugs but for your hair. Such a wonderful turn around. I did follow the instructions not to use too much of the conditioner as that is what really help your hair. I purchased this bigger bottle and it has lasted for a while now. I use this along with the argon oil treatment or coconut oil and it&#x27;s a blessing. It all works so well together and my hair is shiny, smooth, healthy and smells great.</li>
            <li> I was excited that I found this product and at such a great price. When I recieved the product and starting using it I realized that this was in fact NOT the joico reconstruct conditioner!!! It was apparently an off brand that they pumped into a joico bottle. DO NOT PURCHASE from this supplier!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife.  This will last her a few months and is much cheaper than buying retail or in smaller bottles.  She swears by this stuff (too many years of highlights) so I give it 5 stars for product and value.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser turned me on to this stuff, couldn&#x27;t imagine life without it. It&#x27;s amazing! My curls have never been softer. The price is unbelievable for the amazing conditioner you get. This bottle lasts me about 3-4 months, washing my hair once a week.</li>
