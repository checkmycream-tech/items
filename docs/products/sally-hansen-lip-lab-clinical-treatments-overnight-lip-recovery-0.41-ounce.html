            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>This is not greasy and seems to absorb nicely.</li>
            <li>As effective as claimed.</li>
            <li>I liked its thicker texture but not greasy.</li>
            <li>In any case, certainly worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>I feel it is fairly pricey but worth the cost!</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>ordering more.</li>
            <li>u will not find better one</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and feel it does a fabulous job of softening my lips!  </li>
            <li>and he couldn&#x27;t stop kissing them, so I had to make sure he was done kissing me for the night before I applied it...</li>
            <li>, I know :) I would recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I love the creaminess of this lip recovery.</li>
            <li>I might have to look around for a better option.</li>
            <li>It is also not greasy and it very easily glides on and is easy to rub into your lips.</li>
            <li>I found it here on Amazon and was so excited!  </li>
            <li>This product smells fine and keeps your lips moist.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff for getting your lips back into shape.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>However, when I use this product, it heals without scabbing and leaves your lips silky smooth, literally overnight.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and stays put well overnight.</li>
            <li>After using Sally Hanson Overnight Lip Recovery the first night, You actually wake up with lovely soft moisturized lips, I use it at night just before getting into bed (best time)</li>
            <li>Before this time buying on Amazon, I got mine at the local Walgreen and pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>I\\&quot;ve tried several nightly lip therapy products since the one I loved was discontinued.</li>
            <li>i love this so much and it has lasted me literally over a year.</li>
            <li>I have full lips which are prone to chapping.</li>
            <li>It glides on nicely, isn&#x27;t sticky or waxy and makes you lips nice and soft even into the next day.  </li>
            <li>Leaves even the most chapped lips soft after one night&#x27;s use</li>
            <li>Still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you are hesitant, this is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend it if you are prone.</li>
            <li>The only habit I have to break now, is I rub my lips together a lot to make sure there is still product on it</li>
            <li>this really works, my lips are heal, so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It did not moisture my lips as much as the old formula either, and I found myself reapplying more frequently than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first bought it, it was actually originally a substitution for a different Sally Hansen overnight lip repair.</li>
            <li>I use this absolutely every night, its a must.</li>
            <li>do not know why Sally Hansen discontinues their products, but this one really works.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizing lip balm and I reach for it</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of lip and skin care products, and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>I wake up with soft smooth lips that are nearly twice the size.</li>
            <li>I live in AZ and it really helps.</li>
            <li>Best lip product ever, too bad they discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>Most nights I only needed to put it on right before going to bed and it lasted the entire 8 hours of sleep, but on some particularly dry nights (or if my boyfriend decided to kiss me after putting it on) I had to reapply it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, and live it.</li>
            <li>By morning they&#x27;re very soft.</li>
            <li>i use it once or twice daily, but i don&#x27;t see anuthing amazing or different from other tupe lip balms</li>
            <li>It helps with my dry lips to repair and also with the fine lines above the lips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just ordered the daytime lip recovery and the reviews were a little less good</li>
            <li>I love this product, but had a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
            <li>It can be used just once at bedtime and keeps lips moist and soft all night.</li>
            <li>After one week my boyfriend remarked at how soft and supple my lips were</li>
            <li>and this is absolutely the ONLY product that helps.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my lips soft and supple.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that is not good when trying to moisturize them, but that&#x27;s on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work any better than the dark blue Nivea chap stick for overnight relief of chapped lips, and it&#x27;s much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>I live in a desert climate and I am constantly putting some type of lip balm on my lips.  </li>
            <li>I did compare this product to one of my old tubes bought from Walgreen and the texture was slightly different.</li>

            <li> (can&#x27;t imagine how long it would take get this the regular way).</li>
            <li> so I was forced to resort to amazon and pay a higher price.</li>
            <li> I had used this product once before last year and it was fantastic, but I was unable to find it at any store.  </li>
            <li> however i try not to aplly it more than twice a day because i&#x27;m afraid i will build up a tolerance to it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so dry here</li>
            <li> have chronically dry lips- like cracking dry.</li>
            <li> no signs of cracked, dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For no reason, in June of 2013 my lips became itchy and severely dry and nothing was soothing them</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY dry lips</li>
            <li> I always put it on at night because some medications make my lips feel dry.  </li>
            <li> and you do get very dry lips</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips and need too keep them hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips and need too keep them hydrated.</li>
            <li> It is expensive on Amazon but worth it.</li>
            <li> I hesitated with this because of the price and the fact of how much I spent on products that just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in it like some of the other thicker ones.</li>
            <li> I thought i&#x27;d give it a try based on other reviews, but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> feeling of other products but those are the ones that tend to stay on the longest.  </li>
            <li> The ones I prefer are the ones that allow my lips to glide across each other</li>
            <li> I usually relied on it to combat my dry lips.</li>
            <li> I put this on at night a little thick and it still feels present in the morning when I wake up.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately they do not last very long.  </li>
            <li> This is a must-have product for me year round.</li>
            <li> It sloughs off the dead skin that accumulates during the day.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when it was discontinued from my local store, My husband and I live in Nevada</li>
            <li> product has a very slight menthol feel to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for YEARS and was recently disappointed to find that my local stores have stopped selling it (unsure why).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find .</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wear a lot of lipstick because they dry my lips out really bad, but using this product</li>
            <li> I use my Sara Happ Lip Scrub, then put a thin layer of this on after that is done.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day, about every 2 hours, I use a thin layer of the Sara Happ Lip Slip and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Too bad they are not easily available anymore....</li>
            <li> This works all the time and doesn&#x27;t have a weird taste or smell like some lip repair products out there.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and was sad when I ran out and couldn&#x27;t find it in the store.</li>
            <li> Desperate, and based on the ratings, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> In the winter my lips are chapped from the cold and in the summer, from dehydration.</li>
            <li> I hate menthol on my lips but this is tolerable.</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly though, because of the price, but this is relief for me after my 9 month battle of the onsite of horrible lips, with no explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I peel the skin off, which keeps it from healing and we have a horrible cycle.</li>

            <li> Best lip product ever, too bad they discontinued it.  Leaves even the most chapped lips soft after one night&#x27;s use</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for getting your lips back into shape.  I use this absolutely every night, its a must.</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;ve tried several nightly lip therapy products since the one I loved was discontinued. I like this one. It doesn&#x27;t feel like glue going on and my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in it like some of the other thicker ones. Oh, and my lips are healthy!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I live in AZ and it really helps. It is expensive on Amazon but worth it.</li>
            <li> Used to get this at a local beauty supply store, but they no longer stock this.  I use this every night, will repurchase.</li>
            <li> do not know why Sally Hansen discontinues their products, but this one really works. whether it is the yucca &amp;#34;oil? or what, it is VERY effective. ordering more.</li>
            <li> Searched everywhere for this product.  After a friend recommended AMAZON,  I found it listed and ordered 3.  I have used this product for years, but it disappeared from the retail shelves.  GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> i love this so much and it has lasted me literally over a year. however i try not to aplly it more than twice a day because i&#x27;m afraid i will build up a tolerance to it lol. I just ordered the daytime lip recovery and the reviews were a little less good but i&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll be a miracle just like this one</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work any better than the dark blue Nivea chap stick for overnight relief of chapped lips, and it&#x27;s much more expensive.  I thought i&#x27;d give it a try based on other reviews, but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> u will not find better one</li>
            <li> THE BEST lip treatment out there.... And believe me- I have tried it all! I just got a MAC lip conditioner and although it is nice/good- it is not as good as this SallyHansen one. Too bad they are not easily available anymore.... Can&#x27;t believe I paid $19.99 for each (got 2) + $15 for expedited shipping and it still took over a week to get (can&#x27;t imagine how long it would take get this the regular way). In any case, certainly worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> His product surpasses all others I have tried . It can be used just once at bedtime and keeps lips moist and soft all night. Problem is ... It&#x27;s very hard to find . Amazon comes through again!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  It helps with my dry lips to repair and also with the fine lines above the lips.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear a lot of lipstick because they dry my lips out really bad, but using this product I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this at bedtime is has reduced the number of canker sores I get.  I no longer find it in retail stores so thank you Amazon for carrying.  I most definitely recommend it if you are prone.</li>
            <li> This product smells fine and keeps your lips moist. This is not greasy and seems to absorb nicely. The end.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing lip balm and I reach for it every chance I get.  It is smooth and not sticky.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when it was discontinued from my local store, My husband and I live in Nevada and it&#x27;s so dry here and you do get very dry lips, I don&#x27;t care for the greasy sticks. After using Sally Hanson Overnight Lip Recovery the first night, You actually wake up with lovely soft moisturized lips, I use it at night just before getting into bed (best time) The Best Lip moisturizer around! I Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great treatment that repairs and keeps my lips moist. I even use it under my lipsticks.  I have very dry lips and need too keep them hydrated.</li>
            <li> Great product ,I love it . I use it at night and over my lipstick during the day.</li>
            <li> I had used this product once before last year and it was fantastic, but I was unable to find it at any store.  Still love it!! You see results the very next morning. Haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li> this really works, my lips are heal, so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and live it. However, it seems the drug stores around me have stopped selling it- so I was forced to resort to amazon and pay a higher price. Still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have chronically dry lips- like cracking dry. I use this at night (or sometimes even in the day)- and it works miraculously. Immediately you can feel the moisture- and when you wake up- no signs of cracked, dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I use it every night and feel it does a fabulous job of softening my lips!  I feel it is fairly pricey but worth the cost!</li>
            <li> As effective as claimed.</li>
            <li> I live in a desert climate and I am constantly putting some type of lip balm on my lips.  I cannot stand the &amp;#34;waxy, sticky&amp;#34; feeling of other products but those are the ones that tend to stay on the longest.  The ones I prefer are the ones that allow my lips to glide across each other but unfortunately they do not last very long.  This product is amazing!  I have been using it for YEARS and was recently disappointed to find that my local stores have stopped selling it (unsure why).  I found it here on Amazon and was so excited!  And the price is perfect!  One tube, lasted me about 1 year.  Most nights I only needed to put it on right before going to bed and it lasted the entire 8 hours of sleep, but on some particularly dry nights (or if my boyfriend decided to kiss me after putting it on) I had to reapply it.  After one week my boyfriend remarked at how soft and supple my lips were and he couldn&#x27;t stop kissing them, so I had to make sure he was done kissing me for the night before I applied it...quality problem, I know :) I would recommend this to anyone.  It glides on nicely, isn&#x27;t sticky or waxy and makes you lips nice and soft even into the next day.  It doesn&#x27;t have a funky taste either.</li>
            <li> After spending hundreds of dollars on products to help my severe chapped lips, I have a regimen that now works for me. It&#x27;s pricey, but the products do last a while. For no reason, in June of 2013 my lips became itchy and severely dry and nothing was soothing them and I bought a lot of things that worked for others, but didn&#x27;t work for me. I have used this 2 nights in a row and my lips are 75% healed already! I put this on at night a little thick and it still feels present in the morning when I wake up. I use my Sara Happ Lip Scrub, then put a thin layer of this on after that is done. I use to have to put products on every 15 minutes, now I don&#x27;t. Throughout the day, about every 2 hours, I use a thin layer of the Sara Happ Lip Slip and it does the trick. In just one use of this Sally Hansen product, it took care of the cracking in the corner of my lips. I hesitated with this because of the price and the fact of how much I spent on products that just didn&#x27;t work. Desperate, and based on the ratings, I decided to give it a try. I am so glad that I did. I no longer have to keep searching for something that will help my lips! The only habit I have to break now, is I rub my lips together a lot to make sure there is still product on it and I&#x27;m sure that is not good when trying to moisturize them, but that&#x27;s on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a very slight menthol feel to it. I hate menthol on my lips but this is tolerable. It has no flavor and no scent to it, which is a bonus! It is also not greasy and it very easily glides on and is easy to rub into your lips. You can feel your lips just soaking it up. I use it sparingly though, because of the price, but this is relief for me after my 9 month battle of the onsite of horrible lips, with no explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitant, this is worth the cost. Coming from someone with stubborn lips, I have found MY liquid gold. (Hence my title, this should be gold packaged tube and not silver). 10 stars fro me!</li>
            <li> I will wear this until i die. I have EXTREMELY dry lips and this is absolutely the ONLY product that helps. I wake up with soft smooth lips that are nearly twice the size. It is absolutely perfect and i would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I was so upset when I couldn&#x27;t find this product anymore. When I first bought it, it was actually originally a substitution for a different Sally Hansen overnight lip repair. I have a problem where my lips chap to the point that I probably need stitches to close the wound, and the same spot reopens over and over because as it heals, it scabs and I peel the skin off, which keeps it from healing and we have a horrible cycle. However, when I use this product, it heals without scabbing and leaves your lips silky smooth, literally overnight. This is a must-have product for me year round. In the winter my lips are chapped from the cold and in the summer, from dehydration. This works all the time and doesn&#x27;t have a weird taste or smell like some lip repair products out there.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but had a hard time finding it in stores. Amazon to the rescue, AGAIN!!! I have full lips which are prone to chapping. I use lip balm during the day, but it&#x27;s not enough. This product leaves my lips soft and supple. It sloughs off the dead skin that accumulates during the day. Just all around awesome! I compare it favorably to a similar product from Philosophy at three times the price. It&#x27;s not as good as the Philosophy product, but it comes darned close, and at a much more budget friendly price point.</li>
            <li> This is a great treatment that repairs and keeps my lips moist. I even use it under my lipsticks.  I have very dry lips and need too keep them hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love the creaminess of this lip recovery. I use it not only at night but also during the day.</li>
            <li> I got introduced to Sally Overnight Lip Recovery about 2 years ago. I liked its thicker texture but not greasy. I usually relied on it to combat my dry lips. Before this time buying on Amazon, I got mine at the local Walgreen and pretty happy with it. However, for some reason, I felt that the formula had changed. It did not feel the same on my lips as I remembered. I did compare this product to one of my old tubes bought from Walgreen and the texture was slightly different. It did not moisture my lips as much as the old formula either, and I found myself reapplying more frequently than before.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think I will recommend this product since it still works somehow (and first-time users might not feel the difference); though, I would warn people about my experience as well. I might have to look around for a better option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of lip and skin care products, and I really like this one. It goes on smoothly and stays put well overnight. I had noticeable results after just 1-2 days of use. And the price point is absolutely great for the quality.</li>
            <li> good for overnight lip healing and recovery i use it once or twice daily, but i don&#x27;t see anuthing amazing or different from other tupe lip balms</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  I always put it on at night because some medications make my lips feel dry.  By morning they&#x27;re very soft. I work in a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; bldg. in the winter and I even use this during the day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and was sad when I ran out and couldn&#x27;t find it in the store. I found it on Amazon, of course! It is the best ant-aging lip treatment. It smells great and works great for a great price.</li>
