    <ol>
            <li>One of the best wigs I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Fits well and very good quality.</li>
            <li>Great wig for a great price, though!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly good looking wig for the money!</li>
            <li>This wig is gorgeous!  </li>
            <li>Beautiful.</li>
            <li>but still it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It is very nice for the price and the fibers don&#x27;t fall out all over the place, so :D.</li>
            <li>It does have a good bit of curl</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still cute!  </li>
            <li>I got so many complements!</li>
            <li>It arrived in nice conditions felt really nice.</li>
            <li>The ringlets were really nice.</li>
            <li>Fit great and was very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The fiber tangles very easily though</li>
            <li>This purple wig went good with my outfit and it defiantly fit the occasion I would order from this company again</li>
            <li>The color is deep and the hair is perfectly curly and plentiful.  </li>
            <li>It will probably look a lot better under lamplight rather than the daylight.</li>
            <li>The style and cut of the curls are tighter and singular, more like vegas showgirl.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this wig.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li>The color is vibrant, the bangs are cut perfectly, and the curls are bouncy and fun.</li>
            <li>I love this wig, one thing it didn&#x27;t come with was the wig cap but other then that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was a great purchase for the price and</li>
            <li>Great vibrant color, hair is fairly soft and stayed curly.</li>
            <li>I love this wig so much it just came in today.</li>
            <li>Good for daily use or just cosplay.</li>
            <li>She wears the wig regularly and gets great compliments, even from complete strangers!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to brush out and doesn&#x27;t shed too much.</li>
            <li>The color is perfect and it&#x27;s so soft, although it&#x27;s a little bit shiny</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying again.</li>
            <li>Hmm I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m not crazy about this wig.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, rather comfortable to wear, and the fibers are decent quality.</li>
            <li>The wig doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture though...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more of blue violet, very shiny, and a bit longer and curlier.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice the curl pattern is quite different and the shade of purple is more vibrant in person.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>But that didn&#x27;t really affect my opinion of it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have to style it before wearing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for the bangs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible wig, but not exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Vibrant and high quality!</li>
            <li>The color of the synthetic hair fibers are more lilac than dark purple.</li>
            <li>The outfit that I wore it with had a little hat which I was able to cover that with, but it is noticeable when worn by itself.  </li>
            <li>but you can remedy that by gently going through it with a wig brush and some of the hair is going to fall out, even you natural hair does that.</li>
            <li>the comfort surprised me for it being a costume wig.</li>
            <li>Definitely doesn&#x27;t really look like the one pictured.</li>
            <li>This is my first long wig, so I figured that was more or less a standard draw back.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I couldn&#x27;t get it to lay flat against my head on the very top</li>

            <li> it is a little longer than i expected</li>
            <li> Other than this, I just need to trim the fringe as it is extremely long and hard to get to stay to one side or the other without a bobby pin.  </li>
            <li> Much lighter than picture and tangled badly after just a few hours.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t particularly recommend it, but the price isn&#x27;t horrible.</li>

            <li> This purple wig went good with my outfit and it defiantly fit the occasion I would order from this company again thanks</li>
            <li> The color is a lot different from how I thought it would be (a dark purple, instead of a dusky purple?  I can&#x27;t explain well.)  But that didn&#x27;t really affect my opinion of it.  It&#x27;s still cute!  I think the one draw back is that it got tangled the second I took it out of the package.  Not really tangled, but just enough to irritate me.  This is my first long wig, so I figured that was more or less a standard draw back.  Also, it&#x27;s a LOT longer than I expected because of the curls!  It is very nice for the price and the fibers don&#x27;t fall out all over the place, so :D.</li>
            <li> Great vibrant color, hair is fairly soft and stayed curly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for my daughter undergoing chemo. She wears the wig regularly and gets great compliments, even from complete strangers!!! Surprisingly good looking wig for the money!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, rather comfortable to wear, and the fibers are decent quality. I didn&#x27;t really have to style it before wearing. The curls hold well.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it did not come with a wig cap, but this is excusable.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. Quality wig.</li>
            <li> This wig is gorgeous!  The color is deep and the hair is perfectly curly and plentiful.  My only complaint is that I couldn&#x27;t get it to lay flat against my head on the very top (it wanted to stand up a bit).  The outfit that I wore it with had a little hat which I was able to cover that with, but it is noticeable when worn by itself.  Other than this, I just need to trim the fringe as it is extremely long and hard to get to stay to one side or the other without a bobby pin.  Great wig for a great price, though!</li>
            <li> Much lighter than picture and tangled badly after just a few hours.</li>
            <li> Fits well and very good quality.</li>
            <li> I love this wig so much it just came in today. The color is perfect and it&#x27;s so soft, although it&#x27;s a little bit shiny I just used some baby powder to reduce the shine a bit. I have to buy some spray for it cause it&#x27;s gonna need it. Definitely worth buying again. Good for daily use or just cosplay.</li>
            <li> It arrived in nice conditions felt really nice. I didn&#x27;t care much for the bangs but that&#x27;s just a personal preference. They sit about eye level and my eyes were always getting poked. The ringlets were really nice.</li>
            <li> Fit great and was very comfortable. I work for a wig manufacturer so I&#x27;ve worn all sorts of wigs. The fiber tangles very easily though and I feared brushing would only cause the curls to poof up and loose some of their ringlet shape. The wig doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture though...I&#x27;ve attached a couple photos of myself wearing it on Halloween for my mermaid costume. You&#x27;ll notice the curl pattern is quite different and the shade of purple is more vibrant in person. Overall, it was a great purchase for the price and the comfort surprised me for it being a costume wig. I didn&#x27;t attempt to apply heat to it because there wasn&#x27;t a need.</li>
            <li> Vibrant and high quality!</li>
            <li> I love this wig, one thing it didn&#x27;t come with was the wig cap but other then that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Hmm I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m not crazy about this wig. Definitely doesn&#x27;t really look like the one pictured.

It will probably look a lot better under lamplight rather than the daylight. I wouldn&#x27;t particularly recommend it, but the price isn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> Not at all, as shown in the photo. The color of the synthetic hair fibers are more lilac than dark purple. The style and cut of the curls are tighter and singular, more like vegas showgirl. Not at all like the wavy spiral texture that&#x27;s potrayed in the photo.</li>
            <li> One of the best wigs I have ever owned. The color is vibrant, the bangs are cut perfectly, and the curls are bouncy and fun. Easy to brush out and doesn&#x27;t shed too much.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this wig. it is a little longer than i expected but still it&#x27;s great. It does have a good bit of curl but you can remedy that by gently going through it with a wig brush and some of the hair is going to fall out, even you natural hair does that. I have gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> absolutely stunning. I got so many complements! plus you can switch up the styling!</li>
