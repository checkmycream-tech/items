    <ol>
            <li>Purell is the best.  </li>
            <li>They are wonderful people, about 95% volunteers.</li>
            <li>This one is just great!</li>
            <li>Also has a great scent!!!</li>
            <li>I gave this product five stars because we use it all the time and find it excellent, but I&#x27;m guessing any hand sanitizer would do the job.</li>
            <li>Best hand sanitizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is the best form or anitibacterial product because it uses alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Would encourage each to review the effectiveness of this product as I did and think will find it an excellent ally in prevention.</li>
            <li>I always buy these by the case and keep them all around the house and even in our vehicles - - they work great !!!!</li>
            <li>, this product works great!</li>
            <li>If you are asked to bring in a semester&#x27;s supply of hand sanitizer for your school, this is the best buy for your money.</li>
            <li>This was a great bulk purchase of hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Kind of smelly, but awesomely 70% v/v ethyl alcohol.  </li>
            <li>But for what it is, I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re always using this sanitizer and got this for a great price.</li>
            <li>Purrell is great and great to have around.</li>
            <li>With prime, I got this in 2 days for a great price.</li>

            <li>Great travel size.</li>
            <li>great price worked out great for school</li>
            <li>We have a puppy and there are times when we need to hold the baby immediately and have no time to run and wash our hands, and these bottles are doing a great job helping us out there.</li>
            <li>Great Item to have in your Survival Kit at Home.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Spread joy not germs!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great price, great pack.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>This, no matter the price, is great and smells good.</li>
            <li>Good quality product, great price.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful for outtings with the kids when you don&#x27;t have a bathroom in sight but need clean hands!</li>
            <li>Delivered in good time</li>
            <li>Good price if you need a lot</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good price that allowed me to give</li>
            <li>These are good.</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>And Amazon is my favorite shopping place!</li>
            <li>Tons for a rather cheap price and smells great.</li>
            <li>So I buy my own Purell</li>
            <li>When you don&#x27;t have water handy</li>
            <li>My favorite is Mother&#x27;s Therapy Organic&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>When she was able to come home, I asked the nurse what I should get at home</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>Nice germ free hands.</li>
            <li>and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast shipping and great value</li>
            <li>The pump bottle works much better than the flip top.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>I like being able to have easy access each time I get in and out.</li>
            <li>Nice price in large quantities.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t figure out why there doesn&#x27;t exist a product that is 70% ethanol and also fragrance free, but</li>
            <li>My employer provides hand santizer free of charge, but it&#x27;s either the foam (leaves hands sticky) or another brand that has a lingering odor that makes me sneeze.</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s worth it, even if I do spend more time at night slathering on the hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic also.</li>
            <li>But I keep it available for whenever I need it . . .</li>
            <li>This size is perfect for leaving out in a public area without taking up too much room.  </li>
            <li>Order and feel clean.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and after reading many reviews determined this is the best option to deal with the increasing number of diseases that have arrived of late in the U S.  </li>
            <li>A touch runny (as they all are), and I find that many times I pump a bit much and is drips out of my hands . . .</li>
            <li>It goes away quickly, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good, does the job of killing germs and doesn&#x27;t dry out our hands.</li>
            <li>It is a good product and doesn&#x27;t dry your hand.</li>
            <li>This was a great price for the smaller bottles (8 pack) as we just had a new baby and now have one in every room.</li>
            <li>Such a nice smell that dissipates quickly</li>
            <li>It does the job and great for our messy office.</li>
            <li>, I find that it is much more drying than the old version.</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing to rub this on my hands when I am not near a bathroom or do not have time to stop what I am doing to wash my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>One thing to remember about this product is that it has a powerful alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>Generic brands leave my hands feeling slimy and never quite drying while Purell soaks in nice and does not leave a residue after.</li>
            <li>While that may make it better at killing germs, it also means a much stronger alcohol smell when you&#x27;re applying it (strong enough that the people around you will notice).</li>
            <li>have purchased generic brands of hand sanitizer from drug stores, but most either smell funny or leave a residue on my hands.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Everyone thanks me for it and uses it!  </li>
            <li>We use this magical hand cleaner to kill all of our future spawn.</li>
            <li>There are other, natural products that are more appropriate for those groups.</li>
            <li>The fresh cucumber scent is amazing and my whole families hands are soft all year long.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to like and at a decent price to boot!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is what it is.. :)  Delivered as expected and described.</li>
            <li>Whole family loves this.</li>
            <li>inexpensive and well appreciated gifts.</li>
            <li>They will only use the Original Dawn to wash the sea lions, they will use nothing else even if they had 10,000 gallons of an alternate product donated free.</li>
            <li>I also bought the Original blue Dawn which they use for the sea lions.</li>
            <li>Good product, has been around a long time, and in these times of exotic and incurable diseases, a smart thing to keep around.</li>
            <li>Not the new Ultra Dawn, only the original Dawn.</li>
            <li>They are a non-profit organization and everything is donated and they handle up to 175 animals at any one time, though they are better at a number of half of that.</li>
            <li>decent deal</li>
            <li>Decent stuff</li>
            <li>You can look them up on the internet and see live pictures of all the animals and you could always donate products or money to them if you would like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be warned, however, that this new &amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34; formula is 70% alcohol compared to the old one which was around  62%.  </li>
            <li>We ordered a 12 pack and keep a bottle in every room of the house, a few extras in different parts of the larger areas to have it handy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many new organic brands that are less harsh and use safer chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Also, wish I could find this same product in a larger size for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>However alcohol kills bacteria by destroying the cell wall not inhibiting cell functions like other products (which they can evolve to withstand) and therefore is a much better product.</li>
            <li>I generally buy generics whenever they are comparable, but in this case, I have stuck to the name brand.</li>
            <li>I would buy that instead of these many little ones and use less plastic.  </li>
            <li>After trying a few of sanitizers I finally found the brand with the right viscosity for me.</li>
            <li>I would assume this is a good product that is mild enough for the animals and the least dangerous for both humans and animals.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I would rely on this before eating food with my hands, but for general daily use, I like it.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands like soap and water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would want to use it with babies or people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but very expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a germ freak, but do use this when traveling or visiting the shopping center, etc.</li>
            <li> I was getting rashes from the other cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> A lot of other centers have had to close down and ship their animals to the PMMC of Lag Beach.</li>
            <li> This is the product specifically requested by the Pacific Marine Mammal Center that rescues sea lions and a few other aquatic marine mammals.</li>
            <li> Generic brands leave my hands feeling sticky and icky.</li>
            <li> I can buy 12 twelve-ounce bottles of this at my grocery store for a little less than this 12 eight ounce bottles.  </li>
            <li> They appreciate any little gesture.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the flu (knock wood) for over a year since I&#x27;ve started using this stuff a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> And my hands aren&#x27;t dried out either.  </li>
            <li> Germ X, basically the same, is much less expensive at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I bought Purell here for 31 cents an ounce and the price has increased to 36 cents an ounce in the past few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the usual hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> When I use this sanitizer frequently on my children&#x27;s delicate hands during the Winter they get chapped and make life a little uncomfortable for them!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is subtle.</li>
            <li> I hate sanitizers that smell too much like alcohol or fake floral or fruity scents.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I often make poor life choices leading to semen on hands and everywhere else.</li>
            <li> People are dirty beings</li>
            <li> and i have never had the flue or cold yet thank god and purell</li>
            <li> Its not just for Cold and Flu Season.</li>

            <li> This was a great bulk purchase of hand sanitizer. The price and convenience made sense to buy in bulk on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Kind of smelly, but awesomely 70% v/v ethyl alcohol.  I can&#x27;t figure out why there doesn&#x27;t exist a product that is 70% ethanol and also fragrance free, but whatever.  Also, wish I could find this same product in a larger size for a reasonable price.  I would buy that instead of these many little ones and use less plastic.  But for what it is, I&#x27;m happy.  Purchased May 2012. Product expires April 2015.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re always using this sanitizer and got this for a great price.</li>
            <li> I ordered 24 bottles for my company and 7 of them were partially open and leaking when I pulled them out of the box.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I know Purell has been around for years but I have to say it leaves a sticky residue on my hands.  When I use this sanitizer frequently on my children&#x27;s delicate hands during the Winter they get chapped and make life a little uncomfortable for them!  I had this bottle for about a week and the pump didn&#x27;t work anymore.  I had to take it off and it would pour all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many new organic brands that are less harsh and use safer chemicals.  My favorite is Mother&#x27;s Therapy Organic&#x27;s.  The fresh cucumber scent is amazing and my whole families hands are soft all year long.</li>
            <li> helps keep the germs away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the usual hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Generic brands leave my hands feeling sticky and icky. This, no matter the price, is great and smells good.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like and at a decent price to boot!</li>
            <li> My hands have never been cleaner.</li>
            <li> My critique is not of the product. Purrell is great and great to have around. My critique concerns pricing. I can buy 12 twelve-ounce bottles of this at my grocery store for a little less than this 12 eight ounce bottles.  That&#x27;s 144 ounces compared to 96 ounces for the same product</li>
            <li> My sister was hospitalized recently and the ICU had every visitor using some stuff to kill hand germs. When she was able to come home, I asked the nurse what I should get at home and she said Purell. I had never used it before but I bought this 8 pack for my sister&#x27;s home and mine. We love it! It smells good, does the job of killing germs and doesn&#x27;t dry out our hands. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about this before! And Amazon is my favorite shopping place! With prime, I got this in 2 days for a great price.</li>
            <li> This was a great price for the smaller bottles (8 pack) as we just had a new baby and now have one in every room.</li>
            <li> If I could bathe in this, I would.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great and in every passageway in a hospital</li>
            <li> This is the product specifically requested by the Pacific Marine Mammal Center that rescues sea lions and a few other aquatic marine mammals. They use this to constantly wash their hands while dealing with the sea lions, which they do at a minimum as they try to release all animals after they have been rehabilitated. I would assume this is a good product that is mild enough for the animals and the least dangerous for both humans and animals. I also bought the Original blue Dawn which they use for the sea lions. Not the new Ultra Dawn, only the original Dawn. They will only use the Original Dawn to wash the sea lions, they will use nothing else even if they had 10,000 gallons of an alternate product donated free. It is the same for the Purell. They have researched this and are very specific. They are a non-profit organization and everything is donated and they handle up to 175 animals at any one time, though they are better at a number of half of that. A lot of other centers have had to close down and ship their animals to the PMMC of Lag Beach. You can look them up on the internet and see live pictures of all the animals and you could always donate products or money to them if you would like. They don&#x27;t track people watching their website and ask for donations. I told them to call me if they want anything else, giving them all my numbers, and they have yet to ever call me. I always call them and ask what could they use. They appreciate any little gesture. They are wonderful people, about 95% volunteers.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do. After trying a few of sanitizers I finally found the brand with the right viscosity for me. Will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the flu (knock wood) for over a year since I&#x27;ve started using this stuff a few times a day.  And my hands aren&#x27;t dried out either.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> People are dirty beings and I have to be in public with them, so I carry this everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of sanitizer we use at home. I love the scent, it&#x27;s not too strong. I hate sanitizers that smell too much like alcohol or fake floral or fruity scents. This one is just great!</li>
            <li> My employer provides hand santizer free of charge, but it&#x27;s either the foam (leaves hands sticky) or another brand that has a lingering odor that makes me sneeze. So I buy my own Purell and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, however, that this new &amp;#34;Advanced&amp;#34; formula is 70% alcohol compared to the old one which was around  62%.  While that may make it better at killing germs, it also means a much stronger alcohol smell when you&#x27;re applying it (strong enough that the people around you will notice). It goes away quickly, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I find that it is much more drying than the old version. To me it&#x27;s worth it, even if I do spend more time at night slathering on the hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Ebola ain&#x27;t gonna get me!</li>
            <li> It is a good product and doesn&#x27;t dry your hand. my wife uses it in her medical office.</li>
            <li> Nice germ free hands.</li>
            <li> Delivered in good time</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this stuff actually kills the germs on your hands, but I use it anyway and I like the way it feels on my hands. It is very refreshing to rub this on my hands when I am not near a bathroom or do not have time to stop what I am doing to wash my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would rely on this before eating food with my hands, but for general daily use, I like it. Especially if you are in a situation where you have to shake hands with people or touch shared items (like in an office).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased generic brands of hand sanitizer from drug stores, but most either smell funny or leave a residue on my hands. I generally buy generics whenever they are comparable, but in this case, I have stuck to the name brand.</li>
            <li> Great size to take with you. Great travel size. Also has a great scent!!! This product is wonderful for outtings with the kids when you don&#x27;t have a bathroom in sight but need clean hands!</li>
            <li> great price worked out great for school</li>
            <li> I gave this product five stars because we use it all the time and find it excellent, but I&#x27;m guessing any hand sanitizer would do the job. We ordered a 12 pack and keep a bottle in every room of the house, a few extras in different parts of the larger areas to have it handy. We have a puppy and there are times when we need to hold the baby immediately and have no time to run and wash our hands, and these bottles are doing a great job helping us out there. Baby does not seem to mind the scent (which disappears in seconds as it dries up). We also ask visitors to sanitize before we let them pamper our baby.</li>
            <li> I like buying the 12-pack so that I&#x27;m not always running to the store when we are out of bottles.</li>
            <li> I bought these to put on all the sales associates desks.  With the flu going around this is helpful for our clients as well as our staff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Purell!  Nice price in large quantities.  Works well.</li>
            <li> If you work in an office, you need this product.  You don&#x27;t have to be &amp;#34;Monk&amp;#34; to notice the doorknobs of doors at your working establishment are a cesspool of things one does not want to think about too deeply.  Order and feel clean.</li>
            <li> came as advertised. decent deal</li>
            <li> I use Purell all the time and like to have extra ones in the cabinet.  The price was fantastic also.</li>
            <li> Good quality product, great price.</li>
            <li> Good price if you need a lot</li>
            <li> It is what it is.. :)  Delivered as expected and described.</li>
            <li> Best hand sanitizer I&#x27;ve used. Bought a dozen for use at home and for work by refilling a 2oz Purell bottle and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump appears to be unsealed so it explains the importance of keeping it upright as shown on the box.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  This is the best form or anitibacterial product because it uses alcohol.  A lot of other antibac products use a different chemical that the bacteria can become immune to overtime.  However alcohol kills bacteria by destroying the cell wall not inhibiting cell functions like other products (which they can evolve to withstand) and therefore is a much better product.</li>
            <li> It does the job and great for our messy office.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and great value</li>
            <li> i use this for the last 10 years i keep it in my van front doors and my ranger doors every time i pump gas or push a cart i wash my hands i have no imuine system i am a transplant person and i have never had the flue or cold yet thank god and purell</li>
            <li> Great Item to have in your Survival Kit at Home. Its not just for Cold and Flu Season. Stock up and keep Several on hand.</li>
            <li> Good product, has been around a long time, and in these times of exotic and incurable diseases, a smart thing to keep around.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and after reading many reviews determined this is the best option to deal with the increasing number of diseases that have arrived of late in the U S.  Would encourage each to review the effectiveness of this product as I did and think will find it an excellent ally in prevention.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but very expensive so why the 3 stars instead of 4 stars. Germ X, basically the same, is much less expensive at Walmart. 3 10 ounce bottles for $5.94 (20 cents an ounce) or a 30 ounce bottle for $3.97 (13 cents an ounce). I bought Purell here for 31 cents an ounce and the price has increased to 36 cents an ounce in the past few days. Decent stuff but I won&#x27;t be buying it here again unless the price drops.</li>
            <li> I always buy these by the case and keep them all around the house and even in our vehicles - - they work great !!!!</li>
            <li> When you don&#x27;t have water handy Purell works well to sanitize your hands.  I leave it on the counter where patients write checks and handle the pen I leave for them to write with. Everyone thanks me for it and uses it!  This size is perfect for leaving out in a public area without taking up too much room.  It&#x27;s scent is subtle.</li>
            <li> Whole family loves this. Immediately after returning home, everyone uses this to get rid of outside germs.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Good price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands like soap and water.</li>
            <li> I bought a dozen bottles to convert into Santa-tizers to give as Christmas gifts. Good price that allowed me to give inexpensive and well appreciated gifts. &amp;#34;Spread joy not germs!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have plenty of Purell after buying these . . . car, closet, bathroom. I&#x27;m not a germ freak, but do use this when traveling or visiting the shopping center, etc. A touch runny (as they all are), and I find that many times I pump a bit much and is drips out of my hands . . . But I keep it available for whenever I need it . . .</li>
            <li> Tons for a rather cheap price and smells great.</li>
            <li> Great price, great pack. Worth it.</li>
            <li> Prompt and reliable system</li>
            <li> Such a nice smell that dissipates quickly, this product works great! I was getting rashes from the other cheaper brands. I also put one in the kitchen for added protection for my family.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I often make poor life choices leading to semen on hands and everywhere else. We use this magical hand cleaner to kill all of our future spawn. 10/10.</li>
            <li> One thing to remember about this product is that it has a powerful alcohol smell. I&#x27;m not sure I would want to use it with babies or people with sensitive skin. There are other, natural products that are more appropriate for those groups.</li>
            <li> These are good. Use them in my office and at home. Purell quality.</li>
            <li> If you are asked to bring in a semester&#x27;s supply of hand sanitizer for your school, this is the best buy for your money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My husband and I each keep these in our cars at all times. The pump bottle works much better than the flip top. I like being able to have easy access each time I get in and out. Generic brands leave my hands feeling slimy and never quite drying while Purell soaks in nice and does not leave a residue after.</li>
