            <li>Amazing blade.....</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need to own them in all sizes.</li>
            <li>If you own an Oster clipper you will know the quality of Oster clippers.</li>
            <li>Just another great tool to clean up the bulk for haircuts.</li>
            <li>Perfect with my Classic 76&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these blades to anyone looking to get a great cut!</li>
            <li>Great product, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>For professional hair stylist there would be a much greater cost, however I can say that I would be overly impressed with my barber if he/</li>
            <li>I get a very smooth and neat cut that looks like I&#x27;ve been to the barber shop.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>Ive had better.</li>
            <li>I use the 3 1/2 on the sides most of the time.</li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;ll do that on the top.</li>
            <li>well worth the cost for the superior cut compared to plastic guards.</li>
            <li>give such an even, perfect cut.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with the product and the vendor.</li>
            <li>Much better than the plastic guards.</li>
            <li>I will end up buying more of the metal blades as time goes on.</li>
            <li>Much better than the plastic comb guards in that I don&#x27;t have to make nearly as many passes.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers, need more heads.</li>
            <li>Would suggest purchasing the: Clipper Case from Top Performace (Amazon)  as well to prevent this investment from breaking.</li>
            <li>Love everything on my oster 76.</li>
            <li>I like blades better than combs.</li>
            <li>These are so much better than the plastic clip on guards.</li>
            <li>What else could i say about Oster blades; pretty much the best in the barber industry.</li>
            <li>Much better than any of the cheap ones out there.</li>
            <li>this cuts much more smooth and fine</li>
            <li>My Oster clippers have been going strong for about 10 years and the 1/4&amp;#34; blades for about 3.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to shave my own hair.</li>
            <li>Fits my Oster Professional Classic 76 Clippers and works great!</li>
            <li>- a few hours after I posted this review &amp; pictures, I received an e-mail from Amazon informing me that they had already shipped a replacement at no cost... impressive for a Friday night!</li>
            <li>This Oster blade cuts close and precise.</li>
            <li>- received genuine AgION blade (new/unused) as I had originally ordered.</li>
            <li>and it gives a clean trim.</li>
            <li>the barber shop and noticed I like my hair cut the most when the person used an Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I need!</li>
            <li>Swapping the blades out for different sizes is a very quick and hassle free process on supported</li>
            <li>For home users most will only need one or two blades, so the cost will pay for itself fairly quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long paid for itself by trimming my own hair over visiting a barber or stylist.</li>
            <li>I love it as a great easy way to trim and not have to go over the same areas of my beard, at least not more than two three times, maybe more, but it is leagues better than the plastic combs, if you do not have the experience with those combs, so this grabs the hair very well.</li>
            <li>Product was brand new and fit the exact trimmer that i had to it was all goo&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>/&gt;The build quality like most Oster products is second to none.  </li>
            <li>and so we tried the 3 1/2... exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure will last forever.</li>
            <li>Oster blades are very high quality.  </li>
            <li>I really like the metal blades to the plastic attachable ones.</li>
            <li>Much cleaner cut.</li>
            <li>Lasts well, and much smoother than the plastic pieces.</li>
            <li>I will be getting a few more lengths in the near future to help cut a better fade.</li>
            <li>These blades are so much better than those cheesy plastic clip on blades they cut very smoothly</li>
            <li>While reading reviews of the Oster Classic 76</li>
            <li>is a quality blade for my Classic 76.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have long cut my hair at home because it is much quicker than going to the barber, and I have always felt my results were better than what I was getting from a local shop.</li>
            <li>These blades match that high quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Oster and high quality.  </li>
            <li>If this fits your trimmer and is the size you need,  I highly recommend the Oster blades.</li>
            <li>you use this size regularly, you&#x27;ll quickly feel like you got your money&#x27;s worth on the upgrade from using the standard blade with a plastic guard.</li>
            <li>Did not have a true test the hair was to long before I got it cut.</li>
            <li>Between this clipper blade and the Oster Classic 76, you&#x27;ll save tons of money while getting professional results at home.</li>
            <li>While not a fault of these blades, the blades DO get very hot after even a single haircut, so I rated the system (clippers and blades) a \\&quot;4\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I cut my hair once or twice a week and with this blade it is cut to the exact length I want and only takes one pass to cut it.  </li>
            <li>The general opinion was that the metal blades gave a much cleaner, smoother profession cut.</li>
            <li>diferent shape altogether and stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>I am a professional hair stylist and have been using these blades for years.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 3 1/2 blade at the same time I purchased my Oster Classic 76 clipper.</li>
            <li>As far as function, the blade works exactly like I&#x27;d expected...</li>
            <li>No more cheap clippers for me.</li>
            <li>We have the plastic comb adapter things that allowed us to do the same thing, but once we settled on which sizes we use regularly in our family, we bought the metal clipper blades, and it&#x27;s much smoother.</li>
            <li>The clipper blades are more expensive than the plastic clip-on guides, but definitely do a much nicer job</li>
            <li>After outfitting my new Oster Classic 76 with this blade, I must agree with the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>metal blades are a considerable up charge from the plastic guards especially if you need an entire set, however the results support the difference in price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same Oster Classic 76 clipper for over two decades and have not had one single issue with it.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same Oster Classic 76 clipper for over two decades and have not had one single issue with it.  </li>
            <li> I do a very, very minor fade with the sides just barely shorter than the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very strong durable clip its not the same as cutting with plastic clips</li>
            <li> I also use it to cut my kids&#x27; hair; the length isn&#x27;t too short or too long for them (their curly hair looks short, but not shaved after using this 3-1/2 clipper).  </li>
            <li> This is the cutting head I use the most.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional barber, we use the clipper for home use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went store by store for a long time and never found any of this size .Just</li>
            <li> not very useful for short hair</li>
            <li> The only reason a gave it a 4 star is because the blades could&#x27;ve been a little sharper</li>
            <li> Previously I had a trimmer that used those plastic clip-on comb sizer attachments and while they lasted a while, inevitably broke due to their plastic construction.  </li>
            <li> Not much I can</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s perfectly as expected.</li>
            <li> you are a professional or home user and are serious about your hair styles, then stop putting your money in sub par guards and buy metal blades.</li>
            <li> Previously I would hand cut it with a scissors.  </li>
            <li> 5-star blade that loses one star because of bad original order.</li>
            <li> Not sure.  </li>
            <li> Slow delivery.</li>
            <li> Recommend this blade for any serious barber; must have in your barber tools!</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> I started using this as my go to cutting blade</li>

            <li> I use these cutters to grind up my Starbuck beans in the morning!</li>
            <li> I am a barber. Blade cuts without pulling.....good buy!</li>
            <li> This blade was not made by Oster. . . diferent shape altogether and stopped working completely.Beware of counterfeits</li>
            <li> I love it as a great easy way to trim and not have to go over the same areas of my beard, at least not more than two three times, maybe more, but it is leagues better than the plastic combs, if you do not have the experience with those combs, so this grabs the hair very well.</li>
            <li> I started using this as my go to cutting blade and I could not be happier with its performance.  I cut my hair once or twice a week and with this blade it is cut to the exact length I want and only takes one pass to cut it.  This is perfect for guys who want a crew cut.  I&#x27;ve been using the same Oster Classic 76 clipper for over two decades and have not had one single issue with it.  Just keep the blades lubed up and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 3 1/2 blade at the same time I purchased my Oster Classic 76 clipper. I have long cut my hair at home because it is much quicker than going to the barber, and I have always felt my results were better than what I was getting from a local shop. While reading reviews of the Oster Classic 76 I saw mention from several barbers that they preferred the metal blades over guards. The general opinion was that the metal blades gave a much cleaner, smoother profession cut. After outfitting my new Oster Classic 76 with this blade, I must agree with the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality like most Oster products is second to none.  Swapping the blades out for different sizes is a very quick and hassle free process on supported Oster models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal blades are a considerable up charge from the plastic guards especially if you need an entire set, however the results support the difference in price. For home users most will only need one or two blades, so the cost will pay for itself fairly quick. For professional hair stylist there would be a much greater cost, however I can say that I would be overly impressed with my barber if he/she made the investment in their clipper blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a professional or home user and are serious about your hair styles, then stop putting your money in sub par guards and buy metal blades.</li>
            <li> I really like the metal blades to the plastic attachable ones. Much cleaner cut.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I use this 3-1/2 to cut my moustache to the proper length!  Previously I would hand cut it with a scissors.  I never could get all the hair equal length when I hand cut my moustache with scissors.  This takes just seconds, and is foolproof.  I also use it to cut my kids&#x27; hair; the length isn&#x27;t too short or too long for them (their curly hair looks short, but not shaved after using this 3-1/2 clipper).  While not a fault of these blades, the blades DO get very hot after even a single haircut, so I rated the system (clippers and blades) a \\&quot;4\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Expensive but you don&#x27;t need to own them in all sizes. 3 1/2 works on my entire body hair. I use it for body hair grooming.</li>
            <li> Slow delivery. Product works ok.  May be used. Not sure.  Ive had better.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased the clippers and I needed to buy different blades for it! The only reason a gave it a 4 star is because the blades could&#x27;ve been a little sharper</li>
            <li> I use the 3 1/2 on the sides most of the time. Every now and then I&#x27;ll do that on the top. I do a very, very minor fade with the sides just barely shorter than the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this size regularly, you&#x27;ll quickly feel like you got your money&#x27;s worth on the upgrade from using the standard blade with a plastic guard. With a visibly cleaner cut.</li>
            <li> Daughter says it works good.</li>
            <li> Product was as described. I use it quite often and recommend the seller!</li>
            <li> Not much I can say.&lt;br /&gt;This is a quality blade for my Classic 76.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer these blades as opposed to the combs you attach over a shorter blade.</li>
            <li> This blade had to be returned because it cut peoples ears during every haircut.</li>
            <li> What else could i say about Oster blades; pretty much the best in the barber industry. Cuts like butter through any type of hair... Just another great tool to clean up the bulk for haircuts. Recommend this blade for any serious barber; must have in your barber tools!</li>
            <li> There is nothing like the smoothness from the metal blades... well worth the cost for the superior cut compared to plastic guards. I buzzcut my husband&#x27;s thinning hair and these give such an even, perfect cut. We already have the 1/4&amp;#34; blades, but he wanted it just a tad longer and so we tried the 3 1/2... exactly what we wanted. My Oster clippers have been going strong for about 10 years and the 1/4&amp;#34; blades for about 3. It pays to buy quality.</li>
            <li> Oster blades are very high quality.  If you own an Oster clipper you will know the quality of Oster clippers. These blades match that high quality.</li>
            <li> This is the cutting head I use the most. It is 3/8&amp;#34; for that ideal look for me. I get a very smooth and neat cut that looks like I&#x27;ve been to the barber shop. If you like your cut short, but not to short, this is the clipper head you want.</li>
            <li> Great attachment, easy to change out.</li>
            <li> Best brand of clipper blades! Have never had any issues with them!</li>
            <li> Between this clipper blade and the Oster Classic 76, you&#x27;ll save tons of money while getting professional results at home. Totally satisfied with the product and the vendor.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional barber, we use the clipper for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is of excellent quality. We have the plastic comb adapter things that allowed us to do the same thing, but once we settled on which sizes we use regularly in our family, we bought the metal clipper blades, and it&#x27;s much smoother.</li>
            <li> My Oster trimmer only came with one blade that wasn&#x27;t the size I needed so I had to order this. Previously I had a trimmer that used those plastic clip-on comb sizer attachments and while they lasted a while, inevitably broke due to their plastic construction.  With these, buy it once, handle it with some respect and it should give you a lifetime of personal use. It&#x27;s long paid for itself by trimming my own hair over visiting a barber or stylist. Very happy and satisfied.</li>
            <li> I went store by store for a long time and never found any of this size .Just only online.This is exactly what I need!</li>
            <li> not very useful for short hair</li>
            <li> Broke when I received it</li>
            <li> Much better than the plastic guards. Use thus on my 76 for my goatee and it gives a clean trim. I will end up buying more of the metal blades as time goes on.</li>
            <li> One of the musts. Great blade</li>
            <li> I use this to cut my husband&#x27;s and sons&#x27; hair. Lasts well, and much smoother than the plastic pieces.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Oster and high quality.  If this fits your trimmer and is the size you need,  I highly recommend the Oster blades.</li>
            <li> I received an Oster #3.5 blade but it was not AgION and it has scratches on it, indicating it has been used. See my photos. I gave 2 stars because I received a \\&quot;blade\\&quot; in the agreed-upon time frame. I deducted 3 stars because it wasn&#x27;t as pictured and it wasn&#x27;t new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit - a few hours after I posted this review &amp; pictures, I received an e-mail from Amazon informing me that they had already shipped a replacement at no cost... impressive for a Friday night! It was shipped one-day, but since this is the weekend I won&#x27;t receive it until Monday. Once I get the replacement, I&#x27;ll come back and adjust my rating &amp; pictures accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2 - received genuine AgION blade (new/unused) as I had originally ordered. As far as function, the blade works exactly like I&#x27;d expected... Much better than the plastic comb guards in that I don&#x27;t have to make nearly as many passes. Exactly what I needed to shave my own hair. 5-star blade that loses one star because of bad original order.</li>
            <li> Oster&#x27;s products can not be beat. This clipper head is great, I have no complaints about it. I love these clippers, need more heads.</li>
            <li> Excellent Blade. Works Great! It cost me 40 bucks a month for a simple shaved hair cut. Saves you bucks for going thru the barber. Also good for toddlers.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great. This size is just perfect for my needs, trims my hair without making it look too bald. You just can&#x27;t beat Oster when it comes to trimmers.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these clippers. Perfect with my Classic 76&#x27;s. I would highly recommend these blades to anyone looking to get a great cut!</li>
            <li> Really good quality and shipped well.  Glad that I made the purchase off of Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great quality attachment and gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> I always get the same hair cut @ the barber shop and noticed I like my hair cut the most when the person used an Oster Classic 76. So, I decided to buy the trimmers and the blades myself and have my wife start saving me $20 a month. These are the pro-grade blade and are perfect!</li>
            <li> On time and as advertised. Product was brand new and fit the exact trimmer that i had to it was all goo&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> These blades (and the clipper) give a great haircut.  I have used the plastic blades for years but there is no comparison with these blades.</li>
            <li> I thought it did about what I wanted to do.Did not have a true test the hair was to long before I got it cut.</li>
            <li> Amazing blade.....just like a professionals!</li>
            <li> The 3 1/2 cuts but pulls my hair even though I oil it .</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but well worth the investment. Would suggest purchasing the: Clipper Case from Top Performace (Amazon)  as well to prevent this investment from breaking.</li>
            <li> Love everything on my oster 76. Much better than any of the cheap ones out there. You get what you pay for sometimes.</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s perfectly as expected. Oster still makes the best blades. It is compatable with the andis clipper as well. I am a professional hair stylist and have been using these blades for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this blade to use with a Oster Star Teq.  The blade fits perfectly and works great.  The clipper blades are more expensive than the plastic clip-on guides, but definitely do a much nicer job and you have no fear of the blade falling off.  I will be getting a few more lengths in the near future to help cut a better fade.</li>
            <li> Fits my Oster Professional Classic 76 Clippers and works great!</li>
            <li> I like blades better than combs. This Oster blade cuts close and precise. No more cheap clippers for me. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> As always, their products are very good: dependable, they do the job! I recommend them to anyone wanting to do it yourself!</li>
            <li> very strong durable clip its not the same as cutting with plastic clips this cuts much more smooth and fine</li>
            <li> All of the Oster blades are great. Awesome cut! These are so much better than the plastic clip on guards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my blade. And very happy with how quickly it came.</li>
            <li> These blades are so much better than those cheesy plastic clip on blades they cut very smoothly and I&#x27;m sure will last forever.</li>
