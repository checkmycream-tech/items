            <li>I truly love this corrector.</li>
            <li>I love the reputable brand name and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals</li>
            <li>I purchased the Avon Anew Clinical Absolute Even Multi-tone Skin Corrector as I have read great reviews on it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it cheaper here than from my Avon rep</li>

            <li>This cream is perfect, it fades all dark spots no matter where they are on your body.</li>
            <li>To be honest I really did not see a difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The texture is light and it has no discernible smell.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on my skin, but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in brown spots which was my main reason for purchase.</li>
            <li>The original cost of this through avon is $40.</li>
            <li>I thought it worked well when I used as a trial size but haven&#x27;t noticed the difference with the full size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend too much money on it because it did nothing.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look soft and the skin tone more even.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really give it a good rating because I haven&#x27;t been using it that long.  </li>

            <li>I bought my second bottle and will continue to use it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used this product.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much lighter than before.</li>
            <li>It got here supper fast</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this, because it works so well and fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use anything thing else and have noticed a large difference every since, very happ with this particular product.</li>
            <li>I used a couple bottles last year and this seems to work ok to smooth dark spots.</li>
            <li>So... decided to try Avon&#x27;s brand since I love all their other products.</li>
            <li>That is so high for a product that did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>It was highly recommended to me.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t break out normally</li>
            <li>I will update in s few more weeks</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not all gone and clear</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that much for this product first,but actually it worked for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying it, but can see early changes.</li>
            <li>I recommend it, it really helps ur overall skin improve dramatically.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s quite difficult to find good brightening stuff.</li>
            <li>but not nearly as dark and</li>
            <li>I have had dark spots since my first pregnancy almost 40 years ago.</li>
            <li>The Avon Anew Clinical Absolute Even Multi-tone Skin has not eliminated my stubbor dark spots, but it has faded them.</li>
            <li>Pretty disappointing after reading all the positive reviews, I really hoped it would improve some brown spots on my left cheek which showed up after a recent pregnancy (last year).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this it makes my skin feel soft.its a great product and a great seller.i would recommend it to family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my skin, but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in brown spots which was my main reason for purchase.</li>
            <li> Breaks me out and I don&#x27;t break out normally</li>
            <li> This product adds somewhat of a  glow to your face, it decreases some lines, and gives you a more youthful look.</li>
            <li> Still trying this product out so there isn&#x27;t anything I can say as yet. I will update in s few more weeks</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s quite difficult to find good brightening stuff. I&#x27;m Asian, and I have  lots of age and sun spot.  I didn&#x27;t expect that much for this product first,but actually it worked for me. My dark spots on my face has got lighter.  You have to be patient to see the result though. It took about 2 weeks for me.  I think it&#x27;s good product!</li>
            <li> The original cost of this through avon is $40. That is so high for a product that did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and I&#x27;ve seen some of my scars slowly diminishing. It&#x27;s not all gone and clear but it&#x27;s much lighter than before. It&#x27;s actually the first product that&#x27;s helped my acne scars.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully every night for 11 weeks and saw absolutely no improvement.Pretty disappointing after reading all the positive reviews, I really hoped it would improve some brown spots on my left cheek which showed up after a recent pregnancy (last year). But it did not work at all for me. Am now trying Burts Bees Brightening even-tone moisturizing creme and after 4 days, see a bit of improvement. Would not purchase another Avon product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying it, but can see early changes. I wish it contained more product.It was highly recommended to me.</li>
            <li> I like the product,i noticed a difference after few weeks of using it. but now,i am out of it..gotta buy some more and continue using it.</li>
            <li> I thought it worked well when I used as a trial size but haven&#x27;t noticed the difference with the full size.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see that it did anything promised. Had high hopes but very disappointed. Won&#x27;t reorder.  Not at all impressed. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything thing else and have noticed a large difference every since, very happ with this particular product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really give it a good rating because I haven&#x27;t been using it that long.  Have been using it for about 3 weeks and have not&lt;br /&gt;noticed any great improvement</li>
            <li> Great product.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It got here supper fast and it works miracles I have acne prone skin it clears my blemishes and other scars I have. I recommend it, it really helps ur overall skin improve dramatically.</li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference in the clarity and brightness in my skin.  Lives up to its promises and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, my skin feels and looks wonderful!  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to keep younger looking refreshing skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month every night before I go to bed. I&#x27;ve had a lot of problems with acne scarring on my cheeks. They seem to be fading. They&#x27;re not nearly as noticable. I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> To be honest I really did not see a difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This cream is perfect, it fades all dark spots no matter where they are on your body. I will continue to use this, because it works so well and fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend too much money on it because it did nothing.  I also thought it felt a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I waited a few months to review this item.  I have gotten a lot of brown patches on my face.  After using this consistently for a few months, I&#x27;ve noticed that the patches have lightened just a small bit, but not much at all.  I&#x27;ll use the rest of this bottle up, but I probably will not buy this product again.  I am going to buy &amp;#34;Dark Spots No More&amp;#34; instead and see if it helps.</li>
            <li> I have used this everyday since I received it and have not seen any difference. Still have uneven skin tone</li>
            <li> I truly love this corrector. It works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Works on any kind of skin with excellent results</li>
            <li> I used a couple bottles last year and this seems to work ok to smooth dark spots. It&#x27;s not a miracle cream but does seem to work after about two bottles of everyday use.  I love the reputable brand name and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals so would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have had dark spots since my first pregnancy almost 40 years ago. I have tried practically everything there is over-the-counter. The only products that worked were those prepared by my dermatologist and Obagi. They were expensive and had to be combined with Retin A, which is also expensive. It involved mixing and numerous steps AM and PM, plus I had to wear sunscreen constantly. The Avon Anew Clinical Absolute Even Multi-tone Skin has not eliminated my stubbor dark spots, but it has faded them. The texture is light and it has no discernible smell. It makes my skin look soft and the skin tone more even. I bought my second bottle and will continue to use it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> I should admit up front that I haven&#x27;t tried a wide range of skin correctors so I&#x27;m only basing my experience on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been given some samples and thought I noticed a difference in the few times I used it so I came to Amazon to check prices and was very happy to see this was priced much lower than what the Avon site was charging.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for several weeks, once a day in the morning before putting my makeup on and there&#x27;s a definite improvement.  I&#x27;ve had darker areas on my chin since my teens when I had pimples and they&#x27;ve never gone away.  They&#x27;re still there but not nearly as dark and this is in just a few weeks.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Avon Anew Clinical Absolute Even Multi-tone Skin Corrector as I have read great reviews on it.  I have only used it for one week, so it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will work.  I do like the feel of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I love Avon and never have been disappointed with a product. I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile now and haven&#x27;t seen any difference. I have one age spot that has faded using another product... but has darkened since running out of it. So... decided to try Avon&#x27;s brand since I love all their other products. I&#x27;m glad I got it cheaper here than from my Avon rep, but it was still a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used this product.  It is very light and not greasy, can even be worn under make up.  It seems like my freckles have actually lightened since I started using it.  Hope to see that all of the other 6 changes listed prove to be the same.</li>
