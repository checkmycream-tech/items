    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best tanner that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>A gradual application is best to increase color.</li>
            <li>and I find that applying it with latex- gloves or just my hands seems to work the best-</li>
            <li>This is a very good lotion.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll wake up with a beautiful tan.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the amazing reviews on youtube &amp; let me tell you I will NEVER purchase anything from million dollar tan again!</li>
            <li>I simply loved it.</li>
            <li>fair skinned</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>, addung more to streaks does nothing, you have to exfoliate and start all over!</li>
            <li>it has a kind of burnt flesh smell or that smell you get when you&#x27;ve just finished tanning in a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>Because it is visible, it is good for making sure you are blending everything in.</li>
            <li>If you keep applying, you&#x27;ll stat with a nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It kind of smells like vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>makes this tanner apply nicely.</li>
            <li>I found that one coat of self tanner looked fine color wise.</li>
            <li>I was really excited at first, it looked great!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite Sunless</li>
            <li>Overall this is the best self tanner Ive ever used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to keep using it but can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li>It gives an okay amount of color.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>Ok so there are pros and cons to this.</li>
            <li>I also love how there is no color guard</li>
            <li>absolutely love this stuff...</li>
            <li>love the color ....&lt;</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Everyone of my friends who has tried it love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Finally a self tanner that works :)</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and even (ALWAYS exfoliate!)</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m ok with it though ...</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this tanning lotion after seeing so many beauty guru&#x27;s on YouTube giving it a try.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried different kinds of self tanners, and Million Dollar Tans is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful, but it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li>Love the color, doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets like most tan products do.</li>
            <li>I use this all the time :)</li>
            <li>It is more lotion-like, instead of one with a bronzer or color-guard</li>
            <li>You can find it at most drugstores.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to exfoliate while the tanner is on your skin, so you have to do a pretty good job before you apply it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for an amazing product!</li>
            <li>The color this gives off in one application is pretty good-</li>
            <li>Just make sure to moisturize with a light-weight lotion every morning and night to keep it looking good until you&#x27;re ready to start over.</li>
            <li>and no unpleasant smell which is nice.</li>
            <li>and this gives me a nice golden tan /</li>
            <li>I did mix the tan lotion with regular lotion around the feet, hands, wrist, and face to make it a smooth even tan which work great.</li>
            <li>The tan wore for a week (I used a light and inexpensive tanning lotion to maintain the color).</li>
            <li>Really good if you already have natural olive or tan skin.</li>
            <li>Million Dollar Tan seems to be so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I am naturally fair skinned, but will tan easily; my skin has a yellow undertone.</li>
            <li>I applied to my face as well and liked the whole look and glow very much.</li>
            <li>Product has absolutely no scent which is great</li>
            <li>about 6 hours later you&#x27;ve got yourself a wonderful tan!&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>There are other popular, better self tanners.</li>
            <li>I loved it it so clean and the color shows up really good, u just have to make sure you use the same amount on the same areas, the only drawback is this hint of smell which you smell right after waking up</li>
            <li>I love it , it&#x27;s so natural looking .</li>
            <li>You can apply as much as you want in order to increase your tan!</li>
            <li>I test out many different brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely b ordering more....</li>
            <li>it looks better and like an actual tan-</li>
            <li>then the next night, when I want to apply self-tanner, I&#x27;ll take a shower and exfoliate once more.</li>
            <li>The no color guard thing doesn&#x27;t really help this application issue either, who enjoys a tanner that you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;re putting it!?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend for fair skin people as this really does get dark.</li>
            <li>prevent any dryness- the tanner will stick to dryer areas more easily and look uneven or unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My chest area and my elbows start to fade first, and the fading is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Personally, I\\&quot;m still on the quest to find the perfect self tanner that isnt ridiculously priced.</li>
            <li>and it is completely mess free and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Gives off a realistic tan!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>This tanner is very unnatural looking.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>If you apply too much at a time it cakes and flakes off even quicker.</li>
            <li>the tan came out very orangey</li>
            <li>Rub it in like a normal lotion, it doesn&#x27;t streak as long as you make sure you get all around your arms and legs.</li>
            <li>So this defintely did not meet my standards and not to mention how pricey it is, there are other products that do better and way cheaper.</li>
            <li>I like cabana tan more than any other products.</li>
            <li>I am definitely not a beginner at using self tanners, and I took special care to blend in the self tanner into these areas, but every time I&#x27;ve used this self-tanner, I have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>and I purchased the &amp;#34;extreme.&amp;#34; I actually love the color and was wanting a dark tan, but it does not look unnatural.</li>
            <li>The vast vast majority of positive reviews on this brand are sponsored, I&#x27;m telling you don&#x27;t waste your money when there&#x27;s so many better products out there like st tropez, xen tan, etc.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging, love that it never gave me the &#x27;fake tan&#x27; smell, but the fading was very patchy and it was a little more orange than I preferred.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot to get a great fake tan.</li>
            <li>I also found that on my feet and the backsides of my hands, despite extensive rubbing in of the self tanner (plus lotion), there were extremely distinct lines where the self tanner would begin/end.</li>
            <li>and that I can live with.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I applied two pumps to each leg and the next day I was a bronzed goddess!</li>
            <li>It is a white lotion, no color guard, which scared me a bit at first.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried SO many tanning products for years and there&#x27;s usually some issue I have with it (e.g. smell, streaks, color).</li>
            <li>I actually tried the new Jergens 3 days to flow moistruzer and that worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely used better self tanners that cost less.</li>
            <li>Here your skin is still soft and pores may still be open slightly, so your skin will accept the color better.</li>
            <li>This product did not work at all for me, my skin tone is naturally olive</li>
            <li>The only problem I have which is not even really and</li>
            <li>The color looks incredibly natural and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with streaking.</li>
            <li>The only downfall for me is that the after smell took awhile to fade and left my skin dry, but overall it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>so I have high standards, and this fell very short.</li>
            <li>I also find that normal or light tanners tend to just give me subtle color, but this being their darker version</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the lotion and the spray, both with the brush, their mitts, just latex gloves and also bare hands and nothing</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say which guru it was, but she clearly was either paid to rave about this product, or at the very least, was sent this product for free and was encouraged to review it positively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a neutral skin tone (not really pink, not really yellow)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little too light for this, so I&#x27;m going to order the regular color of this lotion next time instead of the extreme.</li>
            <li>Now the color isn&#x27;t extremely dark on me, but since it looks natural I&#x27;m assuming it would be darker on someone who is naturally darker than me-</li>

            <li> The main goal is to 1) remove all dead skin and 2)</li>
            <li> It has a slight smell when you first apply it, but after a few hours it&#x27;s gone (and it&#x27;s not that generic self-tanning smell).</li>
            <li> no it takes forever to come off and takes a long time to exfoliate off also if you have dry skin the tan cracks and gives you reptile skin</li>
            <li> , the color is very dark and one of the longest lasting tans I&#x27;ve ever used (the only longer one would be vita liberata)</li>
            <li> i even gave it a second chance and thought i will put it on and then apply lotion daily like i did everyday before using this stuff</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, the night before I want to apply self-tanner I will scrub my entire body down with a coconut and sugar scrub.</li>
            <li> I should send them my dry cleaning bill!</li>
            <li> You want ALL of the dead skin cells gone, and coconut oil helps moisturize at the same time to help prevent dry patches.</li>
            <li> rinse the next day after applying it to prevent it from streaking, as is the case with other self tanners I have used with a dark color guard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put this on before my trip to Puerto Rico and it lasted about 3 days which was expected because of all the swiming I was doing</li>
            <li> I have tried re-applying for a darker tan, but it just seemed to turn orange on me and made it 10 times harder to get off.</li>
            <li> Other people complained about it being hard/time-consuming to rub in the color guard completely.</li>
            <li> I found that on my chest area, the tanner starts to fade in small spots that grow larger, while the fading on my elbows is extremely patchy.</li>
            <li> but about 3 days until you look freakled due to flaking off.</li>
            <li> This self-tanner starts to fade for me after several days, and fades very unevenly.</li>
            <li> Ill start with the positive</li>
            <li> This is also not as dark as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> BUT the horrendous application and fading totally ruins any benefit that would bring.</li>
            <li> Usually I have to apply coats and coats of other brands.</li>
            <li> It lasted a little over a week on me without reapplying.  </li>
            <li> A little costly.</li>
            <li> Just let it absorb a little before dressing or crawling into bed</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I looked like I had bruises on my kneecaps because the tanner was so uneven.</li>
            <li> if you do it for a few says you will have a darker glow.</li>
            <li> Then once you&#x27;re all dried off, apply the tanner.</li>
            <li> was worried about the color being to dark, because I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times and love the color, but the smell is horrible!!</li>
            <li> And what sucks is the dark blotches will stick around for a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed in it-</li>
            <li> As with all self tanning products, you must moisturize everyday!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad, as far as self-tanners go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being a naive and trusting youtube beauty video viewer, I purchased a bottle of this.</li>
            <li> This is despite the fact that I moisturize at least 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: don&#x27;t fall for this product based on biased 5-star reviews from the company website, or from favorable video reviews by dishonest youtube beauty gurus.</li>
            <li> this sucks do not buy</li>
            <li> Even with the copious use of a moisturizing lotion on these problem areas, the product just collects in these drier areas to a ridiculous amount.</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky around the feet, but once you get used to it, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> is that it makes ME smell weird.</li>
            <li> , i just wish it didn&#x27;t make me smell stale and weird</li>
            <li> But not as brown as fake bake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding a tanning lotion I like</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell weird, I use the lotion before bed</li>
            <li> Ill still use it up, but won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> This product was expensive, and definitely a disappointment.</li>
            <li> No one even notices that it&#x27;s fake!</li>
            <li> bad smell and make</li>
            <li> if did not shaif ur leg its will look realy bad . .</li>
            <li> and I have never dealt with a tan that faded this badly.</li>
            <li> It also stains your fingernails an ugly brown color which lasted 3 WEEKS!!!</li>
            <li> Streakiness/discoloration on elbows, knees, and tops of feet was AWFUL.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Usually I have to apply coats and coats of other brands. The first time I used this I applied two pumps to each leg and the next day I was a bronzed goddess! It is a little tricky around the feet, but once you get used to it, you can&#x27;t go wrong! I will be buying again and again. Thanks for an amazing product!</li>
            <li> bad smell and make u orang&lt;br /&gt;and if did not shaif ur leg its will look realy bad . .</li>
            <li> Love this product! You can apply as much as you want in order to increase your tan! Gives off a realistic tan! No one even notices that it&#x27;s fake! I put this on before my trip to Puerto Rico and it lasted about 3 days which was expected because of all the swiming I was doing but it usually last 1-2 weeks! Love it!</li>
            <li> Stick with the Mermaid Mousse</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite Sunless tanners!!&lt;br /&gt;Its goes on white and about 6 hours later you&#x27;ve got yourself a wonderful tan!&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it makes ME smell weird. it has a kind of burnt flesh smell or that smell you get when you&#x27;ve just finished tanning in a tanning bed. Maybe its just my skin that smells like that, my sister tried it and said it didn&#x27;t smell to her but on me it did. Overall this is the best self tanner Ive ever used, i just wish it didn&#x27;t make me smell stale and weird haha.</li>
            <li> Product has absolutely no scent which is great but it is orange. I test out many different brands. The color is similar to Victoria secrets self tan. But not as brown as fake bake.</li>
            <li> I watched so maybe reviews on you tube and there website, so I bought it. I tried it a few times and love the color, but the smell is horrible!! I&#x27;d love to keep using it but can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> This does NOT come off of your hands even after you wash them. It also stains your fingernails an ugly brown color which lasted 3 WEEKS!!!</li>
            <li> A while back, there was a bunch of hype about this self tanner by a lot of beauty gurus on youtube. Being a naive and trusting youtube beauty video viewer, I purchased a bottle of this. I won&#x27;t say which guru it was, but she clearly was either paid to rave about this product, or at the very least, was sent this product for free and was encouraged to review it positively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) The color guard is white. Because it is visible, it is good for making sure you are blending everything in. Other people complained about it being hard/time-consuming to rub in the color guard completely. Personally, I didn&#x27;t think this was a big issue. Also, I found that I didn&#x27;t need to shower/rinse the next day after applying it to prevent it from streaking, as is the case with other self tanners I have used with a dark color guard.&lt;br /&gt;2) It&#x27;s a lotion form, so it isn&#x27;t as drying as self-tanner sprays that i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;3) It gives an okay amount of color.&lt;br /&gt;4) It doesn&#x27;t smell too bad, as far as self-tanners go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Streakiness/discoloration on elbows, knees, and tops of feet was AWFUL. Even with the copious use of a moisturizing lotion on these problem areas, the product just collects in these drier areas to a ridiculous amount. I looked like I had bruises on my kneecaps because the tanner was so uneven. I also found that on my feet and the backsides of my hands, despite extensive rubbing in of the self tanner (plus lotion), there were extremely distinct lines where the self tanner would begin/end. I am definitely not a beginner at using self tanners, and I took special care to blend in the self tanner into these areas, but every time I&#x27;ve used this self-tanner, I have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;2) Coloring. I am naturally fair skinned, but will tan easily; my skin has a yellow undertone. I found that one coat of self tanner looked fine color wise. However, I was unsatisfied with the lack of color, so I reapplied. After applying a second coat (a day later), and upon subsequent attempts to reapply the tanner to achieve a darker tan, I definitely started looking orange. This tanner is very unnatural looking. This is not usually a problem for me with other self tanners that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;3) Fading/Longevity. This self-tanner starts to fade for me after several days, and fades very unevenly. My chest area and my elbows start to fade first, and the fading is very noticeable. Several people commented on this. It looks like you have a skin disease. I found that on my chest area, the tanner starts to fade in small spots that grow larger, while the fading on my elbows is extremely patchy. This is despite the fact that I moisturize at least 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: don&#x27;t fall for this product based on biased 5-star reviews from the company website, or from favorable video reviews by dishonest youtube beauty gurus. This product was expensive, and definitely a disappointment. I&#x27;ve definitely used better self tanners that cost less. Personally, I\\&quot;m still on the quest to find the perfect self tanner that isnt ridiculously priced. I&#x27;ll update if I ever do find one.</li>
            <li> I simply loved it. Best tanner that I have ever used. It comes off as a lotion and it is completely mess free and fragrance free. Does NOT leave you orange at all. And it gradually fades away within a couple showers. If you keep applying, you&#x27;ll stat with a nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t forget to wash hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding a tanning lotion I like which doesn&#x27;t make my skin look orange. I&#x27;ve always used tanning beds, but a year ago I decided I needed to stop because I had been doing it since I was 18 (im 27 currently). Does not leave streaks... lasts about 4-5 days, longer depending on how often you exfoliate.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all for me, my skin tone is naturally olive so i wanted to enhance my skin tone but it didnt work.  Maybe it works on lighter skin but this did not work on my skin tone.  I actually tried the new Jergens 3 days to flow moistruzer and that worked very well.  So this defintely did not meet my standards and not to mention how pricey it is, there are other products that do better and way cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love it , it&#x27;s so natural looking . The only problem I have which is not even really and issue is I have to put on 2 coats for the color I want</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the amazing reviews on youtube &amp; let me tell you I will NEVER purchase anything from million dollar tan again! Do not fall for the girls on youtube. This stuff will leave you orange &amp; streaky &amp; not to mention the fact that when it fades it looks blotchy and gross. The smell is horrible! Save your money!!</li>
            <li> Ok so there are pros and cons to this. I do like the smell- it does not have that self tanner smell at all. I also love how there is no color guard so I can put it on in the morning and it won&#x27;t stain my clothes. The color this gives off in one application is pretty good- but this is not buildable. It will not get darker if I put it on a couple nights in a row. Also, this fades horribly. I know how to exfoliate my skin.. and I have never dealt with a tan that faded this badly. I was pretty disappointed in it- but I do like how it smells and how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every self tanner out there.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this stuff...&lt;br /&gt;There is no smell and it&#x27;s not sticky  it drys fast.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color ....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fair skinned and this gives me a nice golden tan / not orange.&lt;br /&gt;I sent pics  all of my friends and shared on my Facebook page...&lt;br /&gt;Everyone of my friends who has tried it love it.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely b ordering more....&lt;br /&gt;Finally a self tanner that works :)&lt;br /&gt;I also have psoriasis u can see in the pic ....&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t irritate it at all....&lt;br /&gt;I just put extra lotion on my spots and went over it once....</li>
            <li> Really good if you already have natural olive or tan skin. I don&#x27;t recommend for fair skin people as this really does get dark. Goes on smooth and even (ALWAYS exfoliate!) and no unpleasant smell which is nice. I&#x27;m a little too light for this, so I&#x27;m going to order the regular color of this lotion next time instead of the extreme.</li>
            <li> I loved it it so clean and the color shows up really good, u just have to make sure you use the same amount on the same areas, the only drawback is this hint of smell which you smell right after waking up, I&#x27;m ok with it though ... thanks</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this tanning lotion after seeing so many beauty guru&#x27;s on YouTube giving it a try. My friend tried it as well and recommended it to me. I love this product. I applied this along with a scented lotion (because I have used tanning lotions before, and they all have a smell) after showering and exfoliating. The tan wore for a week (I used a light and inexpensive tanning lotion to maintain the color). I will definitely be repurchasing this lotion and have been recommending it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about the color being to dark, because I have very pale skin and I purchased the &amp;#34;extreme.&amp;#34; I actually love the color and was wanting a dark tan, but it does not look unnatural. I applied to my face as well and liked the whole look and glow very much.</li>
            <li> I have tried different kinds of self tanners, and Million Dollar Tans is the best. I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot to get a great fake tan. I did mix the tan lotion with regular lotion around the feet, hands, wrist, and face to make it a smooth even tan which work great. The only downfall for me is that the after smell took awhile to fade and left my skin dry, but overall it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Not for me didnt see any results from it</li>
            <li> This is a very good lotion. I have been sunless tanning for 5 years.  I have used just about every lotion known to man.  Million Dollar Tan seems to be so far, so good.  It is a white lotion, no color guard, which scared me a bit at first.  Do NOT let that deter you.  It did not streak, did not stain my clothes or sheets.  It lasted a little over a week on me without reapplying.  As with all self tanning products, you must moisturize everyday!  It does extend the life of your tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it does have a smell, I&#x27;m not talking about the DHA smell that all sunless products have, I&#x27;m talking about the actual lotion.  It kind of smells like vegetable oil. It&#x27;s not awful, but it&#x27;s there.  It does dissipate as you put it on.  I didn&#x27;t smell at all after applying until morning.  This is also not as dark as I thought it would be.  I was hoping to be a bit darker after one application.  I have a medium skin</li>
            <li> Love the color, doesn&#x27;t streak. A little costly. Only thing is it doesnt stay on but about 3 days until you look freakled due to flaking off. If you apply too much at a time it cakes and flakes off even quicker. A gradual application is best to increase color.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of tan products from the drug stores. I have also splurged on st tropez products. I like cabana tan more than any other products. It doesn&#x27;t smell weird, I use the lotion before bed and I wake up with a glow... if you do it for a few says you will have a darker glow. Rub it in like a normal lotion, it doesn&#x27;t streak as long as you make sure you get all around your arms and legs. Wash your hands after applying of course. Doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets like most tan products do. I use this all the time :)</li>
            <li> Love the packaging, love that it never gave me the &#x27;fake tan&#x27; smell, but the fading was very patchy and it was a little more orange than I preferred. Ill still use it up, but won&#x27;t repurchase. There are other popular, better self tanners.</li>
            <li> Brief background: I&#x27;m very pale. I have a neutral skin tone (not really pink, not really yellow) and I&#x27;m Scotch-Irish. Yes, that does include the red hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried SO many tanning products for years and there&#x27;s usually some issue I have with it (e.g. smell, streaks, color). But this one is different. It has a slight smell when you first apply it, but after a few hours it&#x27;s gone (and it&#x27;s not that generic self-tanning smell). The color looks incredibly natural and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with streaking. It is more lotion-like, instead of one with a bronzer or color-guard and I find that applying it with latex- gloves or just my hands seems to work the best- Just wash your hand afterwards or use a dampened wash cloth to wipe it off. Now the color isn&#x27;t extremely dark on me, but since it looks natural I&#x27;m assuming it would be darker on someone who is naturally darker than me- and that I can live with. I have tried re-applying for a darker tan, but it just seemed to turn orange on me and made it 10 times harder to get off. I also find that normal or light tanners tend to just give me subtle color, but this being their darker version it looks better and like an actual tan- just with out the damage and no parabens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I apply/maintain it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the night before I want to apply self-tanner I will scrub my entire body down with a coconut and sugar scrub. You want ALL of the dead skin cells gone, and coconut oil helps moisturize at the same time to help prevent dry patches. I also shave and exfoliate with a luffa or luffa gloves. You won&#x27;t be able to exfoliate while the tanner is on your skin, so you have to do a pretty good job before you apply it. Then after the shower, I apply body butter, or body oils to deeply moisturize. The main goal is to 1) remove all dead skin and 2) prevent any dryness- the tanner will stick to dryer areas more easily and look uneven or unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then the next night, when I want to apply self-tanner, I&#x27;ll take a shower and exfoliate once more. Then once you&#x27;re all dried off, apply the tanner. Here your skin is still soft and pores may still be open slightly, so your skin will accept the color better. I like to apply it at night and sleep in it so I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; during the day or have to worry about messing it up. Just let it absorb a little before dressing or crawling into bed (I have not seen it transfer on to my sheets).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And volia! You&#x27;ll wake up with a beautiful tan. Just make sure to moisturize with a light-weight lotion every morning and night to keep it looking good until you&#x27;re ready to start over. I also recommend using a leg-makeup, such as Sally Hansen Airbrushed Legs for when it starts lightening or get&#x27;s patchy when you&#x27;re taking it off. You can find it at most drugstores.</li>
            <li> Fell for the sponsored YouTube reviews of this tanner. Been using self tanners for about 9 years now so I have high standards, and this fell very short. Ill start with the positive, the color is very dark and one of the longest lasting tans I&#x27;ve ever used (the only longer one would be vita liberata) BUT the horrendous application and fading totally ruins any benefit that would bring. I&#x27;ve tried the lotion and the spray, both with the brush, their mitts, just latex gloves and also bare hands and nothing makes this tanner apply nicely. And what sucks is the dark blotches will stick around for a couple of weeks! The no color guard thing doesn&#x27;t really help this application issue either, who enjoys a tanner that you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;re putting it!? The vast vast majority of positive reviews on this brand are sponsored, I&#x27;m telling you don&#x27;t waste your money when there&#x27;s so many better products out there like st tropez, xen tan, etc. This is going in the garbage</li>
            <li> the tan came out very orangey and i thought well i will just exfoliate it off no it takes forever to come off and takes a long time to exfoliate off also if you have dry skin the tan cracks and gives you reptile skin i even gave it a second chance and thought i will put it on and then apply lotion daily like i did everyday before using this stuff the same thing happened i wish i could get my money back this sucks do not buy i do not like the seller either i want  my money back!!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited at first, it looked great! Then, it started streaking and get s ALL OVER EVERYTHING I WEAR! I should send them my dry cleaning bill! No way to keep it up, addung more to streaks does nothing, you have to exfoliate and start all over! NOT WORTH IT! GIVE ME THATYELLOW THING IN THE SKY!</li>
