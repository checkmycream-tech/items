    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a superb shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo.</li>
            <li>It did a great job of cleaning and didn&#x27;t smell too manly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent was pleasant.</li>
            <li>Dove&#x27;s Men+Care Oxygen Charge Shampoo is a good balance between fair pricing and quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good addition to the Dove Men+ line.</li>
            <li>My husband said he thought it smelled good.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s a good thing because my husband doesn&#x27;t have to go around smelling like a bouquet of flowers.</li>
            <li>this is a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say a 8/10 is fair for lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Candidly, with shampoos, I don&#x27;t even know what quality means anymore since it would appear that the distinguishing characteristics between two shampoos is aroma, marketing and price.</li>
            <li>But, Dove has made a nice effort here</li>
            <li>The smell is nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He said this foamed nicely while washing his hair and made his scalp feel like it just have a bid dose of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My husband really liked this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>products is marketed for a  man, but both my husband and I liked this product.  </li>
            <li>is a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is best for oily hair or normal hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Dove routinely offers excellent quality and value, and this shampoo is just another example.</li>
            <li>My husband has used many of the Dove Men&#x27;s Care products and has liked them all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, the scent is very light.</li>
            <li>To that end, what more could one want out of shampoo?</li>
            <li>Overall middle-of-the-road is the best description I can give it.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to have products on hand that can be used by both of us.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I love Dove products.</li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning my hair, leaves it smelling good for awhile, and definitely leaves it manageable.</li>
            <li>The caffeine thing seems interesting.</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see what effect that has over the long-term.</li>
            <li>Hubby loves this more than I thought he would.  </li>
            <li>have been using the shampoo for more than two weeks, and I can report that Dive Men+Care does add some volume.</li>
            <li>On a marketing standpoint-I also love the design and feel of the bottle itself-very</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect when I got this.</li>
            <li>a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my head feel clean after washing and it has a nice manly/musky scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>And the verdict from someone who is very picky and can get allergic real quickly is: this is really a good one for anyone and a safe one for people who get allergies.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly oily scalp and this shampoo certainly cut through it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;--I have very full and bushy hair, and this gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>The smell is reasonably pleasant but reminded me more of a cologne than natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>But the shampoo does have a nice scent that hints of cologne and left my hair clean and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo lathered well and rinsed easily.</li>
            <li>Goes in and rinses out easily.</li>
            <li>they are strong.</li>
            <li>but this is fine.</li>
            <li>This is a fine shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and it cleaned my shoulder length, fine textured hair</li>
            <li>It seemed to work fine with styling gels and all in all this</li>
            <li>This is of that kind of shampoo (what you&#x27;d get at a hair stylist or what is on the market in most places) and DOES live up to its hype.</li>
            <li>It felt reasonably rich, and coated the head easily.</li>
            <li>though this product is marketed for men, the light, musky scent that doesn&#x27;t linger makes it something that can be used by both of</li>
            <li>(review is based on a free sample).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, it works up a nice lather and cleans my hair very well.</li>
            <li>unless I use some of the more natural shampoos or some of the so called hair loss shampoos (which are mostly herbal and do not regrow hair but can keep the scalp healthy and clean).</li>
            <li>Enjoyed using this shampoo because it lathers very easily and do like the masculine fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Like most men, I don&#x27;t give much thought to shampoo, but the &#x27;good stuff&#x27; is immediately identifiable.  </li>
            <li>I like the mild fragrance just fine on this one.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, clean fragrance, lathers well, and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>It gets my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>Lathers well, with a light, masculine, musky scent - kind of like shaving cream scent.</li>
            <li>Just clean and maybe a bit of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Right now, though, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied by the light scent and the manageable hair.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find shampoo for oily hair, and we still have not found the perfect one, but this shampoo is not it.</li>
            <li>Overall a good shampoo if you follow the precautions.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely and rinses out well, no trouble there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really not bad</li>
            <li>The fragrance of this shampoo is quite mild.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my hair very manageable with these traits staying several hours after using the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It gave the hair a very nice soft but full texture, brought out the color (or hair coloring since I&#x27;m a young looking senior) and did NOT cause an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>This is a very refreshing shampoo that deep cleans the scalp.</li>
            <li>To Dove&#x27;s credit, their men&#x27;s line of products is reasonably priced and feels clean and light.</li>
            <li>Hair is easy to comb through and has a little more volume to it, without the need for more product.</li>
            <li>Kind of dries my scalp out if I use it for more than a few days in a row.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and really Summer like making one think of being outdoors.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s masculine, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>but I am glad to have finally won my point of view especially on such a good brand name.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok, I would say that it does smell masculine but I like the smell</li>
            <li>I rarely even use conditioner after using this product.</li>
            <li>A minty fresh musk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sticking to a gender neutral shampoo that offers a better experience.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos sold on the market are chemicals, with some herbs and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is a very large bottle for the money and it is well worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very manageable and keeps my hair in place better and longer than is normal.</li>
            <li>It gives me the same experience in that it lathers well and rinses easily, and leaves me a fresh, clean feeling on my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After shampooing, my hair was left very clean although perhaps a bit dryer, but it was left with a nice volume after styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband loves the scent and I&#x27;ve found that the scent isn&#x27;t too masculine or strong to be used by a woman.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It feels clean and dry and satisfied.</li>
            <li>After the shower, however, the nice minty undertones were gone and that cheap underarm deodorant-like scent stuck heavy.</li>
            <li>While the end result was clean feeling hair (maybe too much, but more on this later)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use very much to get plenty of lather, and I just let the shampoo sit on my scalp for two or three minutes before rinsing off.  </li>
            <li>He tends to be really picky about all his body care items and I got this on a whim to try and show him that there are other brands that are good also.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it clearly made it fuller and stand higher which is fine, but not what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pretty affordable and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or too feminine.</li>
            <li>In fact, at this point, I am still happy to have any hair on my head, let alone a thick mane of hair.</li>
            <li>Now if only they invented a word for shampoo that also sounds more manly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, please note the size of the bottle here.</li>
            <li>It was not quite the best I&#x27;ve seen, but far above average.</li>
            <li>(I would actually say that the lather is &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34;) and rinses super clean.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this shampoo, as I love the general Dove line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He tried this shampoo and it really added some volume to his hair which he doesn&#x27;t really need, but it also made his hair nice and soft and relaxed the curl so that his hair behaves a little better.</li>
            <li>Hair feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I couldn&#x27;t really detect if it made my head feel fuller or have more volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathered nicely and has a decidedly male fragrance, maybe a little musky, that I found appealing.</li>
            <li>a great job getting your hair clean but might be a bit harsh for people with dry</li>
            <li>Left my hair nice and clean, but dry feeling.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, silky hair with absolutely no body.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does provide for more volume, but it makes scalp itchy and oily sooner than other shampoos, even though it says right on the bottle that it is for oily hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is not magic, it doesn&#x27;t give me full, lush hair, but I DO feel like my hair is more full</li>
            <li>I have used other Dove men products and have loved most of them in the past.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge so this will last dear hubby for some time to come</li>
            <li>I really detect a difference between this &#x27;flavor&#x27; or any of the others in the Dove Men&#x27;s lineup?</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s targeted towards men, this really would work well as a unisex shampoo.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say whether the caffeine makes a difference or not, but it did perform well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shampoo lathers up very well.</li>
            <li>He really likes the fragrance.</li>
            <li>All Dove products we have tried we have really</li>
            <li>and my husband said he really didn&#x27;t notice a change.</li>
            <li>very well adding some moisture</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t add much body.</li>
            <li>That said, it rinses cleanly with no residue seemingly present.</li>
            <li>Reach for this Oxygen Charge for a deep clean experience.  </li>
            <li>It definitely gets my hair clean, squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Decent value for the price.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve gotten him a few manly, good shampoos, he&#x27;s starting to get spoiled.</li>
            <li>lately and have had good results so far.</li>
            <li>Not all men want to smell like a high school gym locker.</li>
            <li>Whether the caffeine caused it or not, when the cleansing was complete, the head of hair was standing upright with a certain dandelion effect.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo, which comes in a large 25.4 ounce bottle, has a masculine cologne-like odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The caffeine in this shampoo, provided that it works, is supposed to make his hair look fuller, which it does, and it&#x27;s supposed to help grow new hair, which he is hoping that it does.</li>
            <li>I am a middle aged male with very fine hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling clean and not weighed down.</li>
            <li>It is clear.</li>
            <li>And, the fragrance is masculine without being &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; if the woman in your life is visiting and needs to use it.</li>
            <li>Once those are used up, I&#x27;ll steer clear of buying body care products whose scent is too feminine or too masculine.  </li>
            <li>Not feminine but not overly masculine either.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Most &amp;#34;Mens&amp;#34; shampoos suffer from overly-musky scent, dark blue coloration, and a general lack of quality.</li>
            <li>It has a faint pine scent which is compatible with most fresh scent soaps.</li>
            <li>price is right, especially for this enormous bottle&lt;br /&gt;--I</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t particularly like ANY kind of scent in my shampoo, but this one is at least pretty manly and not overwhelming...</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really say much else about this shampoo other than what I&#x27;ve already</li>
            <li>I have normal hair and would not use it daily without a conditioner.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a big bottle and for us men with short hair, you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve tried the shampoo, but I like other Dove Men+Care products.  </li>
            <li>I can continue to be a major chick magnet.</li>
            <li>I have sort of a tender scalp and my hair can have major problems (like fallout or allergy)</li>
            <li>I have pretty average hair.</li>
            <li>This one has next to no scent as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle of shampoo and should last a very long time.</li>
            <li>This is a neutral scent, thin gel-like shampoo that lathers well and gives a decent clean.</li>
            <li>Some of the other Dove Men shampoos have much stronger scents.</li>
            <li>mean, it&#x27;s so hard to &#x27;not&#x27; get taken advantage of in the personaly hygiene space considering that so many products are likely more or less the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I am not expecting to have a full head of thick hair, Dove Men+Care does seem to help.</li>
            <li>I would say it made my hair feel soft after my shower and dry</li>
            <li>However, it was able to be subdued by a few passes of the hands along with towel drying, and  produce the usual styled look.</li>

            <li> Lathers well, with a light, masculine, musky scent - kind of like shaving cream scent.</li>
            <li> Just clean and maybe a bit of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> Right now, though, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied by the light scent and the manageable hair.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find shampoo for oily hair, and we still have not found the perfect one, but this shampoo is not it.</li>
            <li> Overall a good shampoo if you follow the precautions.</li>
            <li> It lathers up nicely and rinses out well, no trouble there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really not bad</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this shampoo is quite mild.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my hair very manageable with these traits staying several hours after using the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It gave the hair a very nice soft but full texture, brought out the color (or hair coloring since I&#x27;m a young looking senior) and did NOT cause an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This is a very refreshing shampoo that deep cleans the scalp.</li>
            <li> To Dove&#x27;s credit, their men&#x27;s line of products is reasonably priced and feels clean and light.</li>
            <li> Hair is easy to comb through and has a little more volume to it, without the need for more product.</li>
            <li> Kind of dries my scalp out if I use it for more than a few days in a row.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and really Summer like making one think of being outdoors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s masculine, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> but I am glad to have finally won my point of view especially on such a good brand name.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, I would say that it does smell masculine but I like the smell</li>
            <li> I rarely even use conditioner after using this product.</li>
            <li> A minty fresh musk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sticking to a gender neutral shampoo that offers a better experience.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos sold on the market are chemicals, with some herbs and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a very large bottle for the money and it is well worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very manageable and keeps my hair in place better and longer than is normal.</li>
            <li> It gives me the same experience in that it lathers well and rinses easily, and leaves me a fresh, clean feeling on my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After shampooing, my hair was left very clean although perhaps a bit dryer, but it was left with a nice volume after styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband loves the scent and I&#x27;ve found that the scent isn&#x27;t too masculine or strong to be used by a woman.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It feels clean and dry and satisfied.</li>
            <li> After the shower, however, the nice minty undertones were gone and that cheap underarm deodorant-like scent stuck heavy.</li>
            <li> While the end result was clean feeling hair (maybe too much, but more on this later)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use very much to get plenty of lather, and I just let the shampoo sit on my scalp for two or three minutes before rinsing off.  </li>
            <li> He tends to be really picky about all his body care items and I got this on a whim to try and show him that there are other brands that are good also.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it clearly made it fuller and stand higher which is fine, but not what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty affordable and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or too feminine.</li>
            <li> In fact, at this point, I am still happy to have any hair on my head, let alone a thick mane of hair.</li>
            <li> Now if only they invented a word for shampoo that also sounds more manly!&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, please note the size of the bottle here.</li>
            <li> It was not quite the best I&#x27;ve seen, but far above average.</li>
            <li> (I would actually say that the lather is &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34;) and rinses super clean.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo, as I love the general Dove line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He tried this shampoo and it really added some volume to his hair which he doesn&#x27;t really need, but it also made his hair nice and soft and relaxed the curl so that his hair behaves a little better.</li>
            <li> Hair feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I couldn&#x27;t really detect if it made my head feel fuller or have more volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathered nicely and has a decidedly male fragrance, maybe a little musky, that I found appealing.</li>
            <li> a great job getting your hair clean but might be a bit harsh for people with dry</li>
            <li> Left my hair nice and clean, but dry feeling.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, silky hair with absolutely no body.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does provide for more volume, but it makes scalp itchy and oily sooner than other shampoos, even though it says right on the bottle that it is for oily hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not magic, it doesn&#x27;t give me full, lush hair, but I DO feel like my hair is more full</li>
            <li> I have used other Dove men products and have loved most of them in the past.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge so this will last dear hubby for some time to come</li>
            <li> I really detect a difference between this &#x27;flavor&#x27; or any of the others in the Dove Men&#x27;s lineup?</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s targeted towards men, this really would work well as a unisex shampoo.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say whether the caffeine makes a difference or not, but it did perform well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shampoo lathers up very well.</li>
            <li> He really likes the fragrance.</li>
            <li> All Dove products we have tried we have really</li>
            <li> and my husband said he really didn&#x27;t notice a change.</li>
            <li> very well adding some moisture</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t add much body.</li>
            <li> That said, it rinses cleanly with no residue seemingly present.</li>
            <li> Reach for this Oxygen Charge for a deep clean experience.  </li>
            <li> It definitely gets my hair clean, squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Decent value for the price.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve gotten him a few manly, good shampoos, he&#x27;s starting to get spoiled.</li>
            <li> lately and have had good results so far.</li>
            <li> Not all men want to smell like a high school gym locker.</li>
            <li> Whether the caffeine caused it or not, when the cleansing was complete, the head of hair was standing upright with a certain dandelion effect.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo, which comes in a large 25.4 ounce bottle, has a masculine cologne-like odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The caffeine in this shampoo, provided that it works, is supposed to make his hair look fuller, which it does, and it&#x27;s supposed to help grow new hair, which he is hoping that it does.</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged male with very fine hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling clean and not weighed down.</li>
            <li> It is clear.</li>
            <li> And, the fragrance is masculine without being &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; if the woman in your life is visiting and needs to use it.</li>
            <li> Once those are used up, I&#x27;ll steer clear of buying body care products whose scent is too feminine or too masculine.  </li>
            <li> Not feminine but not overly masculine either.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Most &amp;#34;Mens&amp;#34; shampoos suffer from overly-musky scent, dark blue coloration, and a general lack of quality.</li>
            <li> It has a faint pine scent which is compatible with most fresh scent soaps.</li>
            <li> price is right, especially for this enormous bottle&lt;br /&gt;--I</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t particularly like ANY kind of scent in my shampoo, but this one is at least pretty manly and not overwhelming...</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really say much else about this shampoo other than what I&#x27;ve already</li>
            <li> I have normal hair and would not use it daily without a conditioner.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a big bottle and for us men with short hair, you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried the shampoo, but I like other Dove Men+Care products.  </li>
            <li> I can continue to be a major chick magnet.</li>
            <li> I have sort of a tender scalp and my hair can have major problems (like fallout or allergy)</li>
            <li> I have pretty average hair.</li>
            <li> This one has next to no scent as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle of shampoo and should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is a neutral scent, thin gel-like shampoo that lathers well and gives a decent clean.</li>
            <li> Some of the other Dove Men shampoos have much stronger scents.</li>
            <li> mean, it&#x27;s so hard to &#x27;not&#x27; get taken advantage of in the personaly hygiene space considering that so many products are likely more or less the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I am not expecting to have a full head of thick hair, Dove Men+Care does seem to help.</li>
            <li> I would say it made my hair feel soft after my shower and dry</li>
            <li> However, it was able to be subdued by a few passes of the hands along with towel drying, and  produce the usual styled look.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get to oily or dry, it&#x27;s not super straight or curly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The four stars instead of five is because I really prefer to reduce the number of bottles needed in the shower and usually purchase 3 in 1 products.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair flat.</li>
            <li> Perhaps there is a similar formula for dry hair.</li>
            <li> He has a full head of hair that is thick and has a little curl to it.</li>
            <li> it took a bit too long to feel like it was &#x27;all&#x27; out of the hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t try to be anything other than a basic shampoo.</li>
            <li> but to leave my hair feeling dry and crispy is not a desirable result.</li>
            <li> This was solid, in typical Dove fashion.</li>
            <li> my hair hasn&#x27;t felt much different since I started using it, if anything it&#x27;s felt a little</li>
            <li> However, he has noticed lately that it is thinning out a bit near the crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this product for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plenty of lather, but left my hair feeling dryer than usual.</li>
            <li> It also appear to add some volume to my hair (my hair looked noticeably thinner when I was using the other Dove shampoo).</li>
            <li> For some reason it has never stung my eyes like all other soaps and shampoos do.  </li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t fly-away, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Some men will need just this and those with slightly longer hair will want to grab the matching</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not super fragrant, I dont smell like a bowl of potpourri after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, only this shampoo has a subtle, unobtrusive scent that I would describe as musky and manly.</li>
            <li> We were curious to see if there was any evidence of the invigorating inclusion of caffeine, along with the usual sudsing/cleaning components.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not special in any way either.</li>
            <li> found it did seem to add a little volume too.  </li>
            <li> shampoo&#x27;s scent wasn&#x27;t unpleasant at first.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t smell it after I dried my hair.</li>
            <li> But being the champion of mediocrity is nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> One weird thing, though, is it feels like the slanted lid should open from the other end.</li>
            <li> My hubby usually just buys the cheapest shampoo he can find.</li>
            <li> I do have a dandruff problem, and usually use a Head &amp; Shoulders 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> I could be completely wrong and the only one feeling that.</li>
            <li> As it turns out this Dove result was only guilty of some of these sins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> solid choice among a VERY poor Mens shampoo field.</li>
            <li> At least, that&#x27;s what my intuition tells me.</li>
            <li> at least passable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a minor disappointment.</li>
            <li> There have been several products that he has used in his hair and there have been some where the fragrance is so bad I&#x27;ve had to make him go wash it out because it was making me sick.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong at this price.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible, but I feel like other Dove shampoos exit the hair easier.</li>
            <li> There is a very faint one, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Dove&#x27;s Men+Care Oxygen Charge Shampoo is a good balance between fair pricing and quality. Candidly, with shampoos, I don&#x27;t even know what quality means anymore since it would appear that the distinguishing characteristics between two shampoos is aroma, marketing and price. To Dove&#x27;s credit, their men&#x27;s line of products is reasonably priced and feels clean and light. Which brings me to the Oxygen Charge shampoo...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;could I really detect a difference between this &#x27;flavor&#x27; or any of the others in the Dove Men&#x27;s lineup? Not really. The smell is reasonably pleasant but reminded me more of a cologne than natural fragrance. It&#x27;s masculine, that&#x27;s for sure. While the notion that caffeine could induce hair growth is probably debatable, it didn&#x27;t seem to detract from the experience. This shampoo lathered well and rinsed easily. Lastly, I couldn&#x27;t really detect if it made my head feel fuller or have more volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, it&#x27;s so hard to &#x27;not&#x27; get taken advantage of in the personaly hygiene space considering that so many products are likely more or less the same. But, Dove has made a nice effort here that&#x27;s pretty affordable and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or too feminine. To that end, what more could one want out of shampoo?</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried the shampoo, but I like other Dove Men+Care products.  This doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  Like most men, I don&#x27;t give much thought to shampoo, but the &#x27;good stuff&#x27; is immediately identifiable.  This fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Decent value for the price. This is a neutral scent, thin gel-like shampoo that lathers well and gives a decent clean. Although it&#x27;s targeted towards men, this really would work well as a unisex shampoo. Overall middle-of-the-road is the best description I can give it. It doesn&#x27;t try to be anything other than a basic shampoo. For budget shampoos I prefer Tresseme but this is fine. Nothing fancy and you can&#x27;t go wrong at this price.</li>
            <li> This is a fine shampoo.  We were curious to see if there was any evidence of the invigorating inclusion of caffeine, along with the usual sudsing/cleaning components.  Whether the caffeine caused it or not, when the cleansing was complete, the head of hair was standing upright with a certain dandelion effect.  However, it was able to be subdued by a few passes of the hands along with towel drying, and  produce the usual styled look. That said, it rinses cleanly with no residue seemingly present.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. It has a fresh, clean fragrance, lathers well, and rinses easily. It leaves your hair feeling clean and not weighed down. It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done. Hair is easy to comb through and has a little more volume to it, without the need for more product. I really love this.</li>
            <li> I like the Dove line of Men+Care products.  The fragrances are all similar so there is no conflict. It is definitely not floral or feminine. This is a large bottle of shampoo and should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Foremost, this generous size will keep you in-stock for shampoo for quite awhile. I like that! And, the fragrance is masculine without being &amp;#34;weird&amp;#34; if the woman in your life is visiting and needs to use it. It lathers well (I would actually say that the lather is &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34;) and rinses super clean. Some men will need just this and those with slightly longer hair will want to grab the matching conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice shampoo!</li>
            <li> My husband loves the scent and I&#x27;ve found that the scent isn&#x27;t too masculine or strong to be used by a woman.&lt;br /&gt;I had to try this product myself before reviewing it.  It did a great job of cleaning and didn&#x27;t smell too manly.&lt;br /&gt;I found it did seem to add a little volume too.  Can&#x27;t really say whether the caffeine makes a difference or not, but it did perform well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some scented shampoos and conditioners on the shelf that I know my husband will not use.  Once those are used up, I&#x27;ll steer clear of buying body care products whose scent is too feminine or too masculine.  It&#x27;s better to have products on hand that can be used by both of us.&lt;br /&gt;Even though this product is marketed for men, the light, musky scent that doesn&#x27;t linger makes it something that can be used by both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four stars instead of five is because I really prefer to reduce the number of bottles needed in the shower and usually purchase 3 in 1 products.  Since this is only shampoo, someone with longer hair will still need to apply a conditioner for detangling.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a week and I like it. The smell is nice. Not feminine but not overly masculine either. Goes in and rinses out easily. Hair feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed using this shampoo because it lathers very easily and do like the masculine fragrance.  Reach for this Oxygen Charge for a deep clean experience.  People who use silicone based products - serums, hair creams and/or conditioners - need to clarify their hair once a week, and a shampoo like this one is just the ticket to give your hair a &amp;#34;clean slate.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing, my hair was left very clean although perhaps a bit dryer, but it was left with a nice volume after styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Dove routinely offers excellent quality and value, and this shampoo is just another example.</li>
            <li> Well... it&#x27;s shampoo.  It gets my hair clean.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  Kind of dries my scalp out if I use it for more than a few days in a row.  I won&#x27;t throw it out, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it either (review is based on a free sample).</li>
            <li> My hubby usually just buys the cheapest shampoo he can find. Now that I&#x27;ve gotten him a few manly, good shampoos, he&#x27;s starting to get spoiled. He has a full head of hair that is thick and has a little curl to it. However, he has noticed lately that it is thinning out a bit near the crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He tried this shampoo and it really added some volume to his hair which he doesn&#x27;t really need, but it also made his hair nice and soft and relaxed the curl so that his hair behaves a little better. The caffeine in this shampoo, provided that it works, is supposed to make his hair look fuller, which it does, and it&#x27;s supposed to help grow new hair, which he is hoping that it does. Only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo lathers up very well. He really likes the fragrance. I like it too. I can&#x27;t tolerate a lot of fragrances, especially of they are strong. The fragrance of this shampoo is quite mild. It is a manly scent, musky, I would say. It&#x27;s a nice scent. There have been several products that he has used in his hair and there have been some where the fragrance is so bad I&#x27;ve had to make him go wash it out because it was making me sick. Not this one. I like the mild fragrance just fine on this one.</li>
            <li> Plenty of lather, but left my hair feeling dryer than usual. Plan on using a conditioner after using this, even if you don&#x27;t usually&lt;br /&gt;need to use one.&lt;br /&gt;Scent was pleasant. Left my hair nice and clean, but dry feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a superb shampoo. It makes my head feel clean after washing and it has a nice manly/musky scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I definitely recommend this for any man. I do have a dandruff problem, and usually use a Head &amp; Shoulders 2 in 1. Definitely switching to this, after two weeks of use, I don&#x27;t have any dandruff problems and my head isn&#x27;t itchy. It feels clean and dry and satisfied. This is also going to last me a loooong time, it&#x27;s a big bottle and for us men with short hair, you don&#x27;t have to use much. Give this one a try! I love Dove products.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. It does a great job cleaning my hair, leaves it smelling good for awhile, and definitely leaves it manageable. One weird thing, though, is it feels like the slanted lid should open from the other end. At least, that&#x27;s what my intuition tells me. I could be completely wrong and the only one feeling that. Anyway, back tot he shampoo. The caffeine thing seems interesting. It will be interesting to see what effect that has over the long-term. Right now, though, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied by the light scent and the manageable hair. It&#x27;s a good addition to the Dove Men+ line.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this more than I thought he would.  He tends to be really picky about all his body care items and I got this on a whim to try and show him that there are other brands that are good also.  He finally sees my point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said this foamed nicely while washing his hair and made his scalp feel like it just have a bid dose of moisturizer.  The fragrance is light and really Summer like making one think of being outdoors.  The bottle is huge so this will last dear hubby for some time to come but I am glad to have finally won my point of view especially on such a good brand name.</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged male with very fine hair. In fact, at this point, I am still happy to have any hair on my head, let alone a thick mane of hair. I am always on the hunt for shampoos that add volume, and Dove Men+Care Shampoo, with caffeine and \\&quot;Oxycharge\\&quot; technology, promises to do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the shampoo for more than two weeks, and I can report that Dive Men+Care does add some volume. I don&#x27;t need to use very much to get plenty of lather, and I just let the shampoo sit on my scalp for two or three minutes before rinsing off.  The caffeine is supposed to promote growth and the oxycharge technology removes oil and residue. The shampoo, which comes in a large 25.4 ounce bottle, has a masculine cologne-like odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am not expecting to have a full head of thick hair, Dove Men+Care does seem to help. I am encouraged by the results, and will continue to use so I can continue to be a major chick magnet.</li>
            <li> Lathers well, with a light, masculine, musky scent - kind of like shaving cream scent. Now if only they invented a word for shampoo that also sounds more manly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How well does the caffeine work? My hair stays awake until 3 a.m.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does provide for more volume, but it makes scalp itchy and oily sooner than other shampoos, even though it says right on the bottle that it is for oily hair. It is hard to find shampoo for oily hair, and we still have not found the perfect one, but this shampoo is not it.</li>
            <li> This is a very large bottle for the money and it is well worth it in the end. Smells great and makes my hair very manageable with these traits staying several hours after using the product. I have used other Dove men products and have loved most of them in the past. On a marketing standpoint-I also love the design and feel of the bottle itself-very masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this price you cant beat giving it a try!</li>
            <li> This is a very refreshing shampoo that deep cleans the scalp. A couple of precautions though. This is best for oily hair or normal hair. I have normal hair and would not use it daily without a conditioner. Although the description states it to be creamy, it is not. It is clear. Perhaps there is a similar formula for dry hair. The scent is somewhat minty which I like. Overall a good shampoo if you follow the precautions.</li>
            <li> My husband really liked this shampoo.  All Dove products we have tried we have really liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This products is marketed for a  man, but both my husband and I liked this product.  I would say it made my hair feel soft after my shower and dry and my husband said he really didn&#x27;t notice a change. It lathers up nicely and rinses out well, no trouble there. The smell is ok, I would say that it does smell masculine but I like the smell and it wouldn&#x27;t deter me from using it.  My husband said he thought it smelled good.</li>
            <li> My husband has used many of the Dove Men&#x27;s Care products and has liked them all. This oxygen charge shampoo is no exception. I had to try it in order to write a review and it cleaned my shoulder length, fine textured hair very well adding some moisture so it wasn&#x27;t fly-away, without weighing it down. It lathered nicely and has a decidedly male fragrance, maybe a little musky, that I found appealing. It&#x27;s fairly mild and not overpowering. I couldn&#x27;t smell it after I dried my hair. Let&#x27;s face it, these Dove hair products all work equally well on both men and women&#x27;s hair, only the fragrances are different. And that&#x27;s a good thing because my husband doesn&#x27;t have to go around smelling like a bouquet of flowers.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect when I got this. I had to look up the purpose of putting caffeine in shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really not bad but it&#x27;s really not special in any way either. I have pretty average hair. It doesn&#x27;t get to oily or dry, it&#x27;s not super straight or curly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now. It definitely gets my hair clean, squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;But my hair hasn&#x27;t felt much different since I started using it, if anything it&#x27;s felt a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it&#x27;s not super fragrant, I dont smell like a bowl of potpourri after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really say much else about this shampoo other than what I&#x27;ve already said.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell flowery or overly fragrant. Just clean and maybe a bit of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job getting your hair clean but might be a bit harsh for people with dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say if you have oily hair or use a lot of greasy product this is a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this product for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--the price is right, especially for this enormous bottle&lt;br /&gt;--I don&#x27;t particularly like ANY kind of scent in my shampoo, but this one is at least pretty manly and not overwhelming...good enough!&lt;br /&gt;--I have very full and bushy hair, and this gets the job done.  I rarely even use conditioner after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using [[ASIN:B000RYYI7K Dove Hair Therapy Daily Moisture Shampoo]] lately and have had good results so far. The Dove Men+Care Oxygen Charge Shampoo is no exception. It gives me the same experience in that it lathers well and rinses easily, and leaves me a fresh, clean feeling on my hair. However, only this shampoo has a subtle, unobtrusive scent that I would describe as musky and manly. It also appear to add some volume to my hair (my hair looked noticeably thinner when I was using the other Dove shampoo). Overall, I really like this shampoo. It cleans well and smells manly, and adds some volume to my hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo, as I love the general Dove line. Most &amp;#34;Mens&amp;#34; shampoos suffer from overly-musky scent, dark blue coloration, and a general lack of quality. As it turns out this Dove result was only guilty of some of these sins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo&#x27;s scent wasn&#x27;t unpleasant at first. A minty fresh musk. It didn&#x27;t seem too overpowering. After the shower, however, the nice minty undertones were gone and that cheap underarm deodorant-like scent stuck heavy. It was a minor disappointment. Not all men want to smell like a high school gym locker. I&#x27;ll give the scent a 6/10 however, for being at least passable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather is what I looked for next. This was solid, in typical Dove fashion. It felt reasonably rich, and coated the head easily. It was not quite the best I&#x27;ve seen, but far above average. I&#x27;d say a 8/10 is fair for lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next criteria is its cleansing ability. While the end result was clean feeling hair (maybe too much, but more on this later) it took a bit too long to feel like it was &#x27;all&#x27; out of the hair. It wasn&#x27;t horrible, but I feel like other Dove shampoos exit the hair easier. Still it deserves a 7/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it leaves the hair feeling is the ultimate test, however... and this is where the biggest flaw comes. The shampoo claims to be a oxygen cleaning shampoo, but it left my hair feeling a bit like straw. I have a fairly oily scalp and this shampoo certainly cut through it. For that I give it applause... but to leave my hair feeling dry and crispy is not a desirable result. And for this reason I leave it with a 3-Star score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A solid choice among a VERY poor Mens shampoo field. But being the champion of mediocrity is nothing to brag about. I&#x27;ll be sticking to a gender neutral shampoo that offers a better experience.</li>
            <li> First, please note the size of the bottle here. The standard one I see in the store for Dove Men is 12 ounces; this one is 25.4 ounces. So, it&#x27;s chunky, but also a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it works up a nice lather and cleans my hair very well. I have very fine, silky hair with absolutely no body. This shampoo is not magic, it doesn&#x27;t give me full, lush hair, but I DO feel like my hair is more full than it has been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the scent is very light. Some of the other Dove Men shampoos have much stronger scents. Granted, they aren&#x27;t floral, feminine scents, but they are still there. This one has next to no scent as far as I can tell. There is a very faint one, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I have sort of a tender scalp and my hair can have major problems (like fallout or allergy) unless I use some of the more natural shampoos or some of the so called hair loss shampoos (which are mostly herbal and do not regrow hair but can keep the scalp healthy and clean). I decided to try this Dove shampoo. And the verdict from someone who is very picky and can get allergic real quickly is: this is really a good one for anyone and a safe one for people who get allergies. I let my foster son try it and he didn&#x27;t like the smell. I found nothing wrong with it or that notable about the smell. It gave the hair a very nice soft but full texture, brought out the color (or hair coloring since I&#x27;m a young looking senior) and did NOT cause an allergic reaction. NOW when it comes to shampoos, read the ingredients. Most shampoos sold on the market are chemicals, with some herbs and natural ingredients. This is of that kind of shampoo (what you&#x27;d get at a hair stylist or what is on the market in most places) and DOES live up to its hype.</li>
            <li> Well it does give volume...but it turns out, that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for. I have curly hair and it clearly made it fuller and stand higher which is fine, but not what I was looking for.  But the shampoo does have a nice scent that hints of cologne and left my hair clean and smelling great.  It seemed to work fine with styling gels and all in all this is a nice shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a gel like consistency. It lathers up well.  For some reason it has never stung my eyes like all other soaps and shampoos do.  It has a faint pine scent which is compatible with most fresh scent soaps. It leaves my hair very manageable and keeps my hair in place better and longer than is normal. It also leaves my hair flat. I doesn&#x27;t add much body. The shampoo adds softness to my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too shiny.</li>
