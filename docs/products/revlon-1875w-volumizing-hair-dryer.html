            <li>Both work great.</li>

            <li>Great hair dryer for a great price.</li>
            <li>Not too happy will contact amazon</li>
            <li>Interesting to see others say theirs caught fire as mine did too, while it was in my hand!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Very nice Revlon hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Very nice unit.</li>
            <li>very happy happy happy with this product :)</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m glad my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire!!! :)</li>
            <li>The air on it is strong and perfect.</li>
            <li>VERY STRONG!</li>
            <li>They have contacted Revlon without good customer service.  </li>
            <li>Loved that it had three heat settings and two speeds.</li>
            <li>and I could not believe how good my hair felt afterwards.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li>Good when working.  </li>
            <li>, so I thought it would be good.  </li>
            <li>Seeing it recommended as one of the best by Consumer Reports just confirmed what I already thought.  </li>
            <li>My Rusk 1900 watt ceramic dryer blows this dryer away, but it isn&#x27;t fair to compare an $80 dryer to something that now costs $15.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>good price.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent packing and shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Runs</li>
            <li>Good hair dryer</li>
            <li>Good while it lasted</li>
            <li>good question, b/c it stops working.</li>
            <li>Does a good job for the price.</li>
            <li>Nice product.....works great</li>
            <li>Sliding buttons on the handle with separate controls for temperature and wind speed are good features.  </li>
            <li>good price and product</li>
            <li>Good Good Good Good item.</li>
            <li>This is also good price.</li>
            <li>Fair power.</li>
            <li>Considering the price price, it&#x27;s a good quality product.</li>
            <li>A perfect and light hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Every hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had dies like this eventually - looking for one as good as this that won&#x27;t blow up or catch fire though.</li>
            <li>This one is so great because it has lots of power AND the blower settings(low and high) are separate from the heat settings(cool, warm, and hot).I use the hotel provided dryers when I travel and am always so happy to get home to the best blow dryer ever.</li>
            <li>nothing exceptional.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Bought a Conair online and am very pleased with that.</li>
            <li>She is very pleased with the unit.</li>
            <li>The volumizer works really good, makes my hair even thicker, wish it came with a comb tho, but its good, and i love it...</li>
            <li>Many fabulous features &amp; perfect for my use.</li>
            <li>Excellent very responsible</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer!</li>
            <li>But wait, there&#x27;s more!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>Love this dryer!</li>
            <li>Love this dryer!</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>As time went on, it just doesn&#x27;t even get hot anymore at all, warm at best.</li>
            <li>For someone who lives in Miami, Florida and where humidity is 1000%, this blow dryer works amazing.      </li>
            <li>Packaging was great and secure in the box.</li>
            <li>(Granted, I always keep in on the &#x27;Warm&#x27; setting.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Now she has her own blow dryer and won&#x27;t have to share.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking at the review of others and my own experience  </li>
            <li>Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li>The hairdryer has never been dropped and I keep it stored in my own cupboard so that the kids could never accidentally find it and play with it without me knowing.</li>
            <li>Since I started using it people have been commenting on how nice my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>Soon it pops, hisses, and glows a nice yellow-red color before shutting off.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the attachments and don&#x27;t think I will need to - a nice bonus but</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled to find that it was still on the market.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>I have  to use this at my own risk because I don&#x27;t have a replacement, but I&#x27;m on my way to trying to find something that might not cause my hair to catch fire.</li>
            <li>Great dryer for such a wonderful price.</li>
            <li>Good price.very pleased</li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer because I liked the design.  </li>
            <li>The ion button switches off on its own.  </li>
            <li>I like to bring my own hair dryer</li>
            <li>a nice Price too</li>
            <li>The cool shot button is great for taming those frizzy bits.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, good quality.</li>
            <li>Hair dryer works great and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Very easy to switch the tops.</li>
            <li>I love the adjustable heat, I love the attachments and works and lasts for years!</li>
            <li>Anyway, nice dryer:)</li>
            <li>It works great,  but can the cable caught fire at the right by where the cable meets the dryer.  </li>
            <li>My original of this hairdryer, which I loved, died and I was crestfallen when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>Works great for over a month now and easy to clean the intake on the end of dust.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe I had found such a great quality product for a great price.</li>
            <li>is product is great, and is worth more than the price I payed.</li>
            <li>The first time my husband used this dryer, it seemed great.</li>
            <li>The price was great and the item arrived in a timely manner and exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li>It works good, dries my hair quickly with adjustive speed and temprature   </li>
            <li>I really liked the configuration of the buttons, and they are easy to slide to change the settings.  </li>
            <li>The dryer itself is fairly lightweight with a comfortable grip and easy to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it is ok.</li>
            <li>Anyway, OK dryer.  </li>
            <li>And it will be better if the handle is foldable</li>
            <li>Fortunately, nothing caught fire!</li>
            <li>love the settings, how well it dries my hair without frizziness and the variety of settings.</li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with this transaction.  </li>
            <li>Can you actually love an appliance?</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent dryer, it has various speeds and temperatures.  </li>
            <li>and this did nothing to either better or worsen my frizziness.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before I purchased it and it seemed others weren&#x27;t sure what it did for them either.  </li>
            <li>However, it think it has more to do with the hair brush you are using and</li>
            <li>This is a good dryer and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Gradually I started noticing more and more breakage from the heat damage.  </li>
            <li>OK, don&#x27;t use it on the highest setting, lesson learned.  </li>
            <li>Got it as a present and it has been the best hair dryer for her ever.</li>
            <li>price was great and it was shipped in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>My hair looks wonderful, shiny, smooth and feels soft.</li>
            <li>Love the attachments, helps with styling versitility.</li>
            <li>i was so pleased with this dryer, it gave my hair a thicker look.</li>
            <li>better price than walmart.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m glad the thing is gone.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing</li>
            <li>I use to love this hair dryer, I even bought it twice...</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what happend.  </li>
            <li>(yes, I saved all evidence) and I expect as there are many complaints about this product they will soon recall it.      </li>
            <li>(It didn&#x27;t smell like burning hair, more like home perm solution.)</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re paying ... more for a gimmick.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the weight of it</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want another one of these even if it was free!  </li>
            <li>Love the attachments it comes with.</li>
            <li>This is probably not the only dryer that will give these kinds of results and it&#x27;s probably not the best.  </li>
            <li>whatever it is, it sure seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>that is has 3 heat settings so is more versatile than some dryers.  </li>
            <li>I love Revlon products</li>
            <li>I love this and</li>
            <li>glad I purchased it</li>
            <li>Ok - so I had this hair dryer for about 2 years?  </li>
            <li>Or possibly more gray hair coming in, plus hair can change as you age.</li>
            <li>Dryer lasts for many years.</li>
            <li>There are better dryers for the price, if that&#x27;s your deciding factor.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is as healthy as ever though I do use a heat protectant.</li>
            <li>I am sure the hair dyer is defective</li>
            <li>I chose this product over the Conair product because this had more options in the heat/air level settings.</li>
            <li>This dryer, although the buttons are located in about the same spots, I did not have any problems with the dryer turning off while I was using it, which is a very great thing!  </li>
            <li>I bought a Conair in the interim and love that dryer.  </li>
            <li>Wish it had more attachments.</li>
            <li>This dryer works great, and I really like the diffuser attachment.  </li>
            <li>I am fully pleased with the dryer, however the dryer pictured is not what I recieved.  </li>
            <li>Has always been my favorite blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Top rated by consumer reports.</li>
            <li>I had it for many years before it gave out.  </li>
            <li>I love  the attachments too.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this hairdryer; better yet, try another brand.</li>
            <li>Not too sure about the shine thing??</li>
            <li>Wish it had more power then it did and just felt</li>
            <li>I love how all of the reviews are either</li>
            <li>and it had lasted more then 5 years</li>
            <li>I love the controls - separate for temp and power.</li>
            <li>I love the removable filter.</li>
            <li>I love the attachments that come with it</li>
            <li>sadly, many hairs fell to the floor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But so far, so good!</li>
            <li>I thought it was GOOD that it got so hot that my hair held its shape better.  </li>
            <li>Super nice hair dryer:)</li>
            <li>Heat is good and handles great while using to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>I loved it at first...</li>
            <li>The amount of heat is pretty good</li>
            <li>This works out pretty good.  </li>
            <li>First, let me state that this is a good hairdryer.</li>
            <li>It is priced affordably but has many options and handles easily.  </li>
            <li>(A) this is the best hair dryer ever, it&#x27;s super hot and dries my hair very fast</li>
            <li>every which-way on the top of my head that I would need to smooth over with product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the sound is ok</li>
            <li>Thought the ion &amp; ceremic features would be key for giving me, as we all hope for ...  healthy &amp; beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li>Mostly purchased this for the diffuser attachment which i enjoy.</li>
            <li>and she loved it so much.</li>
            <li>It does not have that much power as I wish it had when I bought it,but every thing else is good</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I have read online that many people have experienced the same situation.  </li>
            <li>heat controls are easy to access</li>
            <li>So easy to just order on-line.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;wind\\&quot; power isn&#x27;t as strong, either, even on the highest setting.  </li>
            <li>Perfectly competent (nothing &amp;#34;ionically&amp;#34; special) while working.</li>
            <li>Just arrived, although its cheap, it is good value for money, lots of settings to choose from, dried my hair evenly, great buy.</li>
            <li>This dryer is nice, it gets hot and does the job.</li>
            <li>The top button lets me adjust the temperature from cool, warm to hot.  </li>
            <li>I guess if you take that into consideration, this works fine if you have loads of time in the morning.  </li>
            <li>but my hair seemed fine</li>
            <li>Nothing out of the ordinary--dried my hair just fine.  </li>
            <li>and I have a ton of fine hair.</li>
            <li>The buttons moved easily, and the dryer&#x27;s handle was comfortable to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its light weight and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>Light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I feel lucky that nothing happened to me, apart from a life-long fear of hair driers!</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and this dryer works great with the diffuser to dry it after a shower :)</li>
            <li>I am not kidding, I still have a huge scare.</li>
            <li>I too had a HUGE problem with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Well my hair was soft and healthy looking after just one use, it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s great when it works, however, this is our third one.  </li>
            <li>But with the multiple settings and the air-flow nozzle, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Its so light weight my arm doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Light to hold</li>
            <li>No frizz, not fried, just smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Great for anything you woud throw at it with at-home use, but definitely not Pro/Salon quality.</li>
            <li>Also,good for the price - great for short hair.</li>
            <li>I thought, this thing is going to light my head on fire.</li>
            <li>I bought this drier because my last Revlon drier was great.  </li>
            <li>Great product, works well and is fairly quiet.</li>
            <li>Works great &amp; will do so on low speeds.</li>
            <li>this dryer works, it is great, but this is not the only review reporting fireworks shooting out of the cord connection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I am also a chemistry student, and I am quite perplexed by the ion button.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and made in China.  </li>
            <li>We bought it for about $30, but now the replacement is available on Amazon for about $15.  </li>
            <li>Dries nicely and fast.</li>
            <li>The great product &amp; low price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I keep buying the same one because it fits my hand perfectly and the buttons are placed such that it&#x27;s very easy for me to adjust them while drying.  </li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>This little hottie also turns healthy, beautiful hair into crispy, damaged sh&amp;*--EVEN WHEN YOU HOLD THE DAMNED THING</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t understand the disconnect between user reviews and my own experience versus high ratings for this model in Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li>I use the warm &amp; high settings.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>but the more I used the dryer I realized the intense heat was burning off and damaging my hair!  </li>
            <li>Not user friendly.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser always comments on the great health of my long hair</li>
            <li>I love the first one, lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li>Actually, it is not a bad deal, because the dryer is so cheap.  </li>
            <li>Love the setting controls; I use the warm, high setting and it leaves my hair really soft and healthy looking with no frizz.</li>
            <li>I needed one quick and it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I love that it has so may options and the cool blast button really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown away dryers just because I couldn&#x27;t clean them.</li>
            <li>I keep it clean and store it in a holder</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, lightweight, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Had this exact dryer for many years, finally cord got a break in it but dryer still worked good.  </li>
            <li>I gave this dryer a 5 because I am very satisfied with the speed that it dries and how soft and smooth my hair is right afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t sit it right on your hair people!  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be good as I have fine long hair.</li>
            <li>Indeed, very high quality, and quite handsome.  </li>
            <li>Dryer works great but be careful with cord.</li>
            <li>Was happy to find the exact same model was still being built and received it a couple weeks ago, works</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is relatively good and considering the price is so low</li>
            <li>Then it would be cool for a minute and overheat again.  </li>
            <li>I would let it cool off and begin using it again.</li>
            <li>this hair dryer was a good for about a year, until today when sparks started fyling and smoke came pouring out the back.</li>
            <li>The real reason why I chose this ionic dryer is because I love Revlon&#x27;s button configuration.</li>
            <li>Much faster than before without the static and damage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thankful for the safety feature, but have returned the item for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>hair dryer is light and powerful.  </li>
            <li>There are 3 temperature features and a bonus cool shot&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Both are probably true.  </li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It is the right size for me and not too many features to confuse me but enough to do the job - and nicely.  </li>
            <li>Other reviews seem to be great</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews here, I feel lucky not to have experienced sparks or flames.</li>
            <li>For the first two months of owning this hair dryer, it did a fine job.  </li>
            <li>I also think it is great that it comes with the concentrator attachment to help get your hair extra straight.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;ion\\&quot; switch is nothing more than a gimmick and anyone who reports miraculous transformation of their frizzies is most likely experiencing a placebo effect.</li>
            <li>The dryer is adequate and dries your hair.</li>
            <li>Luckily my children were not using this when it happened.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly and without frizz.</li>
            <li>Great hair dryer so far for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>It was very hot</li>
            <li>Very fast!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Also the cord is a good length-about 5 1/2  to 6 ft. long.</li>
            <li>It has the high and low and warm and hot buttons which are nice.  </li>
            <li>I used this hair dryer for the first time yesterday and I absolutely fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I was also presently suprised that it was so light compared to my travel hairdryer!!</li>
            <li>one week before I purchased my professional Solano Super X (\\&quot;SSX\\&quot;) for (for more money).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon has such a easy return .</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and lots of it</li>
            <li>This hairdryer works fine, is light to handle and not too loud.  </li>
            <li>And the whole thing is light enough.lastic.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one because it looked cheap, reasonable, and a friend recommended me to use Revlon.</li>
            <li>Does the job very well and is light to handle.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight but feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I did not think the ionic would be such an amazing feature untill</li>
            <li>The different setting selection is nice.</li>
            <li>Product purchased about one month ago and so far we are pleased.</li>
            <li>Powerful.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old Revlon drier still works, but has seen better days.</li>
            <li>I checked them all out and decided to stick with Revlon because I love my old travel blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever write customer reviews, but this one seemed to warrant it.</li>
            <li>Personally love the product compares to the old dryer that I have.</li>
            <li>I have purchased 2 of these, one for myself that I&#x27;ve used about a year now, and a second one for my mom because I loved mine that much.</li>
            <li>But I still think I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Liked the different settings it offered and figured Revlon would have a quality hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and I liked the different attachments and settings.</li>
            <li>powerful wind</li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t stand it any more, I started using my old non-ionic blow dryer.</li>
            <li>After about 5 weeks it will not heat up only blows barely warm air.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and the wait.</li>
            <li>Anyway, so I bought this one because it looked like a good dryer, it claimed on the box that it was \\&quot;americas #1 selling hairdryer\\&quot;, and i was curious about the ion feature.  </li>
            <li>Since I really liked the dryer &amp; the attachments, I decided to give it a 2nd shot &amp; purchase another.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I was hitting the cool shot button all the time</li>
            <li>However, it is a bit noisy and it crapped out on me pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I realize now that this dryer was working so quickly because it was WAY too hot, even on the medium setting.</li>
            <li>I switched from high heat (which had been fine with my Conair) to the medium setting, and the smell went away, but the damage continued.</li>
            <li>Indeed, I loved it when I first got it, so much so that I bought a second one to have should this one burn out</li>
            <li>With any force, they pop right out.  </li>
            <li>With any force, they pop right out.  </li>
            <li>AND* SEVERELY BURNING YOUR RIGHT HAND/</li>
            <li>I would point this out to hairdressers but no one seemed to have the right answer to fix the problem</li>
            <li>and I have just not noticed because I&#x27;m not looking right at it while I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li>The package arrived and I was thrilled that the ones ordered were exactly the same</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t dry any more quickly even though the thing is easily twice as large and has ion technology.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter than my last dryer, and very easy to manage.</li>
            <li>The best method for achieving this was to use the highest heat and fastest setting on wet hair until the hair is damp, then to finish drying my hair with the air-flow nozzle on low speed and medium heat while using a rollerbrush to hold the hair straight and curl the ends.         </li>
            <li>I like the setting options: cool, warm, or hot; and low or high.</li>
            <li>I think it dries my hair a little bit faster than my last dryer, and my hair feels Great!</li>
            <li>the good new is, I can keep using my flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I live in South Florida, and this dryer works super fast and makes my hair look silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I still see my hair kind of frizzy when I dry it.  </li>
            <li>Frys hair quickly without frozzoes thanks to ion setting.  </li>
            <li>Also, my old travel dryer easily got hotter than this one.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is not only quiet compared to the others, it dries hair in no time, great buy,</li>
            <li>I have great &#x27;first day&#x27; hair, &#x27;second day&#x27; hair, even &#x27;third day&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>Dry&#x27;s hair quickly, looks great and is not very loud.</li>
            <li>My hair looks better than it did when I used my previous dryer-shinier and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for six months and felt compelled to write because most commercial stores don&#x27;t sell quality hair dryers like this one.</li>
            <li>but this is my first dryer with that option</li>
            <li>and I noticed two things: more even drying (not just dryer in the part of my hair closest to the dryer, but even further out) and softer/smoother texture, with the ion setting.</li>
            <li>I needed my hair perfect, like if we were going out, that means I left it in a Turbie for 30-45 min instead of my usual day-to-day 10 min.  </li>
            <li>Unit started smoking and was about to catch fire on first use.  </li>
            <li>With this dryer, I&#x27;m done in 20 minutes and my hair looks smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have better &#x27;second day&#x27; hair - drying</li>
            <li>The diffusser stays attached securely and it&#x27;s not that loud.</li>
            <li>I love that it has different controls for the temperature and speed.</li>
            <li>Thanks Revlon!</li>
            <li>After about a year, first one burned a hole in the cord where the cord and handle meet.  </li>
            <li>Hope to have better luck with a different brand....</li>
            <li>The real test, however, will be this summer in the NYC (subways!)</li>
            <li>So... it never died, but it did become possessed, so some element of the afterlife is definitely evident.  </li>
            <li>the first time I thought it was a freak accident..</li>
            <li>The dryer did not feel overly hot</li>
            <li>, it was only about 5 bucks more?  </li>
            <li>I looked at my brush and the dryer and my sink and saw that the dryer had burned off whole sections of my hair!  </li>
            <li>Personally like the dryer, but the power cord at the top can get bent and short out the dryer if it is used for many hours.  </li>
            <li>I have owned many hair dryers but not one has ever had an internal explosion.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what they she wanted.</li>
            <li>The drier works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>The first lasted 5 years+.  </li>
            <li>One day it just started switching to a warm/cool setting even though it was set to hot.</li>
            <li>On the 5TH DAY of use EVER, this drier burned off a WHOLE SECTION of my hair!</li>
            <li>I smelled burning and turned off the drier, ran my hand over my hair and the whole section fell to the floor!  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this one and says it works like a charm!</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever using a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my sister&#x27;s hair (being my first time ever using a blow dryer) and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>My sister purchased this hair dryer first</li>
            <li>The electric motor is pretty exposed to dust and debris which is probably the reason that it started failing.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely pleased with this hair dryer.       </li>
            <li>I do not use it on the highest setting because it seems too hot.</li>
            <li>As it turns out, the area where the cord attaches to the handle got so hot that it melted through the plastic coating, exposing about a half-inch of singed wires.</li>
            <li>Then the handle became so hot</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the hot heat deformed the plastic attachment to where it wouldn&#x27;t click to the dryer.</li>
            <li>I wiggled the cord and it started blowing hot air again.  </li>
            <li>I tried to shop locally but, the exact product was close to $10 more</li>
            <li>This is light, quiet, effective, several options for heat and speed settings.  </li>
            <li>Taking the filter off the back creates better air intake</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to take.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer gets HOT.</li>
            <li>but today I noticed that it sparked when it got hot then</li>
            <li>Do not buy this product the only reason the star rating is colored in is because I wasn&#x27;t able to post with out it</li>
            <li>Biggest upside is that it dried my hair well and reliably for a very long time, and was an excellent value.  </li>
            <li>When I asked her after several months of usage she said it&#x27;s great and work like a lot of high end blue</li>
            <li>I live in an area that has high summertime humidity and my hair is fine and tends to frizz a bit on the ends.</li>
            <li>After using it for 6 months (always on the warm settling, not hot), it fried my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not willing to risk catching my hair on fire.</li>
            <li>Old reliable wins for me!</li>
            <li>I have noticed a slight difference in the texture of my hair after drying, but I think that is due to the cool function on the dryer (better than most - cool air is expended almost immediately), rather than the ion feature.  </li>
            <li>Wife likes it; light enough&#x27; powerful</li>
            <li>haha funny either</li>
            <li>Over time, I noticed my hair was becoming brittle and coarse and was thinning out.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer only lasted 6 months and the electric cord started becoming detached from the hair dryer on the inside, causing interruptions in air flow while drying my hair.</li>
            <li>Also, I color my hair with semi-permanent coloring, and the now frizzy ends absorb more of the coloring, giving a strange look.</li>
            <li>Also, the medium heat setting was a bit too hot, and it sucked in too much hair, requiring me once to disassemble the unit for removal.</li>
            <li>I liked the previous one Revlon 1875</li>
            <li>I quickly unplugged it before it completely caught on fire.  </li>
            <li>At first, after I bought it, I really liked how quickly it dried my hair.</li>
            <li>but there are large parts rattling around inside now.</li>
            <li>the cord split where it meets the dryer and a large set of sparks and horrid smell of burning electric permeated my house.</li>
            <li>I Just got a new hair cut and and this is the dryer for curly hair it gave me the right temp.</li>
            <li>it blows very hard and the temperatures are great.</li>
            <li>I then realize that even the grip is hot and that the snake of smoke coming out of the end of the blow dryer is a death knell for my brand new device!  </li>
            <li>Many of the other stylers/dryers are WAY too hot.</li>
            <li>The low speed is sufficient and the high speed is strong enough to do a through job without being too strong.</li>
            <li>A bit large in the hand, but light enough not to be cumbersome.</li>
            <li>And the whole thing is light enough.</li>
            <li>i was getting ready for my day</li>
            <li>The company wants us ot pay $20 to pack it up and ship the unit in.  </li>
            <li>I started out really liking this dryer</li>
            <li>I like to get it as straight and \\&quot;clean\\&quot; as I can.  </li>
            <li>The three levels of temperature control are very helpful.</li>
            <li>I also really like the fact the ion control can be turned off and on.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a dryer just buy this one, its absolutely great!It delivers everything it promises.</li>
            <li>My hair much is smoother, shinier and the (split)</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really worry about it.  </li>
            <li>The ion feature really does seem to work and since I&#x27;ve used this dryer, I do not even need to put styling creme on the ends of my hair to keep them in place and de-frizzed.</li>
            <li>not so much the dryer.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>My hair has a smoother texture and is much softer with this blowdryer.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in the texture of my hair with this dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much bulkier and heavier than I would have prefered.</li>
            <li>Much louder than any others I have used.  </li>
            <li>Last one the cord worked free from dryer and it was shooting sparks out of cord.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read the reviews and have to admit I really don&#x27;t understand the Ion thing but</li>
            <li>That alone is worth the modest investment in this product.</li>
            <li>and it does a much easier job then doing it by hand.</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe I was responsible for these failures, that my coiling the cable was damaging the wiring.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this dryer, and I really like the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li>It does what it says, drys it in much shorter time, and a much healthier feel...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll let you know, but again thanks to all the reviews they really helped in making my purchase.</li>
            <li>They work great when they actually do work, but be prepared for it to only last about a year.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>it took much longer to blow-dry my hair and the ionic thing does nothing for it.  </li>
            <li>The diffuser attachment worked very well w/my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I also like to blow out my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Very \\&quot;iffy\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I am going to buy another one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>really gives the hair a boost, så can absolutly recommend it:)&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like the tools it comes with...</li>
            <li>and I really like the attachments.</li>
            <li>The customer support worked very well.</li>
            <li>the multitude of setting combinations allow me to control how my hair dries- its naturally very wavy and gets frizzy fast, but i haven&#x27;t had any issues like that with this dryer yet.</li>
            <li>I kind of like this because my hair doesn&#x27;t blow everywhere when I&#x27;m using my round brush.  </li>
            <li>I saw reports of \\&quot;sparks\\&quot; and singed hair and will be on the lookout for those things, but so far I&#x27;m extremely pleased and may order a second one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>The old one finally gave up after many years of use.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast, but as far as the &amp;#34;shine boosting&amp;#34; - no dryer does that, you&#x27;ve got to use the right hair products.  </li>
            <li>One year later, It began shorting out and getting super hot at the connection.</li>
            <li>When I needed a new dryer to put in a guest bath, it was my first choice.</li>
            <li>The warm setting is a perfect temperature for me, not to sound silly but, not to hot, and not to cold.</li>
            <li>Okay, maybe not exactly explode, but very close.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, not thick or coarse, so maybe that makes a difference in my</li>
            <li>From other reviews, I would say don&#x27;t buy it if you want a hair dryer that lasts more than a year to two years max.</li>
            <li>Overall, totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>Perhaps in an attempt to correct this, Revlon scaled back the heat output significantly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad mine never shot sparks like the other reviews I saw</li>
            <li>Big and powerful!</li>
            <li>I read the first few reviews at the time &amp; everyone seemed to love it.</li>
            <li>The removable back allows you to clean all the lent and stuff that gets in there over time.</li>
            <li>Then I began to notice after I showered and started to comb my wet hair a lot more hair than normal was falling out.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length fine straight hair, and the ends became dry and frizzy and began to break off.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, breaks easily, and gets a little frizzy when I try to blow dry it.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone considering it, and the price is definitely right!</li>
            <li>I say this because my dryer doesn&#x27;t seem to get nearly as hot as my old, non-ion dryer.  </li>
            <li>On the first use (following their instruction booklet exactly), this dryer burned off whole sections of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I LIKE THE HEAT SETTINGS, ESPECIALLY THE COOL SETTING</li>
            <li>Simple blow dryer with cool function</li>
            <li>As soon as I find a suitable live subject, I will be testing this hypothesis.</li>
            <li>but once I went back to my old hair dryer, my hair was fine.  </li>
            <li>The hairdryer when working,  didn&#x27;t do as good a job as my little travel hair dryer that is only 1250 watts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I have a huge section of dry, burned hair that I have been growing out for months-</li>
            <li>This dryer cuts the time in half or more, depending on how finicky I want to be about the look.</li>
            <li>I thought I had a fairly decent blowdryer...until it died.  </li>
            <li>A decent dryer for the price.</li>
            <li>I had this dryer for 2 months and the handle got too hot to hold after about one minute, then the handle starting melting because it was too hot</li>
            <li>This blowdryer is much better than any I&#x27;ve ever tried, it&#x27;s even better than the really expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer just a few months ago, and when I got it I truly loved it, then it started to be inconsistent with the heat, despite cleaning it regularly and taking care of it, then one morning it sounded like a chainsaw was in my dryer, then it just shorted out and stopped working.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any more hair breakage than the next person, several stylists have complemented me over the years on the health of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the mid setting on this dryer is just perfect for me- not too hot or too cold.</li>
            <li>Much quieter than my last dryer to the point I wondered if it was working right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>But it seems like the high setting should be the medium setting.    </li>
            <li>It had lots of power on high.</li>
            <li>Consumer Reports rated this hair dryer highly.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this ceramic hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>highly rated by consumer reports.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and it is high powered and high heat.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt that revlon will be any help.</li>
            <li>It was significantly noisier than my old Conair dryer which cost the same.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer is a little heavier than most</li>
            <li>So my two little dogs seemed OK with the noise level.  </li>
            <li>Dryer was great for that too, less frizz &amp; less time</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this dryer to anyone and if you already have it I would never use the high heat setting, even if that is what you normally use.  </li>
            <li>I dropped it on the floor, which is luckily tile, so it only left a black mark rather than catching the floor on fire.</li>
            <li>I also love that the dryer has 3 heat settings (my old Conair only had &#x27;high&#x27; or &#x27;low&#x27; and</li>
            <li>but I do not seem to be loosing as much hair as I did when I used my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much shinier and healthier-looking than the results from my old dryer.</li>
            <li>I would normally spend on just using the straightening iron alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In shock, I threw the dryer to the ground where it continued to spark and hiss a few more times until it died.</li>
            <li>, the air was hot enough but the amount of air that was coming out was not, even on the high speed (which it was on for 2 years!).  </li>
            <li>The dryer is about 1.5 pounds of plastic, it contains quite a lot of precious copper, and a few ceramic components that required lots of energy to fabricate.  </li>
            <li>demise of these dryers was pretty much the same</li>
            <li>Just a normal blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth buying a second</li>
            <li>I live alone and use it once/day mostly on high heat.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new hair dryer</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is still going great a few months down the road.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but unlike all other hair dryers I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t fry my fine hair.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this hairdryer to anyone looking for one that is not only easy and reliable, but the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>At this point, most hair dryers are fairly equal in their ability to dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and dried hair fast.</li>
            <li>This dryer, though is nice, is not even remotely a less than short term use dryer.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I thought it would be nice to dry the whole mess and use the iron on it- something I may do once a month because of the time and effort it takes.   </li>
            <li>I finished drying my hair on the low heat setting and it actually came out fine</li>
            <li>When shaking, the hair dryer now sounds like a box full of beans, everything is loose.</li>
            <li>This was equivalent to what I paid for the new dryer.</li>
            <li>I attributed it to a new medication I was taking.  </li>
            <li>I am trashing this and getting a new non revlon dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is brand new and it won&#x27;t work.   </li>
            <li>, I decided it was time to treat myself to a new blow dryer a couple of weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>and then they&#x27;ll send me a new one in 10 days.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy a new one each year why?</li>
            <li>but after reading all these reviews i said let me get away from conair, the dryer never did anything, and if you live in NY you know what the seasons are like here</li>
            <li>Spend $15, get yourself a new dryer each year.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new hair dryer but couldn&#x27;t afford to spend an arm and a leg on a fancy blow dryer.</li>
            <li>i purchased a new blowdryer</li>
            <li>Buying a new one tomorrow-</li>
            <li>I carefully keep the lint filters clean, but it doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>(I won&#x27;t know because I won&#x27;t be using the \\&quot;SSX\\&quot; any longer) but it makes my hair look 100% better after it&#x27;s dried than the professional dryer does</li>
            <li>I have frizzy, half-curly ultra-thick hair, and I had really hoped that this dryer was going to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;An hour after drying my hair with it, my hair was back to its frizzy self, and I really didn&#x27;t notice a quicker drying time.  </li>
            <li>I used it this morning for the first time and found that it really did make my hair feel much softer than with my other, cheaper quality, hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>While ordering this as a gift for someone recently, I noticed the many negative reviews which described exactly what had happened to MY hair too!</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T BUY ANY REVLON DRYERS, many other models have done the same.  </li>
            <li>Reading through past reviews, I&#x27;m just glad my hair dryer didn&#x27;t throw off sparks or catch on fire.</li>
            <li>When I read through the instruction manual, there was a section that stated that the hair dryer had an internal thermometer that would cause the hair dryer to cut power if it became too hot.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too hot to put back on.</li>
            <li>I have had it about 2 months now and every time I use it the handle gets so hot that I actually get</li>
            <li>WOW!    </li>
            <li>its too hot on the hot setting and too cold on the warm.</li>
            <li>There was alot more hair on the floor than usual.  </li>
            <li>I have long, curly, fine, frizzy hair that I like to blow dry straight.  </li>
            <li>I looked inside and it was red hot and started smoking.  </li>
            <li>After my 20+ year old Conair blow dryer was literally falling apart (but still working!)</li>
            <li>Buy this model instead of the more expensive salon models, and spend the extra $$ on more shampoo.</li>
            <li>It started smoking and the handle turned red &amp; hot.</li>
            <li>This one has multiple settings,so you can choose how hot you need it to be.</li>
            <li>Many other similar reports online when I looked it up.  </li>
            <li>I usually look up Consumer Reports on most of my purchases.  </li>
            <li>Dryer worked fine for about a year and a half until one day, it powered off mid-dry.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty standard hairdryer, imo.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this blow dryer last year (2012).</li>
            <li>I had the exact dryer prior to purchasing this one.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this when the cord on the same exact one I had became damaged.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer does a quick, non scorching dry and leaves my hair looking soft.  </li>
            <li>and I could get it relatively straight (as long as it isn&#x27;t very humid)</li>
            <li>This dryer didn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as my old dryer of the same wattage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase another one exactly the same as my old Revlon model.</li>
            <li>Prefer this dryer for many years as it isn&#x27;t too small to handle but large enough to hold and direct in drying hair.</li>
            <li>I was happy with it for about a month, and then started noticing that it would constantly cycle between hot and cold.  </li>
            <li>The unit dries wet hair quickly and leaves hair soft, not frizzy.</li>
            <li>I love this product I had the same one before, but it completely broke down after owning it for years.</li>
            <li>and so I chose the same kind again especially because the weight was less</li>
            <li>However, I had this hair dryer a few years ago and worked fine for quite a while.</li>
            <li>That meant that the dryer only worked if I wrapped the power cord around the handle in a certain angle.  </li>
            <li>It dried my very long hair in just a few minutes (compared with five for my older dryer) and the diffuser gives great volume and lift.  </li>
            <li>Steer clear of this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s much louder than I imagined, far from quiet.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t dropped or near to a water or anything that might&#x27;ve caused it to malfunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also noticed that whenever my hair dresser cuts &amp; blows out my hair, I have soft \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old Remington dryer, either.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get the old dryer without the ceramic feature.</li>
            <li>try not keeping it too long on your hair when its on the hot setting.</li>
            <li>That is how your hair will feel when you use this dryer, only it will take a much shorter amount of time.  </li>
            <li>, it was a lot lighter than my old one.  </li>
            <li>This is a LOUD hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and bouncy when I use it.</li>
            <li>My old dryer conked out so I decided to purchase this one.  </li>
            <li>I use the bowl attachment when I want a natural wave</li>
            <li>The manufacturer wants me to ship it back to them....</li>
            <li>I even went as far as reinforcing the flexible shield where the cord meets the dryer in hopes that it would keep stress off the cable.</li>
            <li>My sister&#x27;s hair was soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old daughter says she hates the hair dryer and it leaves her hair frizzy too.  </li>
            <li>and with the old hair dryers my hair would end up frizzed at the ends.  </li>
            <li>I immediately unplugged it, looked it over and saw the cord was melted near the handle.</li>
            <li>EXCEPT the diffuser attachment has started to COMPLETELY melt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy at all</li>
            <li>(I have short hair), failures started to appear very soon:  </li>
            <li>Not heavy</li>
            <li>The old one is still working.  </li>
            <li>If you want a dryer that lasts forever, I guess you can spend upwards of $150-$200 for a professional one (like my hair dresser)</li>
            <li>I docked a star because it has a weaker output than my old blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Because my hair is so thick, I did have to spend about fifteen to thirty minutes touching it up with my straightening iron, but that is NOTHING to the two hours</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of hair and it dries it in no time while other dryers take more than 20 minutes to have way dry it!</li>
            <li>I have to turn it off and let the handle cool down</li>
            <li>I bought a new different brand of hair dryer and my hair has now been restored to normal, soft shiny hair just like when my hair dresser does it.  </li>
            <li>After all these years, the cord is starting to bend oddly right at the plug, so I don&#x27;t think it has a lot of life in it left unless I find a way to replace the cord.</li>
            <li>For months now, I&#x27;ve been blaming my flat iron on burning a large section of my hair- until today-</li>
            <li>/&gt;While true enough, it did dry my hair</li>
            <li>The ions that are supposed to make my hair shiny and dry quicker were pretty unapparent.  </li>
            <li>that is there when you first dry it.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try an inexpensive hair dryer for the first time since money was tight, and now I really regret it.  </li>
            <li>Fortunatley, I reacted quickly and threw it down without it harming my hair, head or anything else.</li>
            <li>The buttons were a little stiff at first use, but I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll loosen up with more use.      </li>
            <li>Read the fine print, not sure if anyone would jump through the hoops to return it</li>
            <li>I have somewhat thin,fragile hair;and many of the products I&#x27;ve tried have done some serious damage.</li>
            <li>it has all the features that are needed (hot/cold air, different temperature of hot, ionization that you can turn on/off, different speed)</li>
            <li>the exact same drier the very same day.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought the dryer was from my local Walgreens store &amp; the 2nd time was thru Target&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two Revlon hairdryers over the past year and this one worked better than the subsequent one.</li>
            <li>But if you have thick long hair like mine(reaches my waist)this is a handy tool.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this dryer for two very MAJOR reasons.     </li>
            <li>The problem is obviously a cheap cord that when bent back and forth enough times will wear the wire enough to short out.</li>
            <li>Believe me this will happen to all of these units eventually if you use the high heat settings daily.</li>
            <li>And the bottom button adjusts the air flow from low, med to high.</li>
            <li>Also because it doesn&#x27;t really blow dry (just gets hot) it takes longer to actually dry the hair.  </li>
            <li>Especially when my cousin dries my hair for me my hair comes out so smooth and soft with little product.</li>
            <li>and it took the hair dryer much longer to dry my hair than my old one.  </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t work long so don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>and I guess fixed the problem (and I avoided, apparently, setting my hair on fire).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A true waste...</li>
            <li>Both my expensive hair dryer and this hair dryer get my hair straight and very smooth.</li>
            <li>Wait just a few years until this baby shoots out sparks from both ends of the body AT 6 A.M. one fine Monday morning (like it did for me this morning), and RISK BOTH BURNING OFF MASSIVE CHUNKS OF YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a short cut and a new dryer and waiting for my hair to grow out.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this new hair dryer after owning the same one for over a decade.  </li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a new hair dryer and want one that is functional I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a much quicker, healthier dry time.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem like hair would dry as fast as it does...</li>
            <li>I sent this dryer back and will continue to use my old one until it dies completely.</li>
            <li>So, I was looking for a model that would be quiet and hopefully not expose my ears to as much damage as the regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Without thinking, I went out and bought a second one since the first one lasted so long, and thought maybe the sparking incident was a fluke.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, if you&#x27;re going to put your name on something my feeling is that you should stand by the product yourself and not send consumers on a wild goose chase to track down the responsible party!    </li>
            <li>This hair dryer has changed all that - the very first time I used it - my hair dried shiny - with no frizz at all.  </li>
            <li>I check out other reviews on this product on the web yesterday and it seems that I&#x27;m not the first for this</li>
            <li>I have bought this dryer several times though because it will dry my hair sooooo fast!  </li>
            <li>The previous ones never lasted more than a year and a half.  </li>
            <li>Overall, if you don&#x27;t mind the potential electrical danger, it&#x27;s a decent dryer for the price.</li>
            <li>The high power had suddenly become almost low power but not quite.</li>
            <li>I got this blow dryer to replace an old one thinking it was the same brand because both were around $20.  </li>
            <li>but after the second time of a flame shooting out and a loud pop and then sparks everywhere I figuring it time to switch brands..</li>
            <li>The one I have isn&#x27;t ionic and wanted to try it, guess I&#x27;ll go back to the old one.</li>
            <li>The fan was barely spinning on max.  </li>
            <li>: fire the first time, sparks the second, which sounds pretty common considering the reviews on here.  </li>
            <li>My first one finally died and I ordered the very same one because it performed so well and lasted so long.</li>
            <li>It was important to me for the dryer to have a medium heat setting since I also use the dryer to dry my two little dogs after their bath.  </li>
            <li>This cord has more of a softer  rubber feel and a dull dark color, where proper cords have a shiny finish and more of a hard vinyl feel.</li>
            <li>Unit will start making a odd noise and smell funny, not</li>
            <li>My dryer managed to reach that too hot temperature in less than a minute of use.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair which tends to be dry normally</li>
            <li>I wrote a similar review years ago addressing the popping and sparking problem, the frayed hot cord at the point the cord attaches to the handle, and other issues I was having with this.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly this dryer dried my shoulder length hair in under 5 minutes!</li>
            <li>Last week the high fan speed setting started acting like the low speed setting.  </li>
            <li>High speed was not a high speed.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, long, healthy, naturally curly hair and drying/straightening can take a while so weight matters.      </li>
            <li>After reading other reviews about this dryer, I went straight to Target and bought it</li>
            <li>Not disappointed in the least.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, next time I will probably spend a little more and try to get one that leaves my hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li>After reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I didn&#x27;t know for sure whether I should buy it or not, but I convinced myself to because there will always be someone who&#x27;s not happy with a particular product.</li>
            <li>Since people are having such widely varied results, I can only wonder as to the manufacturer&#x27;s quality control process, possibly letting through a few too many faulty machines...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used about 15 or more hair dryers in my life and never experienced such a problem.   </li>
            <li>I was limited in choice in buying a new hairdryer after mine died, since I was at a grocery store and needed one immediately.  </li>
            <li>After a couple uses I noticed the smell of burning hair and thought maybe it was a little too hot</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does come with attachments that similarly priced dryers don&#x27;t usually come with, and there&#x27;s a removable cover thing on the lint trap in the back that makes it way easier to clean, you can remove it and wash it off in the sink in 2 seconds.</li>
            <li>It lasted much longer than I expected, especially given that I used it nearly every single day for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>While the price is right, it is not worth the fire risk!!</li>
            <li>The last time I used it, I noticed the general smell of burning hair when I was done.  </li>
            <li>My curly hair actually turned straight because of this medication and now I assumed my hair was continuing to morph into brittleness and falling out due to the meds.</li>
            <li>We bought it not long ago, about a month.</li>
            <li>My wife asked for a small, powerful hair dryer for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>The first one I&#x27;d had for a few years before it began smoking at the cord.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It certainly makes blow drying my hair less of an event.</li>
            <li>I have thick, course, very curly long hair that normally would take about 40+ minutes to blow dry straight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really too bad, because up until the time I thought I might be electrocuted, I liked how fast it dried my hair and the condition of my hair after drying.</li>
            <li>How am I supposed to live without a hairdryer for that long?!?!?!  </li>
            <li>Not a very long life,</li>
            <li>I exchanged it for a new one, and the new one died a few months later.  </li>
            <li>But for the diffuser, it remains to work just fine -- only because I hardly ever use it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this dryer does dry faster, and leaves my hair softer and shinier and fuller than my old conair.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li>Charred hair was all over the place, both long sections burned off near the root and smaller curled burnt pieces from the ends, and the stench was overpowering.    </li>
            <li>I just moved to Miami and needed a hair dryer that would straighten my medium length wavy hair FAST without ending up a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li>The dryer gets too hot and because the air flow is not strong enough, you end up burning your hair instead of drying it.  </li>
            <li>Just turning the dryer on long enough to dry my hair on high makes the plastic all gooey.</li>
            <li>That way it comes out relatively straight with little frizz (again, dependant on humidity)</li>
            <li>A little while after he had finished using it, he noted that the barrel stayed hot for a long time after it was off.</li>
            <li>I have long, naturally curly, thick hair that I like to wear very straight to the office.</li>

            <li> VERY STRONG!</li>
            <li> They have contacted Revlon without good customer service.  </li>
            <li> Loved that it had three heat settings and two speeds.</li>
            <li> and I could not believe how good my hair felt afterwards.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li> Good when working.  </li>
            <li> , so I thought it would be good.  </li>
            <li> Seeing it recommended as one of the best by Consumer Reports just confirmed what I already thought.  </li>
            <li> My Rusk 1900 watt ceramic dryer blows this dryer away, but it isn&#x27;t fair to compare an $80 dryer to something that now costs $15.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> good price.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent packing and shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Runs</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer</li>
            <li> Good while it lasted</li>
            <li> good question, b/c it stops working.</li>
            <li> Does a good job for the price.</li>
            <li> Nice product.....works great</li>
            <li> Sliding buttons on the handle with separate controls for temperature and wind speed are good features.  </li>
            <li> good price and product</li>
            <li> Good Good Good Good item.</li>
            <li> This is also good price.</li>
            <li> Fair power.</li>
            <li> Considering the price price, it&#x27;s a good quality product.</li>
            <li> A perfect and light hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Every hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had dies like this eventually - looking for one as good as this that won&#x27;t blow up or catch fire though.</li>
            <li> This one is so great because it has lots of power AND the blower settings(low and high) are separate from the heat settings(cool, warm, and hot).I use the hotel provided dryers when I travel and am always so happy to get home to the best blow dryer ever.</li>
            <li> nothing exceptional.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Bought a Conair online and am very pleased with that.</li>
            <li> She is very pleased with the unit.</li>
            <li> The volumizer works really good, makes my hair even thicker, wish it came with a comb tho, but its good, and i love it...</li>
            <li> Many fabulous features &amp; perfect for my use.</li>
            <li> Excellent very responsible</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer!</li>
            <li> But wait, there&#x27;s more!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> As time went on, it just doesn&#x27;t even get hot anymore at all, warm at best.</li>
            <li> For someone who lives in Miami, Florida and where humidity is 1000%, this blow dryer works amazing.      </li>
            <li> Packaging was great and secure in the box.</li>
            <li> (Granted, I always keep in on the &#x27;Warm&#x27; setting.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Now she has her own blow dryer and won&#x27;t have to share.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking at the review of others and my own experience  </li>
            <li> Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer has never been dropped and I keep it stored in my own cupboard so that the kids could never accidentally find it and play with it without me knowing.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it people have been commenting on how nice my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> Soon it pops, hisses, and glows a nice yellow-red color before shutting off.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the attachments and don&#x27;t think I will need to - a nice bonus but</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled to find that it was still on the market.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> I have  to use this at my own risk because I don&#x27;t have a replacement, but I&#x27;m on my way to trying to find something that might not cause my hair to catch fire.</li>
            <li> Great dryer for such a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> Good price.very pleased</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer because I liked the design.  </li>
            <li> The ion button switches off on its own.  </li>
            <li> I like to bring my own hair dryer</li>
            <li> a nice Price too</li>
            <li> The cool shot button is great for taming those frizzy bits.  </li>
            <li> easy to use, good quality.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer works great and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Very easy to switch the tops.</li>
            <li> I love the adjustable heat, I love the attachments and works and lasts for years!</li>
            <li> Anyway, nice dryer:)</li>
            <li> It works great,  but can the cable caught fire at the right by where the cable meets the dryer.  </li>
            <li> My original of this hairdryer, which I loved, died and I was crestfallen when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> Works great for over a month now and easy to clean the intake on the end of dust.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I had found such a great quality product for a great price.</li>
            <li> is product is great, and is worth more than the price I payed.</li>
            <li> The first time my husband used this dryer, it seemed great.</li>
            <li> The price was great and the item arrived in a timely manner and exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li> It works good, dries my hair quickly with adjustive speed and temprature   </li>
            <li> I really liked the configuration of the buttons, and they are easy to slide to change the settings.  </li>
            <li> The dryer itself is fairly lightweight with a comfortable grip and easy to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it is ok.</li>
            <li> Anyway, OK dryer.  </li>
            <li> And it will be better if the handle is foldable</li>
            <li> Fortunately, nothing caught fire!</li>
            <li> love the settings, how well it dries my hair without frizziness and the variety of settings.</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with this transaction.  </li>
            <li> Can you actually love an appliance?</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent dryer, it has various speeds and temperatures.  </li>
            <li> and this did nothing to either better or worsen my frizziness.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased it and it seemed others weren&#x27;t sure what it did for them either.  </li>
            <li> However, it think it has more to do with the hair brush you are using and</li>
            <li> This is a good dryer and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Gradually I started noticing more and more breakage from the heat damage.  </li>
            <li> OK, don&#x27;t use it on the highest setting, lesson learned.  </li>
            <li> Got it as a present and it has been the best hair dryer for her ever.</li>
            <li> price was great and it was shipped in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> My hair looks wonderful, shiny, smooth and feels soft.</li>
            <li> Love the attachments, helps with styling versitility.</li>
            <li> i was so pleased with this dryer, it gave my hair a thicker look.</li>
            <li> better price than walmart.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m glad the thing is gone.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing</li>
            <li> I use to love this hair dryer, I even bought it twice...</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what happend.  </li>
            <li> (yes, I saved all evidence) and I expect as there are many complaints about this product they will soon recall it.      </li>
            <li> (It didn&#x27;t smell like burning hair, more like home perm solution.)</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re paying ... more for a gimmick.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the weight of it</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want another one of these even if it was free!  </li>
            <li> Love the attachments it comes with.</li>
            <li> This is probably not the only dryer that will give these kinds of results and it&#x27;s probably not the best.  </li>
            <li> whatever it is, it sure seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> that is has 3 heat settings so is more versatile than some dryers.  </li>
            <li> I love Revlon products</li>
            <li> I love this and</li>
            <li> glad I purchased it</li>
            <li> Ok - so I had this hair dryer for about 2 years?  </li>
            <li> Or possibly more gray hair coming in, plus hair can change as you age.</li>
            <li> Dryer lasts for many years.</li>
            <li> There are better dryers for the price, if that&#x27;s your deciding factor.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is as healthy as ever though I do use a heat protectant.</li>
            <li> I am sure the hair dyer is defective</li>
            <li> I chose this product over the Conair product because this had more options in the heat/air level settings.</li>
            <li> This dryer, although the buttons are located in about the same spots, I did not have any problems with the dryer turning off while I was using it, which is a very great thing!  </li>
            <li> I bought a Conair in the interim and love that dryer.  </li>
            <li> Wish it had more attachments.</li>
            <li> This dryer works great, and I really like the diffuser attachment.  </li>
            <li> I am fully pleased with the dryer, however the dryer pictured is not what I recieved.  </li>
            <li> Has always been my favorite blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Top rated by consumer reports.</li>
            <li> I had it for many years before it gave out.  </li>
            <li> I love  the attachments too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this hairdryer; better yet, try another brand.</li>
            <li> Not too sure about the shine thing??</li>
            <li> Wish it had more power then it did and just felt</li>
            <li> I love how all of the reviews are either</li>
            <li> and it had lasted more then 5 years</li>
            <li> I love the controls - separate for temp and power.</li>
            <li> I love the removable filter.</li>
            <li> I love the attachments that come with it</li>
            <li> sadly, many hairs fell to the floor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But so far, so good!</li>
            <li> I thought it was GOOD that it got so hot that my hair held its shape better.  </li>
            <li> Super nice hair dryer:)</li>
            <li> Heat is good and handles great while using to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first...</li>
            <li> The amount of heat is pretty good</li>
            <li> This works out pretty good.  </li>
            <li> First, let me state that this is a good hairdryer.</li>
            <li> It is priced affordably but has many options and handles easily.  </li>
            <li> (A) this is the best hair dryer ever, it&#x27;s super hot and dries my hair very fast</li>
            <li> every which-way on the top of my head that I would need to smooth over with product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the sound is ok</li>
            <li> Thought the ion &amp; ceremic features would be key for giving me, as we all hope for ...  healthy &amp; beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li> Mostly purchased this for the diffuser attachment which i enjoy.</li>
            <li> and she loved it so much.</li>
            <li> It does not have that much power as I wish it had when I bought it,but every thing else is good</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I have read online that many people have experienced the same situation.  </li>
            <li> heat controls are easy to access</li>
            <li> So easy to just order on-line.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;wind\\&quot; power isn&#x27;t as strong, either, even on the highest setting.  </li>
            <li> Perfectly competent (nothing &amp;#34;ionically&amp;#34; special) while working.</li>
            <li> Just arrived, although its cheap, it is good value for money, lots of settings to choose from, dried my hair evenly, great buy.</li>
            <li> This dryer is nice, it gets hot and does the job.</li>
            <li> The top button lets me adjust the temperature from cool, warm to hot.  </li>
            <li> I guess if you take that into consideration, this works fine if you have loads of time in the morning.  </li>
            <li> but my hair seemed fine</li>
            <li> Nothing out of the ordinary--dried my hair just fine.  </li>
            <li> and I have a ton of fine hair.</li>
            <li> The buttons moved easily, and the dryer&#x27;s handle was comfortable to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its light weight and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I feel lucky that nothing happened to me, apart from a life-long fear of hair driers!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this dryer works great with the diffuser to dry it after a shower :)</li>
            <li> I am not kidding, I still have a huge scare.</li>
            <li> I too had a HUGE problem with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Well my hair was soft and healthy looking after just one use, it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s great when it works, however, this is our third one.  </li>
            <li> But with the multiple settings and the air-flow nozzle, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Its so light weight my arm doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Light to hold</li>
            <li> No frizz, not fried, just smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great for anything you woud throw at it with at-home use, but definitely not Pro/Salon quality.</li>
            <li> Also,good for the price - great for short hair.</li>
            <li> I thought, this thing is going to light my head on fire.</li>
            <li> I bought this drier because my last Revlon drier was great.  </li>
            <li> Great product, works well and is fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; will do so on low speeds.</li>
            <li> this dryer works, it is great, but this is not the only review reporting fireworks shooting out of the cord connection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I am also a chemistry student, and I am quite perplexed by the ion button.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and made in China.  </li>
            <li> We bought it for about $30, but now the replacement is available on Amazon for about $15.  </li>
            <li> Dries nicely and fast.</li>
            <li> The great product &amp; low price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also light.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I keep buying the same one because it fits my hand perfectly and the buttons are placed such that it&#x27;s very easy for me to adjust them while drying.  </li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> This little hottie also turns healthy, beautiful hair into crispy, damaged sh&amp;*--EVEN WHEN YOU HOLD THE DAMNED THING</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t understand the disconnect between user reviews and my own experience versus high ratings for this model in Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li> I use the warm &amp; high settings.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> but the more I used the dryer I realized the intense heat was burning off and damaging my hair!  </li>
            <li> Not user friendly.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser always comments on the great health of my long hair</li>
            <li> I love the first one, lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it is not a bad deal, because the dryer is so cheap.  </li>
            <li> Love the setting controls; I use the warm, high setting and it leaves my hair really soft and healthy looking with no frizz.</li>
            <li> I needed one quick and it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I love that it has so may options and the cool blast button really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown away dryers just because I couldn&#x27;t clean them.</li>
            <li> I keep it clean and store it in a holder</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, lightweight, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Had this exact dryer for many years, finally cord got a break in it but dryer still worked good.  </li>
            <li> I gave this dryer a 5 because I am very satisfied with the speed that it dries and how soft and smooth my hair is right afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t sit it right on your hair people!  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be good as I have fine long hair.</li>
            <li> Indeed, very high quality, and quite handsome.  </li>
            <li> Dryer works great but be careful with cord.</li>
            <li> Was happy to find the exact same model was still being built and received it a couple weeks ago, works</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is relatively good and considering the price is so low</li>
            <li> Then it would be cool for a minute and overheat again.  </li>
            <li> I would let it cool off and begin using it again.</li>
            <li> this hair dryer was a good for about a year, until today when sparks started fyling and smoke came pouring out the back.</li>
            <li> The real reason why I chose this ionic dryer is because I love Revlon&#x27;s button configuration.</li>
            <li> Much faster than before without the static and damage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thankful for the safety feature, but have returned the item for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> hair dryer is light and powerful.  </li>
            <li> There are 3 temperature features and a bonus cool shot&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Both are probably true.  </li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It is the right size for me and not too many features to confuse me but enough to do the job - and nicely.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews seem to be great</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews here, I feel lucky not to have experienced sparks or flames.</li>
            <li> For the first two months of owning this hair dryer, it did a fine job.  </li>
            <li> I also think it is great that it comes with the concentrator attachment to help get your hair extra straight.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;ion\\&quot; switch is nothing more than a gimmick and anyone who reports miraculous transformation of their frizzies is most likely experiencing a placebo effect.</li>
            <li> The dryer is adequate and dries your hair.</li>
            <li> Luckily my children were not using this when it happened.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly and without frizz.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer so far for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It was very hot</li>
            <li> Very fast!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Also the cord is a good length-about 5 1/2  to 6 ft. long.</li>
            <li> It has the high and low and warm and hot buttons which are nice.  </li>
            <li> I used this hair dryer for the first time yesterday and I absolutely fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I was also presently suprised that it was so light compared to my travel hairdryer!!</li>
            <li> one week before I purchased my professional Solano Super X (\\&quot;SSX\\&quot;) for (for more money).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Amazon has such a easy return .</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and lots of it</li>
            <li> This hairdryer works fine, is light to handle and not too loud.  </li>
            <li> And the whole thing is light enough.lastic.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one because it looked cheap, reasonable, and a friend recommended me to use Revlon.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well and is light to handle.  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight but feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I did not think the ionic would be such an amazing feature untill</li>
            <li> The different setting selection is nice.</li>
            <li> Product purchased about one month ago and so far we are pleased.</li>
            <li> Powerful.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old Revlon drier still works, but has seen better days.</li>
            <li> I checked them all out and decided to stick with Revlon because I love my old travel blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever write customer reviews, but this one seemed to warrant it.</li>
            <li> Personally love the product compares to the old dryer that I have.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these, one for myself that I&#x27;ve used about a year now, and a second one for my mom because I loved mine that much.</li>
            <li> But I still think I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Liked the different settings it offered and figured Revlon would have a quality hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and I liked the different attachments and settings.</li>
            <li> powerful wind</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t stand it any more, I started using my old non-ionic blow dryer.</li>
            <li> After about 5 weeks it will not heat up only blows barely warm air.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and the wait.</li>
            <li> Anyway, so I bought this one because it looked like a good dryer, it claimed on the box that it was \\&quot;americas #1 selling hairdryer\\&quot;, and i was curious about the ion feature.  </li>
            <li> Since I really liked the dryer &amp; the attachments, I decided to give it a 2nd shot &amp; purchase another.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was hitting the cool shot button all the time</li>
            <li> However, it is a bit noisy and it crapped out on me pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I realize now that this dryer was working so quickly because it was WAY too hot, even on the medium setting.</li>
            <li> I switched from high heat (which had been fine with my Conair) to the medium setting, and the smell went away, but the damage continued.</li>
            <li> Indeed, I loved it when I first got it, so much so that I bought a second one to have should this one burn out</li>
            <li> With any force, they pop right out.  </li>
            <li> With any force, they pop right out.  </li>
            <li> AND* SEVERELY BURNING YOUR RIGHT HAND/</li>
            <li> I would point this out to hairdressers but no one seemed to have the right answer to fix the problem</li>
            <li> and I have just not noticed because I&#x27;m not looking right at it while I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li> The package arrived and I was thrilled that the ones ordered were exactly the same</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t dry any more quickly even though the thing is easily twice as large and has ion technology.  </li>
            <li> It is lighter than my last dryer, and very easy to manage.</li>
            <li> The best method for achieving this was to use the highest heat and fastest setting on wet hair until the hair is damp, then to finish drying my hair with the air-flow nozzle on low speed and medium heat while using a rollerbrush to hold the hair straight and curl the ends.         </li>
            <li> I like the setting options: cool, warm, or hot; and low or high.</li>
            <li> I think it dries my hair a little bit faster than my last dryer, and my hair feels Great!</li>
            <li> the good new is, I can keep using my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I live in South Florida, and this dryer works super fast and makes my hair look silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I still see my hair kind of frizzy when I dry it.  </li>
            <li> Frys hair quickly without frozzoes thanks to ion setting.  </li>
            <li> Also, my old travel dryer easily got hotter than this one.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is not only quiet compared to the others, it dries hair in no time, great buy,</li>
            <li> I have great &#x27;first day&#x27; hair, &#x27;second day&#x27; hair, even &#x27;third day&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s hair quickly, looks great and is not very loud.</li>
            <li> My hair looks better than it did when I used my previous dryer-shinier and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for six months and felt compelled to write because most commercial stores don&#x27;t sell quality hair dryers like this one.</li>
            <li> but this is my first dryer with that option</li>
            <li> and I noticed two things: more even drying (not just dryer in the part of my hair closest to the dryer, but even further out) and softer/smoother texture, with the ion setting.</li>
            <li> I needed my hair perfect, like if we were going out, that means I left it in a Turbie for 30-45 min instead of my usual day-to-day 10 min.  </li>
            <li> Unit started smoking and was about to catch fire on first use.  </li>
            <li> With this dryer, I&#x27;m done in 20 minutes and my hair looks smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have better &#x27;second day&#x27; hair - drying</li>
            <li> The diffusser stays attached securely and it&#x27;s not that loud.</li>
            <li> I love that it has different controls for the temperature and speed.</li>
            <li> Thanks Revlon!</li>
            <li> After about a year, first one burned a hole in the cord where the cord and handle meet.  </li>
            <li> Hope to have better luck with a different brand....</li>
            <li> The real test, however, will be this summer in the NYC (subways!)</li>
            <li> So... it never died, but it did become possessed, so some element of the afterlife is definitely evident.  </li>
            <li> the first time I thought it was a freak accident..</li>
            <li> The dryer did not feel overly hot</li>
            <li> , it was only about 5 bucks more?  </li>
            <li> I looked at my brush and the dryer and my sink and saw that the dryer had burned off whole sections of my hair!  </li>
            <li> Personally like the dryer, but the power cord at the top can get bent and short out the dryer if it is used for many hours.  </li>
            <li> I have owned many hair dryers but not one has ever had an internal explosion.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what they she wanted.</li>
            <li> The drier works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> The first lasted 5 years+.  </li>
            <li> One day it just started switching to a warm/cool setting even though it was set to hot.</li>
            <li> On the 5TH DAY of use EVER, this drier burned off a WHOLE SECTION of my hair!</li>
            <li> I smelled burning and turned off the drier, ran my hand over my hair and the whole section fell to the floor!  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this one and says it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my sister&#x27;s hair (being my first time ever using a blow dryer) and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> My sister purchased this hair dryer first</li>
            <li> The electric motor is pretty exposed to dust and debris which is probably the reason that it started failing.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely pleased with this hair dryer.       </li>
            <li> I do not use it on the highest setting because it seems too hot.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, the area where the cord attaches to the handle got so hot that it melted through the plastic coating, exposing about a half-inch of singed wires.</li>
            <li> Then the handle became so hot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the hot heat deformed the plastic attachment to where it wouldn&#x27;t click to the dryer.</li>
            <li> I wiggled the cord and it started blowing hot air again.  </li>
            <li> I tried to shop locally but, the exact product was close to $10 more</li>
            <li> This is light, quiet, effective, several options for heat and speed settings.  </li>
            <li> Taking the filter off the back creates better air intake</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to take.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer gets HOT.</li>
            <li> but today I noticed that it sparked when it got hot then</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product the only reason the star rating is colored in is because I wasn&#x27;t able to post with out it</li>
            <li> Biggest upside is that it dried my hair well and reliably for a very long time, and was an excellent value.  </li>
            <li> When I asked her after several months of usage she said it&#x27;s great and work like a lot of high end blue</li>
            <li> I live in an area that has high summertime humidity and my hair is fine and tends to frizz a bit on the ends.</li>
            <li> After using it for 6 months (always on the warm settling, not hot), it fried my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not willing to risk catching my hair on fire.</li>
            <li> Old reliable wins for me!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight difference in the texture of my hair after drying, but I think that is due to the cool function on the dryer (better than most - cool air is expended almost immediately), rather than the ion feature.  </li>
            <li> Wife likes it; light enough&#x27; powerful</li>
            <li> haha funny either</li>
            <li> Over time, I noticed my hair was becoming brittle and coarse and was thinning out.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer only lasted 6 months and the electric cord started becoming detached from the hair dryer on the inside, causing interruptions in air flow while drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I color my hair with semi-permanent coloring, and the now frizzy ends absorb more of the coloring, giving a strange look.</li>
            <li> Also, the medium heat setting was a bit too hot, and it sucked in too much hair, requiring me once to disassemble the unit for removal.</li>
            <li> I liked the previous one Revlon 1875</li>
            <li> I quickly unplugged it before it completely caught on fire.  </li>
            <li> At first, after I bought it, I really liked how quickly it dried my hair.</li>
            <li> but there are large parts rattling around inside now.</li>
            <li> the cord split where it meets the dryer and a large set of sparks and horrid smell of burning electric permeated my house.</li>
            <li> I Just got a new hair cut and and this is the dryer for curly hair it gave me the right temp.</li>
            <li> it blows very hard and the temperatures are great.</li>
            <li> I then realize that even the grip is hot and that the snake of smoke coming out of the end of the blow dryer is a death knell for my brand new device!  </li>
            <li> Many of the other stylers/dryers are WAY too hot.</li>
            <li> The low speed is sufficient and the high speed is strong enough to do a through job without being too strong.</li>
            <li> A bit large in the hand, but light enough not to be cumbersome.</li>
            <li> And the whole thing is light enough.</li>
            <li> i was getting ready for my day</li>
            <li> The company wants us ot pay $20 to pack it up and ship the unit in.  </li>
            <li> I started out really liking this dryer</li>
            <li> I like to get it as straight and \\&quot;clean\\&quot; as I can.  </li>
            <li> The three levels of temperature control are very helpful.</li>
            <li> I also really like the fact the ion control can be turned off and on.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a dryer just buy this one, its absolutely great!It delivers everything it promises.</li>
            <li> My hair much is smoother, shinier and the (split)</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really worry about it.  </li>
            <li> The ion feature really does seem to work and since I&#x27;ve used this dryer, I do not even need to put styling creme on the ends of my hair to keep them in place and de-frizzed.</li>
            <li> not so much the dryer.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> My hair has a smoother texture and is much softer with this blowdryer.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in the texture of my hair with this dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much bulkier and heavier than I would have prefered.</li>
            <li> Much louder than any others I have used.  </li>
            <li> Last one the cord worked free from dryer and it was shooting sparks out of cord.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews and have to admit I really don&#x27;t understand the Ion thing but</li>
            <li> That alone is worth the modest investment in this product.</li>
            <li> and it does a much easier job then doing it by hand.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe I was responsible for these failures, that my coiling the cable was damaging the wiring.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this dryer, and I really like the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li> It does what it says, drys it in much shorter time, and a much healthier feel...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you know, but again thanks to all the reviews they really helped in making my purchase.</li>
            <li> They work great when they actually do work, but be prepared for it to only last about a year.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> it took much longer to blow-dry my hair and the ionic thing does nothing for it.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser attachment worked very well w/my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I also like to blow out my hair straight.</li>
            <li> Very \\&quot;iffy\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I am going to buy another one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> really gives the hair a boost, så can absolutly recommend it:)&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the tools it comes with...</li>
            <li> and I really like the attachments.</li>
            <li> The customer support worked very well.</li>
            <li> the multitude of setting combinations allow me to control how my hair dries- its naturally very wavy and gets frizzy fast, but i haven&#x27;t had any issues like that with this dryer yet.</li>
            <li> I kind of like this because my hair doesn&#x27;t blow everywhere when I&#x27;m using my round brush.  </li>
            <li> I saw reports of \\&quot;sparks\\&quot; and singed hair and will be on the lookout for those things, but so far I&#x27;m extremely pleased and may order a second one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> The old one finally gave up after many years of use.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast, but as far as the &amp;#34;shine boosting&amp;#34; - no dryer does that, you&#x27;ve got to use the right hair products.  </li>
            <li> One year later, It began shorting out and getting super hot at the connection.</li>
            <li> When I needed a new dryer to put in a guest bath, it was my first choice.</li>
            <li> The warm setting is a perfect temperature for me, not to sound silly but, not to hot, and not to cold.</li>
            <li> Okay, maybe not exactly explode, but very close.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine, not thick or coarse, so maybe that makes a difference in my</li>
            <li> From other reviews, I would say don&#x27;t buy it if you want a hair dryer that lasts more than a year to two years max.</li>
            <li> Overall, totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> Perhaps in an attempt to correct this, Revlon scaled back the heat output significantly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad mine never shot sparks like the other reviews I saw</li>
            <li> Big and powerful!</li>
            <li> I read the first few reviews at the time &amp; everyone seemed to love it.</li>
            <li> The removable back allows you to clean all the lent and stuff that gets in there over time.</li>
            <li> Then I began to notice after I showered and started to comb my wet hair a lot more hair than normal was falling out.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length fine straight hair, and the ends became dry and frizzy and began to break off.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, breaks easily, and gets a little frizzy when I try to blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone considering it, and the price is definitely right!</li>
            <li> I say this because my dryer doesn&#x27;t seem to get nearly as hot as my old, non-ion dryer.  </li>
            <li> On the first use (following their instruction booklet exactly), this dryer burned off whole sections of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I LIKE THE HEAT SETTINGS, ESPECIALLY THE COOL SETTING</li>
            <li> Simple blow dryer with cool function</li>
            <li> As soon as I find a suitable live subject, I will be testing this hypothesis.</li>
            <li> but once I went back to my old hair dryer, my hair was fine.  </li>
            <li> The hairdryer when working,  didn&#x27;t do as good a job as my little travel hair dryer that is only 1250 watts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have a huge section of dry, burned hair that I have been growing out for months-</li>
            <li> This dryer cuts the time in half or more, depending on how finicky I want to be about the look.</li>
            <li> I thought I had a fairly decent blowdryer...until it died.  </li>
            <li> A decent dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> I had this dryer for 2 months and the handle got too hot to hold after about one minute, then the handle starting melting because it was too hot</li>
            <li> This blowdryer is much better than any I&#x27;ve ever tried, it&#x27;s even better than the really expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer just a few months ago, and when I got it I truly loved it, then it started to be inconsistent with the heat, despite cleaning it regularly and taking care of it, then one morning it sounded like a chainsaw was in my dryer, then it just shorted out and stopped working.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any more hair breakage than the next person, several stylists have complemented me over the years on the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the mid setting on this dryer is just perfect for me- not too hot or too cold.</li>
            <li> Much quieter than my last dryer to the point I wondered if it was working right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> But it seems like the high setting should be the medium setting.    </li>
            <li> It had lots of power on high.</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports rated this hair dryer highly.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this ceramic hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> highly rated by consumer reports.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and it is high powered and high heat.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt that revlon will be any help.</li>
            <li> It was significantly noisier than my old Conair dryer which cost the same.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer is a little heavier than most</li>
            <li> So my two little dogs seemed OK with the noise level.  </li>
            <li> Dryer was great for that too, less frizz &amp; less time</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this dryer to anyone and if you already have it I would never use the high heat setting, even if that is what you normally use.  </li>
            <li> I dropped it on the floor, which is luckily tile, so it only left a black mark rather than catching the floor on fire.</li>
            <li> I also love that the dryer has 3 heat settings (my old Conair only had &#x27;high&#x27; or &#x27;low&#x27; and</li>
            <li> but I do not seem to be loosing as much hair as I did when I used my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much shinier and healthier-looking than the results from my old dryer.</li>
            <li> I would normally spend on just using the straightening iron alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In shock, I threw the dryer to the ground where it continued to spark and hiss a few more times until it died.</li>
            <li> , the air was hot enough but the amount of air that was coming out was not, even on the high speed (which it was on for 2 years!).  </li>
            <li> The dryer is about 1.5 pounds of plastic, it contains quite a lot of precious copper, and a few ceramic components that required lots of energy to fabricate.  </li>
            <li> demise of these dryers was pretty much the same</li>
            <li> Just a normal blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth buying a second</li>
            <li> I live alone and use it once/day mostly on high heat.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new hair dryer</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is still going great a few months down the road.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but unlike all other hair dryers I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t fry my fine hair.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this hairdryer to anyone looking for one that is not only easy and reliable, but the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> At this point, most hair dryers are fairly equal in their ability to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and dried hair fast.</li>
            <li> This dryer, though is nice, is not even remotely a less than short term use dryer.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I thought it would be nice to dry the whole mess and use the iron on it- something I may do once a month because of the time and effort it takes.   </li>
            <li> I finished drying my hair on the low heat setting and it actually came out fine</li>
            <li> When shaking, the hair dryer now sounds like a box full of beans, everything is loose.</li>
            <li> This was equivalent to what I paid for the new dryer.</li>
            <li> I attributed it to a new medication I was taking.  </li>
            <li> I am trashing this and getting a new non revlon dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is brand new and it won&#x27;t work.   </li>
            <li> , I decided it was time to treat myself to a new blow dryer a couple of weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> and then they&#x27;ll send me a new one in 10 days.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy a new one each year why?</li>
            <li> but after reading all these reviews i said let me get away from conair, the dryer never did anything, and if you live in NY you know what the seasons are like here</li>
            <li> Spend $15, get yourself a new dryer each year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new hair dryer but couldn&#x27;t afford to spend an arm and a leg on a fancy blow dryer.</li>
            <li> i purchased a new blowdryer</li>
            <li> Buying a new one tomorrow-</li>
            <li> I carefully keep the lint filters clean, but it doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> (I won&#x27;t know because I won&#x27;t be using the \\&quot;SSX\\&quot; any longer) but it makes my hair look 100% better after it&#x27;s dried than the professional dryer does</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, half-curly ultra-thick hair, and I had really hoped that this dryer was going to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;An hour after drying my hair with it, my hair was back to its frizzy self, and I really didn&#x27;t notice a quicker drying time.  </li>
            <li> I used it this morning for the first time and found that it really did make my hair feel much softer than with my other, cheaper quality, hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> While ordering this as a gift for someone recently, I noticed the many negative reviews which described exactly what had happened to MY hair too!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY ANY REVLON DRYERS, many other models have done the same.  </li>
            <li> Reading through past reviews, I&#x27;m just glad my hair dryer didn&#x27;t throw off sparks or catch on fire.</li>
            <li> When I read through the instruction manual, there was a section that stated that the hair dryer had an internal thermometer that would cause the hair dryer to cut power if it became too hot.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too hot to put back on.</li>
            <li> I have had it about 2 months now and every time I use it the handle gets so hot that I actually get</li>
            <li> WOW!    </li>
            <li> its too hot on the hot setting and too cold on the warm.</li>
            <li> There was alot more hair on the floor than usual.  </li>
            <li> I have long, curly, fine, frizzy hair that I like to blow dry straight.  </li>
            <li> I looked inside and it was red hot and started smoking.  </li>
            <li> After my 20+ year old Conair blow dryer was literally falling apart (but still working!)</li>
            <li> Buy this model instead of the more expensive salon models, and spend the extra $$ on more shampoo.</li>
            <li> It started smoking and the handle turned red &amp; hot.</li>
            <li> This one has multiple settings,so you can choose how hot you need it to be.</li>
            <li> Many other similar reports online when I looked it up.  </li>
            <li> I usually look up Consumer Reports on most of my purchases.  </li>
            <li> Dryer worked fine for about a year and a half until one day, it powered off mid-dry.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty standard hairdryer, imo.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this blow dryer last year (2012).</li>
            <li> I had the exact dryer prior to purchasing this one.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this when the cord on the same exact one I had became damaged.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer does a quick, non scorching dry and leaves my hair looking soft.  </li>
            <li> and I could get it relatively straight (as long as it isn&#x27;t very humid)</li>
            <li> This dryer didn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as my old dryer of the same wattage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to purchase another one exactly the same as my old Revlon model.</li>
            <li> Prefer this dryer for many years as it isn&#x27;t too small to handle but large enough to hold and direct in drying hair.</li>
            <li> I was happy with it for about a month, and then started noticing that it would constantly cycle between hot and cold.  </li>
            <li> The unit dries wet hair quickly and leaves hair soft, not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I love this product I had the same one before, but it completely broke down after owning it for years.</li>
            <li> and so I chose the same kind again especially because the weight was less</li>
            <li> However, I had this hair dryer a few years ago and worked fine for quite a while.</li>
            <li> That meant that the dryer only worked if I wrapped the power cord around the handle in a certain angle.  </li>
            <li> It dried my very long hair in just a few minutes (compared with five for my older dryer) and the diffuser gives great volume and lift.  </li>
            <li> Steer clear of this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s much louder than I imagined, far from quiet.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t dropped or near to a water or anything that might&#x27;ve caused it to malfunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also noticed that whenever my hair dresser cuts &amp; blows out my hair, I have soft \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old Remington dryer, either.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get the old dryer without the ceramic feature.</li>
            <li> try not keeping it too long on your hair when its on the hot setting.</li>
            <li> That is how your hair will feel when you use this dryer, only it will take a much shorter amount of time.  </li>
            <li> , it was a lot lighter than my old one.  </li>
            <li> This is a LOUD hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and bouncy when I use it.</li>
            <li> My old dryer conked out so I decided to purchase this one.  </li>
            <li> I use the bowl attachment when I want a natural wave</li>
            <li> The manufacturer wants me to ship it back to them....</li>
            <li> I even went as far as reinforcing the flexible shield where the cord meets the dryer in hopes that it would keep stress off the cable.</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s hair was soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter says she hates the hair dryer and it leaves her hair frizzy too.  </li>
            <li> and with the old hair dryers my hair would end up frizzed at the ends.  </li>
            <li> I immediately unplugged it, looked it over and saw the cord was melted near the handle.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT the diffuser attachment has started to COMPLETELY melt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy at all</li>
            <li> (I have short hair), failures started to appear very soon:  </li>
            <li> Not heavy</li>
            <li> The old one is still working.  </li>
            <li> If you want a dryer that lasts forever, I guess you can spend upwards of $150-$200 for a professional one (like my hair dresser)</li>
            <li> I docked a star because it has a weaker output than my old blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Because my hair is so thick, I did have to spend about fifteen to thirty minutes touching it up with my straightening iron, but that is NOTHING to the two hours</li>
            <li> I have a bunch of hair and it dries it in no time while other dryers take more than 20 minutes to have way dry it!</li>
            <li> I have to turn it off and let the handle cool down</li>
            <li> I bought a new different brand of hair dryer and my hair has now been restored to normal, soft shiny hair just like when my hair dresser does it.  </li>
            <li> After all these years, the cord is starting to bend oddly right at the plug, so I don&#x27;t think it has a lot of life in it left unless I find a way to replace the cord.</li>
            <li> For months now, I&#x27;ve been blaming my flat iron on burning a large section of my hair- until today-</li>
            <li> /&gt;While true enough, it did dry my hair</li>
            <li> The ions that are supposed to make my hair shiny and dry quicker were pretty unapparent.  </li>
            <li> that is there when you first dry it.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try an inexpensive hair dryer for the first time since money was tight, and now I really regret it.  </li>
            <li> Fortunatley, I reacted quickly and threw it down without it harming my hair, head or anything else.</li>
            <li> The buttons were a little stiff at first use, but I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll loosen up with more use.      </li>
            <li> Read the fine print, not sure if anyone would jump through the hoops to return it</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thin,fragile hair;and many of the products I&#x27;ve tried have done some serious damage.</li>
            <li> it has all the features that are needed (hot/cold air, different temperature of hot, ionization that you can turn on/off, different speed)</li>
            <li> the exact same drier the very same day.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought the dryer was from my local Walgreens store &amp; the 2nd time was thru Target&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two Revlon hairdryers over the past year and this one worked better than the subsequent one.</li>
            <li> But if you have thick long hair like mine(reaches my waist)this is a handy tool.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this dryer for two very MAJOR reasons.     </li>
            <li> The problem is obviously a cheap cord that when bent back and forth enough times will wear the wire enough to short out.</li>
            <li> Believe me this will happen to all of these units eventually if you use the high heat settings daily.</li>
            <li> And the bottom button adjusts the air flow from low, med to high.</li>
            <li> Also because it doesn&#x27;t really blow dry (just gets hot) it takes longer to actually dry the hair.  </li>
            <li> Especially when my cousin dries my hair for me my hair comes out so smooth and soft with little product.</li>
            <li> and it took the hair dryer much longer to dry my hair than my old one.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t work long so don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> and I guess fixed the problem (and I avoided, apparently, setting my hair on fire).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A true waste...</li>
            <li> Both my expensive hair dryer and this hair dryer get my hair straight and very smooth.</li>
            <li> Wait just a few years until this baby shoots out sparks from both ends of the body AT 6 A.M. one fine Monday morning (like it did for me this morning), and RISK BOTH BURNING OFF MASSIVE CHUNKS OF YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a short cut and a new dryer and waiting for my hair to grow out.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this new hair dryer after owning the same one for over a decade.  </li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a new hair dryer and want one that is functional I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a much quicker, healthier dry time.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like hair would dry as fast as it does...</li>
            <li> I sent this dryer back and will continue to use my old one until it dies completely.</li>
            <li> So, I was looking for a model that would be quiet and hopefully not expose my ears to as much damage as the regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Without thinking, I went out and bought a second one since the first one lasted so long, and thought maybe the sparking incident was a fluke.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, if you&#x27;re going to put your name on something my feeling is that you should stand by the product yourself and not send consumers on a wild goose chase to track down the responsible party!    </li>
            <li> This hair dryer has changed all that - the very first time I used it - my hair dried shiny - with no frizz at all.  </li>
            <li> I check out other reviews on this product on the web yesterday and it seems that I&#x27;m not the first for this</li>
            <li> I have bought this dryer several times though because it will dry my hair sooooo fast!  </li>
            <li> The previous ones never lasted more than a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Overall, if you don&#x27;t mind the potential electrical danger, it&#x27;s a decent dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> The high power had suddenly become almost low power but not quite.</li>
            <li> I got this blow dryer to replace an old one thinking it was the same brand because both were around $20.  </li>
            <li> but after the second time of a flame shooting out and a loud pop and then sparks everywhere I figuring it time to switch brands..</li>
            <li> The one I have isn&#x27;t ionic and wanted to try it, guess I&#x27;ll go back to the old one.</li>
            <li> The fan was barely spinning on max.  </li>
            <li> : fire the first time, sparks the second, which sounds pretty common considering the reviews on here.  </li>
            <li> My first one finally died and I ordered the very same one because it performed so well and lasted so long.</li>
            <li> It was important to me for the dryer to have a medium heat setting since I also use the dryer to dry my two little dogs after their bath.  </li>
            <li> This cord has more of a softer  rubber feel and a dull dark color, where proper cords have a shiny finish and more of a hard vinyl feel.</li>
            <li> Unit will start making a odd noise and smell funny, not</li>
            <li> My dryer managed to reach that too hot temperature in less than a minute of use.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair which tends to be dry normally</li>
            <li> I wrote a similar review years ago addressing the popping and sparking problem, the frayed hot cord at the point the cord attaches to the handle, and other issues I was having with this.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly this dryer dried my shoulder length hair in under 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> Last week the high fan speed setting started acting like the low speed setting.  </li>
            <li> High speed was not a high speed.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, healthy, naturally curly hair and drying/straightening can take a while so weight matters.      </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews about this dryer, I went straight to Target and bought it</li>
            <li> Not disappointed in the least.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, next time I will probably spend a little more and try to get one that leaves my hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li> After reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I didn&#x27;t know for sure whether I should buy it or not, but I convinced myself to because there will always be someone who&#x27;s not happy with a particular product.</li>
            <li> Since people are having such widely varied results, I can only wonder as to the manufacturer&#x27;s quality control process, possibly letting through a few too many faulty machines...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about 15 or more hair dryers in my life and never experienced such a problem.   </li>
            <li> I was limited in choice in buying a new hairdryer after mine died, since I was at a grocery store and needed one immediately.  </li>
            <li> After a couple uses I noticed the smell of burning hair and thought maybe it was a little too hot</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does come with attachments that similarly priced dryers don&#x27;t usually come with, and there&#x27;s a removable cover thing on the lint trap in the back that makes it way easier to clean, you can remove it and wash it off in the sink in 2 seconds.</li>
            <li> It lasted much longer than I expected, especially given that I used it nearly every single day for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li> While the price is right, it is not worth the fire risk!!</li>
            <li> The last time I used it, I noticed the general smell of burning hair when I was done.  </li>
            <li> My curly hair actually turned straight because of this medication and now I assumed my hair was continuing to morph into brittleness and falling out due to the meds.</li>
            <li> We bought it not long ago, about a month.</li>
            <li> My wife asked for a small, powerful hair dryer for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> The first one I&#x27;d had for a few years before it began smoking at the cord.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It certainly makes blow drying my hair less of an event.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, very curly long hair that normally would take about 40+ minutes to blow dry straight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad, because up until the time I thought I might be electrocuted, I liked how fast it dried my hair and the condition of my hair after drying.</li>
            <li> How am I supposed to live without a hairdryer for that long?!?!?!  </li>
            <li> Not a very long life,</li>
            <li> I exchanged it for a new one, and the new one died a few months later.  </li>
            <li> But for the diffuser, it remains to work just fine -- only because I hardly ever use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this dryer does dry faster, and leaves my hair softer and shinier and fuller than my old conair.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> Charred hair was all over the place, both long sections burned off near the root and smaller curled burnt pieces from the ends, and the stench was overpowering.    </li>
            <li> I just moved to Miami and needed a hair dryer that would straighten my medium length wavy hair FAST without ending up a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> The dryer gets too hot and because the air flow is not strong enough, you end up burning your hair instead of drying it.  </li>
            <li> Just turning the dryer on long enough to dry my hair on high makes the plastic all gooey.</li>
            <li> That way it comes out relatively straight with little frizz (again, dependant on humidity)</li>
            <li> A little while after he had finished using it, he noted that the barrel stayed hot for a long time after it was off.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally curly, thick hair that I like to wear very straight to the office.</li>
            <li> , I have long thick wavy hair that I dry straight, so I&#x27;m hoping this dryer really does work</li>
            <li> A few days later when I was drying my daughter&#x27;s hair on high power, the dryer suddenly lost power.</li>
            <li> Less frizz, dried quick.</li>
            <li> When I compare the cord to other dryers I clearly see the difference in cord.</li>
            <li> My husband then tested it against a flat surface and it constantly sparked as it was on.</li>
            <li> A few months after purchasing, the HIGH setting became LOW and the dryer began shooting sparks out of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the dryer I bought was just defective or something, but it was loud and put out very little air for as loud as it was.</li>
            <li> This recently broke and it did not last long at all !</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s end after a long life of use, but after reading some of the other reviews here I am surprised to learn that this has happened to others, and so soon after their purchase.</li>
            <li> I get so frustrated when the temperature corresponds to the air flow setting because it won&#x27;t let me use hot on low or cool on med...catch my drift?  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure which did it, but my hair looks so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> Evidently this is a common problem as indicated by the problems people have been having with sparks shooting out of the cord and even fires where it shorts out.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth it as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> ends lay flat with the Revlon ION.</li>
            <li> so it may not last as long as the \\&quot;SSX\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Biggest downside of this product is that after a long time (years), the filter on the back broke and wouldn&#x27;t stay on the dryer.  </li>
            <li> This button is rectangular and flat, again making it look and feel like it should be pushed up and not in.  </li>
            <li> my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Never had one last that long.  </li>
            <li> After reading the instructions that came with the dryer, I began with the heat on the highest setting as instructed and drying my hair with a round metal vented brush as normal.  </li>
            <li> It was slightly less noisy, but at a different pitch (it seemed a little higher pitched).       </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, naturally curly hair, and I used the concentration attachment to help me blow dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li> he would of freaked out and probably never let me near him to dry his hair..or worse he could of been really hurt!</li>
            <li> The other day it starting shorting out and then suddenly sparks starting flying out of the spot where the cord enters the handle of the dryer, melting part of the cord.</li>
            <li> And because of a few components that are sometimes intentionally \\&quot;designed to fail\\&quot;, all of this ends up in a landfill so that REVLON can sell you a new one.</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s blow dryer (which was the older version), was broken and she needed a new one.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair in well over HALF the time my old one did.</li>
            <li> It definitely took longer to dry my hair with this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Have you ever left your hair in a towel until it was completely dry?  </li>
            <li> and it was less than a year old.</li>
            <li> I blew dry my hair with this brow dryer and with the next time I had to wash my hair</li>
            <li> like it did with my previous one that was old and didn&#x27;t have ion technology.</li>
            <li> Decided to give it another try, well my hair was frizzy and dry after only one use!</li>
            <li> I used to dry my hair all the time, but I have cut back.  </li>
            <li> I bought it at ShopKo which offers an extended policy for a few extra dollars.  </li>
            <li> I have it set on the &#x27;lowest&#x27; ion setting - meant for thin hair - and it dries quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> I am not a rough user and other dryers have lasted me 10 + years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too loud and not strong enough to blow my hair.</li>
            <li> I suspect that this ultimately contributed to its demise when the motor burned out suddenly the other day.  </li>
            <li> I will contact Revlon and hopefully this dryer will be pulled off the market before some young adult gets seriously hurt or burnt.</li>
            <li> My hair is flat and it takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> Buy it only if you want dry hair and limited hearing.</li>
            <li> It may sound silly, but I bought it for the bowl attachment.</li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment was when I couldn&#x27;t attach the end cap so that I could concentrate more on the strands of my hair.</li>
            <li> hope it will work for a long time.</li>
            <li> For a waste of $18-$21 American, YOU TOO CAN BE A 21 YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH SYMPTOMS OF FEMALE PATTERN BALDNESS!!!!</li>
            <li> I have medium-thick hair, but it is long, and there is a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> After using it every day for about 8 days, I noticed a strange smell, but didn&#x27;t know what it was.</li>
            <li> I dried it with my old blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It is definitely money well spent.</li>
            <li> I still could use the dryer, but without ions, without heat and only when I wrapped the cord carefully around the handle.  </li>
            <li> The filter is there to keep your hair from being sucked into the back of the hairdryer, so for the rest of its life I had to be insanely careful of how I held it.</li>
            <li> &amp; it has a long cord&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> The Revlon is larger than I like but that is not a real problem.</li>
            <li> While I really liked the dryer&#x27;s performance and the flexibility of using it with either the concentrator or diffuser attachments it came with, I&#x27;m really disappointed that it&#x27;s burned out and inoperable after using it (not even daily or at the highest setting!)</li>
            <li> I used that for about a year and the heating element quit so only cool air came out making it useless.  </li>
            <li> I kick it up to the high setting and become aware of a \\&quot;hot\\&quot; smell after a couple of minutes, but think that since I don&#x27;t use this setting very often, it&#x27;s just using coils it doesn&#x27;t usually use- wrong!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical to order this one because of the price but was pleasantly surprised at how fast it dried my hair and left it straight with a little volume just how I like it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it used to take me over 15 minutes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to dry my hair</li>
            <li> but it suffers from the same, if not a little more, complaint.  </li>
            <li> The problem is where the cord comes out at the end of the dryer gets frayed due to the back and forth motion.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated the area of cord where it comes out of the handle wears out and short circuits causing pops, sparks and fire!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely upset, and definitely will not purchase another Revlon product.</li>
            <li> and I cannot believe they are still selling them with all the other complaints I have read about them that date back to 2006!</li>
            <li> This is a relatively inexpensive product and performs extremely well.</li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair and with my old dryer it took 30 minutes to dry, with this dryer only 15 minutes!!!</li>
            <li> I used the hairdryer once a week (if even) to dry my kids hair</li>
            <li> and it gets my hair dry in an acceptable amount of time.</li>
            <li> My hair was completely dry in about 5 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been this dry and unmanagable.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks, I noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t as dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I never noticed my hair being shiner, but it does get it dry.  </li>
            <li> and this gets it dry in no time.  </li>
            <li> Afro American female I use with a long hard comb attachment and this makes blow drying so much easier because I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> Keep your receipt for this one, product has a 2 year Limited Warranty.  </li>
            <li> I did not change one single thing - except my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> dryer is a bit quieter than your average one, but I actually feel that my ... conair, although louder, is a bit stronger in force than this dryer.  </li>
            <li> i guess i don&#x27;t know what an average life span of a hairdryer is, but i would hope they design them to last longer than a couple years.  </li>
            <li> When we got back I could not find it, and thought it was left behind in the hotel, so I pulled out a 10 year old Conair 1600 watt hair dryer to use temporarily.  </li>
            <li> The key verdict will be determined by how long the unit will last... as the previous 2 units (Vidal Sasson) burned out in less than 12 months.</li>
            <li> This one, however, dried my hair so quickly I could hardly believe it!  </li>
            <li> I wish I had read further down the reviews before I bought this myself.</li>
            <li> Some stores will take it back for store credit after the 30 days and less that the 2 year period.  </li>
            <li> But a bit too long and heavy to handle, especially with the filter, tiring for my arm  </li>
            <li> I had this less than 1 year and always kept the back cleared of lint</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dryer for less than 4 months and it&#x27;s already acting up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for about a year and half, purchased it after my last dryer stopped working.</li>
            <li> It was not quite as heat-intensive as my previous hair dryer (also a Revlon product), which I&#x27;m guessing will also help the future health of my hair.       </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call the noise volume quiet, but it was quieter than smaller high-pitched dryers I had in the past.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that prevents me from giving a five-star rating is that it seemed to take a little longer to dry my hair than with my previous dryer, which was the same wattage.       </li>
            <li> Over the last few months I have noticed the ends of my hair have been dry, frizzy and brittle.</li>
            <li> The dryer seemed to dry my hair in a reasonable amount of time, and the weight of the dryer wasn&#x27;t too heavy for 5-8 minutes of drying time for my shoulder length thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair, and a lot of it, that comes down to between my shoulder blades and normally takes me about 30 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer maybe 2 years ago or so after the one i&#x27;d had for 7 years finally died (i don&#x27;t remember anything about that one other than it was small and blue).  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair, and it comes with that nifty little attachment that allows me to focus on a specific area.</li>
            <li> This one only a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> Not very powerful takes forever to dry my hair and minimal frizz control.</li>
            <li> The ion process seems to make her very long, thick hair less frizzy than conventional dryers, but neither the venturi nor the finger attachment did much to quicken the drying process.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the whole ionizing thing, but it has made a big difference with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Lasted only a few months before it died.</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks it would overheat within seconds and send out a spark that would actually burn my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I may have gotten a faulty one but be careful.</li>
            <li> and this dryer is definitely dead after a very brief run.  </li>
            <li> Dryer came as expected.  </li>
            <li> I had been curious about the ionic feature and when my conair died, I decided I&#x27;d purchase one with an ionic feature -afterall</li>
            <li> It saw heavy use with waist length hair the three years prior.</li>
            <li> It was momentarily alarming--</li>
            <li> Then a few days ago the dryer suddenly quit working.  </li>
            <li> So, looks like i will have to buy another dryer sooner than i&#x27;d expected.  </li>
            <li> With daily use for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer, and it died a few months later.  </li>
            <li> did like the rubber hook on the base of the dryer, it came in handy for hanging the dryer on the side of my vanity when not in use (before I started packing it for the gym).  </li>
            <li> I did like the rubber hook on the base of the dryer, it came in handy for hanging the dryer on the side of my vanity when not in use (before I started packing it for the gym).  </li>
            <li> If you lose power just once due to a loose cord connection, STOP using immediately.  </li>
            <li> Around 6 years ago I decided to purchase an expensive Chi dryer for $150 only because I thought it must be better since it was so much more expensive - wrong!</li>
            <li> I highly doubt some of the other women reviewing were using a heat protectant thus explaining their dry unhealthy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dried just as slowly with the Ion switch on or off and the cold air blast was never cold or room temperature, it always just felt like the hot air was coming</li>
            <li> It is slightly wavy, and gets dry no matter what conditioner I use.  </li>
            <li> I got this blow dryer hoping that my frizzy hair would dry faster and get less frizzy...</li>
            <li> In the past, I have been aggravated by poorly placed on and off switches which would be right in the way of your hand when you were drying your hair and switch on and off when you didn&#x27;t want them to.  </li>
            <li> I have had other revlon hair styling tools that lasted longer, just not this one.</li>
            <li> That day I found out how underpowered this HD was compared to other 1875w dryers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up buying the thing that night and threw that other conair one out.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a lot quieter than any other dryer that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Until recently, I had never done any research before buying any household small appliances.</li>
            <li> I received my hair dryer and found it to be the same as other dryers I have owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this dryer or any other Revlon hair products.  </li>
            <li> As stated in some of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> And the other thing, the dryer was sparking as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I bought my 2nd one this past February.</li>
            <li> This past week the same thing happened again..</li>
            <li> As I thought the malfunction was due to wear and tear, I purchased another one.  </li>
            <li> I had it for about 5 years and didn&#x27;t want to experiment with other models or brands.</li>
            <li> other then that problem</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, like these other ladies, my hair dryer just blew up in my face as I was using it.</li>
            <li> The cold air button is really more of a \\&quot;less hot air\\&quot; than actual cold air, but I really don&#x27;t have a use for cold air, anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that the ions make my hair dry faster, but as an experiment I have, on several occasions, dried with and without the ion setting on</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, wavy hair that I usually let dry naturally after drying my bangs (maybe 5 minutes).  </li>
            <li> but always wondered why there always seemed to be new broken hairs with singed marks on the end.  </li>
            <li> It took me less than half an hour, even with sectioning my hair off, to dry and straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I was attributing it to hairdressers thinning my thick hair with these special cutting shears or possibly that the highlighting of my hair had taken its toll after 6 years of coloring so it was drying it out.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and has always taken a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the ceramic ion feature really did, but it seemed to work no better or worse than any other dryer i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer less than one year ago and used it every other day.</li>
            <li> During the time that it worked, average product.</li>
            <li> Volumizer not really worth it</li>
            <li> Not worth the pain and money.</li>
            <li> Did not last nearly as long as it should of, poorly made</li>
            <li> What the heck!!!!! People have complained about this product since back in 2007</li>
            <li> however - it&#x27;s not powerful at all.  </li>
            <li> As for the diffuser I used it a few times and never really got the hang of it</li>
            <li> It seems that they listened to their customers and installed something that cools it down in cycles AS it is drying your hair..</li>
            <li> This is a safety hazard and judging from other reviews my experience is not unique.     </li>
            <li> another reviewer, I&#x27;ve waited a few days and tried resetting the plug and any outlet that I plug it into (all the outlets work with other appliances)</li>
            <li> Within a week, there were no more ions, then there was a loose contact where the power cord enters into the body of the dryer.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, unmanageable hair but with this bad boy it goes from super frizzed out to soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and therefore it will be less tiring to use.  </li>
            <li> I had this hair dryer for less than 1 year.</li>
            <li> Button seems to be made from be less than durable plastic.</li>
            <li> If the fan was stronger I think there would be less of a chance to burn the hair, and it would cause less pain on the scalp.</li>
            <li> We have this hair dryer less than 2 years and</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;d say skip the ion fad and go for your typical dryer.  </li>
            <li> Tonight my husband pointed out the plug (where the prong meets the black plastic) is melting.  </li>
            <li> Purchased as a replacement for my previous one.  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer in the begining of the year thinking it would produce less frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair improved, less split ends/breakage.</li>
            <li> Mine stopped working in less than 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Trying to push this button IN is often somewhat difficult (too thin; too highly set) and takes several tries.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy, long, thick hair</li>
            <li> The buttons popped off, the temperature goes from hot to cold to hot to cold every 30 seconds while on \\&quot;hot\\&quot; and sparks come out about every 45 seconds or so.</li>
            <li> I had this hair dryer for about two months when I noticed that it would switch to a cold cycle when it was too hot</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair which, in the past, has always taken forever to dry with a regular hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am running out today to buy a new hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say... time for me to get a new hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I had been using this dryer for a little over 2 years with the concentrator.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The attachments are held onto the dryer by a little hump of plastic.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer for about (a little money).</li>
            <li> With this drier, I am done in half the time or less!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about other ionic dryers, but this one has a switch to turn off the ionic feature if you&#x27;d like - although I can&#x27;t imagine why.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> This dryer I purchased a little over a year ago</li>
            <li> I used to stick with one hairdresser for at least 3 to 5 years until I needed a change, yet now I was jumping to a new one after each color and cut because I was not happy with my hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer was approximately the same weight as my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> It seems that the common consensus is ozone, but ozone is not an ion, it&#x27;s a polar molecule.</li>
            <li> My hair is not too thin or thick and when I separate it into sections the dryer works well to straighten / dry it properly.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy</li>
            <li> Execelent, but a little too heavy.</li>
            <li> Granted, I used this dryer on the highest heat setting everyday for a year, so I got a lot of use out of it, but every other hairdryer I&#x27;ve had in the past simply blows cold air when it stops working properly--this one could&#x27;ve caused me bodily harm.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this attachment is hard to attach and remove.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer for a few years, and it has served me well up until now.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s not an expensive professional dryer</li>
            <li> Not that much trouble out of it.</li>
            <li> This dryer also came with a round hair brush.  </li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer for almost 5 years and it has never given me any trouble.  </li>
            <li> Cord broke at handle in a few months</li>
            <li> but both times it just nearly killed me...</li>
            <li> It also has trouble with heat control, the temp varies often without changing a switch.</li>
            <li> With my hair looking quite damaged recently I wanted a dryer that wouldn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble and go buy something else.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I discovered a bag that had not been unpacked and found this Revlon dryer.</li>
            <li> Drying my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Dead as of 12/2014.</li>
            <li> Quit after a few months.  </li>
            <li> This one is dead.</li>
            <li> My mother also had this blowdryer a few years  </li>
            <li> Sparks flew out where the cord meets the handle, &amp; it&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> This is also broken last two days.</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder length hair, that usually takes 35 - 40 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how mad I am that I was exposed to such a big risk!</li>
            <li> other complaint is the attachments for it.  </li>
            <li> I have long, very thick, and sometimes unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair</li>
            <li> I have past shoulder length hair, set it on half heat, dries within 7 minutes and not frizzy!</li>
            <li> hair is thick with a slight wave to it.  </li>
            <li> Well over a year ago I started noticing one side of my hair getting split ends, dry and thin.   </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and slightly wavy, and it took fifteen minutes start to finish with a rounded air vent brush.  </li>
            <li> It is not only very scary when you have flames shooting at your face, hair, and clothing, but needless to say, very dangerous.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact that this hair dryer broke after 2 months of moderate and careful use is bad enough, but what is worse is the way it broke</li>
            <li> Switches are hard to push up and down , hard to operate with one hand.</li>
            <li> I had this blow dryer a little over a year, and I was never very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Why is it that Amazon continues to sell this obviously dangerous product when clearly 1/3 of all reviews relate to the electrical hazard?</li>
            <li> I used to have a small, folding travel dryer.  </li>
            <li> And by the time I was done, I had a bunch of small hairs going</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this one works because I never tried it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Buy one, make sure to leave the ION setting \\&quot;ON\\&quot; (not sure why you would NOT want to), you won&#x27;t not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I used this dryer for about the past 1-2 years.</li>
            <li> My hair is usually somewhat frizzy after blow-drying.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I got a dud one or not</li>
            <li> Not sure if the ions were a factor, but it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical enough to keep all the packaging in order to return it if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The cord is very short, which makes it difficult to move around.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if there were sparks</li>
            <li> It was just past the warranty period</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my imagination</li>
            <li> Ion Electrostatic precipitators release small doses of ozone as a byproduct, ozone is toxic and can eat away at the tissue of your lungs.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even my drastic efforts didn&#x27;t save it--it only lasted about six months.</li>
            <li> so that was pointless.</li>
            <li> when I was blow drying , as usual, and smelled something, then saw a gray spot on my head- upon closer inspection, realized it was a singed section of my hair, and as I ran my fingers through it-</li>
            <li> I have to admit that this has been used as a spare dryer for the past year, but it is still used twice a month at least.</li>
            <li> It was totally terrifying, and we were very lucky she did not get burned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long thin hair, so thin that it NEVER keeps a curl, or the body and fullness</li>
            <li> I also use a salon diffuser which fits perfectly (hard to do on alot of dryers).  </li>
            <li> When I moved the cord a little it turned back on, so I knew it had a bad connection.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think I can complaint.  </li>
            <li> Please stay away from this hair dryer unless you want to be scared out of your wits when you least expect it and risk burning off a part of your hair (or carpet).</li>
            <li> Only cold air.  </li>
            <li> At least mine did for about a year until...    </li>
            <li> maybe someone from revlon will read this and offer a refund or a least a recall..if this had happened while i was drying my 2 year olds hair</li>
            <li> I will be writing a complaint to Revlon and returning the item to the store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve complained to Revlon, still waiting to hear from them.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that I am going to have the same problem.  </li>
            <li> I sent a complaint to Revlon, still waiting for a response.</li>
            <li> it does not warm as we wanted</li>
            <li> went to cold cycle definitely throwing it in trash and from all the feedback on this page</li>
            <li> It was falling out in thick strands which has never happened to me before.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair is not fine or thin and no dryer I have ever had has burned my hair before.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading the online reviews but after reading about the other blowdryers I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> So I opened it up and it looks like they used a questionable motor among other things.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve gotten 4-5 years at the very least out of past blow dryers.</li>
            <li> This is a serious fire hazard and could have set our kids hair on fire</li>
            <li> Well a month ago I took this hairdryer on a trip with us because the hotel hair dryers are weak and slow.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the reviews that I read.</li>
            <li> The only issue is it&#x27;s bulking too bad</li>
            <li> The one we bought years ago lasted for several years before the cord went bad.  </li>
            <li> It is really not good for the environment.  </li>
            <li> takes me double the time to blowdry my hair now :(  </li>
            <li> It was very hard and hurt my head.</li>
            <li> Thank you Revlon for cutting my drying time in half.  </li>
            <li> The electrical cord became loose from the base of the unit, exposing raw wiring, and sparking with a flame one day while my 11-year-old child was using it!</li>
            <li> This one is much much worse.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m never happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I used this dryer for approximately two years and had no complaints until yesterday...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for approximately 6 months and just noticed, as others have, that it is sparking.  </li>
            <li> I figured I had accidentally shut it off with my thumb (since the control buttons are so poorly placed).</li>
            <li> It became so frustrating.</li>
            <li> Every one of them has broken within a year, and of course, I can never find the receipt when I need it for the warranty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it as it is poor quality.</li>
            <li> I receive compliments on my hair when I have used the Revlon ION dryer, and needless to say, no compliments on my hair when I have used the \\&quot;SSX\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I bough just 6 months ago and it started to have a weird noise and was not working well</li>
            <li> and I am sorry that I bought it.  </li>
            <li> It does, however, have a burst-of-cold-air button which is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product almost four years ago, and today was the sad day that it cut out.  </li>
            <li> It is almost designed to fail.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;The worst part of my experience is that I bought another one, albeit a different model.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating when you&#x27;re trying to get the dryer and a brush through your hair and the concentrator keeps popping off and falling on the floor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very frustrating when you&#x27;re trying to get the dryer and a brush through your hair and the concentrator keeps popping off and falling on the floor.    </li>
            <li> Very poor design...</li>
            <li> If you buy it, use it for something other than what it was designed for or you&#x27;ll be bald and blind!!!</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t go crazy with styling, I don&#x27;t do the &#x27;just out of bed&#x27;</li>

            <li> Dangerous.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely dangerous and should be recalled off of the market immediately.[[ASIN:B000NNBLSY Revlon Amber Waves 1,875-watt Ion Dryer]]</li>
            <li> But even though the dryer was blowing, the heat was no longer working, and I was blasting my head with cold air.  </li>
            <li> somewhat of a disappointment, i have to say.&lt;br</li>
            <li> -- I consider it highly dangerous.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the cold setting.</li>
            <li> The motor cuts on and off while using it, which is frustrating and annoying.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything until today because  this was SO BAD.</li>
            <li> This morning while drying my hair, I noticed a bad smell and then saw clumps of hair with the ends melted together on the floor and bathroom counter.</li>

            <li> well, it just didn&#x27;t turn on after a year of use. it wasn&#x27;t dropped or near to a water or anything that might&#x27;ve caused it to malfunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As i was getting ready for my day, it just didn&#x27;t turn on. i tried to troubleshoot it, reset, use a different plug etc. no luck.</li>
            <li> Wonderful results. Easy to handle. Great price!  Having said this, I&#x27;m on my third dryer. The problem is where the cord comes out at the end of the dryer gets frayed due to the back and forth motion. In addition to my purchase I also called Helen of Troy. For $6.00 plus shipping they replaced the dryer.  This was equivalent to what I paid for the new dryer. But I wanted to show the company the problem.</li>
            <li> Keep your receipt for this one, product has a 2 year Limited Warranty.  Read the fine print, not sure if anyone would jump through the hoops to return it and Revlon knows that.  Some stores will take it back for store credit after the 30 days and less that the 2 year period.  Just like anything else, It&#x27;s great when it works, however, this is our third one.  The previous ones never lasted more than a year and a half.  Unit will start making a odd noise and smell funny, not haha funny either, a smell like it might catch fire.  Take your chances, for us, maybe the third time will be the charm....I doubt it.</li>
            <li> I just needed a blow dryer to keep at my bf&#x27;s house and because I needed a defuser this was what I found and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> Lasted only a few months before it died. Simply stopped working both the motor and the heating. During the time that it worked, average product. Not the best but not the worst.</li>
            <li> I liked the previous one Revlon 1875 w I had and so I chose the same kind again especially because the weight was less and therefore it will be less tiring to use.  I like it but don&#x27;t think the ionic fixture does any difference.  I still see my hair kind of frizzy when I dry it.  Otherwise, it is relatively good and considering the price is so low, I don&#x27;t think I can complaint.  Nevertheless, next time I will probably spend a little more and try to get one that leaves my hair less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer becuase I needed one quick and it was cheap. The different setting selection is nice. I have medium thick hair, and a lot of it, that comes down to between my shoulder blades and normally takes me about 30 minutes to dry. It did the job for about a year till it shorted out and sparks came out of it. Not a very long life, but I guess you get what you pay for. I have had other revlon hair styling tools that lasted longer, just not this one.</li>
            <li> Diffuser could be bigger. But it is ok.</li>
            <li> BUY THIS PEOPLE. VERY STRONG!</li>
            <li> I purchased model #RV 484 Ionic Revlon Dryer(grey &amp; maroon color). While I was drying my hair, it sparked fire out of the back of the unit.  I have read online that many people have experienced the same situation.  They have contacted Revlon without good customer service.  The company wants us ot pay $20 to pack it up and ship the unit in.  DON&#x27;T BUY ANY REVLON DRYERS, many other models have done the same.  Some people have burnt their hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I looked at this hair dryer for two reasons: (1) as a back-up to my $100 hair dryer my salon sells and (2) something I could keep in my gym bag. I have long, naturally curly, thick hair that I like to wear very straight to the office. Both my expensive hair dryer and this hair dryer get my hair straight and very smooth. The best method for achieving this was to use the highest heat and fastest setting on wet hair until the hair is damp, then to finish drying my hair with the air-flow nozzle on low speed and medium heat while using a rollerbrush to hold the hair straight and curl the ends.         I&#x27;d highly recommend this hair dryer. One thing to note: I do not notice any difference when using the ion switch (depends on hair type?). But with the multiple settings and the air-flow nozzle, this is a great product. I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for six months and felt compelled to write because most commercial stores don&#x27;t sell quality hair dryers like this one.</li>
            <li> I started out really liking this dryer but after a few weeks it would overheat within seconds and send out a spark that would actually burn my hair.  It would singe it at the roots and burn off clumps of hair.  Then it would be cool for a minute and overheat again.  I didn&#x27;t notice a difference with the Ion option but this is my first dryer with that option so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  Other reviews seem to be great so I may have gotten a faulty one but be careful.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! I have very long, thick, naturally curly hair, and I used the concentration attachment to help me blow dry my hair straight. It took me less than half an hour, even with sectioning my hair off, to dry and straighten my hair. Because my hair is so thick, I did have to spend about fifteen to thirty minutes touching it up with my straightening iron, but that is NOTHING to the two hours I would normally spend on just using the straightening iron alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this hairdryer to anyone looking for one that is not only easy and reliable, but the price cannot be beat. Don&#x27;t spend all that money on something similar when this one will do the same job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review as soon as I use the defuser attachment, to see how well it dries my curls without frizzing and such.</li>
            <li> While I really liked the dryer&#x27;s performance and the flexibility of using it with either the concentrator or diffuser attachments it came with, I&#x27;m really disappointed that it&#x27;s burned out and inoperable after using it (not even daily or at the highest setting!) for under two weeks.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer, I&#x27;ve waited a few days and tried resetting the plug and any outlet that I plug it into (all the outlets work with other appliances) and this dryer is definitely dead after a very brief run.  Since people are having such widely varied results, I can only wonder as to the manufacturer&#x27;s quality control process, possibly letting through a few too many faulty machines...</li>
            <li> Product purchased about one month ago and so far we are pleased. The unit dries wet hair quickly and leaves hair soft, not frizzy. A bit large in the hand, but light enough not to be cumbersome. The key verdict will be determined by how long the unit will last... as the previous 2 units (Vidal Sasson) burned out in less than 12 months.</li>
            <li> Loved that it had three heat settings and two speeds. Did what a dryer was suppose to do. However, it is a bit noisy and it crapped out on me pretty quickly. From other reviews, I would say don&#x27;t buy it if you want a hair dryer that lasts more than a year to two years max.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had read further down the reviews before I bought this myself. I read the first few reviews at the time &amp; everyone seemed to love it. Indeed, I loved it when I first got it, so much so that I bought a second one to have should this one burn out (that happened to me once on vacation!!).  Over time, I noticed my hair was becoming brittle and coarse and was thinning out.  I attributed it to a new medication I was taking.  My curly hair actually turned straight because of this medication and now I assumed my hair was continuing to morph into brittleness and falling out due to the meds. I also noticed that whenever my hair dresser cuts &amp; blows out my hair, I have soft \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair.  I thought it was her hair products that gave that result.  While ordering this as a gift for someone recently, I noticed the many negative reviews which described exactly what had happened to MY hair too! I bought a new different brand of hair dryer and my hair has now been restored to normal, soft shiny hair just like when my hair dresser does it.  While mine has never burned out or sparked, it does shoot out smoke now and then, but not often.  Stay away from this blow dryer.  It will ruin your hair.</li>
            <li> Mine caught fire this morning- also at the spot where the cord meets the dryer.  Pop, fire, and a singed wrist...  I dropped it on the floor, which is luckily tile, so it only left a black mark rather than catching the floor on fire. What is up with this dryer????</li>
            <li> Dryer came as expected.  Frys hair quickly without frozzoes thanks to ion setting.  Volumizer not really worth it but it&#x27;s included.  Would buy another.  Best hiair dryer I ever owned!</li>
            <li> If I could, I would rate this product 4.5 stars. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but unlike all other hair dryers I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t fry my fine hair. (Granted, I always keep in on the &#x27;Warm&#x27; setting.) I love that it has so may options and the cool blast button really works! I&#x27;m not sure that the ions make my hair dry faster, but as an experiment I have, on several occasions, dried with and without the ion setting on and I noticed two things: more even drying (not just dryer in the part of my hair closest to the dryer, but even further out) and softer/smoother texture, with the ion setting. Overall, totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer for a few years, and it has served me well up until now. Just this morning I was blow drying my hair when sparks began to fly out of the dryer, into my hair and onto the floor. In shock, I threw the dryer to the ground where it continued to spark and hiss a few more times until it died. I figured it must have reached it&#x27;s end after a long life of use, but after reading some of the other reviews here I am surprised to learn that this has happened to others, and so soon after their purchase. Please stay away from this hair dryer unless you want to be scared out of your wits when you least expect it and risk burning off a part of your hair (or carpet).</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;m loving this hair dryer. it works perfect for me with my 4b 4c hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews on here that this dryer is burning people&#x27;s hair off.  Perhaps in an attempt to correct this, Revlon scaled back the heat output significantly.  I say this because my dryer doesn&#x27;t seem to get nearly as hot as my old, non-ion dryer.  I used to have a small, folding travel dryer.  It burned out and I replaced it with this.  My hair doesn&#x27;t dry any more quickly even though the thing is easily twice as large and has ion technology.  Also, my old travel dryer easily got hotter than this one.  The \\&quot;wind\\&quot; power isn&#x27;t as strong, either, even on the highest setting.  I kind of like this because my hair doesn&#x27;t blow everywhere when I&#x27;m using my round brush.  But it seems like the high setting should be the medium setting.    Anyway, OK dryer.  Nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> It works good, dries my hair quickly with adjustive speed and temprature   But a bit too long and heavy to handle, especially with the filter, tiring for my arm  And it will be better if the handle is foldable</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer! It dries my hair in well over HALF the time my old one did. The removable back allows you to clean all the lent and stuff that gets in there over time. It&#x27;s perfect, and it comes with a ton of attachments.</li>
            <li> So one day I forgot my Revlon RV484 dryer when I went to the gym. No problem since there are communal hair dryers I can use.  That day I found out how underpowered this HD was compared to other 1875w dryers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick with a slight wave to it.  I like to get it as straight and \\&quot;clean\\&quot; as I can.  I don&#x27;t like frizz, I don&#x27;t go crazy with styling, I don&#x27;t do the &#x27;just out of bed&#x27; look either. I had been using this dryer for a little over 2 years with the concentrator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While true enough, it did dry my hair and I could get it relatively straight (as long as it isn&#x27;t very humid), it took quite a bit of time and fussing to get it that way.  And by the time I was done, I had a bunch of small hairs going every which-way on the top of my head that I would need to smooth over with product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I needed my hair perfect, like if we were going out, that means I left it in a Turbie for 30-45 min instead of my usual day-to-day 10 min.  That way it comes out relatively straight with little frizz (again, dependant on humidity) I guess if you take that into consideration, this works fine if you have loads of time in the morning.  Me? I like my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the air was hot enough but the amount of air that was coming out was not, even on the high speed (which it was on for 2 years!).  I wish I would have figure that out back then and exchanged it for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were two features on the dryer that I could not tell you what they do, they never seemed to work or show a difference in styling for me: the Ion switch and the cold air blast. My hair dried just as slowly with the Ion switch on or off and the cold air blast was never cold or room temperature, it always just felt like the hot air was coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other complaint is the attachments for it.  The diffuser and the concentrator.  I think I used the diffuser once but it suffers from the same, if not a little more, complaint.  The attachments are held onto the dryer by a little hump of plastic.  With any force, they pop right out.  Very frustrating when you&#x27;re trying to get the dryer and a brush through your hair and the concentrator keeps popping off and falling on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the rubber hook on the base of the dryer, it came in handy for hanging the dryer on the side of my vanity when not in use (before I started packing it for the gym).  And the whole thing is light enough.lastic.  With any force, they pop right out.

            <li> It&#x27;s doing wonders to my girlfriend&#x27;s hair. She loves it</li>
            <li> I had this hair dryer for less than 1 year. The other day it starting shorting out and then suddenly sparks starting flying out of the spot where the cord enters the handle of the dryer, melting part of the cord. Fortunately, nothing caught fire! I replaced the dryer with a non-Revlon product.</li>
            <li> The disk somehow smells like plastic</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and within one week there was no warm/hot air at all.  Only cold air.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift.  I am not sure how this one works because I never tried it.  It was a big hit for the person who received it so it served its purpose.  Now she has her own blow dryer and won&#x27;t have to share.</li>
            <li> The first time my husband used this dryer, it seemed great. It had lots of power on high. A little while after he had finished using it, he noted that the barrel stayed hot for a long time after it was off. A few days later when I was drying my daughter&#x27;s hair on high power, the dryer suddenly lost power. The high power had suddenly become almost low power but not quite. I also noticed a smell coming from the dryer. Reading through past reviews, I&#x27;m just glad my hair dryer didn&#x27;t throw off sparks or catch on fire. When I read through the instruction manual, there was a section that stated that the hair dryer had an internal thermometer that would cause the hair dryer to cut power if it became too hot. My dryer managed to reach that too hot temperature in less than a minute of use. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> The three levels of temperature control are very helpful. The low speed is sufficient and the high speed is strong enough to do a through job without being too strong. I also really like the fact the ion control can be turned off and on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer only a couple months ago and it&#x27;s already overheating and shutting off.  I carefully keep the lint filters clean, but it doesn&#x27;t help.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as my old Remington dryer, either.</li>
            <li> Unit started smoking and was about to catch fire on first use.  I unplugged it and am going to send it back and ask for a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer less than one year ago and used it every other day. I am not a rough user and other dryers have lasted me 10 + years. On this model, partof the on - off slide plastic button cracked off , making it unusable. Button seems to be made from be less than durable plastic. The hairdryer when working,  didn&#x27;t do as good a job as my little travel hair dryer that is only 1250 watts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the review of others and my own experience  it is a no - brainer that I won&#x27;t buy this one again.  Can&#x27;t understand the disconnect between user reviews and my own experience versus high ratings for this model in Consumer Reports.</li>
            <li> I got this blow dryer to replace an old one thinking it was the same brand because both were around $20.  This one is much much worse.  The dryer gets too hot and because the air flow is not strong enough, you end up burning your hair instead of drying it.  If the fan was stronger I think there would be less of a chance to burn the hair, and it would cause less pain on the scalp. Also because it doesn&#x27;t really blow dry (just gets hot) it takes longer to actually dry the hair.  Steer clear of this blow dryer.  Not worth the pain and money.</li>
            <li> this is the 3rd one i&#x27;ve owned. i now have 2 (keep one in the guest bathroom). love the settings, how well it dries my hair without frizziness and the variety of settings.</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder length hair, that usually takes 35 - 40 minutes to dry. With this dryer, I&#x27;m done in 20 minutes and my hair looks smooth and soft.  I was skeptical about the whole ionizing thing, but it has made a big difference with my hair.  The removable&lt;BR&gt;filter was the deciding factor.  I&#x27;ve thrown away dryers just because I couldn&#x27;t clean them. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> .&lt;BR&gt;Powerful. Multi-speed, multi-temperature. Ionizer. What else could you wish? Great!!</li>
            <li> I never knew how different a blow-dryer could be until a friend of mine came over with this dryer and I could not believe how good my hair felt afterwards.  I ended up buying the thing that night and threw that other conair one out.  (bought an extra travel one that week too)</li>
            <li> I have a similar Revlon Ion 1875-Watt hair dryer with a variable ion control.  My hair is very fine, breaks easily, and gets a little frizzy when I try to blow dry it.  It is slightly wavy, and gets dry no matter what conditioner I use.  I have better &#x27;second day&#x27; hair - drying it just kills it.  This hair dryer has changed all that - the very first time I used it - my hair dried shiny - with no frizz at all.  I have great &#x27;first day&#x27; hair, &#x27;second day&#x27; hair, even &#x27;third day&#x27; hair.  I did not change one single thing - except my hair dryer.  I have it set on the &#x27;lowest&#x27; ion setting - meant for thin hair - and it dries quickly and evenly.  I would never use another hair dryer.</li>
            <li> A few months after purchasing, the HIGH setting became LOW and the dryer began shooting sparks out of it. This dryer is a fire hazard and does not function properly. Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li> The fact that this hair dryer broke after 2 months of moderate and careful use is bad enough, but what is worse is the way it broke: IT EXPLODED in my hand just seconds after I had switched it on. I am not kidding, I still have a huge scare. It made a big bang, immediately started to smoke and damaged the electrical circuit. There was no outside trigger for this explosion at all. When shaking, the hair dryer now sounds like a box full of beans, everything is loose. I cannot tell you how mad I am that I was exposed to such a big risk! I feel lucky that nothing happened to me, apart from a life-long fear of hair driers!</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer I&#x27;ve had yet! The diffusser stays attached securely and it&#x27;s not that loud. I love that it has different controls for the temperature and speed.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer thinking it did not have the ceramic function because none of the literature said anything about it, yet when the dryer arrived, the word CERAMIC was all over it.  I was hoping to get the old dryer without the ceramic feature.</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports rated this hair dryer highly.  I am very pleased with it.  Amazon had a very good price.  I am totally pleased with this transaction.  When I can, I buy from Amazon.  T R Cook III</li>
            <li> Can you actually love an appliance? B/c this dryer is great! I have long thick wavy hair and with my old dryer it took 30 minutes to dry, with this dryer only 15 minutes!!! Its so light weight my arm doesn&#x27;t hurt. My hair is softer after one use. I used to hate drying my hair, now I look forward to it. If you are looking for a dryer just buy this one, its absolutely great!It delivers everything it promises. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer for about (a little money). one week before I purchased my professional Solano Super X (\\&quot;SSX\\&quot;) for (for more money). and after using this one for about one week, then using the \\&quot;SSX\\&quot; for another, I went back to this one and noticed the difference in my hair immediately.  My hair much is smoother, shinier and the (split) ends lay flat with the Revlon ION. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s parched compared to when I use the \\&quot;SSX\\&quot;.  Yes, it&#x27;s not an expensive professional dryer so it may not last as long as the \\&quot;SSX\\&quot; (I won&#x27;t know because I won&#x27;t be using the \\&quot;SSX\\&quot; any longer) but it makes my hair look 100% better after it&#x27;s dried than the professional dryer does and it&#x27;s a much quicker, healthier dry time.  I receive compliments on my hair when I have used the Revlon ION dryer, and needless to say, no compliments on my hair when I have used the \\&quot;SSX\\&quot;.  Buy one, make sure to leave the ION setting \\&quot;ON\\&quot; (not sure why you would NOT want to), you won&#x27;t not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for a while and the biggest issue I have with it is that regardless of the heat setting, it dries out my hair. Badly.  Also, the attachments have a tendency to fall off which is a problem when you&#x27;re mid-drying and it&#x27;s too hot to put back on. I&#x27;m finally getting around to replacing it so that my hair stops getting damaged!</li>
            <li> My 10 year old Revlon drier still works, but has seen better days. I checked them all out and decided to stick with Revlon because I love my old travel blowdryer. I was not disappointed. I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month now and I love it. I have long, very thick, and sometimes unruly hair. I live in South Florida, and this dryer works super fast and makes my hair look silky smooth. Thanks Revlon!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a lot quieter than any other dryer that I&#x27;ve owned. I was also presently suprised that it was so light compared to my travel hairdryer!! I also think it is great that it comes with the concentrator attachment to help get your hair extra straight. My only complaint is that this attachment is hard to attach and remove. I have long hair and it used to take me over 15 minutes to dry my hair. With this drier, I am done in half the time or less!</li>
            <li> I have had 2 of these.  After about a year, first one burned a hole in the cord where the cord and handle meet.  I made the mistake of replacing it with the same model hair dryer.  This hair dryer only lasted 6 months and the electric cord started becoming detached from the hair dryer on the inside, causing interruptions in air flow while drying my hair. After 2 with bascially the same problem, I chose to replace the second one with a Conair.  Hope to have better luck with a different brand....</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly this dryer dried my shoulder length hair in under 5 minutes! This is an excellent dryer, it has various speeds and temperatures.  The cool shot button is great for taming those frizzy bits.  The hair dryer is a little heavier than most but I personaly like this.  I would not hesitate to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Bought this because a friend had it and we loved it, so it was a perfect find here on Amazon.com. Sad to say, just seven months after purchasing, we almost had a fire using this thing! The electrical cord became loose from the base of the unit, exposing raw wiring, and sparking with a flame one day while my 11-year-old child was using it! It was totally terrifying, and we were very lucky she did not get burned. This unit was not used daily, nor was it tugged on or abused in anyway. Will never trust this brand again.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! As other reviewers have stated the area of cord where it comes out of the handle wears out and short circuits causing pops, sparks and fire! This happened after 1 year of use almost to the day. I live alone and use it once/day mostly on high heat. The problem is obviously a cheap cord that when bent back and forth enough times will wear the wire enough to short out. This is not a fluke but  bad design components. When I compare the cord to other dryers I clearly see the difference in cord. This cord has more of a softer  rubber feel and a dull dark color, where proper cords have a shiny finish and more of a hard vinyl feel. Believe me this will happen to all of these units eventually if you use the high heat settings daily. I would definitely not buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would look for another brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer based on reviews. I have had it about 2 months now and every time I use it the handle gets so hot that I actually get 1st degree burns on my palm. I am trashing this and getting a new non revlon dryer. Stay away!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I do not do reviews, except when I believe they are needed. In this case, it is needed! I used this dryer for about the past 1-2 years. Not that much trouble out of it. It did overheat. I would let it cool off and begin using it again. Then last week, I was using it and sparks came out of the thing!!! Yes, sparks! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I believe that this thing should be recalled, so I contacted Revlon. Revlon wanted no part of it. They told me to contact Helen of Troy. I did that. Now, I am waiting for a reply. I have also contacted the consumer safety commission. I am basically begging for a recall. Please do not buy this hair dryer. After contacting Revlon, I will not buy anything Revlon. (I am David&#x27;s wife. The Amazon account is in his name.)</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this dryer for two very MAJOR reasons.     Number 1: The \\&quot;ion\\&quot; switch is nothing more than a gimmick and anyone who reports miraculous transformation of their frizzies is most likely experiencing a placebo effect. I have slightly wavy, long, thick hair and this did nothing to either better or worsen my frizziness. To combat frizzies use a leave-in conditioner or gel, period. The dryer is adequate and dries your hair. At least mine did for about a year until...    Number 2: SPARKS FLEW OUT OF THIS DRYER. BIG ONES! While in use! The sparks were accompanied by a smoky, burning smell. I dropped the thing and unplugged it and haven&#x27;t used it since. This is a safety hazard and judging from other reviews my experience is not unique.     LOOK ELSEWHERE!</li>
            <li> I decided to try an inexpensive hair dryer for the first time since money was tight, and now I really regret it.  I have very thick long hair and it took the hair dryer much longer to dry my hair than my old one.  After a couple uses I noticed the smell of burning hair and thought maybe it was a little too hot but my hair seemed fine so I didn&#x27;t really worry about it.  Then I began to notice after I showered and started to comb my wet hair a lot more hair than normal was falling out.  It was falling out in thick strands which has never happened to me before.  I thought maybe it was stress or horomones since I recently had a baby but the more I used the dryer I realized the intense heat was burning off and damaging my hair!  Even now that I&#x27;ve stopped using it my hair is still fragile from the dryer and still comes out in clumps after I shower.  Please stay away from this dryer!  I&#x27;m glad mine never shot sparks like the other reviews I saw but it doesn&#x27;t surprise me.</li>
            <li> We bought it not long ago, about a month. My wife like it! it has all the features that are needed (hot/cold air, different temperature of hot, ionization that you can turn on/off, different speed) the sound is ok I guess. hope it will work for a long time.</li>
            <li> Reviews and consumer reports rated this as a best buy hair dryer. It was inexpensice and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Did not last nearly as long as it should of, poorly made</li>
            <li> I rarely ever write customer reviews, but this one seemed to warrant it. Here goes:    If you want a hair dryer that BURNS OFF YOUR HAIR AND CAN POTENTIALLY MAKE YOU BALD, this hair dryer is for you! For a waste of $18-$21 American, YOU TOO CAN BE A 21 YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH SYMPTOMS OF FEMALE PATTERN BALDNESS!!!! WOW!    This little hottie also turns healthy, beautiful hair into crispy, damaged sh&amp;*--EVEN WHEN YOU HOLD THE DAMNED THING 6 INCHES AWAY FROM YOUR HEAD!    But wait, there&#x27;s more!    Wait just a few years until this baby shoots out sparks from both ends of the body AT 6 A.M. one fine Monday morning (like it did for me this morning), and RISK BOTH BURNING OFF MASSIVE CHUNKS OF YOUR HAIR *AND* SEVERELY BURNING YOUR RIGHT HAND/CAUSING A FACIAL DEFORMITY VIA AN ELECTICAL SPARK! YES!    The lesson of the day is: DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER/PIECE OF SH&amp;^ OR ANY HELEN OF TROY PRODUCT IF YOU WOULD PREFER TO KEEP A NORMAL-LOOKING HAIR/VISAGE/SELF. THEIR PRODUCTS ARE D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S C-R-A-P.</li>
            <li> I read these reviews and thought I had found a miracle product.  I have medium-thick hair, but it is long, and there is a lot of it.  My hair is usually somewhat frizzy after blow-drying.  I have used the Ion Stylist for over a week now, and have not noticed a difference in drying time.  I have noticed a slight difference in the texture of my hair after drying, but I think that is due to the cool function on the dryer (better than most - cool air is expended almost immediately), rather than the ion feature.  The real test, however, will be this summer in the NYC (subways!) humidity.</li>
            <li> Until recently, I had never done any research before buying any household small appliances. When my Conair dryer finally died last week, I decided to shop around before making a purchase for its replacement. After reading other reviews about this dryer, I went straight to Target and bought it and I have been very pleased! I live in an area that has high summertime humidity and my hair is fine and tends to frizz a bit on the ends. The ion feature really does seem to work and since I&#x27;ve used this dryer, I do not even need to put styling creme on the ends of my hair to keep them in place and de-frizzed. I also love that the dryer has 3 heat settings (my old Conair only had &#x27;high&#x27; or &#x27;low&#x27; and I&#x27;ve found that the mid setting on this dryer is just perfect for me- not too hot or too cold. Great product!</li>
            <li> I received my hair dryer and found it to be the same as other dryers I have owned in the past.  It has the high and low and warm and hot buttons which are nice.  This dryer also came with a round hair brush.  I have no idea what \\&quot;ion\\&quot; is.  I read the reviews before I purchased it and it seemed others weren&#x27;t sure what it did for them either.  My hair is curly and frizzy and after using this hair dryer, it was softer and not frizzy.  However, it think it has more to do with the hair brush you are using and not so much the dryer.&lt;BR&gt;I have seen (and purchased) similar hair dryers for almost double the price.  This is a good dryer and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful takes forever to dry my hair and minimal frizz control.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first... I thought it was GOOD that it got so hot that my hair held its shape better.  Gradually I started noticing more and more breakage from the heat damage.  OK, don&#x27;t use it on the highest setting, lesson learned.  After about a month of not quite daily use, the thing started shooting out SPARKS.  I&#x27;m not about to aim something that does that at my head.  So... it never died, but it did become possessed, so some element of the afterlife is definitely evident.  This thing is a hair-singeing, spark-shooting weapon, folks.  If you buy it, use it for something other than what it was designed for or you&#x27;ll be bald and blind!!!</li>
            <li> Got it as a present and it has been the best hair dryer for her ever. it&#x27;s so good she bought her best friend one!</li>
            <li> its too hot on the hot setting and too cold on the warm. try not keeping it too long on your hair when its on the hot setting. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;good luck</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer for almost 5 years and it has never given me any trouble.  I use it on the medium or low heat settings, and the low speed because I have curly hair.  I also use a salon diffuser which fits perfectly (hard to do on alot of dryers).  I keep thinking the heat switch is going to give out on me because I change it back and forth so often during drying - so I&#x27;m buying another as a backup.  But so far, so good!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this blow dryer. She loves the color, the ionic of the blower, and the attachments especially the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;The price was great and it was shipped in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> Switches are hard to push up and down , hard to operate with one hand. Switches get stuck and need both hands to operate. Not user friendly.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, very curly long hair that normally would take about 40+ minutes to blow dry straight.  This dryer cuts the time in half or more, depending on how finicky I want to be about the look. My hair looks wonderful, shiny, smooth and feels soft. Love the attachments, helps with styling versitility. The dryer itself is fairly lightweight with a comfortable grip and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly makes blow drying my hair less of an event.</li>
            <li> i was so pleased with this dryer, it gave my hair a thicker look. The volumizer works really good, makes my hair even thicker, wish it came with a comb tho, but its good, and i love it...</li>
            <li> Good when working.  Cord broke at handle in a few months</li>
            <li> One of the best hairdryers.  Works great,  I have thick wavy/curly hair.  Light to hold</li>
            <li> Why is it that Amazon continues to sell this obviously dangerous product when clearly 1/3 of all reviews relate to the electrical hazard? I wrote a similar review years ago addressing the popping and sparking problem, the frayed hot cord at the point the cord attaches to the handle, and other issues I was having with this. People are talking about fire and burned hair, for God&#x27;s sake, and Amazon doesn&#x27;t think they have a responsibility to retract this item from their inventory! Liability, Amazon????</li>
            <li> better price than walmart. can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> My wife asked for a small, powerful hair dryer for Christmas.  I checked out reviews everywhere, and despite some noise complaints (none here) no matter how I approached it, I kept coming up with this one, so I bought it.  The ion process seems to make her very long, thick hair less frizzy than conventional dryers, but neither the venturi nor the finger attachment did much to quicken the drying process.  Five stars if not for the size (and therefore the unwieldyness) of the unit.</li>
            <li> We have this hair dryer less than 2 years and yesterday evening it began to do blue sparks for no reason. The cord has never been kinked or stored incorrectly. I used the hairdryer once a week (if even) to dry my kids hair so it&#x27;s not from over use. This is a serious fire hazard and could have set our kids hair on fire had I not plugged it out and stopped using it. The hairdryer has never been dropped and I keep it stored in my own cupboard so that the kids could never accidentally find it and play with it without me knowing. I check out other reviews on this product on the web yesterday and it seems that I&#x27;m not the first for this happen to with Revlon products. So beware. I would rate the product zero but need to give it one to submit this rating.</li>
            <li> I thought I had a fairly decent blowdryer...until it died.  Now I&#x27;m glad the thing is gone.  My hair is thick and has always taken a long time to dry.  Thank you Revlon for cutting my drying time in half.  My hair has a smoother texture and is much softer with this blowdryer.  Since I started using it people have been commenting on how nice my hair looks.  I was skeptical after reading the online reviews but after reading about the other blowdryers I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love this thing and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! I used it this morning for the first time and found that it really did make my hair feel much softer than with my other, cheaper quality, hair dryer.  After reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I didn&#x27;t know for sure whether I should buy it or not, but I convinced myself to because there will always be someone who&#x27;s not happy with a particular product. But I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer. It is lighter than my last dryer, and very easy to manage. I like the setting options: cool, warm, or hot; and low or high. I use the warm &amp; high settings. I think it dries my hair a little bit faster than my last dryer, and my hair feels Great! No frizz, not fried, just smooth and shiny. My hair is fine, not thick or coarse, so maybe that makes a difference in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Update July 2017 - Still using this dryer!</li>
            <li> I use to love this hair dryer, I even bought it twice...but both times it just nearly killed me...the first time I thought it was a freak accident..but after the second time of a flame shooting out and a loud pop and then sparks everywhere I figuring it time to switch brands..maybe someone from revlon will read this and offer a refund or a least a recall..if this had happened while i was drying my 2 year olds hair he would of freaked out and probably never let me near him to dry his hair..or worse he could of been really hurt!</li>
            <li> A decent dryer for the price. Great for anything you woud throw at it with at-home use, but definitely not Pro/Salon quality.</li>
            <li> My mom had two of these hairdryers, Both of them have shot sparks out the end when I used them</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer about 6 months ago, and today when I was using it it started shooting out sparks. I looked it up on google and this has happened to a lot of people. It&#x27;s even started shooting out flames and caused house fires when it&#x27;s just PLUGGED IN and not even turned on. Just don&#x27;t buy it, its dangerous.</li>
            <li> Personally love the product compares to the old dryer that I have. Also,good for the price - great for short hair. curl too</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I got a dud one or not but my experience goes like this.  For the first two months of owning this hair dryer, it did a fine job.  Nothing out of the ordinary--dried my hair just fine.  The last time I used it, I noticed the general smell of burning hair when I was done.  The dryer did not feel overly hot so I wasn&#x27;t sure what happend.  The next thing I noticed was the floor of my bathroom.  There was alot more hair on the floor than usual.  Upon closer inspection, I felt sick to my stomach.  I noticed that there were actual clumps of hair that had fallen out---including the root.  They smelled like burning hair.  There were sections that had 10 hairs clumped together by the burned root.  I was scared.  Needless to say, I am running out today to buy a new hairdryer.  Because of the burning smell, I know the hairdryer is to blame rather than a medical condition or something else environmental.  Do yourself a favor and purchase a different hair dryer.</li>
            <li> On the first use (following their instruction booklet exactly), this dryer burned off whole sections of my hair.  After complaining to Revlon, I was instructed to contact the manufacturer, Helen of Troy.  Frankly, if you&#x27;re going to put your name on something my feeling is that you should stand by the product yourself and not send consumers on a wild goose chase to track down the responsible party!    Instead I contacted the US Consumer Product Safety Commission via email and I received a phonecall from them.  They sent an agent out to my home, purchased this dangerous dryer for cash, took pictures of all the burnt hair (yes, I saved all evidence) and I expect as there are many complaints about this product they will soon recall it.      Don&#x27;t buy this dryer or any other Revlon hair products.  They are faulty and Revlon does not care about customer service, either.</li>
            <li> This dryer ruined my hair!!! At first, after I bought it, I really liked how quickly it dried my hair. After using it every day for about 8 days, I noticed a strange smell, but didn&#x27;t know what it was. (It didn&#x27;t smell like burning hair, more like home perm solution.) I switched from high heat (which had been fine with my Conair) to the medium setting, and the smell went away, but the damage continued. I have medium length fine straight hair, and the ends became dry and frizzy and began to break off. After a month, my hair has turned to brittle straw, won&#x27;t curl, and is breaking all over.  Also, I color my hair with semi-permanent coloring, and the now frizzy ends absorb more of the coloring, giving a strange look. I realize now that this dryer was working so quickly because it was WAY too hot, even on the medium setting. Not sure if the ions were a factor, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. After reading the other reviews here, I feel lucky not to have experienced sparks or flames. I&#x27;m getting a short cut and a new dryer and waiting for my hair to grow out. I&#x27;m extremely upset, and definitely will not purchase another Revlon product.</li>
            <li> The warm setting is a perfect temperature for me, not to sound silly but, not to hot, and not to cold.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, fine, frizzy hair that I like to blow dry straight.  I ordered this dryer because the promise of smoother, shinier, softer hair sounded great.  I really couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in the texture of my hair with this dryer.  If anything, it was harder to straighten my hair with it than with my old non-ionic dryer.  It definitely took longer to dry my hair with this dryer.  This dryer didn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as my old dryer of the same wattage.  I think the ionic button is just a gimmick.  I sent this dryer back and will continue to use my old one until it dies completely.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer hoping for a miracle.  I have frizzy, half-curly ultra-thick hair, and I had really hoped that this dryer was going to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;An hour after drying my hair with it, my hair was back to its frizzy self, and I really didn&#x27;t notice a quicker drying time.  The ions that are supposed to make my hair shiny and dry quicker were pretty unapparent.  &lt;br /&gt;The dryer is a bit quieter than your average one, but I actually feel that my ... conair, although louder, is a bit stronger in force than this dryer.  &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d say skip the ion fad and go for your typical dryer.  You&#x27;re paying ... more for a gimmick.</li>
            <li> I always look for a hair dryer that has separate heat and air flow settings, and a removable filter.  This has those features.  I had been curious about the ionic feature and when my conair died, I decided I&#x27;d purchase one with an ionic feature -afterall, it was only about 5 bucks more?  I was skeptical enough to keep all the packaging in order to return it if it didn&#x27;t work.  Afterall, who needs a dryer that doesn&#x27;t work?  I didn&#x27;t have to return this one.  &lt;BR&gt;Have you ever left your hair in a towel until it was completely dry?  That is how your hair will feel when you use this dryer, only it will take a much shorter amount of time.  And be styled the way you want it to be!&lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;ve found that this dryer does dry faster, and leaves my hair softer and shinier and fuller than my old conair.&lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;ve got long thin hair, so thin that it NEVER keeps a curl, or the body and fullness that is there when you first dry it.  This dryer allows my hair to keep body and fullness throughout the day.  &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about other ionic dryers, but this one has a switch to turn off the ionic feature if you&#x27;d like - although I can&#x27;t imagine why.&lt;BR&gt;I would highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer is nice, it gets hot and does the job. However it&#x27;s much louder than I imagined, far from quiet. It&#x27;s much bulkier and heavier than I would have prefered.</li>
            <li> I just bought this and opened it up.  I thought it would be good as I have fine long hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used it for about 10 minutes and something popped and it sounded different - I looked inside and it was red hot and started smoking.  It may have spit out sparks as I felt something hit my head.  I thought, this thing is going to light my head on fire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is brand new and it won&#x27;t work.   &lt;br /&gt;Everytime I turn it on it starts to heat up and smokes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have a wonderful Revlon hair dryer that works great, so I thought it would be good.  The one I have isn&#x27;t ionic and wanted to try it, guess I&#x27;ll go back to the old one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> this hair dryer was a good for about a year, until today when sparks started fyling and smoke came pouring out the back. based on another review that said she had the same problem, i would not buy this dryer again.</li>
            <li> I use this hair dryer to shrink the heat-shrink tubing around wiring in my computer repair business.  It gets the job done perfectly, every time.</li>
            <li> Okay, maybe not exactly explode, but very close.  After my 20+ year old Conair blow dryer was literally falling apart (but still working!), I decided it was time to treat myself to a new blow dryer a couple of weeks ago.  I have very thick, long, wavy hair that I usually let dry naturally after drying my bangs (maybe 5 minutes).  Yesterday I thought it would be nice to dry the whole mess and use the iron on it- something I may do once a month because of the time and effort it takes.   I kick it up to the high setting and become aware of a \\&quot;hot\\&quot; smell after a couple of minutes, but think that since I don&#x27;t use this setting very often, it&#x27;s just using coils it doesn&#x27;t usually use- wrong!  Soon it pops, hisses, and glows a nice yellow-red color before shutting off.  I then realize that even the grip is hot and that the snake of smoke coming out of the end of the blow dryer is a death knell for my brand new device!  I hope that maybe it&#x27;ll work again after cooling off, much to my husband&#x27;s amusement who said that smell only comes with electronic death, but no, it&#x27;s forever dead.</li>
            <li> I was limited in choice in buying a new hairdryer after mine died, since I was at a grocery store and needed one immediately.  I bought this dryer and I believe it was around $23.  Last night I went to use it and I was pleased with the weight of it, it was a lot lighter than my old one.  I have very thick, long, healthy, naturally curly hair and drying/straightening can take a while so weight matters.      After reading the instructions that came with the dryer, I began with the heat on the highest setting as instructed and drying my hair with a round metal vented brush as normal.  I started out with the air concentrator on the dryer but decided after a minute or two that I didn&#x27;t want it on there so I went to take it off.  It was very hot so I had to hold it with a towel to remove it.  I began drying my hair again and within two minutes I noticed a horrible smell.  I looked at my brush and the dryer and my sink and saw that the dryer had burned off whole sections of my hair!  It was everywhere and when I called my husband in to see what had happened he was in shock!  Charred hair was all over the place, both long sections burned off near the root and smaller curled burnt pieces from the ends, and the stench was overpowering.    I finished drying my hair on the low heat setting and it actually came out fine but now I am too scared of this dryer to ever use it again.  I will be writing a complaint to Revlon and returning the item to the store.  There is no way I am going to pay to ship it back to them AND enclose money for a replacement after it melted off chunks of my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t want another one of these even if it was free!  I would not recommend this dryer to anyone and if you already have it I would never use the high heat setting, even if that is what you normally use.  My hair is not fine or thin and no dryer I have ever had has burned my hair before.  This dryer is DANGEROUS!!!</li>
            <li> As stated in some of the other reviews.  I too had a HUGE problem with this hair dryer.  Although it worked well before it shorted out.   My dryer also had sparks flying and a shortage in the wiring at the connection where the dryer meets the cord.  It over heated, melted and sparks were coming out of it.  Luckily my children were not using this when it happened.  Please do not buy!!</li>
            <li> This is a LOUD hair dryer.  Much louder than any others I have used.  The cord is very short, which makes it difficult to move around.  It also has trouble with heat control, the temp varies often without changing a switch.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this ceramic hair dryer. Excellent workmanship.  Indeed, very high quality, and quite handsome.  RECOMMENDED.  DAME HILDA</li>
            <li> It works great,  but can the cable caught fire at the right by where the cable meets the dryer.  I would not recommend to use this.  And the other thing, the dryer was sparking as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> Personally like the dryer, but the power cord at the top can get bent and short out the dryer if it is used for many hours.  Love the attachments it comes with.</li>
            <li> My hair dryer just blew up. I have owned many hair dryers but not one has ever had an internal explosion. It was aimed at the back of my head at the time so I&#x27;m not sure if there were sparks but there are large parts rattling around inside now. Can&#x27;t wait to open it and see the damage. I used it maybe twice a week and it was less than a year old. Never again with a Revlon dryer.</li>
            <li> Had the blow dryer for several months now... no problem does not over heat.... best investment</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted an drier with a air disperser on it. This was exactly what they she wanted. The drier works exactly as stated. The only issue is it&#x27;s bulking too bad you can&#x27;t fold it.</li>
            <li> I have had this model for somewhere around 8-10 years and it has worked great.  Around 6 years ago I decided to purchase an expensive Chi dryer for $150 only because I thought it must be better since it was so much more expensive - wrong! I used that for about a year and the heating element quit so only cool air came out making it useless.  It was just past the warranty period so I was out of luck. I pulled my Revlon back out and have used it ever since.  Seeing it recommended as one of the best by Consumer Reports just confirmed what I already thought.  After all these years it finally quit this morning.  I&#x27;m going to purchase another one exactly the same as my old Revlon model.</li>
            <li> I love the adjustable heat, I love the attachments and works and lasts for years! it was everything i could want in a hairdryer</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one.  The first lasted 5 years+.  Quality product, low price, think the ion thing is a gimmick.</li>
            <li> Excellent power, variety of settings, great price! Difuser is perfect for curly hair. If you need a hair dryer, choose this one.</li>
            <li> Dryer works great but be careful with cord. Last one the cord worked free from dryer and it was shooting sparks out of cord.</li>
            <li> I just moved to Miami and needed a hair dryer that would straighten my medium length wavy hair FAST without ending up a frizzy mess. I was skeptical to order this one because of the price but was pleasantly surprised at how fast it dried my hair and left it straight with a little volume just how I like it. My hair is soft, shiny and bouncy when I use it. It has a switch to turn off the ionic feature.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this hair dryer, especially for the price. Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these, one for myself that I&#x27;ve used about a year now, and a second one for my mom because I loved mine that much. Both work great. I use the diffuser attachment about daily and it&#x27;s probably the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the reviews that I read. I had doubts of how a blow dryer can give you shine and reduce freeze, and what was this ion thing. Well, for someone who has two left hands for blow drying her hair this blow dryer is a God&#x27;s sent. I blew dry my hair with this brow dryer and with the next time I had to wash my hair I dried it with my old blow dryer. For someone who lives in Miami, Florida and where humidity is 1000%, this blow dryer works amazing.      The blow dryer deliveries what it promises. My hair was shinier and freeze control. Bottom line, I highly recommend it. It is definitely money well spent.</li>
            <li> I gave this dryer a 5 because I am very satisfied with the speed that it dries and how soft and smooth my hair is right afterwards.  This is probably not the only dryer that will give these kinds of results and it&#x27;s probably not the best.  But if you have thick long hair like mine(reaches my waist)this is a handy tool.  It is a little heavy but it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem if you only need to hold it for 5-10 minutes.  The real reason why I chose this ionic dryer is because I love Revlon&#x27;s button configuration. The top button lets me adjust the temperature from cool, warm to hot.  And the bottom button adjusts the air flow from low, med to high. It lets me control and style my hair how I want to. I get so frustrated when the temperature corresponds to the air flow setting because it won&#x27;t let me use hot on low or cool on med...catch my drift?  Anyway, nice dryer:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews and have to admit I really don&#x27;t understand the Ion thing but whatever it is, it sure seems to be working.  My old dryer conked out so I decided to purchase this one.  With my hair looking quite damaged recently I wanted a dryer that wouldn&#x27;t make it worse. I changed shampoo at the same time so I&#x27;m not sure which did it, but my hair looks so much healthier.  I have fine, straight hair and lots of it and I&#x27;m still finished drying in 5-6 minutes.  Much faster than before without the static and damage.  Love the setting controls; I use the warm, high setting and it leaves my hair really soft and healthy looking with no frizz. That alone is worth the modest investment in this product. I haven&#x27;t used the attachments and don&#x27;t think I will need to - a nice bonus but not something I require. I saw reports of \\&quot;sparks\\&quot; and singed hair and will be on the lookout for those things, but so far I&#x27;m extremely pleased and may order a second one for my daughter.  Kudos Revlon!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that this has been used as a spare dryer for the past year, but it is still used twice a month at least. It saw heavy use with waist length hair the three years prior. Even though it now costs almost half of what I paid for it, I still think it is a decent value. My Rusk 1900 watt ceramic dryer blows this dryer away, but it isn&#x27;t fair to compare an $80 dryer to something that now costs $15. The amount of heat is pretty good and it gets my hair dry in an acceptable amount of time. The cold air button is really more of a \\&quot;less hot air\\&quot; than actual cold air, but I really don&#x27;t have a use for cold air, anyway. After all these years, the cord is starting to bend oddly right at the plug, so I don&#x27;t think it has a lot of life in it left unless I find a way to replace the cord. But I still think I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you get what you pay for. This is one of those cases. There&#x27;s no lint on the back that would cause it to overheat or anything. One day it just started switching to a warm/cool setting even though it was set to hot. As time went on, it just doesn&#x27;t even get hot anymore at all, warm at best. I had this less than 1 year and always kept the back cleared of lint so this is just a junk product. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does come with attachments that similarly priced dryers don&#x27;t usually come with, and there&#x27;s a removable cover thing on the lint trap in the back that makes it way easier to clean, you can remove it and wash it off in the sink in 2 seconds. But it doesn&#x27;t work long so don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> I like the style of this product; however, one of the buttons already broke while switching heat modes.  Darn it.</li>
            <li> I have had this model dryer for 8 years.  I like that is has 3 heat settings so is more versatile than some dryers.  When I needed a new dryer to put in a guest bath, it was my first choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer after seeing a recommendation in a fashion magazine.  It doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  It dried my very long hair in just a few minutes (compared with five for my older dryer) and the diffuser gives great volume and lift.  Highly recommend.  Buy this model instead of the more expensive salon models, and spend the extra $$ on more shampoo.</li>
            <li> On the 5TH DAY of use EVER, this drier burned off a WHOLE SECTION of my hair! I smelled burning and turned off the drier, ran my hand over my hair and the whole section fell to the floor!  The hairs were scorched and melted together.  My hairdresser always comments on the great health of my long hair, I&#x27;ve never processed it, I never even get split ends, so that&#x27;s not even an issue here.  I bought this drier because my last Revlon drier was great.  Never again! I&#x27;ve complained to Revlon, still waiting to hear from them.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000FS05VG Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black]] Execelent, but a little too heavy. Good price.</li>
            <li> Interesting to see others say theirs caught fire as mine did too, while it was in my hand!! It started smoking and the handle turned red &amp; hot. Recall this bad boy!!</li>
            <li> I have read all these reviews about the Revlon RV484 today which is 2/3/2014 and even on this date the Revlon hair dryer that I purchased last summer did the same thing...the cord split where it meets the dryer and a large set of sparks and horrid smell of burning electric permeated my house. What the heck!!!!! People have complained about this product since back in 2007 and it still remains on the market?????? I will contact Revlon and hopefully this dryer will be pulled off the market before some young adult gets seriously hurt or burnt. Very poor design...shame on Revlon!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! Very fast!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Great price, great size. It was a gift and she loved it so much. 100% recomended. The only thing was that the box was too big for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now and I like all its features and attachments. It may sound silly, but I bought it for the bowl attachment. But what sold me on this model was the Ion option. Especially when my cousin dries my hair for me my hair comes out so smooth and soft with little product. I use the bowl attachment when I want a natural wave and it does a much easier job then doing it by hand.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this new hair dryer after owning the same one for over a decade.  It lasted much longer than I expected, especially given that I used it nearly every single day for over 10 years.  Biggest upside is that it dried my hair well and reliably for a very long time, and was an excellent value.  Biggest downside of this product is that after a long time (years), the filter on the back broke and wouldn&#x27;t stay on the dryer.  I suspect that this ultimately contributed to its demise when the motor burned out suddenly the other day.  It was momentarily alarming--brief puff of smoke and flicker of flame before it burned itself out.  But no harm done, so I purchased a replacement of the exact same drier the very same day.</li>
            <li> The best blow dryer ever. 23 Afro American female I use with a long hard comb attachment and this makes blow drying so much easier because I have long thick hair and I hate doing it myself but this definitely helps out when I&#x27;m tryna save money but skipping the salon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dryer for less than 4 months and it&#x27;s already acting up.  I keep it clean and store it in a holder (so it doesn&#x27;t drop to the floor) and it&#x27;s still acting up.  The power level drops.  The heat comes and goes.  The manufacturer wants me to ship it back to them....and then they&#x27;ll send me a new one in 10 days.  How am I supposed to live without a hairdryer for that long?!?!?!  I don&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> What I like about this hair dryer is that it doesn&#x27;t fry your hair. I have somewhat thin,fragile hair;and many of the products I&#x27;ve tried have done some serious damage. Many of the other stylers/dryers are WAY too hot. This one has multiple settings,so you can choose how hot you need it to be.</li>
            <li> The diffuser made my curly hair really frizzy and messy.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this daily use dryer.  The first one lasted about 10 years.  I was so thrilled to find that it was still on the market. This one is so great because it has lots of power AND the blower settings(low and high) are separate from the heat settings(cool, warm, and hot).I use the hotel provided dryers when I travel and am always so happy to get home to the best blow dryer ever.</li>
            <li> At this point, most hair dryers are fairly equal in their ability to dry hair.  So, I was looking for a model that would be quiet and hopefully not expose my ears to as much damage as the regular hair dryer. This model highlighted being quiet as a feature.  Totally untrue. It was significantly noisier than my old Conair dryer which cost the same.  I will not trust Revlon again.  Buy it only if you want dry hair and limited hearing.</li>
            <li> feel disappoint with this hair dryer. It&#x27;s too loud and not strong enough to blow my hair. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I had this blow dryer a little over a year, and I was never very happy with it.  It seemed to make my hair frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;This morning, about three minutes after I began using it, there seemed to be a problem with the power getting to the dryer - it would stop and start.  Then the smoke started pouring out of the cord where it attached to the handle.  I quickly unplugged it before it completely caught on fire.  I have NEVER had this happen with a blow dryer.  Many other similar reports online when I looked it up.  I definitely do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love Revlon products so I knew this would be a great blow dryer for me. I love this and the attachment that came with it.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY DANGEROUS! I agree with the other reviewer.  I&#x27;ve had three of these. THREE! The first one I&#x27;d had for a few years before it began smoking at the cord. I thought it was defective. Since it was out of warranty, I just went out and bought another one. One year later it met the same fate.  It started smoking where the cord meets the dryer.  I turned it off.  When I went to unplug it, it shot sparks at the power outlet.  I have a habit of wrapping the cord around the unit to store it. I thought that maybe I was responsible for these failures, that my coiling the cable was damaging the wiring. As now I believed that this hazard was my fault, I bought a 3rd unit and this time I never coiled the cord. I even went as far as reinforcing the flexible shield where the cord meets the dryer in hopes that it would keep stress off the cable. One year later, It began shorting out and getting super hot at the connection. I&#x27;m done! This unit should be recalled!</li>
            <li> THE WORST HAIR DRYER EVER!!!!! I bough just 6 months ago and it started to have a weird noise and was not working well and the next time I tried to use it the cable exploded in FIRE, burned my hand and almost caused a fire!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because of the price. It dries my hair nicely. It claims to have ion technology but I think it is a gimmick. My hair dries frizzy with this hair dryer like it did with my previous one that was old and didn&#x27;t have ion technology.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this item. I bought it after my Vidal Sassoon stopped working and this is garbage! I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything until today because  this was SO BAD. The buttons popped off, the temperature goes from hot to cold to hot to cold every 30 seconds while on \\&quot;hot\\&quot; and sparks come out about every 45 seconds or so. I&#x27;m not lying. I have  to use this at my own risk because I don&#x27;t have a replacement, but I&#x27;m on my way to trying to find something that might not cause my hair to catch fire. Save yourself the trouble and go buy something else.</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s blow dryer (which was the older version), was broken and she needed a new one. She absolutely loves this one and says it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This dryer is not only quiet compared to the others, it dries hair in no time, great buy, glad I purchased it</li>
            <li> Ok - so I had this hair dryer for about 2 years?  Used it on and off.  It seems that they listened to their customers and installed something that cools it down in cycles AS it is drying your hair.. however - it&#x27;s not powerful at all.  My hair is flat and it takes forever to dry.  I tried everything.. I started to think it was my hair products - but once I went back to my old hair dryer, my hair was fine.  A true waste...Tonight my husband pointed out the plug (where the prong meets the black plastic) is melting.  Garbage!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using a blow dryer. I bought this one because it looked cheap, reasonable, and a friend recommended me to use Revlon. I tried it on my sister&#x27;s hair (being my first time ever using a blow dryer) and it worked pretty well. My sister&#x27;s hair was soft &amp; shiny. Overall I&#x27;m gonna give it 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for about a year and half, purchased it after my last dryer stopped working. Liked the different settings it offered and figured Revlon would have a quality hair dryer. Thought the ion &amp; ceremic features would be key for giving me, as we all hope for ...  healthy &amp; beautiful hair.  Well over a year ago I started noticing one side of my hair getting split ends, dry and thin.   I was attributing it to hairdressers thinning my thick hair with these special cutting shears or possibly that the highlighting of my hair had taken its toll after 6 years of coloring so it was drying it out.  Or possibly more gray hair coming in, plus hair can change as you age. I would point this out to hairdressers but no one seemed to have the right answer to fix the problem, I even had them stop thinning it with the shears to hopefully stop the split end look but it didn&#x27;t make a difference. I used to stick with one hairdresser for at least 3 to 5 years until I needed a change, yet now I was jumping to a new one after each color and cut because I was not happy with my hair. Well a month ago I took this hairdryer on a trip with us because the hotel hair dryers are weak and slow.  When we got back I could not find it, and thought it was left behind in the hotel, so I pulled out a 10 year old Conair 1600 watt hair dryer to use temporarily.  Well my hair was soft and healthy looking after just one use, it was amazing.  After a few weeks I discovered a bag that had not been unpacked and found this Revlon dryer. Decided to give it another try, well my hair was frizzy and dry after only one use! My 11 year old daughter says she hates the hair dryer and it leaves her hair frizzy too.  I can&#x27;t believe I never thought the culprit was this hairdryer.  I&#x27;ve used about 15 or more hair dryers in my life and never experienced such a problem.   Please DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.  I have curly hair which tends to be dry normally and with the old hair dryers my hair would end up frizzed at the ends.  This hair dryer does a quick, non scorching dry and leaves my hair looking soft.  Not sure if it&#x27;s my imagination but I do not seem to be loosing as much hair as I did when I used my old dryer.  My sister purchased this hair dryer first and I got to use it at her house and I was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have had.  The old one finally gave up after many years of use.  It is the right size for me and not too many features to confuse me but enough to do the job - and nicely.  I think I&#x27;ll purchase another one to keep in my RV.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a replacement for my previous one.  The last one lasted over 10 years.  These are quality made.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my Mrs.&lt;br /&gt;Decent dryer.&lt;br /&gt;All the features of her expiring one.&lt;br /&gt;Very good price.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent packing and shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Runs every day without a blip.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer does a great job doing what a hairdryer should do&lt;br /&gt;It gets the job done quickly&lt;br /&gt;my hair doesn&#x27;t get frizzy&lt;br /&gt;The heat controls are easy to access&lt;br /&gt;The heat settings are &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only downside - a bit bulky</li>
            <li> I have always trusted the revlon brand and the dryer stands up to the name! The price was great and the item arrived in a timely manner and exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li> Prefer this dryer for many years as it isn&#x27;t too small to handle but large enough to hold and direct in drying hair. For medium size it is lightweight. I don&#x27;t use the attachments for my shorter hair. Dryer lasts for many years.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and dried hair fast.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well and is light to handle.  Dry&#x27;s hair quickly, looks great and is not very loud.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product. It takes a long time to dry my hair and I&#x27;m never happy with the result. There are better dryers for the price, if that&#x27;s your deciding factor.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well and is fairly quiet. Came with a diffuser. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great dryer for such a wonderful price. Definitely recommend for purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this hair dryer six weeks ago.  Last week the high fan speed setting started acting like the low speed setting.  The fan was barely spinning on max.  So I opened it up and it looks like they used a questionable motor among other things.  Turning it on with the thing open and after 2-3 seconds the smell of fried components is immediately noticeable.  The electric motor is pretty exposed to dust and debris which is probably the reason that it started failing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the dryer I bought was just defective or something, but it was loud and put out very little air for as loud as it was. High speed was not a high speed. Air leaked where the cord attached, so back it went. Bought a Conair online and am very pleased with that.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, but great hair dryer. Very good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice Revlon hair dryer. Many fabulous features &amp; perfect for my use. Works great &amp; will do so on low speeds.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and daughter. They tell me that it works great. Very good product and price.</li>
            <li> Good!  Big and powerful!</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer and I liked the different attachments and settings. However, I had this hair dryer a few years ago and worked fine for quite a while. One day while drying my hair, it popped and started to smoke. I immediately unplugged it, looked it over and saw the cord was melted near the handle. It was throw away since it was FRIED. Without thinking, I went out and bought a second one since the first one lasted so long, and thought maybe the sparking incident was a fluke.  This morning, the same thing happened to me while using it. It sparked and and there was a pop - again I turned it off and unplugged it immediately. I looked it over, and the cord had MELTED away from where it attached to the handle. Dangerous. While the price is right, it is not worth the fire risk!!</li>
            <li> I love it. Lots of power and quiet</li>
            <li> So easy to just order on-line. Rather then run out to the store to purchase. I go through a lot of hair dryers. Drying my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this hair dryer for about 9 months now and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. My hair is as healthy as ever though I do use a heat protectant. Your hair is going to get damaged with any sort of heat if you don&#x27;t. I highly doubt some of the other women reviewing were using a heat protectant thus explaining their dry unhealthy hair.</li>
            <li> I have had this dryer for a couple years and it has been great EXCEPT the diffuser attachment has started to COMPLETELY melt. Just turning the dryer on long enough to dry my hair on high makes the plastic all gooey. Gross. Needless to say... time for me to get a new hair dryer. Good while it lasted and i&#x27;m glad my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire!!! :)</li>
            <li> I used this dryer for approximately two years and had no complaints until yesterday... Without any warning, it caught on fire as I was dryng my hair. Fortunatley, I reacted quickly and threw it down without it harming my hair, head or anything else. This product is extremely dangerous and should be recalled off of the market immediately.[[ASIN:B000NNBLSY Revlon Amber Waves 1,875-watt Ion Dryer]]</li>
            <li> easy to use, good quality. powerful wind</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for approximately 6 months and just noticed, as others have, that it is sparking.  It&#x27;s really too bad, because up until the time I thought I might be electrocuted, I liked how fast it dried my hair and the condition of my hair after drying.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, PACKAGED WELL AND SPEEDY SHIPMENT.  THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> This is great blow dryer.  Heat and speed setting are wonderful.  I have past shoulder length hair, set it on half heat, dries within 7 minutes and not frizzy!</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas present....</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> Just arrived, although its cheap, it is good value for money, lots of settings to choose from, dried my hair evenly, great buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer about a month ago. I really like it. It dries my hair quickly and without frizz. (I have the ion generator on and use the concentrator.) Also the cord is a good length-about 5 1/2  to 6 ft. long. (The cord on my last hair dryer was way too short.) I would recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The 1st time the hair dyer went up in flames at the part where the cord attaches to the hair dyer I thought it was a one time thing.  I bought a 2nd one and only months later the same thing happened.  I am sure the hair dyer is defective so buyers beware.</li>
            <li> I usually look up Consumer Reports on most of my purchases.  Over the years they have proven to be trustworthy and my purchases at their recommendation has saved me money and headaches.  The Revlon hairdryer has just been purchased but I like it already.  It is priced affordably but has many options and handles easily.  Not disappointed in the least.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this dryer, and I really like the way my hair looks. It does what it says, drys it in much shorter time, and a much healthier feel...my head isn&#x27;t on fire. It doesn&#x27;t seem like hair would dry as fast as it does...but it works!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely pleased with this hair dryer.       It did improve the texture of my hair. My hair is much shinier and healthier-looking than the results from my old dryer. The fly-away hairs are minimized, which is great news during a Wisconsin winter. It was not quite as heat-intensive as my previous hair dryer (also a Revlon product), which I&#x27;m guessing will also help the future health of my hair.       The buttons were a little stiff at first use, but I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll loosen up with more use.      This dryer was approximately the same weight as my previous dryer. It was slightly less noisy, but at a different pitch (it seemed a little higher pitched).       The only thing that prevents me from giving a five-star rating is that it seemed to take a little longer to dry my hair than with my previous dryer, which was the same wattage.       I chose this product over the Conair product because this had more options in the heat/air level settings.</li>
            <li> I just bought this dryer so I have yet to use it. I just wanted to thank all the ladies for their reviews.  It helped me choose this dryer. I have been using the Conair 1875 translucent blue dryer for two years.  I had to buy a new one each year why? good question, b/c it stops working. I used it last night, and went to use it this monring and ah ha, it doesn&#x27;t work! It didn&#x27;t fall noone else uses it it just stoped! I was going to but the Conair ion blowdryer but after reading all these reviews i said let me get away from conair, the dryer never did anything, and if you live in NY you know what the seasons are like here, I have long thick wavy hair that I dry straight, so I&#x27;m hoping this dryer really does work I&#x27;ll let you know, but again thanks to all the reviews they really helped in making my purchase.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer works great and dries quickly. Easy to handle. I do not use it on the highest setting because it seems too hot.</li>
            <li> I used this hair dryer for the first time yesterday and I absolutely fell in love with it.  I have very thick, wavy hair which, in the past, has always taken forever to dry with a regular hair dryer.  This one, however, dried my hair so quickly I could hardly believe it!  My hair was completely dry in about 5 minutes of use.  In the past, I have been aggravated by poorly placed on and off switches which would be right in the way of your hand when you were drying your hair and switch on and off when you didn&#x27;t want them to.  This dryer, although the buttons are located in about the same spots, I did not have any problems with the dryer turning off while I was using it, which is a very great thing!  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone considering it, and the price is definitely right!</li>
            <li> I had been using this hairdryer daily for about a year or so... until today.  As I was holding it above my head, drying my hair, I heard a pop.  A few sparks flew out the end and into my hair and the whole thing shut off.  As it turns out, the area where the cord attaches to the handle got so hot that it melted through the plastic coating, exposing about a half-inch of singed wires. A tad bit dangerous if you asked me!  Granted, I used this dryer on the highest heat setting everyday for a year, so I got a lot of use out of it, but every other hairdryer I&#x27;ve had in the past simply blows cold air when it stops working properly--this one could&#x27;ve caused me bodily harm.  I think I may look into buying a different brand this time around.</li>
            <li> Ion Electrostatic precipitators release small doses of ozone as a byproduct, ozone is toxic and can eat away at the tissue of your lungs.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight but feels cheaply made. Where the cord connects to the body of the dryer, air escapes when it is on. Get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I had this dryer for 2 months and the handle got too hot to hold after about one minute, then the handle starting melting because it was too hot and then, it smelled like something was burning.  I lost my receipt, so I called the company and they replaced it.  I am afraid that I am going to have the same problem.  This was a definite piece of garbage and I am sorry that I bought it.  I wish the company had refunded my money.  I bought a Conair in the interim and love that dryer.  Do not get this one.  It is horrible.</li>
            <li> Wish it had more attachments. Great value though!</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer I use it with the defusser and works great but without the defusser it has a lot of power!</li>
            <li> Only had this for 6 months and it died.  I have short hair and only used this once a day.  VERY disappointed with the quality of this item!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she loves it what else is there to say? She is very pleased with the unit.</li>
            <li> I had this dryer between one and two years.  I really liked the configuration of the buttons, and they are easy to slide to change the settings.  The dryer seemed to dry my hair in a reasonable amount of time, and the weight of the dryer wasn&#x27;t too heavy for 5-8 minutes of drying time for my shoulder length thick hair.  It was important to me for the dryer to have a medium heat setting since I also use the dryer to dry my two little dogs after their bath.  I wouldn&#x27;t call the noise volume quiet, but it was quieter than smaller high-pitched dryers I had in the past.  So my two little dogs seemed OK with the noise level.  Then a few days ago the dryer suddenly quit working.  When I moved the cord a little it turned back on, so I knew it had a bad connection.  But even though the dryer was blowing, the heat was no longer working, and I was blasting my head with cold air.  Then the handle became so hot, I knew I had to shut it off.  When I tried to shut it off, it wouldn&#x27;t shut off.  I had to drop the dryer because it was burning my hand, and I unplugged it from the wall.  My entire upstairs smelled like burned up hair dryer.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact it burned up, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Good price.very pleased</li>
            <li> I have curly, medium-length hair.I bought this dryer in the begining of the year thinking it would produce less frizz. After using it for 6 months (always on the warm settling, not hot), it fried my hair. My hair has never been this dry and unmanagable. Since the dryer was the only thing I changed in my hair-care regiment, I figured that was the answer. When I couldn&#x27;t stand it any more, I started using my old non-ionic blow dryer. Within two weeks, I noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t as dry and frizzy. I hate this dryer because of all the damage it did to my hair. And, although I did not experience the sparks, it short-circuit on me on a weekly basis.    I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone, especially for people with curly, think hair.</li>
            <li> I have owned this dryer for about 6 months. Over the last few months I have noticed the ends of my hair have been dry, frizzy and brittle. My hair has never been like this before. This morning while drying my hair, I noticed a bad smell and then saw clumps of hair with the ends melted together on the floor and bathroom counter. This dryer is a hazard and I cannot believe they are still selling them with all the other complaints I have read about them that date back to 2006! Don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE. GREAT HAIR DRYER.  I LIKE THE HEAT SETTINGS, ESPECIALLY THE COOL SETTING</li>
            <li> Wife likes it; light enough&#x27; powerful</li>
            <li> This hairdryer works fine, is light to handle and not too loud.  It does, however, have a burst-of-cold-air button which is difficult to use.  It&#x27;s positioned in such a way that you feel it should be pushed UP instead of IN. This button is rectangular and flat, again making it look and feel like it should be pushed up and not in.  Trying to push this button IN is often somewhat difficult (too thin; too highly set) and takes several tries.  If it weren&#x27;t for that button, which I seem to use a lot, I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars instead of 4.  Other than that, I do like this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Does a good job for the price. I like the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I Just got a new hair cut and and this is the dryer for curly hair it gave me the right temp. My hair was not frizzled when I was done. There was. A lot of bad reveiws but I can only say I have. Had the dryer for 6 months and it works great!  All I have to say is Amozon is a great company !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually owned three of these!  I love the first one, lasted about a year.  I bought another one thinking I use it every day so I&#x27;m probably not going to have a blowdryer last for several years.  The second one only lasted about 8 months and my third crapped out after 3 days.  Never again.</li>
            <li> Dryer worked fine for about a year and a half until one day, it powered off mid-dry. I figured I had accidentally shut it off with my thumb (since the control buttons are so poorly placed). The next day, halfway through my drying, it sparked and smoked. It was terrifying!</li>
            <li> Nice product.....works great</li>
            <li> great purchase for the price. it blows very hard and the temperatures are great. very happy happy happy with this product :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer because I liked the design.  Sliding buttons on the handle with separate controls for temperature and wind speed are good features.  I saw there were mixed reviews, but assumed Revlon had made the product well.  After two months of 10 to 15 minutes of use a day with the included diffuser, it spit blue fire and turned itself off.  I&#x27;m thankful for the safety feature, but have returned the item for a full refund.  I&#x27;m not willing to risk catching my hair on fire.</li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment was when I couldn&#x27;t attach the end cap so that I could concentrate more on the strands of my hair. It&#x27;s like the hot heat deformed the plastic attachment to where it wouldn&#x27;t click to the dryer. It became so frustrating. But for the diffuser, it remains to work just fine -- only because I hardly ever use it! I bought this  dryer years ago which is a plus, but I have had issues with it burning some parts my hair. The ion button switches off on its own.  I don&#x27;t regret buying it, but it&#x27;s not as great as I&#x27;d like it to be. I gave it a 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This is probably the 5th Revlon hair dryer I&#x27;ve purchased in the last 5 years. Every one of them has broken within a year, and of course, I can never find the receipt when I need it for the warranty. They work great when they actually do work, but be prepared for it to only last about a year. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Dryer does an excellent job drying my hair. My hair is not too thin or thick and when I separate it into sections the dryer works well to straighten / dry it properly. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product almost four years ago, and today was the sad day that it cut out.  I used to dry my hair all the time, but I have cut back.  This dryer still got a lot of use and always worked well.  I&#x27;m planning on buying the same one!</li>
            <li> My original of this hairdryer, which I loved, died and I was crestfallen when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  The package arrived and I was thrilled that the ones ordered were exactly the same and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I love it!! I have a bunch of hair and it dries it in no time while other dryers take more than 20 minutes to have way dry it!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s powerful, lightweight, and easy to use.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new hair dryer</li>
            <li> This drys my hair in five minutes and I have a ton of fine hair. Much quieter than my last dryer to the point I wondered if it was working right. Works great for over a month now and easy to clean the intake on the end of dust.  Not too big to store in our vanity drawers.</li>
            <li> With the exception of colors, this appears to be the same as an earlier model of the same brand I owned.  That was reliable for several years until slowing speed required replacement.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer does a very good job. It has multiple settings for heat and fan speed. Very good value.</li>
            <li> This works out pretty good.  It is lighter than my last one, so my arms appreciate it!</li>
            <li> just now moth. It&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> Beware that after some use of this dryer, the cord loosens at its connection to the body of the dryer.  If you lose power just once due to a loose cord connection, STOP using immediately.  I didn&#x27;t.  I wiggled the cord and it started blowing hot air again.  The next event was flames shooting out at me through the spot where the cord exits the body of the hair dryer.  It is not only very scary when you have flames shooting at your face, hair, and clothing, but needless to say, very dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this dryer works, it is great, but this is not the only review reporting fireworks shooting out of the cord connection.</li>
            <li> good price and product</li>
            <li> Purchased this model because it had all the features I was looking for. After about 5 weeks it will not heat up only blows barely warm air.</li>
            <li> Not the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever used but, for the price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This dryer works great, and I really like the diffuser attachment.  Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! I have very thick, unmanageable hair but with this bad boy it goes from super frizzed out to soft and shiny. It&#x27;s not heavy at all and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it overheating or shorting out (sounds like operator errors to me). Definitely worth the money and the wait.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer maybe 2 years ago or so after the one i&#x27;d had for 7 years finally died (i don&#x27;t remember anything about that one other than it was small and blue).  Anyway, so I bought this one because it looked like a good dryer, it claimed on the box that it was \\&quot;americas #1 selling hairdryer\\&quot;, and i was curious about the ion feature.  i think i bought it for around $25.  I bought it at ShopKo which offers an extended policy for a few extra dollars.  I wish i&#x27;d taken them up on the offer, as now this dryer has gone kaput.  The motor cuts on and off while using it, which is frustrating and annoying.  So, looks like i will have to buy another dryer sooner than i&#x27;d expected.  i guess i don&#x27;t know what an average life span of a hairdryer is, but i would hope they design them to last longer than a couple years.  somewhat of a disappointment, i have to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that though, this dryer performed well enough.  I don&#x27;t know what the ceramic ion feature really did, but it seemed to work no better or worse than any other dryer i&#x27;ve used.  I never noticed my hair being shiner, but it does get it dry.  Its a pretty standard hairdryer, imo.  nothing exceptional.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer so far for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> First, let me state that this is a good hairdryer. It dries my hair, and it comes with that nifty little attachment that allows me to focus on a specific area. All in all, I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am also a chemistry student, and I am quite perplexed by the ion button. What ions is it supposed to be shooting at me, and why? It seems that the common consensus is ozone, but ozone is not an ion, it&#x27;s a polar molecule. Or is it supposed to be shooting H+ at me? If so, why does my hair need protons? What does my hair dryer think that these ions are going to bond with once they reach my head?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a giant attachment that has a bunch of spikes on it. I have determined that if you use this attachment in combination with the ion button, it must turn into a freeze ray. As soon as I find a suitable live subject, I will be testing this hypothesis.</li>
            <li> I got this blow dryer hoping that my frizzy hair would dry faster and get less frizzy...it took much longer to blow-dry my hair and the ionic thing does nothing for it.  Overall, it&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li> I am fully pleased with the dryer, however the dryer pictured is not what I recieved.  The outside is not a shiny metallic as pictured it is a gray plastic color.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping! Very useful. I like it very much</li>
            <li> I first bought this blow dryer last year (2012). It worked great! My hair improved, less split ends/breakage. My hair stylist even saw a great improvement. The diffuser attachment worked very well w/my curly hair. Less frizz, dried quick. I also like to blow out my hair straight. Dryer was great for that too, less frizz &amp; less time w/my flat iron. After about 13 months the dryer shut off during use. I followed the instructions on how to fix/reset the dryer, but nothing. Since I really liked the dryer &amp; the attachments, I decided to give it a 2nd shot &amp; purchase another. I bought my 2nd one this past February. This past week the same thing happened again..shut off during use. The first time I bought the dryer was from my local Walgreens store &amp; the 2nd time was thru Target&#x27;s website. Very \\&quot;iffy\\&quot; product. I sent a complaint to Revlon, still waiting for a response. Just putting it out there ~ buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I owned this dryer for a year when flames shot out of where the dryer connected to the electrical cord.  As a result, my nightgown and chest were burnt.  The burn I sustained took four weeks to heal and left a two inch scar on my chest.  Frankly, despite the severity of the incident, I was grateful that my face or hair were not involved in the incident.  As I thought the malfunction was due to wear and tear, I purchased another one.  After five months, the dryer gave off sparks from the same location.  I was not injured that time.  I contacted Revlon and encouraged them to recall or discontinue the model.  DO NOT purchase this product -- I consider it highly dangerous.</li>
            <li> Purchased 5/2014. Dead as of 12/2014. Perfectly competent (nothing &amp;#34;ionically&amp;#34; special) while working. We&#x27;ve gotten 4-5 years at the very least out of past blow dryers. You make the decision.</li>
            <li> highly rated by consumer reports.  Seems to work great.  The one I received was a reddish color though</li>
            <li> Super nice hair dryer:)</li>
            <li> At present, I am using this hair dryer at home.  I like it so much that I am going to buy another one for my travel bag. When I visit family and friends I like to bring my own hair dryer so I keep one packed in my suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is light and powerful.  My hair looks better than it did when I used my previous dryer-shinier and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> This is a relatively inexpensive product and performs extremely well. It was a bargain. I tried to shop locally but, the exact product was close to $10 more and they would not match an online price. Their loss</li>
            <li> It does not have that much power as I wish it had when I bought it,but every thing else is good</li>
            <li> Good Good Good Good item. I want to recommend to my friends. This is also good price. I like it.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and made in China.  It is almost designed to fail.  I don&#x27;t think that our unit was an exception:  With daily use for a few minutes (I have short hair), failures started to appear very soon:  Within a week, there were no more ions, then there was a loose contact where the power cord enters into the body of the dryer. That meant that the dryer only worked if I wrapped the power cord around the handle in a certain angle.  I learned that trick.  Then, the heat selector started to burn and froze in the \\&quot;no heat\\&quot; position.  I still could use the dryer, but without ions, without heat and only when I wrapped the cord carefully around the handle.  At this point, I gave up.  It lasted about a year.  Now it&#x27;s in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;LESSON:  Actually, it is not a bad deal, because the dryer is so cheap.  We bought it for about $30, but now the replacement is available on Amazon for about $15.  Spend $15, get yourself a new dryer each year.&lt;br /&gt;PROBLEM:  It is really not good for the environment.  The dryer is about 1.5 pounds of plastic, it contains quite a lot of precious copper, and a few ceramic components that required lots of energy to fabricate.  And because of a few components that are sometimes intentionally \\&quot;designed to fail\\&quot;, all of this ends up in a landfill so that REVLON can sell you a new one.</li>
            <li> Has always been my favorite blow dryer.  Love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my blow dryer. I used it the day I got it in the mail! Packaging was great and secure in the box. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember when I ordered this. I already have a newer one because this one died last year.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I had found such a great quality product for a great price. I was in the market for a new hair dryer but couldn&#x27;t afford to spend an arm and a leg on a fancy blow dryer. I did a lot of shopping around and finally came across this one that even came with the attachments I was looking for. I bought it and was worried that for the price the product wouldn&#x27;t be as described. I received it and it has 3 different heat settings and two different levels. It also came with the attachments which work great! This blow dryer is still going great a few months down the road. If you are in the market for a new hair dryer and want one that is functional I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is light, quiet, effective, several options for heat and speed settings.  Everything you need. Top rated by consumer reports.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these dryers within the last ten years, and they worked well 75% during that time.  My hair is thick and slightly wavy, and it took fifteen minutes start to finish with a rounded air vent brush.  The buttons moved easily, and the dryer&#x27;s handle was comfortable to grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The demise of these dryers was pretty much the same: fire the first time, sparks the second, which sounds pretty common considering the reviews on here.  Also, the medium heat setting was a bit too hot, and it sucked in too much hair, requiring me once to disassemble the unit for removal. I considered buying a third, but having generated sparks with the last two, I opted to purchase a different brand.  Overall, if you don&#x27;t mind the potential electrical danger, it&#x27;s a decent dryer for the price.</li>
            <li> I had the exact dryer prior to purchasing this one.  I had it for many years before it gave out.  I have thick, curly hair and this gets it dry in no time.  Its light weight and easy to hold.  It has 3 different heat settings and high/low setting for air flow.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for the wife. When I asked her after several months of usage she said it&#x27;s great and work like a lot of high end blue dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Got a defective piece...Should check before supplying....</li>
            <li> Does everything I need it to do. Light and easy to use. I love  the attachments too. Dries nicely and fast.</li>
            <li> This product sparked, overheated, and caught on fire burning my rug. Do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! My first one finally died and I ordered the very same one because it performed so well and lasted so long. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Mine stopped working in less than 3 months.  As I was drying my hair it all of the sudden stopped.  Nothing I could do would make it turn back on.  It wasn&#x27;t that expensive but I do expect it to last longer than 3 months.</li>
            <li> This blowdryer is much better than any I&#x27;ve ever tried, it&#x27;s even better than the really expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two Revlon hairdryers over the past year and this one worked better than the subsequent one. I think I may have escaped burning my hair by taking the back filter off of it; my dryer also sparked but I realized it was because it was overheating. Taking the filter off the back creates better air intake and I guess fixed the problem (and I avoided, apparently, setting my hair on fire).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you shouldn&#x27;t have to do this, and doing so creates further problems. The filter is there to keep your hair from being sucked into the back of the hairdryer, so for the rest of its life I had to be insanely careful of how I held it. Unfortunately, even my drastic efforts didn&#x27;t save it--it only lasted about six months. The transformer somehow stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part of my experience is that I bought another one, albeit a different model. I tend to blame technical difficulties on user error, but I can see in this case I was not alone. Don&#x27;t buy this hairdryer; better yet, try another brand.</li>
            <li> Very nice unit. Heat is good and handles great while using to dry your hair. Not too sure about the shine thing??</li>
            <li> Rated this five stars because of&lt;br /&gt;1) There are 3 temperature features and a bonus cool shot&lt;br /&gt;2) There are 2 speeds&lt;br /&gt;3) Not heavy &amp; it has a long cord&lt;br /&gt;4) The 2 combing and area specific drying pieces&lt;br /&gt;5) The great product &amp; low price.&lt;br /&gt;This is product is great, and is worth more than the price I payed.</li>
            <li> Blow dryer is awesome!  Works great</li>
            <li> Simple blow dryer with cool function</li>
            <li> Had this exact dryer for many years, finally cord got a break in it but dryer still worked good.  Never had one last that long.  Was happy to find the exact same model was still being built and received it a couple weeks ago, works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE November 2013  This dryer I purchased a little over a year ago, the cord went bad already.  The one we bought years ago lasted for several years before the cord went bad.  This one only a little over a year.  Evidently this is a common problem as indicated by the problems people have been having with sparks shooting out of the cord and even fires where it shorts out.  This happens at the point where the cord comes out of the rubber stiffener at the bottom of the dryer.  If I get another one I&#x27;ll wrap electrical tape at the point where it comes out so the cord won&#x27;t keep bending and flexing at that point so hopefully it won&#x27;t break the wires inside.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  I have curly hair and this dryer works great with the diffuser to dry it after a shower :)</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this item. After 6 months this item sparked and caught on fire.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a blow dryer with a diffuser and I have wavy/curly hair. This diffuser works great and my hair looks great after using it!</li>
            <li> I love this product I had the same one before, but it completely broke down after owning it for years. If you need a blow dryer this is it</li>
            <li> I ordered this when the cord on the same exact one I had became damaged. I had it for about 5 years and didn&#x27;t want to experiment with other models or brands. Old reliable wins for me!</li>
            <li> it does not warm as we wanted</li>
            <li> Wish it had more power then it did and just felt cheep I&#x27;m glad Amazon has such a easy return .</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Quit after a few months.  I bought this blow dryer because the one I was using was 10 years old &amp; could reasonably be expected to die soon.  The old one is still working.  This one is dead.</li>
            <li> I love how all of the reviews are either (A) this is the best hair dryer ever, it&#x27;s super hot and dries my hair very fast OR (B) this dryer either burned by hair or caught on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are probably true.  I have bought this dryer several times though because it will dry my hair sooooo fast!  Yes, it may catch on fire, but it&#x27;s a risk I&#x27;m willing to take.  Also, don&#x27;t sit it right on your hair people!  Use the attachment and hold it away a bit!</li>
            <li> Just a normal blowdryer. Mostly purchased this for the diffuser attachment which i enjoy. My mother also had this blowdryer a few years  back and it had lasted more then 5 years so its great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Update- This recently broke and it did not last long at all ! other then that problem I loved it! I did not think the ionic would be such an amazing feature untill i purchased a new blowdryer and it was not Ionic takes me double the time to blowdry my hair now :(  I recommend finding a different blowdryer but one that is ionic. As for the diffuser I used it a few times and never really got the hang of it so that was pointless.</li>
            <li> No friz hair dryer. Second one we&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m on my third one of these.  I keep buying the same one because it fits my hand perfectly and the buttons are placed such that it&#x27;s very easy for me to adjust them while drying.  It&#x27;s also light.  Dries fast, but as far as the &amp;#34;shine boosting&amp;#34; - no dryer does that, you&#x27;ve got to use the right hair products.  For this price, don&#x27;t expect it to last a lifetime.  I get about three years out of it.  If you want a dryer that lasts forever, I guess you can spend upwards of $150-$200 for a professional one (like my hair dresser) but it&#x27;s not worth it as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Fair power. Considering the price price, it&#x27;s a good quality product.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer just a few months ago, and when I got it I truly loved it, then it started to be inconsistent with the heat, despite cleaning it regularly and taking care of it, then one morning it sounded like a chainsaw was in my dryer, then it just shorted out and stopped working. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth buying a second, I&#x27;d recommend a Tourmaline instead. This dryer, though is nice, is not even remotely a less than short term use dryer.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick. The air on it is strong and perfect. Very easy to switch the tops. GREAT price for a three-in-one blow dryer. Recommend.</li>
            <li> good product ..! Recommended</li>
            <li> A perfect and light hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I really gives the hair a boost, så can absolutly recommend it:)&lt;br /&gt;And a nice Price too</li>
            <li> This hair dryer gets HOT. I love the controls - separate for temp and power. I love the removable filter. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years and used it on the hottest setting daily. I haven&#x27;t had any more hair breakage than the next person, several stylists have complemented me over the years on the health of my hair. HOWEVER, like these other ladies, my hair dryer just blew up in my face as I was using it. Sparks flew out where the cord meets the handle, &amp; it&#x27;s dead. Every hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had dies like this eventually - looking for one as good as this that won&#x27;t blow up or catch fire though.</li>
            <li> Its a blow dryer! LOL. I docked a star because it has a weaker output than my old blow dryer.  I appreciate the cold setting.</li>
            <li> The Revlon works well enough.  It replaces  a Braun (?) machine that shorted out.  The Revlon is larger than I like but that is not a real problem.</li>
            <li> excellent product, very good at relationship between Quality vs Price, recommended 100%</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The cord seems to be way longer than what I am used to. I really like the tools it comes with...</li>
            <li> I picked this hair dryer out for Christmas for my mom to get me and it is a great product. I love the attachments that come with it and it is high powered and high heat.</li>
            <li> For months now, I&#x27;ve been blaming my flat iron on burning a large section of my hair- until today- when I was blow drying , as usual, and smelled something, then saw a gray spot on my head- upon closer inspection, realized it was a singed section of my hair, and as I ran my fingers through it- sadly, many hairs fell to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;So the good new is, I can keep using my flat iron.  The bad news- who thought this hair dryer was so bad for your hair!  I have a huge section of dry, burned hair that I have been growing out for months- but always wondered why there always seemed to be new broken hairs with singed marks on the end.  Buying a new one tomorrow- but NEVER this brand again.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer for a great price. It has all the features that we like and I really like the attachments. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I had this hair dryer for about two months when I noticed that it would switch to a cold cycle when it was too hot but today I noticed that it sparked when it got hot then went to cold cycle definitely throwing it in trash and from all the feedback on this page I highly doubt that revlon will be any help. Do not buy this product the only reason the star rating is colored in is because I wasn&#x27;t able to post with out it</li>
            <li> Hoy recibí el paquete en Venezuela, es un regalo para mi esposa. En el momento de usarlo el producto no funcionó. Es muy lamentable para mí encontrarme con esta situación. Por favor solicito que se resuelva mi problema. Gracias&lt;br /&gt;Today I received the package in Venezuela, is a gift for my wife. At the time of using the product did not work. It is very unfortunate for me to meet this situation. Please I request that my problem is resolved. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is also broken last two days. Don&#x27;t buy it as it is poor quality. Bought this as a birthday present. Not too happy will contact amazon</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer, and it died a few months later.  I exchanged it for a new one, and the new one died a few months later.  At this point, I&#x27;m going to eat the loss and buy from a different company.</li>
            <li> The customer support worked very well.</li>
            <li> The adapter with the spikes was horrible.  It was very hard and hurt my head. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> Handle get burning hot after a few minutes of use!  Scary! I have to turn it off and let the handle cool down so I can finish drying my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> the multitude of setting combinations allow me to control how my hair dries- its naturally very wavy and gets frizzy fast, but i haven&#x27;t had any issues like that with this dryer yet.</li>
            <li> Excellent very responsible</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer based on the review of Consumer Reports.  I was happy with it for about a month, and then started noticing that it would constantly cycle between hot and cold.  At first I thought I was hitting the cool shot button all the time but I am not.  Then I was drying my white dog after a bath and noticed sparkes were shooting out of the dryer!!  I have to assume this has been happening for the 6 months I&#x27;ve had it and I have just not noticed because I&#x27;m not looking right at it while I&#x27;m using it.  My husband then tested it against a flat surface and it constantly sparked as it was on.</li>
