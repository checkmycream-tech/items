            <li>The 024 worked to relieve the pain for a couple of hours but the strong smell was more than I was willing to put up with.</li>
            <li>Not bad just strong.  </li>
            <li>However, you may have good success temporarily &amp;#34;erasing&amp;#34; the pain from over-use of muscles or whatever, and may allow you to be able to sleep when that is not possible without having applied it.</li>
            <li>The beauty of this product is that it will either heat up or cool the affected area depending on what you need.</li>

            <li>My mom was kind enough to buy this and the towelettes in hopes of easing my pain.</li>
            <li>but I feel that it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that it has a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li>As far as the smell, yes it is strong</li>
            <li>it works very fast to give me relief..</li>
            <li>It is much better than back patches and it does not burn your skin.</li>
            <li>I really love it and keep a supply around just in case my back hurts after workouts or when I get up in the morning.</li>
            <li>The pleasant minty smell and the deep pain-relieving sensation are much more effective for my back, neck, and shoulder pain than other topical remedies.  </li>
            <li>a real advantage.&lt;br /&gt;The body can quickly learn to expect a continuation of pain from a minor problem, and it will linger on and on, even becoming chronic as you change your posture or gait to accommodate the ache or pain.</li>
            <li>Despite the other reviews I have found it very effective for back pain or fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it with the above caveats.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>fantastic relief highly recommend it to anyone with joint or muscle pain, cant praise it enough.</li>
            <li>size doesn&#x27;t fit all, but if you are one of the vast majority that are not allergic or bothered by any of the natural oils used in its manufacture, you may find comfort and relief in what it can do for you.</li>

            <li>One negative about the product is I will only use when I am home because the smell is overpowering and might disturb others (it is not a bad smell,just a strong one).  </li>

            <li> Be careful when ordering this product from 024.</li>
            <li> Let me first of all say that Pain is the body&#x27;s way of telling you that something is wrong, and that you should respond with a treatment that behooves the problem.</li>
            <li> I find other products burn my skin</li>
            <li> I wish they would make this in a roll on like some of the other pain relief products.</li>
            <li> The product is not worth 100.00 a month.</li>
            <li> it less often because it is too expensive to use as much as I</li>
            <li> My only complaint which isn&#x27;t really a complaint</li>
            <li> if you have trouble breathing at night</li>
            <li> 024 doesn&#x27;t heal the problem, but it relaxes my stiff neck and shoulders with it&#x27;s cooling / heating sensations and takes the edge off the pain.  </li>
            <li> They have a scam going where they keep sending this crappy product every few months and charging your credit card for $80!  </li>
            <li> waste your money!</li>
            <li> The problem is that the type is so small you don&#x27;t even notice this part of their &#x27;trial&#x27;.</li>
            <li> u can put a small amount on your chest and it will help you breathe.</li>
            <li> As someone else said, a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t go crazy.  </li>
            <li> reviewers here have complained about the smell - duh -</li>
            <li> This product is ridiculously ineffective.  </li>
            <li> I have never experienced a \\&quot;burning sensation\\&quot; from it.</li>
            <li> I just had to run into the shower to get the oils off because the pain from the oils is worse than the muscle pain, which did go away.</li>
            <li> Not only did it NOT work to relieve pain, but it stinks like crazy!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this product to miraculously heal something that is broken or badly sprained.</li>
            <li> also, just a heads up..wash your hands well after using if you rub your eyes it will burn really bad....</li>
            <li> I had to wait for it to wear off - took 2 days - while the smell made me sick to my stomach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom who had very bad arthritis.  </li>
            <li> The awful smell and price do not justify the temp.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for years. It does have a strong smell, but most people find it pleasant. I have never experienced a \\&quot;burning sensation\\&quot; from it. But you must be careful handling it, not too get it in your eyes or anywhere else that is sensitive. Despite the other reviews I have found it very effective for back pain or fibromyalgia. I was searching for the company to order some more when I came upon the bad reviews. This product is way more safe than ben gay or other creams that are not natural ingredients and can be dangerous if used too aggressively. A little bit of this product goes a long way, so the expense is relative because it should go a long way. You can apply it with a q tip or cotton ball. Getting in the shower with it is ok, but be careful applying too much extra heat from shower or heating pad. The beauty of this product is that it will either heat up or cool the affected area depending on what you need. The natural oils contained in the product are what smell, but it dissipates after 30 minutes or so. I love the product, but like anything, use it wisely.</li>
            <li> This works great. I have been using it on hammertoes for a long time and it helps the pain.</li>
            <li> Let me first of all say that Pain is the body&#x27;s way of telling you that something is wrong, and that you should respond with a treatment that behooves the problem. Don&#x27;t expect this product to miraculously heal something that is broken or badly sprained. However, you may have good success temporarily &amp;#34;erasing&amp;#34; the pain from over-use of muscles or whatever, and may allow you to be able to sleep when that is not possible without having applied it. As you heal when you&#x27;re sleeping, this can be a real advantage.&lt;br /&gt;The body can quickly learn to expect a continuation of pain from a minor problem, and it will linger on and on, even becoming chronic as you change your posture or gait to accommodate the ache or pain. My experience has been that if you can reduce the pain even temporarily (especially) in acute situations, it may break the cycle and never return.  People we have spoken with have also experienced relief with chronic aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, some users have reported that it is effective with masking the pain of fibromyalgia.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers here have complained about the smell - duh - it&#x27;s from the natural oils. I think it is a pleasant smell, but it is a bit oily, so if you put it on before going to bed, give it some time to soak in, and cover it to reduce the amount that transfers to your sheets. You may also want to use less than more and will find that a little goes a long way. And - oh yes- it won&#x27;t cause you to fail a drug test as many OTC remedies do.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product personally for more than 10 years, have given it to older family members, and given dozens of the towelettes to strangers who were in dire need of quick relief - never with a complaint. I strongly recommend it with the above caveats.&lt;br /&gt;One size doesn&#x27;t fit all, but if you are one of the vast majority that are not allergic or bothered by any of the natural oils used in its manufacture, you may find comfort and relief in what it can do for you.</li>
            <li> I love this product and buy it straight from the site in multiples for cost effectiveness.  I use it on my neck and back to relieve chronic pain from a neck injury - I had C5-7 fused in 2004 and haven&#x27;t found anything else that works for me.  I find other products burn my skin and I don&#x27;t care for their medicinal scents.  024 doesn&#x27;t heal the problem, but it relaxes my stiff neck and shoulders with it&#x27;s cooling / heating sensations and takes the edge off the pain.  As someone else said, a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t go crazy.  The scent can be strong, but I disagree that it&#x27;s unfavorable - I love the mint scent and find it relieves stress and clears my sinuses.</li>
            <li> I have constant back pain due to seizures. My mom was kind enough to buy this and the towelettes in hopes of easing my pain. I just had to run into the shower to get the oils off because the pain from the oils is worse than the muscle pain, which did go away. But I don&#x27;t want to trade one pain for another pain. Especially a burning pain.&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend 024 products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year I bought a bottle of a pain relieving oil from a Chinese Massage place ($10), it worked wonders, and didn&#x27;t have the burning feeling. The smell was still strong, but much closer to a pleasant smell than 024 products.</li>
            <li> I have back pain after a fall resulting in a crushed vertebra. The 024 worked to relieve the pain for a couple of hours but the strong smell was more than I was willing to put up with. So back to pain pills.</li>
            <li> One negative about the product is I will only use when I am home because the smell is overpowering and might disturb others (it is not a bad smell,just a strong one).  On the other hand, I was pleasantly surprised to find that, although this product does not take away the pain, it does make you feel like you have less pain due to the cooling effect it has where it is applied.  It&#x27;s almost as if your brain is fooled to not notice the pain because you&#x27;re experiencing a different sensation.  Whatever the reason, when I need some relief, it is nice to know that sometimes this product can give it to me.</li>
            <li> This product is ridiculously ineffective.  Not only did it NOT work to relieve pain, but it stinks like crazy! I could not get the stench off of my skin - even after scrubbing with a soapy washcloth!  I had to wait for it to wear off - took 2 days - while the smell made me sick to my stomach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And good luck getting your money back when you contact customer service! They have a scam going where they keep sending this crappy product every few months and charging your credit card for $80!  And there is no returning the product for any kind of refund, even if it is UNOPENED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Have been using it daily for an exteemely&lt;br /&gt;painful shoulder. However, I will have to&lt;br /&gt;use it less often because it is too expensive to use as much as I need.&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful product, but it is what&lt;br /&gt;It is.</li>
            <li> I was rear-ended and had neck fusion surgery(C5,6,7).9 months later I fell from a roof and ruined the surgical area and fractured my C2 .I have sore shoulders,pain in both arms and pain &amp; burning between my shoulder blades. This product helps releave most of it.I have given many bottles and pads to friends and they all like the product because it works!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best for pain and sinus conditions..</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  The pleasant minty smell and the deep pain-relieving sensation are much more effective for my back, neck, and shoulder pain than other topical remedies.  To me, it&#x27;s worth every single penny I pay for it.</li>
            <li> Be careful when ordering this product from 024. They charge you 19.99 for a 14 day trial and then charge you 79.99 if you do not contact them within the 14 days. The problem is that the type is so small you don&#x27;t even notice this part of their &#x27;trial&#x27;. The product is not worth 100.00 a month. The awful smell and price do not justify the temp. relief.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for relief of back pain. It is much better than back patches and it does not burn your skin.I really love it and keep a supply around just in case my back hurts after workouts or when I get up in the morning. My friends like it as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased for arthritus hip pain and it did nothing for me just cooled off my skin..save your money go with ben gay!!</li>
            <li> fantastic relief highly recommend it to anyone with joint or muscle pain, cant praise it enough. you wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom who had very bad arthritis.  She really loved it.  Said it really worked good.  The only thing is that it has a very strong smell.  Not bad just strong.  My mom said she didn&#x27;t mind the smell long as it helped her pain.  She was 84........</li>
            <li> It may smell but not as bad as Tiger Balm and works great.  My daughter has Fibromyalgia and we rub this on her neck and shoulders for a good deal of relief.  I use it on my back and legs (arthritis) and sigh afterwords.</li>
            <li> Great stuff feel much better</li>
            <li> I buy this regularly..it smells amazing...if you have trouble breathing at night u can put a small amount on your chest and it will help you breathe. I rub it on my knees and elbows it works very fast to give me relief..My only complaint which isn&#x27;t really a complaint I wish the relief would last longer..also, just a heads up..wash your hands well after using if you rub your eyes it will burn really bad.... Quick update... I wish they would make this in a roll on like some of the other pain relief products.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and I love it.  I do agree that the typing should be bigger that you can cancel in 14 days but I feel that it is worth every penny.  As far as the smell, yes it is strong but I noticed it went away after about 20-30 minutes. So after I shower, I apply it and then get dressed and do not  notice the smell. You must be careful getting it in around your private parts as it did burn.  I am going to keep using it for my arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> Excellent for arthritis and fibromyalgia pain. Strong scents and heat help with pain. I use with a heating pad. Works great!</li>
