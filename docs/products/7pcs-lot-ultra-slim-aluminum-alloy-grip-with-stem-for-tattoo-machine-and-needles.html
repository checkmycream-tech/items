            <li>perfect fit and feel would recommend to any artist looking to change their grips for a brighter new look.</li>
            <li>Nice set fit great and super light</li>
            <li>This is actually my second set purchased because I love the shape... who knows if I hold them as intended.. but they are very comfortable to me and are perfect for my style.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s way better deals out there</li>
            <li>but they are nice and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>no hand cramps love these tubes</li>
            <li>I love this set of grips.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for and more</li>
            <li>we already used them and they fit good in your hand and feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast &amp; in great condition.</li>
            <li>I use smooth running, light weight rotary machines, so these nice light weight grips go well with them.</li>
            <li>They fit comfortably in my hand &amp; fit my tips without any problems!</li>
            <li>easy to grip.</li>
            <li>Super looking colors, too!</li>
            <li>While they are light weight, they are plenty strong.. and clean easy.</li>
            <li>Also, the colors are fantastic.</li>
            <li>cheap.</li>
            <li>some don&#x27;t fit .</li>
            <li>Are good if you are  5 year old.</li>
            <li>The grip set came very fast with all the  7 pieces there except most of them</li>
            <li>Grips aren&#x27;t machined very well but they&#x27;re ok for the money</li>
            <li>great little tubes . . .  </li>
            <li>Well made and colorful..</li>
            <li>, I have to go look for the right tool now.</li>
            <li>5 grips worked great one hole on the 6th grip was too small.</li>
            <li>Kind of cheat stripped easy on the heads of screws, they will work if on a tight budget but spring the extra money on some better quality if your looking for a more durable longer lasting product.</li>
            <li>I will buy more definitely.</li>
            <li>7pc.s in the bunch where I can leave different needles in and color coordinate love these.</li>
            <li>where non useable i was only able to use 3 of the seven.</li>
            <li>only look awesome but quality sucks A $$</li>
            <li>These tubes were exactly as seen in the picture came really fast and are extremly lite</li>
            <li>Came to my house pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>These grips are smaller than you would expect but are also easy to handle.</li>
            <li>plan on ordering more in the very near future.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My only problem with them is I wish it came with the hexkey to put them together and the tool to clean them</li>
            <li>colors are sweet and have lasted several autoclaves which ive had some brands die in one ultrasonic cleaning let alone an autoclave</li>
            <li>tighten down easy to any guns we have without any problems.</li>
            <li>Great for small hands, exactly as described if not better!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just that the two that stripped were my favorite colored ones, Black and yellow....</li>
            <li>my only compliant is that this item is a little to light for my taste.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely nothing bad to say about these, lightweight, good grip,</li>
            <li>I bought this aboutn2 months ago and it to forever to get to me and on top of that I only got 1 color which sucks !</li>

            <li> Decided to try these grips as the original ones with my machines a little thick for my hands and personal taste.  </li>
            <li> I mean really for the money they aren&#x27;t meant to be long lasting</li>
            <li> These are decent for the money, but I had 2 that were really stiff on the set screw thread, and now a few months later, they are stripped.</li>
            <li> but for the price its not worth sending back something I can fix myself</li>
            <li> the ones that didnt work were poorly drilled the tips wont fit because the hole is too small on one side but purfect on the other, while some of the stems have iregular openings which could damage the needles.</li>
            <li> These are heavy and solid grips!</li>
            <li> I prefer using slim grips like these for lining, so with 2 down</li>
            <li> Half of the grips wouldn&#x27;t accept tubes on either end, I even tried all of my tube and tip parts with no luck.</li>
            <li> Nothing fits tight or even close . . .</li>
            <li> Missing not for autoclave.  </li>
            <li> Also do not use these in an ultrasonic cleaner with any detergent cleaners other than dish soap/green soap, it will fade and dull the anodized coloring on the grip.</li>
            <li> I like small grips like these.</li>
            <li> I have XL Hands &amp; like small grips.</li>
            <li> I have 5 left, so not too bad, I do have other grips too, but these are like disposable ones with a pulse to me.</li>
            <li> Poorly machined and SHARP!</li>
            <li> My hands are tiny and it&#x27;s very difficult for me to hold cylinder-shaped grips, my hand hurts after a little while.</li>
            <li> Edges are sharp as well making it uncomfortable to grasp.</li>
            <li> Machine quality is poor.</li>
            <li> Tubes are flimsy and thin.</li>
            <li> For $7.00 you can not go wrong.</li>
            <li> some of the grips wear threaded like crap couldnt screw the the nutts n</li>

            <li> some of the grips wear threaded like crap couldnt screw the the nutts n and they strip out very easily</li>

            <li> I bought this aboutn2 months ago and it to forever to get to me and on top of that I only got 1 color which sucks ! There&#x27;s way better deals out there</li>
            <li> tubes were stuck to the inside og grips and could not pull out except for 2 out of the seven and 4 of the 7 didnt have set screws in them</li>
            <li> Good!! excellent items, its perfect and work excellent this is best good and I think buy more again thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Great product if you have your own tips. I like that they came in a verity of different colors</li>
            <li> Grips aren&#x27;t machined very well but they&#x27;re ok for the money</li>
            <li> These are decent for the money, but I had 2 that were really stiff on the set screw thread, and now a few months later, they are stripped.

            <li> My only problem with them is I wish it came with the hexkey to put them together and the tool to clean them but they are nice and comfortable to use. They also do well to even out the weight of the machine</li>
            <li> These tubes were exactly as seen in the picture came really fast and are extremly lite i did a 6hr tatt the night I recieved them no hand cramps love these tubes</li>
            <li> Decided to try these grips as the original ones with my machines a little thick for my hands and personal taste.  The contour adds to comfort - and the colors bright and beautiful.  However, when working with the machines - it&#x27;s about control and comfort.  And these grips give me that.</li>
            <li> I love this set of grips. My hands are tiny and it&#x27;s very difficult for me to hold cylinder-shaped grips, my hand hurts after a little while. These are perfect for me, very comfortable, I can hold the machine for hours without discomfort. Also, the colors are fantastic.</li>

            <li> Great for small hands, exactly as described if not better!</li>
            <li> Machine quality is poor. Lots of burs to nick yourself on. Edges are sharp as well making it uncomfortable to grasp.</li>

            <li> The grip set came very fast with all the  7 pieces there except most of them where non useable i was only able to use 3 of the seven. the ones that didnt work were poorly drilled the tips wont fit because the hole is too small on one side but purfect on the other, while some of the stems have iregular openings which could damage the needles.

            <li> cheap. some don&#x27;t fit . do yourself a favor and save up for a good one</li>
            <li> 5 grips worked great one hole on the 6th grip was too small. I redrilled it with a metal bit and it works great. Can&#x27;t complaine for 7.00 and 5 mins of redriling.</li>
            <li> only look awesome but quality sucks A $$</li>
            <li> Half of the grips wouldn&#x27;t accept tubes on either end, I even tried all of my tube and tip parts with no luck.</li>
            <li> I find these to be some great grips. Well made and colorful..They all came with the bottom part of the tube so no need to buy them seperate</li>
            <li> These work great and are very strong. Makes things a lot easier too. Came to my house pretty fast too.</li>
            <li> Product was as described</li>

            <li> Very pleased with the product! These are heavy and solid grips! Super looking colors, too! Would recommend to others as we are pleased with the item!</li>
            <li> only part that is 3/4 is the rear so these are great for those that use those huge rubber grip covers.  goes on easier.  colors are sweet and have lasted several autoclaves which ive had some brands die in one ultrasonic cleaning let alone an autoclave</li>
            <li> Great Price For this set.. If it was a U.S. Made it would cost about $70.00 So 90% off retail is good. I like small grips like these. It is like writing &amp; or drawing with a pen. Nice feel.  I have XL Hands &amp; like small grips. Some Like med or lg. it is an individual preference. For $7.00 you can not go wrong. Ever watch American Chopper. They are CNC Machined.  So They are Computer Driven Machines. They Do Not  Screw up.  Bill</li>
            <li> Kind of cheat stripped easy on the heads of screws, they will work if on a tight budget but spring the extra money on some better quality if your looking for a more durable longer lasting product.</li>
            <li> Poorly machined and SHARP! Tubes are flimsy and thin. Nothing fits tight or even close . . . but for the price its not worth sending back something I can fix myself</li>
            <li> perfect fit and feel would recommend to any artist looking to change their grips for a brighter new look. Great price</li>
            <li> I love this set. It arrived fast &amp; in great condition. They fit together perfectly &amp; are the correct size for my machines. Definitely a great set worth every penny! They fit comfortably in my hand &amp; fit my tips without any problems! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> They. Are good if you are  5 year old. No parts. Missing not for autoclave.  It&#x27;s good for fishing lol</li>
            <li> I use smooth running, light weight rotary machines, so these nice light weight grips go well with them. While they are light weight, they are plenty strong.. and clean easy. This is actually my second set purchased because I love the shape... who knows if I hold them as intended.. but they are very comfortable to me and are perfect for my style.</li>
