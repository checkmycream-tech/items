            <li>Very nice body wash.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely one of the best - if not the best - brand of unscented soap.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for an excellent, moisturizing, unscented shower gel for sensitive skin, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin</li>
            <li>some lotion or oil is still a good idea during the drier months--but this is a winner</li>
            <li>I love this body wash, it&#x27;s a great price for the size and works well.</li>
            <li>good, nice size makes it cost effective.</li>
            <li>This stuff is totally amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really the best bodywash.</li>
            <li>highly recommend trying it &amp; buying on Amazon for the best deal.</li>
            <li>Perfect for people with real sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I like it better  than  the neutragena.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon at Vitacost because I&#x27;d otherwise have to drive 2 hours out to get refills.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It works great, find it to be very invigorating with no scent, also  </li>
            <li>Its an OK body wash and lathers OK..</li>
            <li>not so sure I would repurchase it though..</li>
            <li>I did what I always do when I find something that I need or just really love...</li>
            <li>Also love their scented versions.</li>
            <li>I just love this product and will be purchasing it again and again.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I picked this one.</li>
            <li>I love this unscented body wash.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Fair trade product and a very large  bottle for the price too.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Produces a great lather, leaves no residue, and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>After continued use however, I found find it to be very drying, which is surprising given the ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to pump out whatever amount I want without wasting any.  </li>
            <li>It also rinses easily, unlike some moisturizing soaps.  </li>
            <li>Love the clean feeling and</li>
            <li>Lathers easily , rinses well.</li>
            <li>Foams well and rinses easily out of my mesh pouf.  </li>
            <li>But it absorbs easily and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t figure out how I did it, nor is it easily to replicate.</li>
            <li>( I use neem oil and theraneem soap and it has a strong neem smell,)</li>
            <li>a day.&lt;br /&gt;The product is fine.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a huge value for cost, and I will continue to use post</li>
            <li>Smooth, cleans well, pump works</li>
            <li>Good body wash for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>But so far so good.</li>
            <li>It also leaves me with a clean conscious because it&#x27;s fair trade certified.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a great bargain compared to more toxic, less eco-friendly products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had much better luck with Aveeno Active Naturals unscented (good, but still a little drying) and Cetaphil Restoraderm body wash (wonderful stuff and not drying at all).</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this, I had high hopes given the good reviews.</li>
            <li>But this stuff is great and got rid of all my dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li>I will tell all my friends about how wonderful it lathers and actually keeps your skin soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually rather pleasant body wash.</li>
            <li>I love Whole Foods</li>
            <li>One pump is perfect: the fluff ball gets very bubbly and I can wash my entire body very easily.</li>
            <li>As I age &amp; lead a very busy life, my body needs more moisture.</li>
            <li>This is a very large bottle so well worth the money and planning on purchasing it for our friends for the holidays.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the world&#x27;s most refined soap, but it is somehow simple and yet amazing beyond being simple.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This gives a nice  clean without being slippery or so squeaky that your skin dries tight.</li>
            <li>Great safe and non-toxic body washes made and works very well especially for dry and or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m coming back for more.</li>
            <li>I first purchased a bottle of this @</li>
            <li>It suds up pretty well and seems to help keep moisture in.</li>
            <li>this is unscented which it is, but I was surprised how smooth it is.</li>
            <li>Everyday Shea Moisturizing Body Wash Unscented is a non-toxic, eco-conscious fair trade product.  </li>
            <li>Very few ingredients, gentle, great for the whole family.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every kind of body wash for sensitive skin, and none of them were gentle enough, but this one is.</li>
            <li>I loved it immediately in both the lavender &amp; the unscented versions but in this size bottle it retailed at about $22.-a little much for my fixed income.</li>
            <li>Found this at a local health food store and gave it a shot, since it was inexpensive, free trade, and unscented (I&#x27;d rather wear perfume, thanks).  </li>
            <li>the Whole Foods in Jacksonville.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use as much after-bath moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>I also find the product has an unusual odor.</li>
            <li>some of Everyday Shea&#x27;s lotions).&lt;br /&gt;It is a good body wash- non-drying, general purpose.</li>
            <li>, the few I had started to get on my hips are fading, so I&#x27;m thrilled that this helps to cleanse and keep moisture in while my skin stretches to new capacity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant, and began using this in e beginning of my 2nd trimester to help ensure moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>i only use it when i have nothing better, it&#x27;s the big backup bottle.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it cleans thoroughly, and it leaves my skin pleasantly moist.  </li>
            <li>There truly was no fragrance added, which my very sensitive skin appreciated.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Does not really lather up like I like &amp; leaves a fairly clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product in a local  health &amp; grocery .</li>
            <li>It has also helped easy itching on several body parts due to dryness living in California, working in field sales all day, then on my bike, playing soccer or at the gym 6 days a week.</li>
            <li>I even use it to wash my face and it&#x27;s helped clear up some blemishes.</li>
            <li>A deal-maker as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I have soft water at my house, so there&#x27;s no issues with it sudsing.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an old standby around our house.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>you have drier sensitive skin, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin silky soft, I can&#x27;t stop feeling my arms after showering.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really done wonders for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It has worked well through the cold dry winter months here in DC and it is light enough for a refreshing cleanser with the heavier summer oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since switching to \\&quot;green\\&quot; socially conscious products, Everyday Shea is the only body wash/soap I buy other than Dr. Wood&#x27;s Peppermint Shea (which is also non-toxic and ecologically sound).</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it is truly unscented, and leaves me feeling cleaner and more moisturized than anything I&#x27;ve used the last few years.</li>

            <li> It is natural and doesn&#x27;t cause me to get all itchy like other body washes have done to me.</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle smell, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Beyond frustrating as it&#x27;s extremely hard to use with being able to use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Does not itch or dry my skin out</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do although in this weather my skin is exceptionally dry</li>
            <li> The consistency is on the thin side but it lasts as long as a thicker wash; it just doesn&#x27;t soap up as much but cleans as well.  </li>
            <li> Makes a lot of lather, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I alternate between this and 4 other products &amp; usually take 2 showers</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other wash.</li>
            <li> Not super moist--</li>
            <li> how little you need for a foam.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was trying to find a alternative to other soaps i have bought in the past, and I know it says this</li>
            <li> It does have a slight odor from the shea butter which is subtle but not particularly fragrant</li>
            <li> is that the pumper is not easily opened/raised for use.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but the big draw here is the moisturization.</li>
            <li> This stuff is alright, not great.</li>
            <li> Defective versus broken.</li>
            <li> no moisturizing qualities that i could discern, a vaguely unpleasant odor, a slightly sticky consistancy.</li>
            <li> It does have a little bit of a scent to it that I can&#x27;t describe, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately we don&#x27;t have one in Savannah.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t awful, but it isn&#x27;t neutral either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I had been using  neutragena,  but Costco quit carrying it so I ordered  this.  It feels good on the skin and I like it better  than  the neutragena.</li>
            <li> As I age &amp; lead a very busy life, my body needs more moisture. I alternate between this and 4 other products &amp; usually take 2 showers a day.&lt;br /&gt;The product is fine. No scent. Does not really lather up like I like &amp; leaves a fairly clean feeling. It has also helped easy itching on several body parts due to dryness living in California, working in field sales all day, then on my bike, playing soccer or at the gym 6 days a week.</li>
            <li> Found this at a local health food store and gave it a shot, since it was inexpensive, free trade, and unscented (I&#x27;d rather wear perfume, thanks).  Turns out it&#x27;s the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  A little goes a long way, it cleans thoroughly, and it leaves my skin pleasantly moist.  Not super moist--some lotion or oil is still a good idea during the drier months--but this is a winner and I&#x27;m coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Everyday Shea Moisturizing Body Wash Unscented is a non-toxic, eco-conscious fair trade product.  Thankfully, it doesn&#x27;t contain palm oil (as do some of Everyday Shea&#x27;s lotions).&lt;br /&gt;It is a good body wash- non-drying, general purpose. It does have a slight odor from the shea butter which is subtle but not particularly fragrant so I add either essential oil or fragrance oil to give it a scent.  The consistency is on the thin side but it lasts as long as a thicker wash; it just doesn&#x27;t soap up as much but cleans as well.  And it&#x27;s a great bargain compared to more toxic, less eco-friendly products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since switching to \\&quot;green\\&quot; socially conscious products, Everyday Shea is the only body wash/soap I buy other than Dr. Wood&#x27;s Peppermint Shea (which is also non-toxic and ecologically sound).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of body wash for sensitive skin, and none of them were gentle enough, but this one is. I love this body wash, it&#x27;s a great price for the size and works well. I&#x27;ll go out of my way to keep using it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is alright, not great. It&#x27;s unscented! A deal-maker as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I first purchased a bottle of this @ the Whole Foods in Jacksonville. I love Whole Foods but unfortunately we don&#x27;t have one in Savannah. I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon at Vitacost because I&#x27;d otherwise have to drive 2 hours out to get refills. I purchased it because it is a simple liquid soap(castille), it contains shea butter, does not contain 50 ingredients like alcohol or sulphates, it&#x27;s liquid, it&#x27;s 32 ounces and it&#x27;s all this for under eleven bucks. It isn&#x27;t the world&#x27;s most refined soap, but it is somehow simple and yet amazing beyond being simple.</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle smell, but it&#x27;s not bad. It leaves my skin very clean feeling. I have soft water at my house, so there&#x27;s no issues with it sudsing. One pump is perfect: the fluff ball gets very bubbly and I can wash my entire body very easily. It also leaves me with a clean conscious because it&#x27;s fair trade certified.</li>
            <li> This stuff is totally amazing. I had to get rid of everything I used that was scented as I became allergic to something. But this stuff is great and got rid of all my dry itchy skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant, and began using this in e beginning of my 2nd trimester to help ensure moisturized skin. I also thought using a shea wash may help give a boisterous to the shea and cocoa butter I&#x27;m using to prevent stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives a nice  clean without being slippery or so squeaky that your skin dries tight. It has worked well through the cold dry winter months here in DC and it is light enough for a refreshing cleanser with the heavier summer oils. I really like this, it&#x27;s a huge value for cost, and I will continue to use post pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, no stretch marks, the few I had started to get on my hips are fading, so I&#x27;m thrilled that this helps to cleanse and keep moisture in while my skin stretches to new capacity.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and I love this stuff.  It is natural and doesn&#x27;t cause me to get all itchy like other body washes have done to me.</li>
            <li> Beyond frustrating as it&#x27;s extremely hard to use with being able to use. My guess? Defective versus broken. But who knows.</li>
            <li> This is perfect.  I shave with it, wash with it.  It&#x27;s easy to pump out whatever amount I want without wasting any.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  It also rinses easily, unlike some moisturizing soaps.  It&#x27;s an old standby around our house.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but the big draw here is the moisturization. It&#x27;s really done wonders for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great safe and non-toxic body washes made and works very well especially for dry and or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works great, find it to be very invigorating with no scent, also  you can use it on your hair between regular shampoo&#x27;s as well.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder when needed</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of the best - if not the best - brand of unscented soap.  Fair trade product and a very large  bottle for the price too.</li>
            <li> I used to use Dove unscented but tried this one. Not from this seller but from the local store. Suprized there are no reviews for it on here it&#x27;s really the best bodywash. Love the clean feeling and how little you need for a foam.</li>
            <li> Its an OK body wash and lathers OK..not so sure I would repurchase it though..Its not as moisturizing as i thought it would be given the ingredients...I prefer Nubian heritage shea body wash</li>
            <li> Good body wash for sensitive skin.  Very few ingredients, gentle, great for the whole family. Makes a lot of lather, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Perfect for people with real sensitive skin.  Does not itch or dry my skin out and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product in a local  health &amp; grocery . I loved it immediately in both the lavender &amp; the unscented versions but in this size bottle it retailed at about $22.-a little much for my fixed income. I did what I always do when I find something that I need or just really love...I went to Amazon, of course!&lt;br /&gt;This product is organic, well made &amp;  for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying it &amp; buying on Amazon for the best deal.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an excellent, moisturizing, unscented shower gel for sensitive skin, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  It has only a few ingredients; it doesn&#x27;t have a whole list of unpronounceable chemicals along with a teeny bit of shea.  This is the real thing.  It does have a little bit of a scent to it that I can&#x27;t describe, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant.  It suds up pretty well and seems to help keep moisture in.</li>
            <li> Lathers easily , rinses well. I don&#x27;t need to use as much after-bath moisturizing lotion. Unscented so no problem with sensitivity to fragrance</li>
            <li> Leaves skin so incredibly soft. Won&#x27;t use any other wash. Also love their scented versions.</li>
            <li> I just love this product and will be purchasing it again and again.  I will tell all my friends about how wonderful it lathers and actually keeps your skin soft and moist.  This is a very large bottle so well worth the money and planning on purchasing it for our friends for the holidays.</li>
            <li> no moisturizing qualities that i could discern, a vaguely unpleasant odor, a slightly sticky consistancy. i only use it when i have nothing better, it&#x27;s the big backup bottle.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was trying to find a alternative to other soaps i have bought in the past, and I know it says this this is unscented which it is, but I was surprised how smooth it is. It&#x27;s actually rather pleasant body wash. The biggest surprise of all is the neem leaf. ( I use neem oil and theraneem soap and it has a strong neem smell,) this doesn&#x27;t however which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. But so far so good. definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this, I had high hopes given the good reviews. Initially, it seemed to work well. There truly was no fragrance added, which my very sensitive skin appreciated. After continued use however, I found find it to be very drying, which is surprising given the ingredients. Consequently, I had to use a quality unscented moisturizing lotion or cream after every shower (e.g., CeraVe) to counteract the effect of the body wash. I also find the product has an unusual odor. It isn&#x27;t awful, but it isn&#x27;t neutral either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have drier sensitive skin, this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you. I have had much better luck with Aveeno Active Naturals unscented (good, but still a little drying) and Cetaphil Restoraderm body wash (wonderful stuff and not drying at all).</li>
            <li> Very nice body wash.  Foams well and rinses easily out of my mesh pouf.  I was having problems with itching and rashes on my skin, so I decided to try this.  I bought the unscented and my skin is clearing; I think I was allergic to the product I had been using.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do although in this weather my skin is exceptionally dry so using lots of it.  But it absorbs easily and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> The best. Great quality. Truly moisturizes. Smooth, cleans well, pump works good, nice size makes it cost effective. Love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I picked this one. A little goes a long way, it is truly unscented, and leaves me feeling cleaner and more moisturized than anything I&#x27;ve used the last few years. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this unscented body wash. Produces a great lather, leaves no residue, and has natural ingredients. I even use it to wash my face and it&#x27;s helped clear up some blemishes. I also use it to shave with... and even sometimes as a shampoo! It leaves my skin silky soft, I can&#x27;t stop feeling my arms after showering.  :)  Great value and supports Alaffia&#x27;s great cause!</li>
            <li> No fragrances, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;Good foaming action.&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a pumper, which I is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Good volume so you don&#x27;t run out easily.&lt;br /&gt;The only knock I have is that the pumper is not easily opened/raised for use.  I still can&#x27;t figure out how I did it, nor is it easily to replicate.</li>
