            <li> I choose this item to have shinny nails without polish.  The oil is great and does a good job of healing and softening the cuticle. The file is a file, what can one say?  But I was very disappointed in the &amp;#34;Buffer&amp;#34;.  After the first use the film on the buffer has worn off.  I am certain it is not a Seacret  buffer.  I need a buffer to shine my nails and the one with the kit does not do any good.</li>
            <li> Why cant I find these anymore? What a great product? Did the dead sea run out of salt? Darn it</li>
            <li> this makes my nails look very nice without the bother of polishing them. I love the fact you get to have two blocks.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve used other facial cleansing soaps in the past but this by far does a great job. My face is clear and is no longer oily. I&#x27;m also using it other area&#x27;s on my body where I have skin problems.

            <li> Awesome, it makes my nails look so shiny, like they&#x27;re polished! Have used it several times to give myself a manicure! So awesome!</li>
            <li> Fantastic buffers! They polish my nails so shiny that people think I have clear nail polish on. It&#x27;s quick and easy to bring out that shine, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the first Seacret nail buffer that I had been using about 4 years. Very durable and does shine up your nails nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail buffer (&amp; the file &amp; cuticle came w/ it then too) @ a mall in Baltimore...&amp; thought, &amp;#34;Will I really use this?  Or is this just something that I&#x27;m going to put away in a drawer &amp; never look @ again?&amp;#34;  10 years!  later, I&#x27;m still using it...of course, it got VERY worn out after 10 years...and I had been wanting to get another one, but didn&#x27;t want to have to travel to get one...so I was able to purchase this online...it&#x27;s AMAZING how awesome &amp; smooth it makes your nails look...even w/o having to get a real manicure!  I dont&#x27; know this for sure, but it seems like it makes your polish stay on longer too...possibly b/c of how smooth the nail is?  Anyway, it was definatly worth purchasing &amp; I even gave one away as a gift.  There is also (or @ least there used to be) an awesome scrub to go w/ it as well.  It really only takes 5-10 min. to do &amp; you can do it while you&#x27;re watching TV...even in the busy sched. of having kids, I find that it&#x27;s not difficult to stay consistent w/ using this buffer.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this on Amazon and did not pay the $60 at the mall.  Love how nicely it shines up the nail, and moisturizes the cuticle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself but will buying several for my gals!  Buffer is wonderful, file super and the cuticle oil is top notch.  GREAT little bargain...</li>
            <li> Great product and received quickly with tracking info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good to test it out instead of shelling $30 at the mall. not sure if it comes with warranty like in the mall where you can replace the buffer pad for lifetime as far as we have the receipt. if you have already tried i think buying it in mall would make sense since you can replace the pad and get oil refill free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommend the product and seller as i ended up buying one more set as a gift</li>
            <li> I did not receive the gift bag...so i do not know what is to rate...product is good..i will buy again</li>
            <li> This is the same as the kits you pay a fortune for at the mall kiosks but doesn&#x27;t contain hand cream. I love the cuticle oil. It makes great gifts.</li>
            <li> The oil is the best I&#x27;ve ever used on cuticles that have always needed a lot of management.  It keeps them soft and pliable, not as much trimming required.  The buffer and nail file are excellent.  This is a great set of products and I highly recommend all of them.</li>
            <li> This buffer works great.  I use all the sides in the order indicated and my nails are shiny and the little ridges are gone.  Does the job easily.</li>
            <li> A simple and a non toxic way to make your nails look great without any muss or fuss.  My nails are stronger - firmer than they were before!  No kidding!!! Love Love Love this product!</li>
            <li> I felt this was a great value.  I have purchased this buffer in the past from mall vendors, and knew that I liked the product.  I lost my original, and was able to replace it from here at a greatly reduced price.  Would do it again!</li>
            <li> Seacret nail buffers are the best out on the market. I have tried others, and they&#x27;re not as good and the results don&#x27;t last as long. They&#x27;re the only brand that I use, and you get the best quality.</li>
            <li> I bought the block and cuticle oil about a year ago and loved it. I found them on here for a way more cheaper price plus I got an extra block, nail file and carrying bag. I am not pleased with the quality of the nail file. It rubs down easily and does not have much use after it is used a few times. I am using one block so far and the silk part is already lifting up in small pieces. Don&#x27;t know if its the same Seacret or just a knock off.</li>
