            <li>Very happy with the products Amazon carries.</li>
            <li>But it is the perfect size for traveling and the best hairspray on the market.</li>
            <li>This is a very good hair spray used by professionals.</li>
            <li>They came packaged very good and on time.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>These are great for travel</li>
            <li>Hair was even able to uphold some rain!!</li>
            <li>it is a good travel size</li>
            <li>My favorite hairspray in travel size!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Great for traveling, not taking up much room.</li>
            <li>Love this size for travel--Love the product.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re sure to find one (or more)</li>
            <li>I looked very quickly when ordering and chose this one because the 10 ounce size was out of stock with Prime Shipping.</li>
            <li>It works well for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this helps it keep in place.</li>
            <li>This is and has been my absolute favorite hair spray for years!</li>
            <li>This is a great product but the picture is a bit deceiving as you only receive ONE 3 ounce can of spray, not two as in the picture.</li>
            <li>scent is light and fresh and doesn&#x27;t clash with my favorite perfume or overpower it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray, but be aware, if you are buying this</li>
            <li>BEST hairspray for hard to hold hair.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair spray for my heavy, stubbornly straight hair.</li>
            <li>I wish they were more readily available because this is the only product I can use that</li>
            <li>Wether your looking to hold you curls, updo, teased look, or just tame some fly aways, this is the hairspray that you&#x27;ve been looking</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just right for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was so glad to see Amazon carried the smaller can.</li>
            <li>Its a great product but showing 2 items when only one is really for sale is kinda not right.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a finer spray than the large can</li>
            <li>There are quite a few amazing products in this line.  </li>
            <li>Really stays all day.</li>
            <li>and I really like that.  </li>
            <li>love that it holds my ever-changing style without being sticky, tacky or just too heavy.  </li>
            <li>Good product but the value vs size is poor.</li>
            <li>If you buy the bigger can, which is 10.6 oz, you get more than 3x the volume at less than 2x</li>
            <li>I can easily run my fingers or a brush through my hair after using Tigi Bed Head Hard Head Hair Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love Tigi Bed Head Hard Head Hair Spray!</li>

            <li> even spray a little on each section of hair before I use my clipless curling iron (or wand) to help my thick, heavy hair hold a curl all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was unaware of that and was shocked when only one came in the mail.</li>
            <li> I have used Tigi  Bed Head Hard Head hair spray for years but always hated to haul the large can when I went on vacation.</li>

            <li> I have used Tigi  Bed Head Hard Head hair spray for years but always hated to haul the large can when I went on vacation. Was so glad to see Amazon carried the smaller can. It seems to have a finer spray than the large can and I really like that.  I will keep getting these smaller cans as I need them. They came packaged very good and on time. Very happy with the products Amazon carries.</li>
            <li> Its a great product but showing 2 items when only one is really for sale is kinda not right. My bad for not reading better thru it.</li>
            <li> Only one in the order which is somewhat misleading considering they show two</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture, you only get 1.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Misleading, though showing 2 cans.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but the picture is a bit deceiving as you only receive ONE 3 ounce can of spray, not two as in the picture.</li>
            <li> it is a good travel size but I find smaller ones in TJ Max store</li>
            <li> This is and has been my absolute favorite hair spray for years! Wether your looking to hold you curls, updo, teased look, or just tame some fly aways, this is the hairspray that you&#x27;ve been looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it holds my ever-changing style without being sticky, tacky or just too heavy.  I can easily run my fingers or a brush through my hair after using Tigi Bed Head Hard Head Hair Spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and fresh and doesn&#x27;t clash with my favorite perfume or overpower it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even spray a little on each section of hair before I use my clipless curling iron (or wand) to help my thick, heavy hair hold a curl all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Tigi Bed Head Hard Head Hair Spray! It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;must-have&amp;#34; to keep in my hair styling arsenal.  There are quite a few amazing products in this line.  You&#x27;re sure to find one (or more) that&#x27;s just right for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that in this listing you will only receive one small 3 ounce size can of Tigi Bed Head Hard Head Hair Spray.  I&#x27;m noting this because of the two cans shown in the photo.  I looked very quickly when ordering and chose this one because the 10 ounce size was out of stock with Prime Shipping. I was expecting two 3 ounce cans.  I now know it&#x27;s just to show the front and back of the can.</li>
            <li> These are great for travel so I don&#x27;t have to check my bag. I wish they were more readily available because this is the only product I can use that doesn&#x27;t give me a migraine.</li>
            <li> Good product but the value vs size is poor. If you buy the bigger can, which is 10.6 oz, you get more than 3x the volume at less than 2x the cost. I just derp&#x27;d and saw two cans and though ther would be 2 cans in my order but there&#x27;s only 1.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray, but be aware, if you are buying this and it shows two cans, you are only getting one 3oz can. I was unaware of that and was shocked when only one came in the mail. But it is the perfect size for traveling and the best hairspray on the market.</li>
            <li> BEST hairspray for hard to hold hair. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this helps it keep in place.</li>
