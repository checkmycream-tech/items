            <li>product is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>and we were using Neutrogena oil face wash (which worked amazingly well!)</li>
            <li>I felt like it was a bit drying on my skin, but with a good toner and moisturizer you should be good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad Neutrogena sells this product!  </li>
            <li>Now that I can&#x27;t find it in stores, I&#x27;m glad I can find it here!</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>my face felt awesome after using it the first time, and i thought it was a really nice product (again, still havent fully read the label yet).</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is effective.</li>
            <li>I own some high-end cleansers and this does not compare.</li>
            <li>I tend to have oily skin and after using this, my face feels so clean!!</li>
            <li>This cleanser has a nice smell, a good foaming texture, and a smooth after-effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It rinses off very easily with no soapy residue.</li>
            <li>and this works perfect, making my face feel clean and fresh after I use it.  </li>
            <li>As an adult now, this has been the BEST product on the market I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>The smell is very nice and it makes my face feel nice and dry (which feels great for a oily face).</li>
            <li>This is a really great cleanser and make up remover wash, in top of that, it really helps with my acne!</li>
            <li>The redness isn&#x27;t much better than the oil.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to control the oil on my face (believe me you don&#x27;t want to know how many).  </li>
            <li>This is more like an &amp;#34;Oil Control&amp;#34; face wash for people with oily skin like me.  </li>
            <li>Even if I don&#x27;t use a foundation product afterwards, my complexion appears smoother and more even afterwards.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Buying on Amazon is just better than going to Walmart and putting up with those people there.  </li>
            <li>if anything, my skin is MORE oily than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nothing I have come across works as well, including many high-priced alternatives that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I love the texture of the product</li>
            <li>Overall I am extremely happy with this product and it now has a place in my beauty regime!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to find a face wash that works better for me.</li>
            <li>and I get significantly better results.</li>
            <li>I been using Clinique for many year and my acne got match better,  after trying neutrogena for 3 months</li>
            <li>I still have some oiliness by the end of the day, but better than not using it at all.</li>
            <li>I normally love Neutrogena products but this product didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>Use it morning and night time along with a spot corrector and you will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t seem to stop more breakouts, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the results you can say in reasons because it really cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite cleanser to use in the morning</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading many reviews for oily skin, and this is a dream product.  </li>
            <li>4 years ago I moved to a more humid climate, and my skin will never forgive me.  </li>
            <li>With this, the acne and oil is much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Caused more breakouts than prevented.</li>
            <li>I have used many products before and they work ok,</li>
            <li>, Im going to buy more.</li>
            <li>Very worth the price!</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling very clean and not oily at all.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that it keeps it oil free for more than an hour though.</li>
            <li>Nice product at a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect cleanser...not too drying, but really gets the oil off; works as a wonderful makeup remover, even gentle enough for eye makeup; doesn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid, so it&#x27;s much gentler on the face.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>So , if you are in a humid-hot weather, it may not give you the 6 hours of oil free skin it says.</li>
            <li>This wash leaves my face oil free and removes the shine in my T-zone.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so so smooth immediately after I wash it.</li>
            <li>This wash makes your face feel smooth, clean, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels squeaky clean and oil free after use.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my face pretty oil free for most of the day but dries the $hizz out of my lips.</li>
            <li>My skin always feels so refreshed and clean also</li>
            <li>It Blows proactive out of the water my face does not feel clean with out it.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena rapid clear is the best product i have found in a long time, It does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>i have VERY oily skin - especially in the summer - and this product does a really good job of keeping it under control!</li>
            <li>Flaking does happen because I assume it is drying out so much that the top layers of skin is peeling off and revealing clean, unblocked skin.  </li>
            <li>Its good for people with oily skins, i use it when i go outisde and its really suny outside :)</li>
            <li>Other than that this product is great.</li>
            <li>Then, I use it again in the evening before bed and before I apply a mild acne treatment (2.5 percent Benzoyl Peroxide - Neutrogena On-the-Spot acne treatment).  </li>
            <li>and it still clears all of the oil away and washes off quickly.  </li>
            <li>i have large pores on my nose so its easy for me to get blackheads on my nose</li>
            <li>There is no weird smell , its not oily, and it doesn&#x27;t even burn!</li>
            <li>Read the label and realize i didnt even need this product in the first place!</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily, and this wash keeps my face oil free without drying it out.</li>
            <li>It removes some of the oil, but it has a funky smell and leaves your face kind of red.  </li>
            <li>Effective, and cheaper than at local pharmacies</li>
            <li>and I still think this is worth trying.  </li>
            <li>I have an oil skin, and it is really useful</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and have told everyone I know about it I am so glad I found it on Amazon because you can&#x27;t find it in stores because it works too good and last a long time.</li>
            <li>do all the right things.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for several weeks , and so far it performs good in oil control, it really useful</li>
            <li>Rapid Clear provides significantly superior oil control, plus I use a much smaller amount of product per application.  </li>
            <li>The product is also very gentle.</li>
            <li>I have very very oily skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in the store except at WalMart, so I&#x27;m really happy Amazon carries it and at a price no one else can touch.</li>
            <li>I love using this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS - You may find a better price in your local grocery store, Walgreens, or even Walmart</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my first time buying it.  </li>
            <li>but they are starting to disappear more I use this product.</li>
            <li>Now i HAVE to use this product bc of how it affected me in the first place.</li>
            <li>Some of them actually made my face feel MORE oily.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that there is no strong scent.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so clean and clear now.</li>
            <li>Ok so I read the reviews for this product and thought finally something to help my oily skin and let me say I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use an SPF moisturizer too as this will get your skin quite dry.</li>
            <li>I switched to the whole Neutrogena family for skin care products and it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>Top this with some Bezoyl-peroxide cream and your breakouts will be minimal</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years to help control my (very) oily skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very ood product and it works well.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my skin was getting really oily with the summer heat</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really foam or lather</li>
            <li>and I used it without really reading what it is</li>
            <li>I really like how you don&#x27;t need to use much of this</li>
            <li>before I get ready for the day - takes away all that night time oil and shine.</li>
            <li>, I have  really oily skin.</li>
            <li>Even without the salicylic acid, it keeps breakouts away much better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve used, including some extra-strength acne cleansers which are much harsher on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many over the years and I am extremely picky.</li>
            <li>The product is good, not as I expected because I expected too much.</li>
            <li>I had moderately normal skin, so i didnt really need an oil control face wash, but this was given to me as a gift</li>
            <li>I guess I was a decent cleanser</li>
            <li>After searching for quite some time, I finally found a product that can control mildly oily skin and help to shrink enlarged pores.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that worked on my super oily skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin, live in a dry climate,  and I haven&#x27;t found it to be a very mild face wash.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really help fade my old acne&#x27;s away</li>
            <li>This really cleared up my face and is keeping it clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal customer and will continue to buy it as long as they make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>keep in mind, this is not a face wash for people that do NOT have oily skin or are prone to having their skin dry out normally by washing their face with just a mild soap (but this is just my opinion).  </li>
            <li>However, I live in Dominican Republic where it is summer 12 months per year.</li>
            <li>If you do have breakout, this will dry it out and cause the scabs to come off quick.  </li>
            <li>This is the only facial cleanser that makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nutragena, I&#x27;m sure you try hard, but this just doesn&#x27;t do it for some of us.  </li>
            <li>not on my period at all times it seems like my face can never be completely clear.</li>
            <li>After using this cleanser moring andvnigjt for three days my face was completely clear.</li>
            <li>i will continue to use this twice a day to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had very oily skin on my face since I was a teenage.  </li>
            <li>My t-zone is very oily and this is the only product that really feels like it instantly gets it out and controls it.</li>
            <li>keeps skin soft while eliminating excess oil.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in stores lately -</li>
            <li>I tried it and was not impressed at all, my skin felt very fresh and clean after I washed it</li>
            <li>Also, remember that nothing will keep your face oil-free all day long for those of us with very oily skin our faces.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it for 2 weeks to see if my face will go back to normal.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out as much as some others.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for those conditions and has not provoked my skin further.</li>
            <li>They seem to really help with my acne and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin!</li>
            <li>It helps to keep the shine under control- unless I&#x27;m in a intense situation or outside in the heat for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>It removes the oil but does not dry my face at all.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t really make my skin less oily.  </li>
            <li>but so many people complained that their skin hurt a little that they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>You only need a little bit and it cleans my face very well</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the results you can say in reasons because it really cleans thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite cleanser to use in the morning</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading many reviews for oily skin, and this is a dream product.  </li>
            <li> 4 years ago I moved to a more humid climate, and my skin will never forgive me.  </li>
            <li> With this, the acne and oil is much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Caused more breakouts than prevented.</li>
            <li> I have used many products before and they work ok,</li>
            <li> , Im going to buy more.</li>
            <li> Very worth the price!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling very clean and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that it keeps it oil free for more than an hour though.</li>
            <li> Nice product at a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect cleanser...not too drying, but really gets the oil off; works as a wonderful makeup remover, even gentle enough for eye makeup; doesn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid, so it&#x27;s much gentler on the face.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> So , if you are in a humid-hot weather, it may not give you the 6 hours of oil free skin it says.</li>
            <li> This wash leaves my face oil free and removes the shine in my T-zone.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so so smooth immediately after I wash it.</li>
            <li> This wash makes your face feel smooth, clean, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels squeaky clean and oil free after use.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my face pretty oil free for most of the day but dries the $hizz out of my lips.</li>
            <li> My skin always feels so refreshed and clean also</li>
            <li> It Blows proactive out of the water my face does not feel clean with out it.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena rapid clear is the best product i have found in a long time, It does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> i have VERY oily skin - especially in the summer - and this product does a really good job of keeping it under control!</li>
            <li> Flaking does happen because I assume it is drying out so much that the top layers of skin is peeling off and revealing clean, unblocked skin.  </li>
            <li> Its good for people with oily skins, i use it when i go outisde and its really suny outside :)</li>
            <li> Other than that this product is great.</li>
            <li> Then, I use it again in the evening before bed and before I apply a mild acne treatment (2.5 percent Benzoyl Peroxide - Neutrogena On-the-Spot acne treatment).  </li>
            <li> and it still clears all of the oil away and washes off quickly.  </li>
            <li> i have large pores on my nose so its easy for me to get blackheads on my nose</li>
            <li> There is no weird smell , its not oily, and it doesn&#x27;t even burn!</li>
            <li> Read the label and realize i didnt even need this product in the first place!</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily, and this wash keeps my face oil free without drying it out.</li>
            <li> It removes some of the oil, but it has a funky smell and leaves your face kind of red.  </li>
            <li> Effective, and cheaper than at local pharmacies</li>
            <li> and I still think this is worth trying.  </li>
            <li> I have an oil skin, and it is really useful</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and have told everyone I know about it I am so glad I found it on Amazon because you can&#x27;t find it in stores because it works too good and last a long time.</li>
            <li> do all the right things.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for several weeks , and so far it performs good in oil control, it really useful</li>
            <li> Rapid Clear provides significantly superior oil control, plus I use a much smaller amount of product per application.  </li>
            <li> The product is also very gentle.</li>
            <li> I have very very oily skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in the store except at WalMart, so I&#x27;m really happy Amazon carries it and at a price no one else can touch.</li>
            <li> I love using this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS - You may find a better price in your local grocery store, Walgreens, or even Walmart</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first time buying it.  </li>
            <li> but they are starting to disappear more I use this product.</li>
            <li> Now i HAVE to use this product bc of how it affected me in the first place.</li>
            <li> Some of them actually made my face feel MORE oily.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that there is no strong scent.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks so clean and clear now.</li>
            <li> Ok so I read the reviews for this product and thought finally something to help my oily skin and let me say I have very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use an SPF moisturizer too as this will get your skin quite dry.</li>
            <li> I switched to the whole Neutrogena family for skin care products and it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> Top this with some Bezoyl-peroxide cream and your breakouts will be minimal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years to help control my (very) oily skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very ood product and it works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my skin was getting really oily with the summer heat</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really foam or lather</li>
            <li> and I used it without really reading what it is</li>
            <li> I really like how you don&#x27;t need to use much of this</li>
            <li> before I get ready for the day - takes away all that night time oil and shine.</li>
            <li> , I have  really oily skin.</li>
            <li> Even without the salicylic acid, it keeps breakouts away much better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve used, including some extra-strength acne cleansers which are much harsher on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many over the years and I am extremely picky.</li>
            <li> The product is good, not as I expected because I expected too much.</li>
            <li> I had moderately normal skin, so i didnt really need an oil control face wash, but this was given to me as a gift</li>
            <li> I guess I was a decent cleanser</li>
            <li> After searching for quite some time, I finally found a product that can control mildly oily skin and help to shrink enlarged pores.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that worked on my super oily skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin, live in a dry climate,  and I haven&#x27;t found it to be a very mild face wash.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really help fade my old acne&#x27;s away</li>
            <li> This really cleared up my face and is keeping it clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal customer and will continue to buy it as long as they make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> keep in mind, this is not a face wash for people that do NOT have oily skin or are prone to having their skin dry out normally by washing their face with just a mild soap (but this is just my opinion).  </li>
            <li> However, I live in Dominican Republic where it is summer 12 months per year.</li>
            <li> If you do have breakout, this will dry it out and cause the scabs to come off quick.  </li>
            <li> This is the only facial cleanser that makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nutragena, I&#x27;m sure you try hard, but this just doesn&#x27;t do it for some of us.  </li>
            <li> not on my period at all times it seems like my face can never be completely clear.</li>
            <li> After using this cleanser moring andvnigjt for three days my face was completely clear.</li>
            <li> i will continue to use this twice a day to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very oily skin on my face since I was a teenage.  </li>
            <li> My t-zone is very oily and this is the only product that really feels like it instantly gets it out and controls it.</li>
            <li> keeps skin soft while eliminating excess oil.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in stores lately -</li>
            <li> I tried it and was not impressed at all, my skin felt very fresh and clean after I washed it</li>
            <li> Also, remember that nothing will keep your face oil-free all day long for those of us with very oily skin our faces.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it for 2 weeks to see if my face will go back to normal.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out as much as some others.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough for those conditions and has not provoked my skin further.</li>
            <li> They seem to really help with my acne and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin!</li>
            <li> It helps to keep the shine under control- unless I&#x27;m in a intense situation or outside in the heat for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> It removes the oil but does not dry my face at all.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t really make my skin less oily.  </li>
            <li> but so many people complained that their skin hurt a little that they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little bit and it cleans my face very well</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and 1 bottle can last you a long time.</li>
            <li> But after a few days have passed and my face did not return to normal, so i suspected that it was bc of this.</li>
            <li> I found Rapid Clear Oil-Control when the previous product I used was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin to the point where my glasses start slipping off my face after wearing them for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have had an extremely oily nose since my teens and I have tried numerous facial washes and creams.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been searching for something that would help clear it up without being too harsh but</li>
            <li> I use it every morning, and it keeps my skin from getting too oily all day long.</li>
            <li> Been using this face wash for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive combination skin with acne scars and a few breakouts.</li>
            <li> But the next day i woke up with my face all clogged up and felt extremely oily.</li>
            <li> well, as long as you dont use it 10x a day I guess!</li>
            <li> This will dry your face out if you are not used to it but give it some time</li>
            <li> it may dry your face out</li>
            <li> I can even notice the change when the water is still on my face and I haven&#x27;t toweled dry my face yet.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really dry out skin either..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something I recommend Olay Pore Minimizing facial scrub it is swirled in a little bottle</li>
            <li> One tube now lasts me three times as long as the previous product</li>
            <li> but it helps stop the new ones that comes or stop it from getting worse.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like a lot of harsh chemicals do.</li>
            <li> and I had a few dry patches.</li>
            <li> Helps the dark acne spots to fade away.  </li>
            <li> , I had a pimple breakouts is such a common to me</li>
            <li> my face is still oily after using this for almost a month now... not worth the money...</li>
            <li> I was let down by this product.  </li>
            <li> so I tried a few other \\&quot;shine control\\&quot; cleansers and NONE of them took away the shine or oil.</li>
            <li> I have a less oily face when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an oily-skinned black girl from the Caribbean</li>
            <li> Use just a little.  </li>
            <li> And that was the ONE product that actually worked for a few hours!!!  </li>
            <li> i have a few like 1-3 blemishes when im</li>
            <li> But now i need it everyday</li>
            <li> this product just dried her skin</li>
            <li> Lowers the amount of oil that you will see on your face for quite a few hours.  </li>
            <li> my pimple easily dried off and was healed in a</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can possibly think of about this product is that it can be drying if you dont use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> His face is back to being shiny and constantly oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummed :(</li>
            <li> Really thick and greasy.  </li>
            <li> it even removes tough makeup and keeps my oily face without shine.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the shower, getting it all over my face and even behind and inside my ears.</li>
            <li> Too bad that other product wasn&#x27;t discontinued sooner.  </li>
            <li> I hope to god Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t discontinue this, or I will be so so sad.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I had to find another product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing glaringly wrong, or bad about it, but here&#x27;s how I feel:  </li>
            <li> i broke out really bad (time of the month)</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> it makes you feel refreshed though after using it. :(</li>
            <li> THAT WAS A HORRIBLE MISTAKE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love using this facial cleanser. I tend to have oily skin and after using this, my face feels so clean!!</li>
            <li> The product is good, not as I expected because I expected too much. I have a less oily face when I use it. However, I live in Dominican Republic where it is summer 12 months per year. So , if you are in a humid-hot weather, it may not give you the 6 hours of oil free skin it says.</li>
            <li> It removes some of the oil, but it has a funky smell and leaves your face kind of red.  The redness isn&#x27;t much better than the oil.</li>
            <li> excellent for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very oily skin on my face since I was a teenage.  As an adult now, this has been the BEST product on the market I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products to control the oil on my face (believe me you don&#x27;t want to know how many).  I place some in the palm of my hand and apply on my face in the shower in the morning and wash off with a washcloth / rinse off further with the shower water.  Use just a little.  You don&#x27;t need a lot (about the same amount as the toothpaste you use on your toothbrush).  Then, I use it again in the evening before bed and before I apply a mild acne treatment (2.5 percent Benzoyl Peroxide - Neutrogena On-the-Spot acne treatment).  This has managed to keep my skin looking the best overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now keep in mind, this is not a face wash for people that do NOT have oily skin or are prone to having their skin dry out normally by washing their face with just a mild soap (but this is just my opinion).  This is more like an &amp;#34;Oil Control&amp;#34; face wash for people with oily skin like me.  Also, remember that nothing will keep your face oil-free all day long for those of us with very oily skin our faces.  Oil glands in our faces are working all the time, so you may need to facial tissue to wipe off excess oil during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, live in a dry climate,  and I haven&#x27;t found it to be a very mild face wash.  However, everyone is different, so you have to experiment with what works for you.  This product definitely works for me and I&#x27;m glad Neutrogena sells this product!  I&#x27;m a loyal customer and will continue to buy it as long as they make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - You may find a better price in your local grocery store, Walgreens, or even Walmart is selling it for around $7.50 as of December 2014.  Just shop around and look on-line for the best price as I wouldn&#x27;t pay around $10 a bottle for the product unless I had too.</li>
            <li> Effective, and cheaper than at local pharmacies</li>
            <li> This wash leaves my face oil free and removes the shine in my T-zone. I have had an extremely oily nose since my teens and I have tried numerous facial washes and creams. This has been the best.  It removes the oil but does not dry my face at all.  It rinses off very easily with no soapy residue. Even if I don&#x27;t use a foundation product afterwards, my complexion appears smoother and more even afterwards.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It is the only face wash that works for me.  Now that I can&#x27;t find it in stores, I&#x27;m glad I can find it here!</li>
            <li> My skin looks so clean and clear now. I switched to the whole Neutrogena family for skin care products and it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> Best face-wash I have used.  This isn&#x27;t my first time buying it.  Buying on Amazon is just better than going to Walmart and putting up with those people there.  This will dry your face out if you are not used to it but give it some time and it will work.  Flaking does happen because I assume it is drying out so much that the top layers of skin is peeling off and revealing clean, unblocked skin.  If you do have breakout, this will dry it out and cause the scabs to come off quick.  Top this with some Bezoyl-peroxide cream and your breakouts will be minimal</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product.  I have NEVER found anything that helps my oily face, and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything.  I bought 3 bottles of this when there was a sale and I&#x27;ve used all of them.  No difference - if anything, my skin is MORE oily than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do all the right things.  I don&#x27;t overwash, I don&#x27;t constantly touch my face, and I even use dabbing wipes periodically to attempt to control the constant oiling-up.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only product that ever came close to helping me was made by Avon years ago but so many people complained that their skin hurt a little that they stopped making it.  And that was the ONE product that actually worked for a few hours!!!  I&#x27;ll take a bit of tenderness to be rid of this oil at last.  I&#x27;m almost 50 and my glands are still messing up my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nutragena, I&#x27;m sure you try hard, but this just doesn&#x27;t do it for some of us.  Please, keep trying!  There has to be SOMETHING that can be done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years to help control my (very) oily skin. Nothing I have come across works as well, including many high-priced alternatives that I&#x27;ve tried. I use it every morning, and it keeps my skin from getting too oily all day long. Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like a lot of harsh chemicals do.</li>
            <li> I hope they don&#x27;t ever stop making this. This has been great for my overly oily face.</li>
            <li> This is the only facial cleanser that makes my face feel clean. Nothing else compares to this.</li>
            <li> Very good. Works as it is suppose to. I use it daily to keep the shine off my face. It is effective.</li>
            <li> I always get Neutrogena products for my skin issues.  They seem to really help with my acne and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin!</li>
            <li> Best product that I have found!</li>
            <li> Ok so I read the reviews for this product and thought finally something to help my oily skin and let me say I have very oily skin.  I tried it and was not impressed at all, my skin felt very fresh and clean after I washed it and I love the texture of the product but it just didn&#x27;t help me with my oil problem at all.  Skin care products don&#x27;t work the same for everyone so it is just something you have to try and see if it works.  I like Neutrogena a lot and I still think this is worth trying.  If you are looking for something I recommend Olay Pore Minimizing facial scrub it is swirled in a little bottle but I found it works great with my skin type.</li>
            <li> Been using this face wash for a long time. My skin is very oily, and this wash keeps my face oil free without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling very clean and not oily at all. It&#x27;s a very ood product and it works well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t improve my acne at all. I guess I was a decent cleanser but it didn&#x27;t do anything for acne.</li>
            <li> I have an oil skin, and it is really useful</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash ever. I have tried many over the years and I am extremely picky. The performance, consistency, smell, and experience are excellent. I hope to god Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t discontinue this, or I will be so so sad.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my skin was getting really oily with the summer heat and I would look like a grease face minutes after doing my make up(EWWW!!). So I looked online for something to eliminate oil and stumbled across this. I LOVE it! The smell is very nice and it makes my face feel nice and dry (which feels great for a oily face). It helps to keep the shine under control- unless I&#x27;m in a intense situation or outside in the heat for a long period of time. Overall I am extremely happy with this product and it now has a place in my beauty regime!</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;·clears acne fast&lt;br /&gt;·doesn&#x27;t smell bad&lt;br /&gt;·good consistency&lt;br /&gt;· not oily&lt;br /&gt;·not over drying (if you use moisturizer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;·if you dont use moisturizer it may dry your face out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is absolutely amazing! i broke out really bad (time of the month) &amp; I picked this up at walmart and thought hi would give it a try. i have a few like 1-3 blemishes when im not on my period at all times it seems like my face can never be completely clear. After using this cleanser moring andvnigjt for three days my face was completely clear. i have large pores on my nose so its easy for me to get blackheads on my nose but they are starting to disappear more I use this product. The only bad thing I can possibly think of about this product is that it can be drying if you dont use a moisturizer. I went camping for 2 days and I forgot my moisturizer and I had a few dry patches.Other than that this product is great. There is no weird smell , its not oily, and it doesn&#x27;t even burn! i will continue to use this twice a day to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> I was let down by this product.  There&#x27;s nothing glaringly wrong, or bad about it, but here&#x27;s how I feel:  It doesn&#x27;t really foam or lather, it doesn&#x27;t really make my skin less oily.  The good thing is that there is no strong scent.  Overall it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims.</li>
            <li> Nice product at a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I had moderately normal skin, so i didnt really need an oil control face wash, but this was given to me as a gift and I used it without really reading what it is (i thought it was just anothr neutrogena products for acne). THAT WAS A HORRIBLE MISTAKE! my face felt awesome after using it the first time, and i thought it was a really nice product (again, still havent fully read the label yet). But the next day i woke up with my face all clogged up and felt extremely oily. My face felt disgusting. I thought it was just because of the weather, so i continue to use the product (again it work quiet well after washing) and it help cleans up my oily face. But after a few days have passed and my face did not return to normal, so i suspected that it was bc of this. Read the label and realize i didnt even need this product in the first place! But now i need it everyday bc my face is just so oily now. I stopped using it for 2 weeks to see if my face will go back to normal. It didnt and i felt disgusted. Now i HAVE to use this product bc of how it affected me in the first place. And after using it for a while, i felt my face starting to burn (like sun burn)..</li>
            <li> My husband has terribly oily skin and we were using Neutrogena oil face wash (which worked amazingly well!) but they stopped selling it, so we tried this. It does not control his oil at all ... it literally does nothing. His face is back to being shiny and constantly oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummed :(</li>
            <li> the title says it all. I&#x27;ve yet to find a face wash that works better for me. would buy again</li>
            <li> I have used it for several weeks , and so far it performs good in oil control, it really useful</li>
            <li> I found Rapid Clear Oil-Control when the previous product I used was discontinued.  Too bad that other product wasn&#x27;t discontinued sooner.  Rapid Clear provides significantly superior oil control, plus I use a much smaller amount of product per application.  One tube now lasts me three times as long as the previous product and I get significantly better results.</li>
            <li> I been using Clinique for many year and my acne got match better,  after trying neutrogena for 3 months I don&#x27;t see any diffrents,its not bad,but  I don&#x27;s see any diffrents and I tryed all neutrogena product.</li>
            <li> All of Neutrogena products are wonderful. How do you buy stock in this company?</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I really like how you don&#x27;t need to use much of this and it still clears all of the oil away and washes off quickly.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The moment you put this product in you can feel it working. My t-zone is very oily and this is the only product that really feels like it instantly gets it out and controls it. I felt like it was a bit drying on my skin, but with a good toner and moisturizer you should be good. I wouldn&#x27;t advise going for this if you have sensitive skin because it is not a gentle product at all, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I still have some oiliness by the end of the day, but better than not using it at all.</li>
            <li> After searching for quite some time, I finally found a product that can control mildly oily skin and help to shrink enlarged pores.  This wash makes your face feel smooth, clean, and refreshed.  I have used it twice a day for the last two weeks and am seeing noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin to the point where my glasses start slipping off my face after wearing them for a few hours. I use this product in the shower, getting it all over my face and even behind and inside my ears. Afterwards all the oil is gone and my skin feels great. If you have oily and shiny skin, this stuff works great for that.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It makes my skin so so smooth immediately after I wash it. I can even notice the change when the water is still on my face and I haven&#x27;t toweled dry my face yet. It reduces oil on my skin for a couple hours. The product is also very gentle. It doesn&#x27;t have a drying effect after washing. I like the smell of it. I wish there was a similar product like this that also reduces pores as well!</li>
            <li> keeps skin soft while eliminating excess oil. Almost no pimples using this the last eight years.</li>
            <li> it just what i wanted from a face cleanser. it even removes tough makeup and keeps my oily face without shine. would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The best oil control cleanser I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out as much as some others. I also use &amp;#34;Clearly natural&amp;#34; bar soap, which is excellent.</li>
            <li> I normally love Neutrogena products but this product didn&#x27;t work at all. My 12 daughter had acne and I&#x27;ve been searching for something that would help clear it up without being too harsh but this product just dried her skin and unfortunately I had to find another product.</li>
            <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used and will ever use again!</li>
            <li> Great for Oily Skin!  I&#x27;m an oily-skinned black girl from the Caribbean and I LOVE this cleanser!  Lowers the amount of oil that you will see on your face for quite a few hours.  Make sure to use an SPF moisturizer too as this will get your skin quite dry. Helps the dark acne spots to fade away.  Use it morning and night time along with a spot corrector and you will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> great product! i have VERY oily skin - especially in the summer - and this product does a really good job of keeping it under control! I can feel the difference in my skin immediately after i rinse off the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Its good for people with oily skins, i use it when i go outisde and its really suny outside :)</li>
            <li> This is the only product that worked on my super oily skin. Will continue to using this product. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a really great cleanser and make up remover wash, in top of that, it really helps with my acne! Now, I had a acne for a while now and I can&#x27;t seem to stop more breakouts, so I tried this one. I&#x27;m really happy with the results you can say in reasons because it really cleans thoroughly. My skin always feels so refreshed and clean also, I had a pimple breakouts is such a common to me that when it showed, I used this for 2 days (Day and Night regimen) my pimple easily dried off and was healed in a flash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really help fade my old acne&#x27;s away but it helps stop the new ones that comes or stop it from getting worse. Very worth the price!</li>
            <li> Always a good product - will buy from this  vendor again!</li>
            <li> Skin feels squeaky clean and oil free after use.  Doesn&#x27;t really dry out skin either.. well, as long as you dont use it 10x a day I guess! Only need a tiny amount, too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in stores lately - so I tried a few other \\&quot;shine control\\&quot; cleansers and NONE of them took away the shine or oil. Some of them actually made my face feel MORE oily. I&#x27;m so happy I came to Amazon to find this!  It&#x27;s my favorite cleanser to use in the morning before I get ready for the day - takes away all that night time oil and shine.</li>
            <li> This really cleared up my face and is keeping it clear. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it keeps it oil free for more than an hour though.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading many reviews for oily skin, and this is a dream product.  4 years ago I moved to a more humid climate, and my skin will never forgive me.  With this, the acne and oil is much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Really thick and greasy.  Caused more breakouts than prevented.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin from getting oily all day. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and 1 bottle can last you a long time. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and have told everyone I know about it I am so glad I found it on Amazon because you can&#x27;t find it in stores because it works too good and last a long time. It Blows proactive out of the water my face does not feel clean with out it.</li>
            <li> I own some high-end cleansers and this does not compare. However, as a basic cleanser, Neutrogena always gets the job done. This cleanser has a nice smell, a good foaming texture, and a smooth after-effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for 4+ years now and I have sensitive combination skin with acne scars and a few breakouts. It is gentle enough for those conditions and has not provoked my skin further.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is a perfect cleanser...not too drying, but really gets the oil off; works as a wonderful makeup remover, even gentle enough for eye makeup; doesn&#x27;t contain salicylic acid, so it&#x27;s much gentler on the face. Even without the salicylic acid, it keeps breakouts away much better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve used, including some extra-strength acne cleansers which are much harsher on my skin. It&#x27;s hard to find in the store except at WalMart, so I&#x27;m really happy Amazon carries it and at a price no one else can touch.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face pretty oil free for most of the day but dries the $hizz out of my lips.</li>
            <li> I dont know if it is my face or its just the product... my face is still oily after using this for almost a month now... not worth the money... it makes you feel refreshed though after using it. :(</li>
            <li> Neutrogena rapid clear is the best product i have found in a long time, It does a fantastic job. You only need a little bit and it cleans my face very well, I have  really oily skin. I have used many products before and they work ok, This gets the oil under control and it smells great. 5 stars for a product that does what it claims, Im very happy i found something that works to get rid of the oil and shine without drying out my skin. Great product and great price, Im going to buy more.</li>
            <li> I have very very oily skin and this works perfect, making my face feel clean and fresh after I use it.  It washes off easily and leaves no residue.</li>
