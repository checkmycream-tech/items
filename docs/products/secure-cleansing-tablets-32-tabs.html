            <li>If you are going to use the so much superior SECURE dental adhesive, a much better product then its competitors, then you must use SECURE Cleansing Tablets - given that the competitions&#x27; cleaners DO NOT affectively remove this adhesive.</li>

            <li>Glad I got a box.</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>If you use Secure denture adhesive, this is the best (maybe only!)</li>
            <li>These tablets work great for cleaning my dentures, they remove all the adhesive completely.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and recommend to any using the Secure adhesives.  </li>
            <li>Cleans well easy to use and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the only thing that takes secure adhisive off it works great .</li>
            <li>I have been trying the Secure Denture Adhesive</li>
            <li>I use the secure glue</li>
            <li>Secure is everything that the advertisement says it is.  </li>
            <li>Definately as MUST HAVE when you use SECURE ADHESIVES.  </li>
            <li>With this, since its made to remove the secure adhesive, I just apply it into my denture bath, leave it overnight</li>
            <li>This cleanser takes ALL the Secure adhesive off.</li>
            <li>I like the Secure cleansing if I am in a hurry.</li>

            <li>:B007BNPR02 Denture Cleanser 32 Tab By Secure Denture Adhesive (1 Each)]]</li>
            <li>love this stuff, i cant buy it at any stores around my area , cleans dentures very well, easy to use</li>
            <li>Cleans dentures very good because of its high alkaline content especially when using secure bonding adhesive.</li>
            <li>I tried to clean my invisalign with it, but it did not work at all..</li>
            <li>I am so happy Secure made their own Cleansing Tablets because before I found them, I was having to scrub and scrub and scrub to get the leftover adhesive off of my dentures that the Secure product leaves behind.</li>
            <li>This product was as advertised and and really have enjoyed using.</li>
            <li>I love their denture cream and strips but this not so much.</li>
            <li>Like super glue for dentures</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>This cleanser, made for Secure adhesive, really works!  </li>
            <li>But you really need to use the Secure Cleansing Tablets along with it.</li>
            <li>These tablets work really well and complement the Secure Denture Adhesive</li>
            <li>When I get up in the morning, I replace the water with warm water, and add one tablet, and let the dentures soak for about 30 minutes while I do my daily exercising.  </li>
            <li>This does just want I wanted it to do clean very well</li>
            <li>and they are clean and shining just like new!</li>
            <li>The only one to clean dentures after using Secure adhesive.</li>
            <li>but not no where near the secure paste.</li>
            <li>It is far superior to any of the other cleaners I have used.</li>
            <li>I use the Secure Denture Bonding Cream, and these tablets remove all residue left from the cream.  </li>
            <li>so I just use the whole tablet</li>
            <li>and if you put them in a soak all night ( you really don&#x27;t have to )</li>
            <li>Secure is the only cleansing tablet I can use without my mouth being irritated.</li>
            <li>These tablets are especially helpful if you use the Secure dental adhesive.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is better than any other cleansers.</li>
            <li>Was equivelant to other top brands</li>
            <li>I have tried other over the counter cleansing tablets but the don&#x27;t clean like this one since I use the Secure Denture Adhesive for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Then I rinse the dentures thoroughly with water, dry them and apply the Secure cream.  </li>
            <li>but it seems like some of the tablets are a bit less potent than others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only cleaner that completely takes off Secure Denture adhesive.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>If not used the adhesive b I lds up like a new liner.</li>
            <li>And you definitely have to scrub it real well to get the solution off</li>
            <li>no problems...there is a tiny white line but nothing permanent as it goes away with the next soaking in Secure cleansing tablets.  </li>
            <li>It is more expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li>However , I would rather soak at night to clean and not sure about the extended use on this product .</li>
            <li>I recently ordered Secure adhesive only to find that my standard cleansers did not clean all of the adhesive off my partials.  </li>

            <li> Broken tablets are mostly still usable if you&#x27;re careful when you open the individual envelopes.</li>

            <li> I soak the dentures overnight in a denture bath and plain water.  </li>
            <li> Works well but usually arrives with several of the tablets broken inside the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I think this is probably due to poor packing at the shipping point.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not help me at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been trying the Secure Denture Adhesive and it&#x27;s great stuff, But you really need to use the Secure Cleansing Tablets along with it. They are also great. I even had a small stain on the back part of my upper denture for several years, and this stuff cleaned it up. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> Useless, the adhesive does not stick to my gums, but it did to my dentures (which I was told would not damage the soft line I had). When I tried the cleaning tabs (1) it wouldn&#x27;t even dissolve and my lining was damaged.​</li>
            <li> Before I ordered SECURE cleansing tablets I had to work hard to remove the residue from my dentures, now all I do is drop in a tablet, no more scrubbing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  I use the Secure Denture Bonding Cream, and these tablets remove all residue left from the cream.  Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried does that.  I brush my dentures at night before going to bed, using a denture brush and an anti-bacterial foaming hand soap (a process recommended by my dentist).  I soak the dentures overnight in a denture bath and plain water.  When I get up in the morning, I replace the water with warm water, and add one tablet, and let the dentures soak for about 30 minutes while I do my daily exercising.  Then I rinse the dentures thoroughly with water, dry them and apply the Secure cream.  I&#x27;m good for all day.</li>
            <li> cleans nicely.It says use half a tablet but I can&#x27;t break it into without the other half crumbling even though it is scored so I just use the whole tablet</li>
            <li> I use the secure glue and it&#x27;s the only product that removes that glue.  Definitely follow the web-site advice of soaking for 30-40 minutes (especially if you have built up glue on them).  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered Secure adhesive only to find that my standard cleansers did not clean all of the adhesive off my partials.  This cleanser, made for Secure adhesive, really works!  It is more expensive but worth it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product I have used.  Secure is everything that the advertisement says it is.  You will not be disappointed in trying this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, bought extra to share with Family.</li>
            <li> good product, good service.</li>
            <li> Definately as MUST HAVE when you use SECURE ADHESIVES.  Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the only thing that takes secure adhisive off it works great . you don&#x27;t taste a after taste when you use it and if you put them in a soak all night ( you really don&#x27;t have to ) they co.e out sparkling and I&#x27;m a smoker and a coffee / soda drinker in glad I found it .</li>
            <li> Like super glue for dentures</li>
            <li> I am so happy Secure made their own Cleansing Tablets because before I found them, I was having to scrub and scrub and scrub to get the leftover adhesive off of my dentures that the Secure product leaves behind. With this, since its made to remove the secure adhesive, I just apply it into my denture bath, leave it overnight and when I wake up in the morning I rinse them off, give my teeth a brush and they are clean and shining just like new! Amazing!</li>
            <li> If you are going to use the so much superior SECURE dental adhesive, a much better product then its competitors, then you must use SECURE Cleansing Tablets - given that the competitions&#x27; cleaners DO NOT affectively remove this adhesive.</li>
            <li> Secure is the only cleansing tablet I can use without my mouth being irritated. Shipped on time</li>

            <li> These tablets work great for cleaning my dentures, they remove all the adhesive completely.</li>
            <li> No better than other denture cleaners!</li>
            <li> Cleans well..they do not recomend to process more than 7 min.because of sulfates.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not help me at all. I tried to clean my invisalign with it, but it did not work at all..</li>
            <li> Works well but usually arrives with several of the tablets broken inside the packaging.  I think this is probably due to poor packing at the shipping point.  I would buy it locally if I could find it.  Broken tablets are mostly still usable if you&#x27;re careful when you open the individual envelopes.</li>
            <li> My order came in a timely manner. This cleanser takes ALL the Secure adhesive off. Wonderful product. Won&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> Cleans dentures very good because of its high alkaline content especially when using secure bonding adhesive. Cleans your denture in as litte as five minutes, but I let my soak overnight. All residue are gone.</li>
            <li> Great cleaner.  Gets off all the residue except Cushion Grip</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is better than any other cleansers. It works very good, but so do others.</li>
            <li> I like the Secure cleansing if I am in a hurry. However , I would rather soak at night to clean and not sure about the extended use on this product .</li>
            <li> Cleans well easy to use and will continue to use this product. would recomend to others. should be sold in stores</li>

            <li> They do the job. No build up of adhesive at all.</li>

            <li> Am satisfied with product</li>
            <li> This item was advertised as a 4 count. They shipped only one. They have refused to ship the balance of the order. Their customer service cannot spell correctly, use the proper nouns nor write a grammatically correct sentence.[[ASIN:B007BNPR02 Denture Cleanser 32 Tab By Secure Denture Adhesive (1 Each)]]</li>
            <li> This product was as advertised and and really have enjoyed using. I will continue to purchase this in the future. Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> If you use Secure denture adhesive, this is the best (maybe only!) cleansing tablet that will get them sparkly clean!!!</li>
            <li> This cleanser does not clean the Denture Cream off as well as products from the store.  I don&#x27;t think I will use this again..</li>
            <li> love this stuff, i cant buy it at any stores around my area , cleans dentures very well, easy to use</li>
            <li> I love their denture cream and strips but this not so much.</li>
            <li> Good product; I used it in conjunction with the denture adhesive and it did indeed clean off all the leftover adhesive.  However, the adhesive does not last 12 hours; the lower dentures ALWAYS lose their grip by midafternoon.  S A Little</li>
            <li> works great for cleaning auto parts as well. I only buy this brand and never have issues with my partial.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and recommend to any using the Secure adhesives.  I&#x27;m using once per week and no problems...there is a tiny white line but nothing permanent as it goes away with the next soaking in Secure cleansing tablets.  Effervescent, etc works great but this just does a thorough job.  Glad I got a box. Don&#x27;t use on softliners though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only cleaner that completely takes off Secure Denture adhesive.</li>
            <li> five stars speak for themselves</li>
            <li> Same as any store brand. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> These tablets work really well and complement the Secure Denture Adhesive</li>
            <li> It was okay but not no where near the secure paste.</li>
            <li> These tablets are especially helpful if you use the Secure dental adhesive.  This stuff BLASTS the gunk off!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Cleans dentures real good</li>
            <li> Very good cleansing solution.  I soak my partials overnight and get a very good cleaning</li>
