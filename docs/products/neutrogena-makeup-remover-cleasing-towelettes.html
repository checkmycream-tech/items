            <li>it smells nice.</li>
            <li>the makeup nicely too...</li>
            <li>You have to get this if you don&#x27;t own some.</li>
            <li>Works fairly well for getting that top layer of makeup off.</li>
            <li>and she saw this handy case and the rest is icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>But for the amount of wipes you receive it is kind of a rip off.</li>
            <li>it is great for after the face washing to clean up the eye area.</li>
            <li>this product was great, it is exactly the product I was looking for for the price I was looking for..</li>
            <li>Tonight I was wearing bright eyeshadow, waterproof eyeliner, mascara, lipstain, and full face makeup.</li>
            <li>They have a very light refreshing fragrance as well.  </li>
            <li>and I like them more.</li>
            <li>I feel as if they remove more make-up.</li>
            <li>I love these makeup remover towelettes.</li>
            <li>Love how well this removes make up</li>
            <li>I use many of this brand of products</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>, I wish they came out more like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for more than a week with no drying out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Decided once they ran out to not be cheap and try Neutrogena, and what a difference!</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I do use more than one at a time but you could do it all with one if you chose.  </li>
            <li>more becuase</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t leave a residue, but I like the smell of these better.</li>
            <li>great product, gentle on the skin, I wish it was on the subscription and save program.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like so many do.</li>
            <li>I love these towelettes.  </li>
            <li>They are great for thorough and gentle make up removal.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size towelette and does the job with the first swipe.</li>
            <li>the wipes themselves seem to be pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I absolutely love the cheap makeup remover wipes that come from the Dollar Tree and find that I can remove my makeup with 1-2 wipes of those wipes.</li>
            <li>Even easily removes eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>This towelette removes all my makeup easily.</li>
            <li>I wear a decent amount of makeup, including bright eyeshadows that tend to stain (think Sugarpill and Inglot) and I favor waterproof eyeliner and mascara</li>
            <li>In addition, these wipes are amazing and certainly gets the job done.</li>
            <li>this produce does the job, cleans my makeup and is smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using it primarily for makeup application, wiping my cheeks of eye shadow fall out before I apply foundation.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>They have a light, unoffensive smell, they don&#x27;t sting the eyes or irritate my skin, and they did what they were meant to do.</li>
            <li>The actual pads work great though</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I love this product when I first purchased from Costco, they worked so well.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I fell in love.</li>
            <li>face feels clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>They leave my face feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and refreshed after using these.</li>
            <li>They are just the right size to use on both eyes to remove mascare, and eye shadow easily.</li>
            <li>Love this towelettes, they really do remove makeup and waterproof mascara, would recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li>These are great at getting off your makeup, but I apparently have more sensitive facial skin than most people because they ended up drying out my face.</li>
            <li>Very gentle yet does clean face thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin so the fact that no harsh alcohols are used in this product is incredibly</li>
            <li>i love how easily it takes off my makeup, especially eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient for light makeup.</li>
            <li>Tried others , this was the only effective one</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Wake up with a fresh face</li>
            <li>I cleans off the make up and leaves your face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I wish it wasnt as pricey, but for what it does, I guess its worth it.</li>
            <li>I was able to completely remove it all with 1 wipe, though 2 wipes would have probably made the job easier.</li>
            <li>The towelettes are moist, not soaked, and smell great, but not strong.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong but nice.</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t use this product daily or replace my normal cleansing routine with it, but when I can&#x27;t wash my face or need to quickly take off my makeup, these work good.</li>
            <li>So soft and could get the makeup out so easily.</li>
            <li>Removes all products easily while being sensitive to your skin.  </li>
            <li>They are very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very gentle on the skin and doesn&#x27;t cause a break out.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brand because I liked the container and thought that the towelettes would stay moist if they were in a closed container.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and plan to buy this brand again.  </li>
            <li>Basically, the container is nothing more than a blue plastic box that matches the packaging of the wipes.</li>
            <li>It was too the point i would have to remove the first 2 or 3 pads to get one that was moist.</li>
            <li>and I can deal with using cotton balls ;)</li>
            <li>its kinda funny and wasnt really intentional</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking that I wouldn&#x27;t have ONE that stayed dry on top.</li>
            <li>I love these makeup remover wipes because it seems to effortlessly wife off your makeup without the alcohol smell and making your skin dry.</li>
            <li>though a little bit pricey to buy online, i liked the convenience of not having to go out to the store.  </li>
            <li>They get the makeup right off, no need for scrubbing my face off... and they leave my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>Really takes off all makeup with one toilette.</li>
            <li>This is a real breakthrough for me.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really remove the make-up very well.</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin feels very moisturized after using it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re gentle and work well.</li>
            <li>and it was really</li>
            <li>Also, I really like the box that you get with this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the feel of the chemicals on my skin</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t get eyeliner off very well</li>
            <li>Afirma que é muito bom e funciona legal.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me then look for a different product or make sure to moisturize really well afterward.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Simple brand Sensitive cloths and these are much better at getting my makeup off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just recently discovered these and have been using them when I get off-stage to quickly and easily remove my theatrical make up.</li>
            <li>Way better than other wipes.</li>
            <li>They wipe away all traces of makeup and oil (but work a little less effectively on waterproof mascara even though they claim to remove it)  leaving my face feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>very gentle for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Since these cost more than I&#x27;m used to I wanted to see if it would take less to do the job.</li>
            <li>I opened my older package and stuck it in.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li>another reviewer mentioned, the package says that you DON&#x27;T have to wash your face after using these (which makes me a little uneasy having acne prone skin) but I&#x27;m going to continue this for 1-2 weeks on their own and will update if there&#x27;s any major change in my skin.</li>
            <li>complete job of cleansing my whole face.</li>
            <li>It also works really well for the removal of eye makeup, which I have not found to be true with other makeup removing cloths.  </li>
            <li>After rinsing with cool water to sooth the burning/stinging, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with my Clinique eye make-up remover (it doesn&#x27;t sting even when I have dry skin).</li>
            <li>I wet with extra water if I have more eye make up.</li>
            <li>First Impressions, will update upon further use:&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>These seemed to be pretty standard face wash pads to me and did their job when I got them.</li>
            <li>I usually buy it in super market, and it&#x27;s my first time to buy it online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to store old makeup clothes and they won&#x27;t dry out as fast.</li>
            <li>Cheaper also compare to the cost of other makeup remover, it&#x27;s worthy to have one</li>
            <li>my fingers were covered, and scrubbing with hot soapy water several times did a whole lot of nothing, but i picked up one of these to clean my face for the night to discover the color was coming off on it, so a few wipes later and my hands were spotless.  </li>
            <li>There is so much space left over, I would never take this camping</li>
            <li>The opposite actually: very nourishing.</li>
            <li>So refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t remove make up very well, especially mascara.  </li>
            <li>However, this towelette does completely remove the oily residue.  </li>
            <li>This container is available in the drugstores for about $10 or so, with the refills a few dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li>Good product but too expensive.</li>
            <li>The towelettes are quite thick and feel more like cloth (maybe they are, who knows?).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use makeup but do use a moisturizer and needed something to help clean pores everyday after showering.</li>
            <li>greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The sheets are pretty big, so when I only have eyeliner on, I can cut them into fourths</li>
            <li>I will say that you can buy this a lot cheaper at places such as Wal Mart and Target, but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the same thing you will have in a normal store.</li>
            <li>have recently tried Walgreens generic brand of makeup remover (the studio 35 brand), and it was a huge let down.</li>
            <li>And I found it on Amazon with free shipping and just a little more expensive than Costco</li>
            <li>I recommend them highly especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is, but I saw it in the store for half the price.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier than any other method.</li>
            <li>These gently take it right off without having to rub your eyes very hard.</li>
            <li>They leave my skin feeling soft not greasy and I only use these I don&#x27;t wash my face because that irritates my rosacea further.  </li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s true, these will be a staple item I keep next to my bed for lazy nights</li>
            <li>I use the blue hrd cover box for other trinkets, and I really like that.</li>
            <li>it does a thorough job and once dry my face feels soft.</li>
            <li>But $11 every 25 days is a little much.</li>
            <li>I use half a towel per use, so they last a pretty long time!</li>

            <li> This towelette removes all my makeup easily.</li>
            <li> I wear a decent amount of makeup, including bright eyeshadows that tend to stain (think Sugarpill and Inglot) and I favor waterproof eyeliner and mascara</li>
            <li> In addition, these wipes are amazing and certainly gets the job done.</li>
            <li> this produce does the job, cleans my makeup and is smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using it primarily for makeup application, wiping my cheeks of eye shadow fall out before I apply foundation.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> They have a light, unoffensive smell, they don&#x27;t sting the eyes or irritate my skin, and they did what they were meant to do.</li>
            <li> The actual pads work great though</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I love this product when I first purchased from Costco, they worked so well.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I fell in love.</li>
            <li> face feels clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> They leave my face feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and refreshed after using these.</li>
            <li> They are just the right size to use on both eyes to remove mascare, and eye shadow easily.</li>
            <li> Love this towelettes, they really do remove makeup and waterproof mascara, would recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> These are great at getting off your makeup, but I apparently have more sensitive facial skin than most people because they ended up drying out my face.</li>
            <li> Very gentle yet does clean face thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so the fact that no harsh alcohols are used in this product is incredibly</li>
            <li> i love how easily it takes off my makeup, especially eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient for light makeup.</li>
            <li> Tried others , this was the only effective one</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Wake up with a fresh face</li>
            <li> I cleans off the make up and leaves your face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasnt as pricey, but for what it does, I guess its worth it.</li>
            <li> I was able to completely remove it all with 1 wipe, though 2 wipes would have probably made the job easier.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are moist, not soaked, and smell great, but not strong.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but nice.</li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t use this product daily or replace my normal cleansing routine with it, but when I can&#x27;t wash my face or need to quickly take off my makeup, these work good.</li>
            <li> So soft and could get the makeup out so easily.</li>
            <li> Removes all products easily while being sensitive to your skin.  </li>
            <li> They are very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very gentle on the skin and doesn&#x27;t cause a break out.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brand because I liked the container and thought that the towelettes would stay moist if they were in a closed container.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and plan to buy this brand again.  </li>
            <li> Basically, the container is nothing more than a blue plastic box that matches the packaging of the wipes.</li>
            <li> It was too the point i would have to remove the first 2 or 3 pads to get one that was moist.</li>
            <li> and I can deal with using cotton balls ;)</li>
            <li> its kinda funny and wasnt really intentional</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that I wouldn&#x27;t have ONE that stayed dry on top.</li>
            <li> I love these makeup remover wipes because it seems to effortlessly wife off your makeup without the alcohol smell and making your skin dry.</li>
            <li> though a little bit pricey to buy online, i liked the convenience of not having to go out to the store.  </li>
            <li> They get the makeup right off, no need for scrubbing my face off... and they leave my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Really takes off all makeup with one toilette.</li>
            <li> This is a real breakthrough for me.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really remove the make-up very well.</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin feels very moisturized after using it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re gentle and work well.</li>
            <li> and it was really</li>
            <li> Also, I really like the box that you get with this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the feel of the chemicals on my skin</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t get eyeliner off very well</li>
            <li> Afirma que é muito bom e funciona legal.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me then look for a different product or make sure to moisturize really well afterward.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Simple brand Sensitive cloths and these are much better at getting my makeup off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently discovered these and have been using them when I get off-stage to quickly and easily remove my theatrical make up.</li>
            <li> Way better than other wipes.</li>
            <li> They wipe away all traces of makeup and oil (but work a little less effectively on waterproof mascara even though they claim to remove it)  leaving my face feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li> very gentle for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Since these cost more than I&#x27;m used to I wanted to see if it would take less to do the job.</li>
            <li> I opened my older package and stuck it in.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> another reviewer mentioned, the package says that you DON&#x27;T have to wash your face after using these (which makes me a little uneasy having acne prone skin) but I&#x27;m going to continue this for 1-2 weeks on their own and will update if there&#x27;s any major change in my skin.</li>
            <li> complete job of cleansing my whole face.</li>
            <li> It also works really well for the removal of eye makeup, which I have not found to be true with other makeup removing cloths.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing with cool water to sooth the burning/stinging, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with my Clinique eye make-up remover (it doesn&#x27;t sting even when I have dry skin).</li>
            <li> I wet with extra water if I have more eye make up.</li>
            <li> First Impressions, will update upon further use:&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> These seemed to be pretty standard face wash pads to me and did their job when I got them.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it in super market, and it&#x27;s my first time to buy it online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to store old makeup clothes and they won&#x27;t dry out as fast.</li>
            <li> Cheaper also compare to the cost of other makeup remover, it&#x27;s worthy to have one</li>
            <li> my fingers were covered, and scrubbing with hot soapy water several times did a whole lot of nothing, but i picked up one of these to clean my face for the night to discover the color was coming off on it, so a few wipes later and my hands were spotless.  </li>
            <li> There is so much space left over, I would never take this camping</li>
            <li> The opposite actually: very nourishing.</li>
            <li> So refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t remove make up very well, especially mascara.  </li>
            <li> However, this towelette does completely remove the oily residue.  </li>
            <li> This container is available in the drugstores for about $10 or so, with the refills a few dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> Good product but too expensive.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are quite thick and feel more like cloth (maybe they are, who knows?).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use makeup but do use a moisturizer and needed something to help clean pores everyday after showering.</li>
            <li> greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The sheets are pretty big, so when I only have eyeliner on, I can cut them into fourths</li>
            <li> I will say that you can buy this a lot cheaper at places such as Wal Mart and Target, but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the same thing you will have in a normal store.</li>
            <li> have recently tried Walgreens generic brand of makeup remover (the studio 35 brand), and it was a huge let down.</li>
            <li> And I found it on Amazon with free shipping and just a little more expensive than Costco</li>
            <li> I recommend them highly especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is, but I saw it in the store for half the price.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier than any other method.</li>
            <li> These gently take it right off without having to rub your eyes very hard.</li>
            <li> They leave my skin feeling soft not greasy and I only use these I don&#x27;t wash my face because that irritates my rosacea further.  </li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s true, these will be a staple item I keep next to my bed for lazy nights</li>
            <li> I use the blue hrd cover box for other trinkets, and I really like that.</li>
            <li> it does a thorough job and once dry my face feels soft.</li>
            <li> But $11 every 25 days is a little much.</li>
            <li> I use half a towel per use, so they last a pretty long time!</li>
            <li> I use it to remove all makeup, works wonder on mascara, then I clean my face as usual as this does leave a little film on your face.</li>
            <li> This is a lazy way of cleansing and I should go through the entire routine of washing my face, and using toner, but truthfully, I&#x27;m too tired at night to do it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and it does not leave my face feeling like a grease pit either.  </li>
            <li> These remover towelettes don&#x27;t dry my face out either.</li>
            <li> I did have some dry skin around my eyes at the time as well.</li>
            <li> I got these at the same time I got a different brand and these out performed the other brand hands down.</li>
            <li> I have to be so rough with my eyes to get the make up off</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would hate these, but I kind of do.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your face oily as a lot of the other ones do.</li>
            <li> I guess I will buy from Costco next time instead of being lazy and order from Amazon....</li>
            <li> Will let other people know about it.</li>
            <li> and because I have to be quite rough with the towelette in order to remove them, I choose to use a little cleansing oil instead.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about these is that they leave an oily residue on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Has never caused irritations or breakouts - if the smell was toned down just a smidge</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally like the inner packaging, its a little difficult to get them out and separate them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too tired at night to wash my face the regular way</li>
            <li> This package was totally dried out</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long lasting qualities, but that stuff is almost impossible to scrub off.</li>
            <li> Usually I have a hard time removing waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why the cloth is so hard on my skin</li>
            <li> No more eye pain!</li>
            <li> Because of this, I felt a little guilty spending $11 on face wipes and a container</li>
            <li> I have tough to remove eyeshadow and eyeliner</li>
            <li> It gets rid of what my oil-free eye makeup remover leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin around my eyes, and when I used this it stung my eyelids like crazy!!!</li>
            <li> Unless they change the formula for the worst ill be using this product until I&#x27;m too old to care about make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too tired to get up and scrub my face into cleanliness in the bathroom!hroom!</li>
            <li> I used cold cream, soap, mineral oil  -</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s bad for the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This makeup remover smells very strongly of unpleasant chemicals that gives you the feeling of a rash just by smelling it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> But, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I could use a Ziploc container for that, so I am disappointed in that</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really takes off all makeup with one toilette. I wear liquid eyeliner and no problem. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  I don&#x27;t use makeup but do use a moisturizer and needed something to help clean pores everyday after showering.</li>
            <li> Love this towelettes, they really do remove makeup and waterproof mascara, would recommend and will buy again. Tried others , this was the only effective one</li>
            <li> I used cold cream, soap, mineral oil  - nothing comes close to this.  I have to wear makeup every day for my job - with waterproof mascara - this product is truly exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth every penny.  I no longer fight remaining mascara all night - flaking off onto my face and in my eyes.  This is a real breakthrough for me.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and it does not leave my face feeling like a grease pit either.  A+ for me, I will be a customer for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used. Even easily removes eyelash glue. Unless they change the formula for the worst ill be using this product until I&#x27;m too old to care about make up.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that I wouldn&#x27;t have ONE that stayed dry on top. I was so excited to get it! It came with a sealed package of wipes. I opened my older package and stuck it in. There is so much space left over, I would never take this camping the liquid comes out of the container. :-\ I don&#x27;t know, I think I am gonna use it but... Meh</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. It&#x27;s a good size towelette and does the job with the first swipe. I like the fact it is refillable. It does not leave your face oily as a lot of the other ones do. I will say that you can buy this a lot cheaper at places such as Wal Mart and Target, but I highly recommend it. I bought it for my daughter and she raved about it so I bought one for myself and I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is always a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and I feel they are the best makeup remover out there. Works for eye makeup and has never irritated my skin or eyes. The opposite actually: very nourishing. I use half a towel per use, so they last a pretty long time!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would hate these, but I kind of do. They don&#x27;t really remove the make-up very well. However, I do like the fact that I don&#x27;t feel like I need to rinse of wash my face after using one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the container they come in, though. I used the almay make-up remover towelettes before I bought these and I like them more. I feel as if they remove more make-up.</li>
            <li> Gotta love Neutrogena! :) I got those at a very good price! The com inside this box in an additional wrapper, so you can get each towelette and still have it sealed.&lt;br /&gt;To me this produce does the job, cleans my makeup and is smooth.</li>
            <li> I love these makeup remover wipes because it seems to effortlessly wife off your makeup without the alcohol smell and making your skin dry. In fact, my skin feels very moisturized after using it. I have dry skin so the fact that no harsh alcohols are used in this product is incredibly refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I would wipe and wipe and wipe and wipe and it just won&#x27;t all come off.  I finally gave up trying.&lt;br /&gt;On a good note it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love this product when I first purchased from Costco, they worked so well. So soft and could get the makeup out so easily. And I found it on Amazon with free shipping and just a little more expensive than Costco and I just decided to try. But, I was disappointed. Don&#x27;t know why the cloth is so hard on my skin and it did not&lt;br /&gt;remove the makeup nicely too... I guess I will buy from Costco next time instead of being lazy and order from Amazon....</li>
            <li> I love these makeup remover towelettes. My face feels cleaner and softer than with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like Neutrogena products?  The towelettes are moist, not soaked, and smell great, but not strong.  They do a good job getting makeup off, including mascara.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it is a good name and it was a good price.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was using another brand of eye makeup pad cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;They did the job, but left my skin to greasy. When I switched&lt;br /&gt;to the Neutrogena Cleansing Towelettes, I found them to do&lt;br /&gt;a complete job of cleansing my whole face. My skin was not&lt;br /&gt;left greasy.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for another great Neutrogena product.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Elinor Johnston</li>
            <li> These are the only ones I&#x27;ve used that dont make my face feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The sheets are pretty big, so when I only have eyeliner on, I can cut them into fourths and they last forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The refils come in a sticky open pouch, so I use the blue hrd cover box for other trinkets, and I really like that.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it in super market, and it&#x27;s my first time to buy it online. It&#x27;s just the same thing you will have in a normal store. Very convenient for light makeup.</li>
            <li> Love how well this removes make up AND how my skin feels after.  So refreshed and soft. Will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Yes great product. My daughter loves it. Will let other people know about it. great price and great container keeps moisted</li>
            <li> Very gentle yet does clean face thoroughly. I wet with extra water if I have more eye make up. I use many of this brand of products</li>
            <li> I have used the designer priced cloths for a while.  I picked these up here on Amazon as an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34;.  I am hooked!  They leave my face feeling clean.  I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> These work so well, and they aren&#x27;t greasy which is awesome!! They are just the right size to use on both eyes to remove mascare, and eye shadow easily.</li>
            <li> Way better than other wipes. I got these at the same time I got a different brand and these out performed the other brand hands down. They&#x27;re gentle and work well.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t remove make up very well, especially mascara.  I have to be so rough with my eyes to get the make up off that I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s bad for the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love these. They get the makeup right off, no need for scrubbing my face off... and they leave my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> this product was great, it is exactly the product I was looking for for the price I was looking for..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is particular to the package I received, but I found the towelettes to be relatively dry -- so they felt rough on my skin. Also, I thought the plastic container was a dispenser but it is literally just a box that holds the wipes package. I suppose that&#x27;s still helpful, and I shouldn&#x27;t have assumed, but I bought this product because I wanted a dispenser. I will be sticking to Garnier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for gel make up also. Cheaper also compare to the cost of other makeup remover, it&#x27;s worthy to have one</li>
            <li> these are tested on animals!  that&#x27;s a deal-breaker for me; there are other good wipes out there that are cruelty-free</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for some time.  It is really wonderful taking off make-up.  I can&#x27;t go a day without it.</li>
            <li> Removes all my makeup. Wake up with a fresh face</li>
            <li> Great product.  The cleansing cloths are wonderful make up removers.  I recommend them highly especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Even happier that it comes with the case to help keep them moist.</li>
            <li> The makeup remover wipes work as described.  I am impressed how it even takes off mascara.  I don&#x27;t personally like the inner packaging, its a little difficult to get them out and separate them, I wish they came out more like a kleenex does.  I also don&#x27;t care for how my face feels after I use them.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but its doesn&#x27;t have the dame freshness that it would if I had washed my face with an actual cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that the towelettes do take off makeup.  I certainly wouldn&#x27;t use this product daily or replace my normal cleansing routine with it, but when I can&#x27;t wash my face or need to quickly take off my makeup, these work good.</li>
            <li> Good product but too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I use now to remove my eye make-up. These gently take it right off without having to rub your eyes very hard.</li>
            <li> love these! very gentle for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I cannot go a day without using this product. it is great for after the face washing to clean up the eye area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the bottled eye makeup remover up to this point; was reluctant to try wipes thinking they would not work as well.  I&#x27;m happy to say, they work every bit as good as the liquid eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I fell in love. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it removed my makeup. At times I don&#x27;t wash my face after using these wipes and no breakout the next day ( this is what sealed the deal for me). You have to get this if you don&#x27;t own some.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean777</li>
            <li> These are great. they work on foundation and eye makeup equally well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too tired at night to wash my face the regular way so these towelettes are a godsend.  They wipe away all traces of makeup and oil (but work a little less effectively on waterproof mascara even though they claim to remove it)  leaving my face feeling very clean.  They have a very light refreshing fragrance as well.  I wear waterproof mascara, eyebrow pencil and eyeliner and because I have to be quite rough with the towelette in order to remove them, I choose to use a little cleansing oil instead.  However, this towelette does completely remove the oily residue.  This is a lazy way of cleansing and I should go through the entire routine of washing my face, and using toner, but truthfully, I&#x27;m too tired at night to do it.  This is the perfect alternative.  I bought this brand because I liked the container and thought that the towelettes would stay moist if they were in a closed container.  So far so good.  I&#x27;ve used them for more than a week with no drying out.  The towelettes are quite thick and feel more like cloth (maybe they are, who knows?).  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and plan to buy this brand again.  This container is available in the drugstores for about $10 or so, with the refills a few dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently tried Walgreens generic brand of makeup remover (the studio 35 brand), and it was a huge let down. The studio 35 worked well, but left my eyes stinging and it was really unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided once they ran out to not be cheap and try Neutrogena, and what a difference! No more eye pain! Also, I really like the box that you get with this. It&#x27;s much easier to store old makeup clothes and they won&#x27;t dry out as fast.</li>
            <li> Works fairly well for getting that top layer of makeup off. This doesn&#x27;t quite get all of my eye liner off and I still find myself using eye makeup remover for that area. I don&#x27;t really like the feel of the chemicals on my skin but it&#x27;s meant to be used just before a proper face wash anyway, so it&#x27;s not that bad. I&#x27;ve started using it primarily for makeup application, wiping my cheeks of eye shadow fall out before I apply foundation. Works great for that!</li>
            <li> The product came on time and in great condition. In addition, these wipes are amazing and certainly gets the job done. I cleans off the make up and leaves your face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> This makeup remover smells very strongly of unpleasant chemicals that gives you the feeling of a rash just by smelling it. It also doesn&#x27;t get eyeliner off very well and you have to scrub which obviously irritates and reddens your skin. If you get it in your eye it doesn&#x27;t sting, so that&#x27;s good. Also, the box can be reused. Allover, 3 stars!</li>
            <li> though a little bit pricey to buy online, i liked the convenience of not having to go out to the store.  i love how easily it takes off my makeup, especially eye makeup.  it does a thorough job and once dry my face feels soft. its kinda funny and wasnt really intentional but i had learned that these also take spra ypaint off of my hands too.  my fingers were covered, and scrubbing with hot soapy water several times did a whole lot of nothing, but i picked up one of these to clean my face for the night to discover the color was coming off on it, so a few wipes later and my hands were spotless.  these are awesome!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these.  However, over priced.  Get them at Sam&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Removes all products easily while being sensitive to your skin.  I highly recommend these cleansing wipes.</li>
            <li> I like that these don&#x27;t leave an oily residue on my face. My skin feels clean and refreshed after using these.</li>
            <li> Quem pediu usa para retirar a maquiagem. Afirma que é muito bom e funciona legal. Facilita bem o processo. Diz que vale a pena.</li>
            <li> I have tough to remove eyeshadow and eyeliner but it&#x27;s never a challenge with these cloths.  I have been using them for over a year and they do not cause my face to feel overly oily nor do I break out.  I used to use the Simple brand Sensitive cloths and these are much better at getting my makeup off.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have used only about 3 different types of makeup remover cloths and I prefer these because they don&#x27;t irritate my skin and I have rosacea. They also remove eye makeup.  I do use more than one at a time but you could do it all with one if you chose.  They leave my skin feeling soft not greasy and I only use these I don&#x27;t wash my face because that irritates my rosacea further.  Love &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> Wife has been using Neutrogena products for quite awhile. She began using the Makeup Remover Towelettes acouple of years ago and she saw this handy case and the rest is icing on the cake. She likes it.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about these is that they leave an oily residue on the skin.  They work though, and haven&#x27;t caused a breakout or anything.  I like the grapefruit wipes more becuase they don&#x27;t leave a residue, but I like the smell of these better.</li>
            <li> This towelette removes all my makeup easily. Usually I have a hard time removing waterproof mascara. This product takes it off with ease without stinging my eyes. Light scent is very pleasant. I wish it wasnt as pricey, but for what it does, I guess its worth it.</li>
            <li> First Impressions, will update upon further use:&lt;br /&gt;So I wear a decent amount of makeup, including bright eyeshadows that tend to stain (think Sugarpill and Inglot) and I favor waterproof eyeliner and mascara for it&#x27;s long lasting qualities, but that stuff is almost impossible to scrub off. Honestly, I absolutely love the cheap makeup remover wipes that come from the Dollar Tree and find that I can remove my makeup with 1-2 wipes of those wipes. Because of this, I felt a little guilty spending $11 on face wipes and a container (I know they sell them without the container, but the holder keeps them moist longer). Now, I thought the holder would be one of those kinds that have a pop-top where you can pull the wipes through it like similar brands do, but these aren&#x27;t like that. Basically, the container is nothing more than a blue plastic box that matches the packaging of the wipes. I could use a Ziploc container for that, so I am disappointed in that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the wipes themselves seem to be pretty good. Tonight I was wearing bright eyeshadow, waterproof eyeliner, mascara, lipstain, and full face makeup. I was able to completely remove it all with 1 wipe, though 2 wipes would have probably made the job easier. Since these cost more than I&#x27;m used to I wanted to see if it would take less to do the job. It does. They have a light, unoffensive smell, they don&#x27;t sting the eyes or irritate my skin, and they did what they were meant to do. Granted it was a bit trickier to get all the mascara off than I ad hoped, but it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer mentioned, the package says that you DON&#x27;T have to wash your face after using these (which makes me a little uneasy having acne prone skin) but I&#x27;m going to continue this for 1-2 weeks on their own and will update if there&#x27;s any major change in my skin. If that&#x27;s true, these will be a staple item I keep next to my bed for lazy nights were I&#x27;m too tired to get up and scrub my face into cleanliness in the bathroom!hroom!</li>
            <li> These seemed to be pretty standard face wash pads to me and did their job when I got them. I kept them inside the blue plastic box they came in but they kept drying out in there. It was too the point i would have to remove the first 2 or 3 pads to get one that was moist. Was hoping to keep the box to store future washing pads but it has since proved unreliable to me. The actual pads work great though</li>
            <li> Great product…fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product and I am pleased with it. My skins feels refreshed after using the towelette and I don&#x27;t break out with a rash from it.</li>
            <li> But for the amount of wipes you receive it is kind of a rip off. I just want simple wipes to remove my makeup. But $11 every 25 days is a little much. Probably wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really good make up remover. Does a good job and never causes my eyes to burn. You do have to scrub at your eyelashes a bit, but I guess that&#x27;s the trade off for my eyes not feeling like liquid fire.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently discovered these and have been using them when I get off-stage to quickly and easily remove my theatrical make up. It makes it so much easier than any other method. These remover towelettes don&#x27;t dry my face out either. I like the plastic container box to help keep them from drying out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is, but I saw it in the store for half the price. If you&#x27;re in a rush to get it, prime it, if not go to Target.</li>
            <li> great product, gentle on the skin, I wish it was on the subscription and save program.</li>
            <li> These are tiny tiny and even though they&#x27;re neutrogena I didnt expect this to be a mini package.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the commercials. I thought a towelette would be easier than using several cotton balls. I have sensitive skin around my eyes, and when I used this it stung my eyelids like crazy!!! I did have some dry skin around my eyes at the time as well. After rinsing with cool water to sooth the burning/stinging, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with my Clinique eye make-up remover (it doesn&#x27;t sting even when I have dry skin). It works great and I can deal with using cotton balls ;)</li>
            <li> handy and works great! The smell is a little strong but nice. I use it to remove all makeup, works wonder on mascara, then I clean my face as usual as this does leave a little film on your face. If I&#x27;m short on time I have just used the towelettes and gone to bed - no issues ever. Has never caused irritations or breakouts - if the smell was toned down just a smidge it would be 5 stars!</li>
            <li> These work so well. They take everything off and best of all the product doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like so many do. They are very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love these towelettes.  They are great for thorough and gentle make up removal.  Mascara is especially easy to take off.</li>
            <li> These are great at getting off your makeup, but I apparently have more sensitive facial skin than most people because they ended up drying out my face. If you have sensitive skin like me then look for a different product or make sure to moisturize really well afterward. I also wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell they left.</li>
            <li> This package was totally dried out</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and I love them.  I feel like my face is cleaner when I use them, as opposed to just washing.  It also works really well for the removal of eye makeup, which I have not found to be true with other makeup removing cloths.  And trust me, I wear tons of mascara so I would know!</li>
            <li> This works great on makeup and eye makeup. It gets rid of what my oil-free eye makeup remover leaves behind. It&#x27;s also very gentle on the skin and doesn&#x27;t cause a break out. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
