            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>The switch on the handle was shot from the rigorous cleaning it got and quite honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the mold/fungus was 100% out of the inside of the unit, so I was happy to replace</li>
            <li>Thank you very much and best wishes to you all.&lt;br /&gt;Aloha, George</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, right on time.</li>
            <li>Used the water pik for years - does a great job, easy to use, very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums have never been better!</li>
            <li>I kept flossing and then did the Water Pik and got even more out!</li>
            <li>-65 does a much better job!</li>
            <li>My husband and I love it!  </li>
            <li>This one looks good, but it&#x27;s operation is erratic, someimes feels like it&#x27;s about to conk out, but it hasn&#x27;t, so far so good, but not the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>It is so much more effective than floss!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied though!</li>
            <li>This thing makes more noise than a garbage truck backing up!</li>
            <li>(like so many products!)</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The adjustable strength of the water stream is easy to adjust on the fly.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was great and replaced it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The dentist used to probe my gums for &amp;#34;pockets,&amp;#34; not the most pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel amazing when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well wherever it is set.  </li>
            <li>So, now I bought my children their own waterpik and sent one to son in college along with getting myself one.  </li>
            <li>someone mentioned that Panasonic has it&#x27;s own oral irrigator.........</li>
            <li>She ha used them some years ago and found them to be quite effective.</li>
            <li>This is also good to maintain healthy gums.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a nice deal.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is fill the reservoir with warm water and put the mouth piece in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice.</li>
            <li>Plenty of power for a through cleaning, Holds plenty of water, and a nice assortment of PICS.</li>
            <li>I sue warm water</li>
            <li>Adjustable pressure switch on the wand is nice.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how effective the flosser is in removing food particles that remain after brushing.</li>
            <li>If you still plan to by one, all I can say is be warned, and own a house.</li>
            <li>Two things are not so nice.  </li>
            <li>but i liked the wp-20</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have that problem with the plug in kind.</li>
            <li>The holders for the attachments are handy.</li>
            <li>It seems like a good product, as I had one of these that lasted for many years.</li>
            <li>I own one already and purchased this one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>so my husband and I each have our own.  </li>
            <li>I think it will make a nice gift, but it was not for myself.</li>
            <li>This item is nice and compact, but on the load side.  </li>
            <li>the decibels of a Motley Crue concert  circa1988.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use it with warm water &amp; mouth wash.</li>
            <li>There was no way to replace it except for some kind of home repair.  </li>
            <li>Would purchase again nice size also thank u</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see anything I liked.</li>
            <li>My dentist is very impressed on how much healthier my gums are now</li>
            <li>Not as good as the old model (which was really excellent)</li>
            <li>but the competing products are worse.&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as the old model (which was really excellent)</li>
            <li>PERFECT HIGH QUALITY ITEM AND LOVE THE TRAVEL WATERPIK!</li>
            <li>I like it as its suitable for many ages, come with good package and nice item, would order again.</li>
            <li>This model is the older one and the best.  </li>
            <li>When you have the time to use it, it works great to make your teeth feel truly clean.</li>
            <li>good,  it is useful good,  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and has been working great for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>The disign is compact and its VERY easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The water force can be adjusted and on the highest setting is very strong...</li>
            <li>Quality is good and it works fine.</li>
            <li>We replaced it with the ConAir, lower rated but more effective.</li>
            <li>(2) the handle controller of jet force were more effective and discernible.</li>
            <li>It has kept my gums in good condition, and that&#x27;s important because gum disease has been linked to infection and inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great while it lasts.</li>
            <li>Give us real clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have used many waterpiks over the years and liked all, unfortunatley not this one.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>This is a really good device to clean stains in between teeth....</li>
            <li>I am so happy I did, works great, simple to use.</li>
            <li>I mix about 3/4 warm water with 1/4 fluoride mouth wash for that fresh-from-the-dentist-but-no-copay kind of clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit continues to operate very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Cleans debris between teeth very effectively, but the unit is very, very noisy.  </li>
            <li>This is made very cheaply.</li>
            <li>Nice strong jet.</li>
            <li>However, if I were to buy again, this is the model for me because it is effective, practical and easy to carry.</li>
            <li>I used for years, butr more effective and equally easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought the better unit: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GLRREU/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 .</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>These things work okay for a while</li>
            <li>Your dentist will be impressed and your teeth will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>worked ok for abot a year</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the waterpik.  </li>
            <li>love the power</li>
            <li>*Be sure that the tip you are looking for is for the model you choose, as not all waterpiks tools are interchangeable--</li>
            <li>Many studies will state that the Waterpik does not get everything that flossing would.</li>
            <li>My experience disagrees with these studies and my visits with the dentist are actually better now with the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for quality, it is a plastic system with a motor, nothing terribly sophisticated about it</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t expect it to last more than two or three years at best.</li>
            <li>, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>In most cases I have had to replace the units because of leaks in the hose.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.      </li>
            <li>It provides better removal of food particles than dental floss by a mile.</li>
            <li>May be it is time to design a more practical one.  </li>
            <li>This makes sure there is not any build up in the lines.  </li>
            <li>The latest one leaks water</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how many water pik</li>
            <li>I saw the x-rays and all the teeth roots are healthy, no cavities.    </li>
            <li>I love my waterpik</li>
            <li>The product was great and fast service .</li>
            <li>This one seems to work better.  </li>
            <li>A two year warranty led me to believe this is a mugh better product than I thought.  </li>
            <li>The WaterPik works much better than floss for me...</li>
            <li>This is my latest replacement and it works as well or better than all of the others I have owned over the years.  </li>
            <li>The Water Pik seems just as reliable to me as the one I used many years ago</li>
            <li>With this product I would say I am 90% pleased.</li>
            <li>It cleans between your teeth a lot better than flossing.</li>
            <li>Also it would be better if they had the pressure control on the unit instead of handle.</li>
            <li>I love WaterPik products.</li>
            <li>and I still love my WP-65 WaterPik.  </li>
            <li>a go suggested I use one and have for many years.  </li>
            <li>many alternatives, so I keep spending money on this brand.</li>
            <li>I mix lots of water, with several tablespoons of Listerine--nearly filling the WaterPik&#x27;s reservoir (all quite UNscientifically), and repeatedly, remain abundantly impressed with the junk this baby removes--</li>
            <li>Im glad</li>
            <li>Gums are better too.</li>
            <li>MFR CLAIMED I SHOULD EXERCISE MORE CARE IN RINSING AND USING.</li>
            <li>It flushes more particles</li>
            <li>Just make sure there&#x27;s a tip on the flosser if you leave water in it, or it will leak.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>After many years of service it died.</li>
            <li>what more would you expect?</li>
            <li>(instructions say they are safe for that use).  </li>
            <li>my teeth are &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; and more food debris is coming out in the rinse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t looked at many alternatives yet,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a good extra thing to do, and can be a great help if you have to deal with braces or hard-to-reach spots where food tends to get stuck.</li>
            <li>I have dentures, top and bottom.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this WATERPIK.</li>
            <li>ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION WITH STANDARD SHIPPING IN A TIMELY MANNER.</li>
            <li>made in USA is my favorite</li>
            <li>Mfg should made a better quality.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>Therefore, I was more satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>The glass nozzle is sometimes balky at fitting into the clamp.  </li>
            <li>Now the teeth will be ok.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Great product and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion - More plastic in landfill than needed because wear parts not user replaceable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care what all the reports say that flossing is better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, one more con which dentists and orthodontists discourage using the Waterpik,</li>
            <li>Just ordered two more because I did NOT like Model WP-660.</li>
            <li>The latest version is lighter and quieter than predecessors.</li>
            <li>Most of the devices you find in stores now have all the bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li>Many people have this problem with this model.  </li>
            <li>Read more reviews and watch video online about replacing the hose.    </li>
            <li>I do sort-of wish it had a top cover to keep stuff from falling into the water reservior</li>
            <li>I like it better.  </li>
            <li>I love the waterflosser results</li>
            <li>Love this one, replaced a cordless one with this and like this one a lot better.  </li>
            <li>It has more power and leaves my mouth feeling like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took somewhat longer to get delivery, but i am pleased using it.</li>
            <li>I had one of these for many years before it wore out.  </li>
            <li>In that case, perhaps more R&amp;D needs to go into this technology before products are placed on the market.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>It holds more water and has much better pressure.</li>
            <li>A good range of useful attachments to enhance oral hygiene.       </li>
            <li>This is a great product and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I am very conscientious with my great electric toothbrush and flossing; however, this thing makes my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have</li>
            <li>Have used one for many years and had to replace it.</li>
            <li>This one has way more pressure than needed</li>
            <li>Pressure is greater.</li>
            <li>I have many caps</li>
            <li>so I must maintain healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>I always seem to get more water on the mirror than I do in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>but I now love it</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This unit works much better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>finally figured out how to hook it up and every thing is working perfect.</li>
            <li>It used to look sturdy and more stable when placed in a countertop, now it is so lightweight, nosier and</li>
            <li>The price was better than Walmart price.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay more.</li>
            <li>I find it useful gets the junk off your teeth and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>, i AM ABLE TO FLUSH OUT</li>
            <li>My latest waterpik broke after just two weeks...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t intend to buy any more of these.</li>
            <li>I have had many waterpiks over the years.  </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>The pulsing I&#x27;m not so sure of yet.</li>
            <li>In today&#x27;s world it would probably cost $8,000 to replace and the Waterpik keep this area and my whole mouth in great shape.  </li>
            <li>I have always been satisfied with them and love the way my mouth feels after using it.</li>
            <li>Works OK.</li>
            <li>The top of the unit does not sit properly&lt;br /&gt;Water</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t begin to work until you play with the fitting</li>
            <li>Maybe I should learn how to use this better.</li>
            <li>I love the design which keeps up to 3 nozzles on the side and under the water tank.</li>
            <li>Definitely love this waterpik.  </li>
            <li>Now our mouths are healthy.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone trying to have better dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li>paired with regular brushing and flossing will make your dentist happy!  </li>
            <li>so I love it too.</li>
            <li>Should have included more tips.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t check more.    </li>
            <li>I heated it some, bent it some, and it was much better.  </li>
            <li>This Waterpik Water Flosser is even better than the waterpik</li>
            <li>Use warm water, it is more comfortable</li>
            <li>This product more than met my expectations.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve used one of these things, you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever lived without it.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, helps maintain healthy gums.</li>
            <li>There sure is an opportunity for someone to make one of these things that works..</li>
            <li>After four uses - it still works.. more than could be said with the WP-65.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have tried many water picks over the years.  </li>
            <li>but they probably would not sell as many units.</li>
            <li>I have always used waterpik,,and this one works just as well as any that I have owned,,,I love water piks,,,,better than flossing</li>
            <li>If If you expect me to write reviews and try to tell me how many words to use.</li>
            <li>This also keeps gums healthy and plague build up at bay.</li>
            <li>and my hygienist is pleased with me</li>
            <li>If you are considering a waterpik, I say get it! :)</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years now.  </li>
            <li>I use the flosser and so many more food particles come out.</li>
            <li>I have used Teledyne Waterpiks for many years.  </li>
            <li>Want to keep those teeth for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This gets more gunk out than my flosser at times.</li>
            <li>I sure don&#x27;t need ,or want the junk that the water container can attract .</li>
            <li>Great water flosser, highly portable, a good price, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik Water Flosser is very easy to use - set-up takes seconds, the intensity is easy to adjust, and clean-up is a breeze.  </li>
            <li>This is not the first one I have owned, but certainly the best one.</li>
            <li>a very clean feeling.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li>works great, leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li>After a month or two, full pressure just feels like a nice gum massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, you can&#x27;t fill the tank without picking up the fairly bulky apparatus and putting it underneath the faucet.  </li>
            <li>; be aware that isn’t a good place to start, work your way up.</li>
            <li>I hope the motor is as good as the first two.  </li>
            <li>plus it is fun!!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>Our new Waterpik is just great.</li>
            <li>and you should be able to suck out some water easily.</li>
            <li>I love the way it is easy to turn to get all the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>its what I expected and wanted works wonderfully thank you , why do you require me to tell you more about this product?</li>
            <li>The pressure is great - nice that you have various settings.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband by dentist request and it works great and it very easy to use wish that the tank held more water but no big deal.</li>
            <li>No suction, very loud bought Waterpik ultra water been a month now works great</li>
            <li>I was glad to fine one again...</li>
            <li>Never felt cleaner or more confident in my smile!</li>
            <li>It is quicker and better than flossing with dental floss and the clean feeling is a lot better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an incredible item and has health benefits far beyond just clean teeth.</li>
            <li>So far it is great</li>
            <li>My teeth already look great and gums also and I am 71 years old.</li>
            <li>My old Waterpik needed replacing and was so great</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important update:</li>
            <li>It works really well, has good pressure levels</li>
            <li>Really makes me wonder how good brushing is!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to quick</li>
            <li>This waterpik flosser is very adequate, good price and reasonable durability.  </li>
            <li>Nice to have clean enviro rated teeth and gums, and full mouth&lt;br /&gt;Great way to start a day</li>
            <li>In other words, a perfect transaction.</li>
            <li>I had the original, and it worked for many year.</li>
            <li>It works perfect, and maybe a little better.</li>
            <li>I started using the Waterpik a number of years ago, and once one realizes how much more it does than a toothbrush, one will never again feel that ones teeth are clean unless followed up with the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also does not have tank cover top, which would help to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>The ordering process was easy.  </li>
            <li>Practice working with the stream and force in your mouth, but otherwise easy to use and put together</li>
            <li>Easy to use (once you learn not to bathe yourself).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, too.  </li>
            <li>Nothing can give you that clean feeling in your mouth better that water flosser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to set up and use that instructions aren&#x27;t needed.</li>
            <li>(I have braces) to get the job done and this was not an easy task because you can&#x27;t turn the unit off with one hand anymore, no matter how you try to turn the unit off just to refill it, it slides all around the place.</li>
            <li>I love how clean my teeth feel after Waterpik&#x27;ing and then brushing. &#x27;</li>
            <li>It is a easy and hygienic way to bring the tips along with you.</li>
            <li>Easy to maintain</li>
            <li>It works great but takes more minutes to get the same cleaning as a sonic brush.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy attachment and removal of cleaning tool tips that are color  coded for easy identification.       </li>
            <li>Water flow and pressure are easily adjustable and the wand rotates 360 degrees.       </li>
            <li>and they fall out easily when I remove the tank (when it is used as a cover).</li>
            <li>Slide switch can move too easily</li>
            <li>Inserting the attachment into the &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34; takes getting used to, but it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>Easy setup.</li>
            <li>This one has some apertures that you can place the tool heads in, but they fall out easily.</li>
            <li>I understand that the tubing and wand can be replaced easily.  </li>
            <li>After using this Waterpik, the hygienist kept remarking how easily the plaque was coming off and</li>
            <li>Exchange very quick and no</li>
            <li>Tips remove easily.  </li>
            <li>There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it is very quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>- Still going strong after almost 3 years.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of pretty good QC engineers out there; you might want to consider hiring some before you throw another design like this into full production.    </li>
            <li>It has a mechanism by which you can set how strong you want water to be pumped.</li>
            <li>The older model gave me good service for years.</li>
            <li>It has been around for over 40 years and still going strong.</li>
            <li>The older ones were good.</li>
            <li>It has a good range of pressures and  the highest setting is as high as you could ever need.  </li>
            <li>and it did feel pretty warm.</li>
            <li>Was my first water flower and am very pleased, I am amaze at how clean my teeth desk.  </li>
            <li>Now I use it every day and my mouth is as clean and fresh as a springtime rose.  </li>
            <li>The flosser works fine, but it is noisier than I hoped.  </li>
            <li>This device is admittedly somewhat cumbersome to use but seems to do a fine job of cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Half the time I think &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because when &lt;br /&gt;it works, it works fine</li>
            <li>so I use it instead of flossing, and my dentist said my gums were fine.  </li>
            <li>You need to do this each night you use it; by doing so, it will work fine.  </li>
            <li>I found the Water Pik to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>Once I get that going it works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it works fine</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>Meeting all expectations just fine.</li>
            <li>works fine, took some getting used to</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>works fine.  </li>
            <li>The power is fine</li>
            <li>When it works, the product is fine.  </li>
            <li>I thought this model would be fine...</li>
            <li>This unit works fine.  </li>
            <li>Been looking for one like my old one- super happy with this-</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a huge difference in water capacity</li>
            <li>Than put the jet in the sink and the water should continue to flow freely.</li>
            <li>Also, there are several positions for controlling the strength of the jet - start with the weakest one to find the strength most comfortable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the Waterpik arrived securely wrapped and in good time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the hose breaks every 3 months and they won&#x27;t replace for free</li>
            <li>--- that was the primary reason for my purchase.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>plenty of power, easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>Seller shipped item promptly with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Is a great alternative to traditional flossing</li>
            <li>Works great and only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Great product: my second Waterpik.</li>
            <li>This machine is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what you really miss.</li>
            <li>Then, when I filled the resevoir with water, it leaked out the bottom.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>easy to control, fill and clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much junk stays in your teeth after flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li>The WP-65 with the hydrogen peroxide solution remains mold free and we&#x27;ve owned it just about 10 months now.</li>
            <li>Yes this water flosser is essential for great oral hygiene</li>
            <li>This is the basic device and works great.  </li>
            <li>The big tank plus the variable power is great.</li>
            <li>switch needs to be in precise place</li>
            <li>Just get the unit as close to the sink and your head as possible, so that the hose never needs to stretch, and everyone will go home happy.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product and I plan to buy one for my sister.</li>
            <li>the material used looks cheap.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It seems cheaply made though.</li>
            <li>Veerryy cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The implements now fit into the handle without a fight - the manufacturing tolerances must have been reworked.</li>
            <li>and I discovered that it had become brittle because it was just really cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>Like, for example, the fact that the handle never seems to fit the receptacle unless you remove the tip each time.  </li>
            <li>My dentist says my problem gap areas are free of plaque, and should stay that way........</li>
            <li>I like to keep my wife happy with quiet surroundings.</li>
            <li>and I use it twice daily with great results.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the way it it flips over to become the cover making it nice and compact.</li>
            <li>It is truly amazing how much cleaner my teeth are since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the fact that replacement parts are readily available.</li>
            <li>Every time I turn it on, there&#x27;s a 90% chance there&#x27;ll just be a buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>The newer versions are cheaply made and flimsy.</li>
            <li>so far, it is doing a good job.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik is doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li>This replacement is as good as the old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good</li>
            <li>To use warm, clean, pure water in your waterpIk, mix a cup of room temperature ZeroWater, with the cup of boiling</li>
            <li>healing that becomes possible, using a waterpik with warm, clean water, is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>Great product for anyone, especially kids who need a quick and easy way to floss well.  </li>
            <li>That is because one is still faced with the reduced elasticity of the original hose into which the replacement hose is meant to fit.  </li>
            <li>It is quieter than the older model but just as effective.</li>
            <li>I took a chance and it fit perfectly in the small space I&#x27;d reserved for it.</li>
            <li>Waterpiks don&#x27;t last forever and this new one is the best I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>The machine worked great and for a long time--5 kids in the family; still works for all I know.  </li>
            <li>And I still have my original teeth at almost 65 years of age.</li>
            <li>I bought the Water Flosser after my original Waterpik (model 100) died after six or seven years of usage.</li>
            <li>and had the first for many years.  </li>
            <li>But the first two months that it was working, I love it.</li>
            <li>Original review:    </li>
            <li>My first one lasted for many years before giving up.  </li>
            <li>Now I waterpik first then floss, brush and waterpik once more.  </li>
            <li>Inferior to the original version</li>
            <li>This is sooo much better than the cordless one I bought first.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great as long as it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At recommendation of my dentist I have been a Waterpik user for over 25 years, and am never disappointed with the product.  </li>
            <li>When I started using the Waterpik, I started winning the war against cavities and my gums went from that reddish-pink that bleeds while flossing, which means bacteria has inflamed your gums and are eating away at your teeth, to a nice and healthy whitish-pink and absolutely no bleeding, even at the dentist&#x27;s office when they try to make them bleed!</li>
            <li>after 10 years, I figured it was time for a nice, shiny new one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first-time user of such a device --- and am very impressed so far.  </li>
            <li>Now, they are about as clean as possiable.  </li>
            <li>Think you teeth are clean after brushing?</li>
            <li>and yet it&#x27;s amazing if you read the reviews how many people still come back to give them another chance.  </li>
            <li>My mouth has never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li>Tthe size wasn&#x27;t as bulky as I thought it might be and with the speed I use I can clean all of my teeth with one fill.</li>
            <li>Turns out my setting is (3/5), to clean w/o bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>tank also flips to cover unit to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I sent it back and received a replacement which worked beautifully for the first two days.</li>
            <li>and my mouth feels really clean.  </li>
            <li>I use this device to clean my dentures well and clean and refresh my mouth and gums.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe the great fresh feeling it gives the entire mouth.</li>
            <li>After using the waterpik water flosser your mouth feels so clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so clean</li>
            <li>and clean where dental floss does not , i´m</li>
            <li>My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean unless I waterpik each morning.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>This waterpix is easy and fun to use..</li>
            <li>Cheap water supply cord breaks or cracks quickly and would purchase another brand out there if there were one that was competitive.</li>
            <li>i MAY EVEN START USING IT TO CLEAN MY TEETH.</li>
            <li>I have had several, and this is the best so far, if it turns out that it lasts well.  </li>
            <li>Contacted Waterpik, they said I had to clean out the rubber stoppers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip for how to produce clean water, for use in a waterpIk flosser.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>I brush and floss but felt like my teeth just weren&#x27;t as clean as they should be</li>
            <li>It has a good range of pressure settings, from gentle to very forceful.  </li>
            <li>So far I love this WaterPik!  </li>
            <li>, I believe it comes with the special tips automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I USE IT TO IRRIGATE MY SINUS CAVITIES WITH A SPECIAL TIP.  </li>
            <li>Had one of these previously and loved it!  </li>
            <li>Not as good as last one I bought.  </li>
            <li>Gradually build up the pressure until you can handle either full blast or one level below.</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t used it full force yet</li>
            <li>Well, I can&#x27;t really remember how many of these I have purchased during the&lt;br /&gt;last 10 years.</li>
            <li>I purchased this model even though it did not do quite as much as the top model</li>
            <li>Was not that much more to replace whole unit than it was to just purchase replacement tube  (which cracks after a while).  </li>
            <li>This is my third Waterpik flosser over the years - good service, durable for every day use.</li>
            <li>turn it on and run the water jet quick through all your teeth to clean them.</li>
            <li>The whole reservoir on the top idea...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Surely, modern technology can come up with better material choices than those of this dated product.</li>
            <li>If the hand piece is in it&#x27;s holder when you put the tank on to use, you can&#x27;t get it out without removing the full tank from the unit.  </li>
            <li>if it lasted 10 years, it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li>We use the waterpik daily for good dental care.</li>
            <li>This is a good investment now and the future concerning dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll return for full refund.  </li>
            <li>My dentist was amazed that my gums were in such good shape when I went to see him.</li>
            <li>Put it at full blast and this thing does some damage.</li>
            <li>and it just isn&#x27;t as good as the smaller unit they used to make.</li>
            <li>The warranty was only good for 30 days, so I&#x27;m out-of-luck.  </li>
            <li>really works and my teeth and gums are in better shape than they have ever been in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that to be true.</li>
            <li>IT WILL NOT GO FULL FORCE</li>
            <li>If you have a friend with dragon breath buy them one and tell them that you enjoyed it so much you wanted them to have one, too.  </li>
            <li>(Full disclosure: I bought mine at a well known brick n mortar chain, not at Amazon.)  </li>
            <li>So easy to use; no chasing the unit around the counter top, one handed turn on and turn off, a water capacity that easily holds enough water to do my full mouth of braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The assembly was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>was right and available quickly.</li>
            <li>It has greatly helped my issues with gum bleeding and other symptoms of periodontal disease.</li>
            <li>And the water massage keeps your gums happy and in the pink!</li>
            <li>The powerful water jets clean all food debris away and massage my gums - I have braces</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, my mouth feels fresh &amp; clean after using my Waterpik Flosser,</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve dissolved the salt in hot water before adding it to the Waterpik, and it&#x27;s been working fine for a month.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Of course, most people probably don&#x27;t do this so these companies are not only defrauding their customers, they are spoiling the enviornment with disposable products that can&#x27;t be safely disposed.   </li>
            <li>This model looks much better than the older models, but it&#x27;s a piece of garbage.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I didn&#x27;t, after using this model I could only imagine how many times I would have had to refill the portable pik.</li>
            <li>I think we would ALL like to see more convincing independent research on its long-term effectiveness on improving gum and dental health.)</li>
            <li>On top of that my older Waterpik never had a problem over the years I have had it.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>but my grandson said he was surprised how much debris a waterpik releases even after what he thought was a good brushing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a waterpik for many, many years and realized the same results.</li>
            <li>This model one below maximum is adequate for needed pressure.</li>
            <li>The Waterpic does the job it was designed to do but it is very noisy and has a cheap sound to it.</li>
            <li>Buying it on Amazon saved me money and the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise the units seem to last for many, many years.</li>
            <li>This is a super product that works well.  </li>
            <li>around until resevoir fits properly on top to let the water flow.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I highly recommend it for helping to keep teeth and gums&lt;</li>
            <li>Very powerful, quiet and effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To sum up, there is a reason the waterpik is better than flossing and it is because of the high intensity water pressure.</li>
            <li>First, it feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>She promised me that it is here to stay and that I would benefit from it very much!</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this item and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Well, operationaly this one seems to fit the bill pretty well.</li>
            <li>You may be able to spend a few more dollars to get a much better machine.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the large water tank is a plus.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik flosser is a strong machine for flossing and can certainly do the job</li>
            <li>I used one of the older versions, this is far superior.</li>
            <li>At night before bed, I Waterpik with a full reservoir of warm water mixed with a quick splash of mouthwash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably order a new one of the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; model as it&#x27;s cheaper, appears to be marginally more functional than the slicker one.</li>
            <li>the new unit is more convenient to use.</li>
            <li>; I think I&#x27;ve had it for more than 10 years, so I bought this new flosser.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the new one</li>
            <li>Before I could send the first one back the new one was already here that was the best service, ever thanks.</li>
            <li>Waterpik has been one of the best companies for long lasting products I have ever dealt with.  </li>
            <li>The whole thing tips over easily.  </li>
            <li>Really has a strong motion to it.  </li>
            <li>All these years later I decided I needed another one, and I&#x27;m so pleased to have it!  </li>
            <li>the  FIRST  WEEK!  </li>
            <li>Should have shopped Amazon first!</li>
            <li>Overall, we really love this Waterpik and recommend it!</li>
            <li>it was ten times better!  </li>
            <li>Liked the one vibrate on previous model better than this one that has 3.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate and love the different pressure setttings.</li>
            <li>I bough it for my parents and they are not that good when it comes to dealing with electronic products since they are a bit old, but they are easily learnt how to use this since it is simple to use.</li>
            <li>The container is too large to allow a smooth insertion of the pik into its cavity.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little device to aid in your dental home care.  </li>
            <li>This particular model seems to work OK at first but</li>
            <li>and I recommend it very highly to anyone who wants under-the-gum cleaning for the most thorough cleaning you can get.  </li>
            <li>I use my water pik everyday and this was a great buy.  </li>
            <li>Shipped out real fast.</li>
            <li>the concept is good but they have to make a machine that actually works and without the jackhammer noise that shakes the whole house.</li>
            <li>my old one burned out, wanted to replace, but newbies were all $60 at the store, and had more features than I needed.  </li>
            <li>results of using it are well worth it.  </li>
            <li>This item is well worth the price but plan to replace it every three or so years.</li>
            <li>Waterpiks are such a vital part of complete dental hygiene and this one does an excellent job of eliminating remaining food between teeth and on the gumline.</li>
            <li>The reason I only gave it 4 stars is: Reservoir could fit better.</li>
            <li>and, how fresh my mouth feel thereafter.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ll say I love this thing.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth make sure you have the lurkwarm water (like it states in book to use).</li>
            <li>is extremely useful in keeping the progress of the disease at bay.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased with this unit.</li>
            <li>Over time, as the unit ages and weakens, I wonder if this will shorten the useful lifespan.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked them and they last for years.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The order was timely delivered to me, and so far I am pleased with the way it is operating.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>If this one lasts as long I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and does what a Waterpik is designed to do.  </li>
            <li>More sensitive gums need a weaker force of water to come out.  </li>
            <li>this worth it?</li>
            <li>I end up getting water everywhere, but it is powerful.</li>
            <li>Okay - I read some reviews stating that the Waterpik Water Flosser was &#x27;loud&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li>However the added capacity of the tank makes the unit well worth having.</li>
            <li>Far too many times</li>
            <li>Appliances like this have a finite life and given the engineering that&#x27;s required and the manufacturing time and materials I have to think this is a product that is worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay so far.</li>
            <li>but I left it in until I could think of a way to create my own lid.  </li>
            <li>Makes flossing fun.</li>
            <li>It has a nice big reservoir</li>
            <li>Now the kids finally have one of their own.  </li>
            <li>(she said that would soften the plaque for easier and more complete removal).</li>
            <li>WHICH IS WHAT IS USEFUL TO KEEP MY TEETH CLEAN.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oral irrigators are clearly beneficial for the gums, and the WaterPik brand seems to provide a stronger flow than others I have tried, and is more satisfactory to use.  </li>
            <li>so well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>: The pressure control slider on the handle goes from mild to very, very strong with no real middle ground.</li>
            <li>I was able to repair it with a piece of automotive vacuum hose that the broken ends of the tube happened to fit into perfectly.  </li>
            <li>My guess is that they are a very big American company that has a very good product idea and that grew to be very large.  </li>
            <li>The new one worked great for the first 3 months and now only will work on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>and it comes with a 2 year warranty both of which are very positive.</li>
            <li>I add a little mouth wash to kill any germs, and it keeps my mouth bright and clean between dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>The item seemed to do a very nice job for the short time in which it was operational; it left my mouth feeling very fresh.  </li>
            <li>There was NOT any significant delay, but it makes me wonder --- wouldn&#x27;t it have been more efficient to have INITIALLY used the US mail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this before and due to time and wear had to replace it and am very happy once again having my waterpic back in my home.</li>
            <li>Water comes out super fast!</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was how much more powerful his unit was compared to the old one....</li>
            <li>It has improved my health remarkably by helping keep my gums free of food debris in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>This one is just right.</li>
            <li>So, something about the design of this unit isn&#x27;t right..</li>
            <li>I can can&#x27;t seem to operate it right,</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that is right.</li>
            <li>I used it right after brushing.  </li>
            <li>This one is just right.  </li>
            <li>That said, this new machine is the best one yet (with several improvements over my last one, which was otherwise identical).  </li>
            <li>I had my dental appointment yesterday, and my checkup was positive!  </li>
            <li>long before the motor gives out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as far as getting the job done -- flossing with a water jet -- it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It really helps me to clean food from that area and refresh</li>
            <li>Look nice and small size. :)</li>
            <li>Keep doing what you are doing.&amp;#34; She made one suggestion, that I switch the order of the four steps I follow to put rinsing with a popular whitening mouthwash first rather than second</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other Waterpiks in the past and been very happy with them, but this one is leagues better</li>
            <li>This new model is working fine for the month that I have had it.  </li>
            <li>I have one myself and it works great to get the small food pieces out of your mouth.</li>
            <li>you - like me - found the WaterPik to be the only design suitable, skip the 65 and get the 260.</li>
            <li>I reamed mine out a bit with a small clean drill bit and now get good flow.</li>
            <li>Their newer model seems to work a little better, but this one has a lower profile and fits in the space I have by the sink better.</li>
            <li>My mouth is much fresher throughout the day and this gets far more food debris out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a nice small instrument, easily handled.  </li>
            <li>Expect it to last a year or two before the motor starts failing, but hey, 40 bucks every two years is very cheap dental insurance.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much when it is operational.  </li>
            <li>Also, it was sent super-fast, and was very favorably priced, so I&#x27;m rating this transaction 5 STARS, because they won&#x27;t let me go higher!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little too noisy but it does a good job.</li>
            <li>The motor seems to be stronger, pushing out a more vibrant and thinner stream of water, which, when inadvertently aimed at soft skin tissue, under the tongue for example, causes a degree of pain.  </li>
            <li>The first one broke after 6 months.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik worked fitfully from first use.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted twenty years until the seal started spraying water.</li>
            <li>If you buy extra tools, be sure to include the Orthodontic tip.  </li>
            <li>My first waterpik lasted 7 years.</li>
            <li>The first Waterpik I purchased was the portable rechargeable one.  </li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t get more than a couple of uses out of it.  </li>
            <li>With all of the latest research on dental hygiene and cancer, longevity and overall health, this is a &#x27;power tool&#x27; I won&#x27;t be without.    </li>
            <li>Its exactly what I look for.</li>
            <li>The hose broke on my first WP-65 within the warranty period.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I have to move it back &amp; forth till the pressure comes thru the jet tip.</li>
            <li>The WaterPik lasts a long time &amp; does a great job especially for people who have dental bridges &amp; caps.  </li>
            <li>I have used variations of this Waterpik product for over 40 years and most last years before needing to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>After purchasing two battery charged water piks, the first was an Inter-Plak, and having them both die within weeks</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased died after four weeks.</li>
            <li>If you hold the pik higher than the reservoir</li>
            <li>start from the lowest strength setting the first time, until you find your limit.</li>
            <li>The motor did not function correctly after the first 10 uses.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that it&#x27;s a lot lighter</li>
            <li>Flossing is so much easier this way!</li>
            <li>I purchased this Waterpik to replace one I had used for many years that finally just wore out.  </li>
            <li>The force of the stream of water can be set higher than the handheld model.  </li>
            <li>Pretty.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;ve been using these make sure to start out on a low pressure setting otherwise</li>
            <li>Hydrogen Peroxide kills bacteria, fungus, and mold and is safe to use internally as a mouth rinse.</li>
            <li>I first pour that into the water well, then I Waterpik</li>
            <li>I like the procedure of using this to floss much better than using actual floss.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Waterpik first.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t set it to maximum power the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a product like this which consistently breaks after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Be aware of the following statement listed under \\&quot;Warning\\&quot; in the product&#x27;s operation manual: \\&quot;Do not use this product for more than 5 minutes in each two-hour period.  </li>
            <li>First:  </li>
            <li>The tank is the cover for the unit when not in use, With the hand unit in it&#x27;s holder and the tip in place, the tank (cover) does not work unless you remove the tip first (Bummer).  </li>
            <li>I am ordering the next model up and hoping I have better results.</li>
            <li>This was my first time ever using a water flosser.</li>
            <li>I encourage you to start with the flosser in your mouth before you turn it on; got everything on my counter nice and wet.</li>
            <li>The first two lasted about 20 years each</li>
            <li>I used to floss first in the morning then brush and then waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I hope it works better than the last one.  </li>
            <li>Received in a timely manner and replaces the same item I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>It has more power than our last WaterPik and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about two years before the pump went out.  </li>
            <li>The price was really reasonable!  </li>
            <li>First one arrived and didn&#x27;t work out of the box.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is more water splashing on my hands (over the bowl)-- which I can&#x27;t explain.</li>
            <li>its exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Just took delivery and used for the first time this water pick flosser.</li>
            <li>I taped a piece of flexable plastic across the back of the resevoir which covers the opening on top.</li>
            <li>I may come up with a better solution in the future, but for now this is working for</li>
            <li>OK, Now it&#x27;s about a month later.</li>
            <li>My advice is \\&quot;don&#x27;t start any higher than the lowest setting\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Anything higher will strip paint!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Would like it to have one or two higher water pressure settings than those offered by the machine.</li>
            <li>This unit  fill to brim and you have more than enough time.</li>
            <li>Gotta say that it started shaking at first and it worried me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it every day, and it definitely works better than floss and brushing alone.</li>
            <li>I had one of these units when they first came out and it lasted for years.</li>
            <li>One month after purchasing this Waterpik it wouldn&#x27;t pulse water when sliding the selector to higher pressures.</li>
            <li>It seems as if the pause button was activating at the higher flow.</li>
            <li>I had a Waterpik Flosser for many years without a problem, using it daily.  </li>
            <li>He seems to like it better than regular flossing.  </li>
            <li>I will check around first to see if there are close competitors.    </li>
            <li>As others have recommended, starting with a lower setting will help your gums build up to being able to use the flosser at higher water pressure levels.  </li>
            <li>The first two, I just threw away and purchased another.</li>
            <li>produces more noise than my last unit</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need</li>
            <li>does exactly whatt it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I have it on a middle setting and cannot imagine needing (or being able to stand) a higher setting.  </li>
            <li>The higher you set the power the quicker</li>
            <li>I have had the same experience as many of the people who bought this product.  </li>
            <li>Spend more and get one that will last longer than two weeks.</li>
            <li>I used it only once, but it was once too many.  </li>
            <li>Since the manufacturing went to China the quality has consistently declined.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Idea is you cut off most of the old hose and attach new.</li>
            <li>In any case, this new one does everything the old one did but better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, easy to operate and has several settings.</li>
            <li>Use warm water - especially if you have sensitive teeth!  </li>
            <li>PRO: I have been recently told by a new dentist that I have excellent teeth, no gum disease, tight gums and no cavities.</li>
            <li>One drawback is the large size of product versus small vanity top, I should have been more aware of dimensions as it takes up large amount of space.</li>
            <li>Kids think it is fun too but be sure to tell them to be careful the first time they use it or they will get water everywhere.  </li>
            <li>took old one apart cleaned and lubed gears and little plastic piston, runs great</li>
            <li>This is a little loud but the results are great.  </li>
            <li>Another person did a pretty comical review of this model and mentioned how loud it was and something about a tractor I think and let me tell you, that reviewer wasn&#x27;t far from the truth.</li>
            <li>The higher settings are rough on your gums but if you start off in the lower ones and after a few weeks work your way up it is just perfect.</li>
            <li>We were so thrilled with our purchase, that we ordered another for our other home.</li>
            <li>The new unit has a little more pressure and a lot more quitter.  </li>
            <li>The tips move a little too easy , but overall a good product.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to come back here and purchase the full size model as the portable one was not only super messy, but not as effective or easy to move as the original.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine until last week, now the water does not come out right.</li>
            <li>I might prefer the thing to be more expensive and more sturdily constructed and last much longer, but I did have a good experience while it lasted.</li>
            <li>Does just as good a job as the more expensive units.  </li>
            <li>Very loud, loud enough to wake up my roommate, but does a good job.  </li>
            <li>If you love healthy teeth and gums, I suggest purchasing this small appliance!</li>
            <li>As compared to the unit it replaced (which we wore out over about three years of daily use), the motor is smaller, the unit runs louder, and the pump seems to require more torque than the motor can comfortably provide-</li>
            <li>This one much higher quality and really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for that offer!</li>
            <li>I have been using waterpik for a long time and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have had many Waterpik flossers that lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it was a real eye opener...</li>
            <li>Works great has plenty of power, some of the other models don&#x27;t have enough pressure.</li>
            <li>Even though it is listed as lower, it is higher on both of my W65 units and allows me to really get into gum pockets where my wisdom teeth used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These devices are much better at cleaning the gum line plaque than floss by a long shot.</li>
            <li>My first one served very well for over eight years before developing a leak.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it, I was amazed on how much crud it got out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>They should really consider using that higher setting to mine diamonds.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It does feel good to use, but I&#x27;m not sure I can put up with the dismal quality.  </li>
            <li>I had a WaterPik when, as an adult, I found myself with a mouth full of braces.  </li>
            <li>new models pump is not as strong as the old model.</li>
            <li>The new one does not have as much pressure when flossing which is fine with me as the old one could really sting if you didn&#x27;t adjust it just right.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I gave it a 4 was that my old nozzles don&#x27;t fit it.  </li>
            <li>the rubber feet would not stick to the countertop surface and the damn thing slid all around while trying to set up, clean teeth, and then clean and dry the unit.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t leave warm water in the tub) tub and perhaps turn it upside down over the assembly over which it does not rest squarely, or store it elsewhere, or cover it with a towel , or whatever.  </li>
            <li>the effect is obvious good, teeth clean, comfortab, it has a little defect that it made some noise when you water your teeths.</li>
            <li>That is to take the unit apart (a tricky, but possible, thing to do) and fit the replacement nozzle head and hose combination directly onto the pump, thereby replacing the sclerotic original hose.</li>
            <li>This is the fourth one of these I&#x27;ve bought in 14 years so it has about an average life span of about 3and one half years;depending on how many in the household use this very good product.</li>
            <li>Easy to set the hose back in its cradle.</li>
            <li>We had followed Waterpik&#x27;s direction that if you use a mouthwash, you must always run water through the unit one more time to flush out any lingering mouthwash (indeed, they can dry to a sticky film).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to lift that and fill it by using a glass or cup that we all have sitting around the bathroom</li>
            <li>On my previous Waterpik I never needed to cover the tub at all, since after I emptied it, it had its own well-fitting</li>
            <li>We wore out our first one, but clearly had gotten our monies worth.  </li>
            <li>There is a third option which the Waterpik company strongly discourages.  </li>
            <li>So unless you have a strong grip with your thumb and wont mind a big dent in your finger, go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li>After the 80/20 solution has dripped out of the unit, I keep a special set of towels to clean and dry the whole unit.</li>
            <li>and it has reduced my pockets by a large percentage.  </li>
            <li>If this unit ever wares out I will certainly purchase another.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the nth time and was quite satisfied with it until recently when it came in with a new design style.  </li>
            <li>On mid range intensity it does great job without piercing pinpoint jet of my previous one.</li>
            <li>and I returned it for a refund, because of the hassle of shipping, I chose to buy another locally and that one works just fine.</li>
            <li>The fittings are tight, the style is the same and it works great.</li>
            <li>A nice little version of a waterpik.  </li>
            <li>Note that, on the advice of my dentist, I fill mine with a little salt and warm water.  </li>
            <li>I took away a star because it tends to leak a little (they all do) and for the noise, but overall a great value.</li>
            <li>I never had a Waterpik with so much spray..</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>This Waterpik is well made, albeit plastic in the modern fashion.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and is well engineered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very, very noisy.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I am very hesitant to buy another Waterpik product.</li>
            <li>It has settings from gentle to really blast the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>This product was much cheaper than our Wal Mart store and the delivery was speedy too.</li>
            <li>Free shipping made a big difference.  </li>
            <li>If you put it on high it would cut your teeth out of your gums!  </li>
            <li>This water flosser is a fabulous addition to brushing and flossing as it blasts out debris from beneath bridges and in between teeth that sometimes get missed with traditional flossing.  </li>
            <li>And the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect much reliability from the device.</li>
            <li>Also it gets in between the teeth that are real close together with no problems.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this waterpik.</li>
            <li>However, it does splatter quite a bit, so you have to really lean close over the basin.  </li>
            <li>but I just really don&#x27;t like this water flosser routine.  </li>
            <li>My husband won&#x27;t floss so the waterpik has to do the whole job which it does.  </li>
            <li>and it did not work very well at all.  </li>
            <li>Daily use of my Waterpik is  an important part of my dental&lt;br /&gt;hygiene.</li>
            <li>THE WATER PIC HAS WORKED VERY WELL,  </li>
            <li>it is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I do not think this is to much of a problem.</li>
            <li>Sits on my counter without taking up too much room.</li>
            <li>and it was recommended by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Great machine for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>It worked really well until this week.  </li>
            <li>Either issue a statement about how to keep the units mold/fungus free or come out with a Waterpik \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; that meets our warranty needs and destroys these critters at the same time.</li>
            <li>It took about 2 days to get used to using it, but can see how much cleaner my teeth, gums and tongue are.&lt;br /&gt;Wished</li>
            <li>thanks for asking.</li>
            <li>I really like the waterpik</li>
            <li>The Waterpik works really well on my daughter&#x27;s braces.</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t use floss very well, and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really cleans his teeth, gums and mouth.  </li>
            <li>Has two tips and is very compact.  </li>
            <li>i also like the fact that the pressure is adjustable so that an individual can build up to the level that is comfortable for them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This do not come with a lid and who is going to use that much water at one time.  </li>
            <li>The sound of an antique tractor brings back fond memories for me.  </li>
            <li>The sound of an antique tractor brings back fond memories for me.  </li>
            <li>This one works really well.</li>
            <li>this works really well..</li>
            <li>Waterpik  used too be  really  quality product.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Over all I really like this Water Pik.  </li>
            <li>and really that is all that matters.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t remember when I started using a Waterpik  </li>
            <li>I finally put a washcloth under it to muffle the sound, otherwise, it does the job.</li>
            <li>This item has made my mouth much cleaner.</li>
            <li>but this has made the job so much easier.</li>
            <li>thank you so much and will use again.</li>
            <li>My son really needed this item goes well with the flossing he does according to the dentist.</li>
            <li>It meets all of my needs at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>It has 2 tips which is much appreciated (but the tongue cleaner makes me gag).  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it.  </li>
            <li>This order came very promptly.</li>
            <li>It takes a minutes to really set it for the water to pump, but otherwise it meet all of our expectations.  </li>
            <li>It just feels very cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it does its job, very well, I can&#x27;t complain with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using waterpik devices for years and this helps keep my dental cleaner from yelling too much at me .</li>
            <li>I wanted to give up on the whole task.  </li>
            <li>The whole assembly is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>It is a real POS...</li>
            <li>The pump is MUCH quieter.</li>
            <li>but this is a very noisy</li>
            <li>The tongue cleaner didn&#x27;t seem to do much</li>
            <li>I never have much plaque build up or need intense cleaning.</li>
            <li>So far has been a reliable and useful product.</li>
            <li>It is smaller and works better than the old model I had (which lasted over 8 years).</li>
            <li>Only gave it four stars because it doesn&#x27;t seem quite as strong as the older model.</li>
            <li>It is still basically the same as my old one except this one has a lot more power and comes with a tongue cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Now I have this new model and found it very usefull, as the first one I had</li>
            <li>Very useful especially if you have bridgework done.</li>
            <li>an \\&quot;old things are good, new things are bad\\&quot; kind of complainer, but in this case, the old simple design didn&#x27;t have much to it and was hard to break  </li>
            <li>If you have strong gums, you can have the water forced out strong.  </li>
            <li>This product works OK but not nearly as good as the old WP 60 with more setting for cleaning gums.</li>
            <li>would prefer it be made other than China because China made products seem to break more often.  </li>
            <li>Removes food particles between teeth better than tooth picks, brushes, floss, and any other means I have found.</li>
            <li>I think the second setting is plenty powerful, and any higher would be too intense</li>
            <li>Other than the hose, the machine is OK.  </li>
            <li>I owned  Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser before this one, I still prefer the original it has a larger water capacity</li>
            <li>You can not get a better cleaning &amp; gum masssge with any other device.  </li>
            <li>Cleans extremely well, easy to use and is consistently reliable.</li>
            <li>maybe the older waterpiks work but not the newer ones, Waterpik has really lowered its standards.</li>
            <li>Recently visited my dentist and he told me that my teeth were perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>I have an older model of this Waterpik Flosser that I have had for years and has worked very well.</li>
            <li>WELL TO CLEAN OUT THE BACK TEETH</li>
            <li>Much improved over older model.  </li>
            <li>The control for this is in the wand, and has too much power even on the low setting, because the pump is always running full bore.</li>
            <li>I have deep gums where the wisdom teeth were pulled and this gets this area clean.</li>
            <li>The unit is quite noisey, it&#x27;s kind of hard for my daughter, who&#x27;s 8, to manage on her own, the water sprays out of control it you don&#x27;t know how to manipulate the little button while it&#x27;s in your mouth.</li>
            <li>The pump seems to be pretty strong (see caution about this below), and the reservoir is large enough for me to pik my way between all the teeth in my mouth and still have water left over.  </li>
            <li>This particular device is very quiet, holds a suitable amount of water for proper cleaning, and does not leak at all.  </li>
            <li>The only problem with the new one is the reservoir doesn&#x27;t fit when it is turned over with the wand in place.</li>
            <li>The old one clicked distinctly into each of the five settings while the new one slips from one to another with just the slightest touch.  </li>
            <li>- it is not very noisy, easy to use, and I really like the lever that lets you adjust the pressure.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s responsible for saving what teeth I have left, and within a week of use it improves gum health tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Generally, these provide a very clean mouth experience, especially when used with a shot of mouthwash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of lazy with flossing</li>
            <li>However, after a week of doing so with this machine, adding the salt directly to the water, it clogged up, and I had to spend quite a while cleaning it and flushing the lines with hot water.  </li>
            <li>I let it cool off and tried it the next day.</li>
            <li>For years I paid $35 on average and now the price has jumped to $50 and more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty loud..</li>
            <li>It came with the tongue cleaner which is great, but only one flosser, but the ones I had from the older Water-Pik fit perfectly, so no loss there.</li>
            <li>Surely they cut down on bacteria, and odor, but they don&#x27;t stop plaque.    </li>
            <li>I read many reviews and some good and some bad.  </li>
            <li>Made more cheaply, less adustible, etc.</li>
            <li>Keep hoping they will find a better design that is less akward to use.</li>
            <li>It was fine at first, but I left it for three weeks unplugged to go on a trip, and when I got back it would not charge at all.  </li>
            <li>Wore my previous one out after more than 5 years.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than the previous two.</li>
            <li>Even better than the previous model that we had.  </li>
            <li>I read the information that came with the flosser, especially the Quick Start Guide.  </li>
            <li>I was one of the lucky ones, I got eight months   and two weeks use from my Waterpik WP-65 Personal Dental Water Jet.  </li>
            <li>Purchased as a replacement for an older model.  </li>
            <li>The competitor did not hold enough water to adequately flush out the deposits without having to refill it nor did it have the power the Waterpik&#x27;s have.</li>
            <li>I can send it back on my own expense and get partial refund.</li>
            <li>I had an older Waterpik and it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>We had an older Water Pik which we could no longer ge tthe parts for it.</li>
            <li>This cleans belter than the older models.  </li>
            <li>It sometimes requires time and effort to get the water hose properly coiled again and the top back in place.  </li>
            <li>I try and not press the handle button to stop the water flow but use the on off switch on the main unit.</li>
            <li>bought this to replace an older model of Waterpik Water Flosser.</li>
            <li>The older model&#x27;s tubing kept splitting because it had become brittle.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I wish someone would design and manufacture a decent product and put Waterpik out of its misery.</li>
            <li>But the main thing is, like someone else mentioned in another review.</li>
            <li>Older models the plastic tubing would get brittle and break.  </li>
            <li>This particular product was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>The older models of this type of Waterpik lasted years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Use a \\&quot;Sunbeam Hot Shot Hot Water Dispenser\\&quot;, to instantly make and dispense, a cup of boiling</li>
            <li>I had the older version of this model and it lasted for 7 years before beginning to leak.</li>
            <li>I particularly like this brand.</li>
            <li>well however it is very loud and vibrates too much.</li>
            <li>This seems to work well, was fairly priced and hopefully will last as long as the last one did.</li>
            <li>you are new to Waterpik and if there seems to be no flow, make sure you press down on the connecting parts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but the noise level can be a bit high.  </li>
            <li>This device is well built and is highly functional, but I consider it to have one drawback...</li>
            <li>/&gt;To take advantage of the high pressure you can.&lt;br /&gt;Clean the guck out around the sink</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t someone at WaterPik design a high quality and reliable product?</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the product to everyone.</li>
            <li>My dentist highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>I owned another waterpik for a few years that broke recently and replaced it with this one because i loved the old one so much.</li>
            <li>so I set it at high before I turned it on</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I reccomend this unt highly</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for anyone who has any gaps between teeth or implants that harbor food particles.</li>
            <li>I had a Waterpik in high school that I got because I had braces.  </li>
            <li>However, if you use it on a high setting and have fillings, be forewarned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works fine, as expected..</li>
            <li>Off switch could have been placed a little more accessable on the front of the machine , instead of the side.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, they expect you to stand the wand up inside this little recess in the reservoir when not in use.  </li>
            <li>a stronger water jet stream, the more expensive one claims to have 10 PSI higher water pressure than the original</li>
            <li>Not a problem, little to put up with for my healthy gums.</li>
            <li>This EXTREMELY picky consumer, STRONGLY recommends you buy this product.  </li>
            <li>My WaterPik was great -- I did not mind the noise and found that I ould contol the twisted coil hose by putting it in a cup between brushes.  </li>
            <li>Best price I found (without having to wait for 7 day auctions to end grrrr)</li>
            <li>Bottom line is despite the flaky quality the advantages in my radically improved gum health from using a waterpik (vs no waterpik) are so great that if I have to sadly toss one into the electronics recycling</li>
            <li>They really help keep my fixed bridge in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>This replaces my old one that died and works very well.</li>
            <li>The disadvantage of this one is that the top does not fit when you are through.</li>
            <li>This is the same as our old one which died after many years of faithful daily use.  </li>
            <li>I get about 3 years out of these things before they have to be chucked, but that&#x27;s only $12 a year, so worth it.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with Waterpik&#x27;s latest model, the WP-100, which touts to have the same water capacity, measured in seconds as the WP-65, which is definitely not the case and clearly a marketing deception as the capacity is listed as 900s, as in 900 seconds each tankful.</li>
            <li>I always brush my teeth at least twice a day with a good electric toothbrush, and I flossed occasionally, so I couldn&#x27;t imagine there was that much gunk between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>There are, however, a few caveats to this goofy contraption:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is our second such device; the first one served us well for more than ten years.  </li>
            <li>If not careful, you could dump the reservoir full of water because you can actually lift up the whole unit with the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read many reviews about WaterPiks, the Conair model, and a few others.  </li>
            <li>Looks like everything&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>For being $35 I would expect material to be stronger and more firm..</li>
            <li>Stay away from the smaller unit niot as powerful.</li>
            <li>Before long I had mine at full force with no problem at all</li>
            <li>ZeroWater ZD-010 10-Cup Pitcher, with a fresh filter, to make local utility provided water that measures 0 to 3 on the TDS meter (that comes with the pitcher).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way it pulses and cleans stuff out that is trapped between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if the tubing will break, but overall it is definitely worth getting some type of waterpik.</li>
            <li>The new unit will require a little more counter space in our bathroom, but I have some hope (based on the large number of positive reviews) that it will last longer.</li>
            <li>The new Waterppik is much lighter than our old one.</li>
            <li>I thought the new model would be much quieter than the old one, it is not.  </li>
            <li>My old flosser did not work very well, even when it was new -</li>
            <li>The water tank is large enough to clean all my teeth without having to re-fill it like smaller units.</li>
            <li>Have been pleased with the WaterPik so far (in use less than a month).  </li>
            <li>(I fixed this with a rubber band and may super glue the next handle on high).&lt;br</li>
            <li>But your return policy was right on no problems with the second one.</li>
            <li>But if this one lasts as long as its predecessor, I&#x27;ll count myself lucky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only way that my mouth feels really, truly refreshed in the morning - that is to say, my teeth and tongue do not taste either like morning grossness, nor does it taste like toothpaste or mouthwash, and instead my mouth simply feels clean with the use of this product.</li>
            <li>Then you will have to throw the unit out and buy another one because they design it so you can&#x27;t fix or replace the hose, so plan on buying a new one every year or two.</li>
            <li>I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips.</li>
            <li>I just started using my new Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>The cost of repairing the hose almost equals the cost of a new unit, so I always end up buying one.  </li>
            <li>The new one is not as noisy as the olderone, and I like the lever on the side that can adjust the pressure.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Hope they make them like they used to, we&#x27;ll find out with this new one.</li>
            <li>I wish they would have included their new under-the-gum spout and that they would re-issure the multi-holed sprayer that used to come with the appliance.  </li>
            <li>This new Water Pik</li>
            <li>I had to refill the new WP-100&#x27;s water container twice</li>
            <li>all the Waterpik&#x27;s we&#x27;ve owned, 3 WP-65&#x27;s and 1 WP-100, we&#x27;ve learn each time something new about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this new model in 2012 and am writing this review in 2014.&lt;br /&gt;Within six months the model started choking.</li>
            <li>I live in a city that has some of the cleanest water in the country.</li>
            <li>They sent a new head tube unit</li>
            <li>new Waterpik</li>
            <li>new Waterpik</li>
            <li>We have used a WaterPik for years and, when we needed a new one, bought this.</li>
            <li>live in an apartment.  </li>
            <li>My new Waterpik is lighter weight, quieter, and easier to connect the water basin to the unit.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was so eager to use this to floss her new braces.  </li>
            <li>This for me is a can&#x27;t live without product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I will order because it&#x27;s cheaper than a new unit.</li>
            <li>I returned it for a new one, and it stopped working after about six weeks.</li>
            <li>The new one.</li>
            <li>I always had to put the handle down to refill despite that I had a huge glass of warm water with mouthwash already prepared to be dumped and no matter what I did with all the sliding and things I was trying to hold, the second refill always spilled outside the more narrow water well (more narrow than the WP-65) making a big mess to clean on the countertop now too in addition to everything</li>
            <li>So, when my last purchase died a month ago, I went ahead and ordered one with the reasonable expectation that this 2012 edition would be pretty much the same as the older ones.  </li>
            <li>The top doesn&#x27;t fit easily on the base.  </li>
            <li>I previously spent about $18 a month replacing sprinkler heads and now I just clean them and re-install them.</li>
            <li>Purchased mine in 2013 and have used it every night since; essential part of my bed-time ritual and it gets my whole mouth much cleaner than floss + brushing.</li>
            <li>The only thing that bothers me about it is that it is not as powerful as the old one I had.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I think this was a great buy and have since become addicted to water piking my teeth on a very regular basis.</li>
            <li>This waterpik is small enough to be portable and transportable and large enough to hold a good rinse.  </li>
            <li>VERY loud.</li>
            <li>This is also very loud which could be an issue for apartment dwellers.</li>
            <li>The spray was very powerful and actually \\&quot;hurt\\&quot;, especially when it was by my tooth with a crown.   </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a very old Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>So we took another stab and bought a new one, exact same problem.  </li>
            <li>This newly designed version has a bigger housing than the original ones and the design of the handle is different.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully this will last 7 years like the first.</li>
            <li>Have used this one for about a month; replaced one that was 20 years old!</li>
            <li>I only had &#x27;leaks&#x27; the first couple days.</li>
            <li>This treatment worked the first two times but on the third try it was unsuccessful.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li>If you have an old water pick fix it!</li>
            <li>But once you get used to doing that it has more pressure than the ones in the past.</li>
            <li>I see many other reviewers had the same problem.  </li>
            <li>There are other brands in the market, but I recommend the original Water-Pik from Teledyne.</li>
            <li>In all fairness I bought a WaterPik unit almost 15 years ago and it lasted until this year, in spite of the fact that it was used by two teen-agers and an adult!</li>
            <li>The basic system is superb on all my teeth and essential on those that snag uncomfortable bits of food.  </li>
            <li>This one broke exactly 2 months later in August 2013.  </li>
            <li>Pretty simple design.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would go with the Waterpik name in that I have had their products in the past and got many years of use out of it.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a third step after first flossing with dental floss and brushing.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>the new WP65 is almost identical to my old WP60, but the motor is significantly quieter (yea!), and the power from the nozzle is a bit less (boo!).  </li>
            <li>First decent one I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
            <li>Like so loud that if you live in an apartment and do your teeth at 11:30 pm you will wake your neighbors</li>
            <li>far the new machine does work well</li>
            <li>Free flowing, less nosiy and graduated force control.</li>
            <li>But it galls me to know that the company saved money on the manufacturing with the light weight and then saved another 1 cent (or less) to reduce the length of the power cord.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Waterpiks for more than 20 years and on average I&#x27;d say they last 3-4 years.</li>
            <li>After just 3 days, it starts giving very loud noise -- as loud as a lawn-mower .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When the new one arrived I was excited to get started with it because of a few new features.</li>
            <li>It is also used to clean surfaces to a squeaky clean, so it doesn&#x27;t leave residue behind.</li>
            <li>All I can say is this removed much more debris from my teeth than traditional flossing, and in much less time.</li>
            <li>It worked fine shooting the water through, but there seemed to be only a very weak or a very strong pulse; therefore, when I wanted it on the medium setting (#3), the force was the same as on the high setting.</li>
            <li>This product has been around for a long time without any essential design or construction changes except that it is now made in China whereas it was originally made in America.  </li>
            <li>Water container is large enough so you don&#x27;t have to keep refilling at one session.</li>
            <li>The machine has a large tank for holding mouthwash or the like and comes with several mouthpieces.</li>
            <li>Large reservoir to hold enough water/mouthwash mixture to service two people.       </li>
            <li>instructions said to use the lowest setting initially, which certainly made sense.  </li>
            <li>- The best money I&#x27;ve spent in a very long time&lt;br /&gt;- Some of my teeth are very close together and it&#x27;s difficult to floss</li>
            <li>but I like the looks of OralBreeze (not near as noisy and not doesn&#x27;t look like very much there to break), and will probably avoid buying another WaterPik....    Message to WaterPik:  </li>
            <li>I have a nasal nozzle (a little alliteration) from the old one that doesn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>It works wonderfully to remove food particles behind the hard to get to wisdom teeth.  </li>
            <li>One thing I do after I use any type of mouthwash in the reservoir is afterwards I put in clear water and run it for 15-20 seconds to get the mouthwash out of the system.</li>
            <li>The machine is much, much too loud as to opposed last one I had.</li>
            <li>I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A CLEAR ACRYLIC COLOR RATHER THAN</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old, my dentist said I have the teeth of a 30 year old.</li>
            <li>The product performs satisfactorily so far.</li>
            <li>To preface this, let&#x27;s remember I am not a dentist and have zero professional training in dental care,</li>
            <li>I hear alot of people complain that the waterpik is so loud - and it is -</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old</li>
            <li>Unit seems far too bulky for what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>I decided to continue trying to use it when it worked until it stopped working completely, now because the pause button on the handle is not responding.</li>
            <li>No complainst thus far, and dont expect any..</li>
            <li>my old water pik  has been discarded.</li>
            <li>Its considerably cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely loud, however, so</li>
            <li>The WP-65 replaced my six year old</li>
            <li>WP-70 on which the hose had finally developed a leak I couldn&#x27;t fix.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>So far there is no leakage of water from anywhere on the unit, but that may come with time.</li>
            <li>As a dental office manager I can tell you first hand that these waterpik water flossers save people time and money in the long run.</li>
            <li>It is loud</li>
            <li>After four months the motor quit completely.</li>
            <li>then my old Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>My old Professor from Colorado State U (he invented it with his dentist) would not have approved with charging $99 for something that used to cost $1 for the old machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We thought because it was old.  </li>
            <li>It was extremely loud that my neighbor would hear it.  </li>
            <li>You would be surprised by the amount of debris that is hiding at your gum line that brushing (even power brushing) can&#x27;t remove.</li>
            <li>You also gain the benefit of having your gums massaged by the pulsating action.</li>
            <li>I had to throw it away this week because the tube became brittle and cracked near the handle unit, and there is no way to replace that piece itself.</li>
            <li>Note this is NOT the 20 year old model that others say lasted so well.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for our old unit which lasted 10+ years.  </li>
            <li>This flossed cleans in between teeth with no harsh pulsation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about 1/2 the weight of my old unit which lasted 8 years.  </li>
            <li>I had to cut off the cord from my old unit and</li>
            <li>I use the regular WP-65 tips for them without a problem and the hygienist mentioned that I keep that wire all-around cleaner than any of their patients.</li>
            <li>this replaced my old unit.</li>
            <li>I pried open the handle gently.</li>
            <li>and repaired my old Waterpik and have been using it since with no problems.</li>
            <li>You can read my review on this hose repair kit with handle and it tells you how I did it as the instructions that came with it would not work as my old hose was to brittle.</li>
            <li>both it and the old pump are loud.</li>
            <li>If you have an old water pick fix it!000A8EHU6 WaterPik hose repair kit with handle.]</li>
            <li>and repaired my old Waterpik and have been using it since with no problems.</li>
            <li>You can read my review on this hose repair kit with handle and it tells you how I did it as the instructions that came with it would not work as my old hose was to brittle.</li>
            <li>both it and the old pump are loud.</li>
            <li>Starts out pumping immediately unlike my old one that needed priming each time.  </li>
            <li>Loud?  </li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s loud, but I grew up around farm machinery, so I&#x27;m used to it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I feel like a freak, huddled over the sink, a loud buzzing in my ear, and water pouring out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Loud?  </li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s loud, but I grew up around farm machinery, so I&#x27;m used to it.  </li>
            <li>a loud buzzing in my ear, and water pouring out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this product is completely unusable for anyone who lives in an apartment.  </li>
            <li>This was a replacement of one I had for about 4 - 5 years:  the hose developed a pinhole leak.  </li>
            <li>While I can appreciate that it must be both flexible and capable of containing the water pressure created by the pump so the hose materials are crucial.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot lighter than my old one maybe because the old one is about 25yrs</li>
            <li>I bought this when my old Waterpik bit the dust after 15 years.  </li>
            <li>this was a replacement for a wp-20 that died from old age 15</li>
            <li>so it seems like a no-brainer as far as dental hygiene (thank God for spell checker on that one...</li>
            <li>It cleans out all  the food between my teeth that even brushing does not do completely.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is how much space it takes up.</li>
            <li>and I have had no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>By the afternoon, all of the remaining liquid, apx 1/2 inch had drained completely out all over the sink and onto the floor.  </li>
            <li>Wantebeen improvedd it to replace 20 year old unit that died.</li>
            <li>Wow is it loud.</li>
            <li>I thought my Oster beehive blender was loud, but if you got that item and this going at once you&#x27;d probably be rockin&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have purchased probably six so far, all became throwaways.</li>
            <li>old Waterpik.</li>
            <li>Also, the price has jumped considerably.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>the wand doesn&#x27;t go back in very well</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it or at least buy it at a reputable store when you can return it.</li>
            <li>It made the whole vanity shake, and you could hear it all over the house.&lt;br /&gt;Spend an extra couple bucks and get the wp100.</li>
            <li>This product works like a dream and my 5 yr old enjoys using it as well</li>
            <li>I now wish I had kept the old one.  </li>
            <li>My teeth hadn&#x27;t been professionally cleaned in about 6 years.</li>
            <li>, that was 3 years old before it died.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I noticed the &#x27;kids model&#x27; WP-260 has far fewer one-star reviews as a percentage.</li>
            <li>one thing I don&#x27;t care about it, it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li>well I think, though it&#x27;s embarrassingly loud in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Bought it to replace one that was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this from Bed Bath and was really looking forward to getting started on my journey back to gum health .</li>
            <li>I object, not only to the cost of replacing my Water Pik every few years, but also to the effect on the environment of discarding so many of these machines.</li>
            <li>The flosser is powerful enough for daily use and seems to be holding up.</li>
            <li>First it was, you have to flush the mouthwash out of it (not doing that killed our first unit).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had if I hadn&#x27;t broken the fitting on the head by using too much pressure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a good job cleaning out particles but the water container is difficult to keep on the input and the flosser needs to have a lower spray for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Start on the top row, far front side and slowly move the pick forward and around your teeth at the gumline.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned with the lightness of this new flosser as the first two were much heavier.  </li>
            <li>I have an older version of the WaterPik that is much simpler in design, and limited in versatility.   </li>
            <li>I also prefer the higher pressure &amp; steady flow as opposed to the WaterPik&#x27;s \\&quot;rat-tat-tat\\&quot; pulsating pressure flow, but I also think if I&#x27;d kept using WaterPik, by now I would&#x27;ve had to order another replacement; these new models just don&#x27;t seem to last very long.    </li>
            <li>Effecive product to clean gums and in between tight spaces of teeth.  </li>
            <li>I do feel that WaterPik could easily correct this problem with a small spring stiffener at the handle if they wanted to</li>
            <li>We had a waterpik for years but wanted a new one for our new bathroom- big mistake</li>
            <li>Still no doubt that this little baby is getting the gum line clean.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day after smoothie time and this thing blasts out all of the little fruit and vegetable bits hiding in my mouth and leaves my teeth sparkling clean.  </li>
            <li>It becomes very top heavy and leaks a little around the gasket every time you put it on or take it off.  </li>
            <li>This powerful and efficient machine does, extremely well, the job it is designed for.</li>
            <li>Often times if you have a deep enough sink; gravity will do most of the work for you if you point the pik down into the sink.</li>
            <li>When I got it to the point that no more was coming out, I used the unit and it was fine.</li>
            <li>The water tank is easy to use; we normally put in two small glasses of water and when we are done, we let the hose drop into the sink and the water left in the container drains out into the sink.  </li>
            <li>My experience has shown that if I floss first and Waterpik second, I actually get out material the floss missed.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a much older waterpik that finally died.</li>
            <li>It has the same power as the older models.</li>
            <li>I actually have no pros for this, except that once you get it working, it does the intended job, but by the time I get to that part, the air is pretty blue.</li>
            <li>This is my second one my first one finally gave out after about 8 yrs</li>
            <li>I did find a cool little battery operated brush (no name brand).</li>
            <li>Maneuvering the water container on top of the assembly so that it is tightly in place at the fitting where the water runs through is so difficult to do that</li>
            <li>then it will be necessary to prime at a high setting.</li>
            <li>I use a low power to flush out debris and then a high power for removing plaque.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik at high speed seems to pulverize plaque, which then can be rinsed or brushed away.  </li>
            <li>I chose it for its varible settings, especially the high ones.</li>
            <li>You have to keep moving it from low to high to try to find one that works.  </li>
            <li>It is very noisy and the pressure gauge goes from too low at lowest setting to too much and next low setting.  </li>
            <li>The old WaterPik I had lasted for years, and when I finally broke I replaced it with this new model.  </li>
            <li>Unit is reliable, sound is the same as previous models, works well.</li>
            <li>Flossing is very important; but often regular string floss can miss those hard to get pieces of food.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the noise is unavoidable based on how the motor works, but I don&#x27;t think that is a reasonable excuse.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is loud and bulky, but I have to laugh at the other commenter who tries to get the whole apparatus under the tap --</li>
            <li>But I usually wipe it down with a clean cloth after use because excess moisture can quickly lead to grime.  </li>
            <li>This little gadget quickly gets rid of in between bits no tooth brush can reach.  </li>
            <li>Canister is large enough to do the entire mouth.</li>
            <li>Except for the color of the reservoir, this one is the same as and cost $15 less than I paid for the original.  </li>
            <li>Almost a machine gun sound for a lack of a better description - and uncomfortable to the ears while your head is bent down near it.  </li>
            <li>I had to struggle with it to push it down enough times so that it finally seated well enough that after turning the switch on, some water was able to come through the hand flosser tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This would seem a more efficient way of accomplishing the same thing, without the mess, and without the minor assembly</li>
            <li>I returned to a local repair shop who told me they don&#x27;t repair this equipment but return it to Waterpik who should send me a new one.</li>
            <li>I expect this new one to do the same.</li>
            <li>I had it by the 5th day of using the WP-100, contacted Amazon who accepted it back without a problem as I exchanged it for a new WP-65.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to order some extra piks, because the problem with my old one is that the pik broke, and I can&#x27;t replace it, because the old size is different from the new ones.  </li>
            <li>Top pressure may be slightly less than my previous old waterpik (would no longer hold a nozzle - stated blowing off</li>
            <li>for a personal water pic, it is much too big.  </li>
            <li>My only dissappointment is that I expected to receive 3 distinct tips, including a Pik Pocket tip.  </li>
            <li>Regularly maintaining it really makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li>hope it last as long as the first one I bought years ago.</li>
            <li>Fixed my old Waterpik but had to do a different install&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fixed my old Waterpik but had to do a different install&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, this is really the only &amp;#34;realistic&amp;#34; way for our kids to floss around their braces on a daily basis!</li>
            <li>My old, brand X, water flosser died after about 5 years of near daily use.  </li>
            <li>We have a 25 year old water pik and a 5 year old one in a different bathroom.</li>
            <li>Some people complained about the pressure of the water being too strong, but I almost think it is like a gum massage.  </li>
            <li>The water tub does not fit onto the bottom assembly firmly at all, and everything else kind of teeters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I assume that since I am getting between the teeth and down below the gums I am doing it right.</li>
            <li>I have to balance it on the sink since the cord is short and will not reach very far.</li>
            <li>I give major credit to Water pik.</li>
            <li>and I believe that the use of Water Piks has been a major factor in helping me to maintain the condition of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I have now only had the product for two months and it already needs completely replaced!</li>
            <li>Problem is that the stub of the old hose is brittle and cracks not long after the repair.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many of these in the past few years for this very reason.  </li>
            <li>My previous Waterpik had a nice sturdy cover with a little lidded insert in which a number of extra tools could be stored.</li>
            <li>The fact that it weighs about half of the old one should&#x27;ve been the first tell-tale sign that something is going to be messed up.  </li>
            <li>But...I do have solid experience in engineering, and the hard and social sciences, and I LOVE the \\&quot;WaterPik</li>
            <li>The new one is similar to the old one seems to work about the same.</li>
            <li>The new one offers more convenient (though not perfect) placement of controls and movable parts.  </li>
            <li>Shame on Waterpik for this cost cutting while at the same time charging more and taking advantage of its loyal customers.</li>
            <li>the older models lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, the wattage has gone down to half of what it used to be and consequently there is just not enough pressure to do any decent job.  </li>
            <li>Though WaterPik seems to offer better irrigating performance than other brands when the products work, I am beginning to believe that WaterPik&#x27;s quality and durability are poor, and I wish there were a higher quality, good-performing alternative.</li>
            <li>The little motor gives out and they are really worth the price.</li>
            <li>Make sure the reservoir is pressed down tightly onto the pic so that it seals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Waterpik sent me a new unit, but since the first one failed so quickly, I can no longer recommend them.</li>
            <li>Finally, the blue plastic cover/supply reservoir is less strong than the white one of the WP-60.  </li>
            <li>And incidentally, if you&#x27;re plagued by halitosis (bad breath), cleaning under the gumline AND cleaning the tongue itself are both great ways to fight that problem, and you can do both with this flosser.  </li>
            <li>Before I take a look at the product and the quality itself, let&#x27;s talk Waterpiks in general.</li>
            <li>This has done wonders for my gums and general tooth health.</li>
            <li>If you could replace the pump/hose assembly reasonably, these things would last a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use it after meal if possible to clear out food between teeth.</li>
            <li>If they gave it a 6 month warranty, I would not had expected so much.  </li>
            <li>This one shoots out water in a pulsing action and they say to set it at its highest speed to prime the unit before each use so you are likely to get sprayed and spray your bathroom while you&#x27;re at it.  </li>
            <li>The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the insanely loud tractor noise this thing pumps out.</li>
            <li>Because I have sensitive gums there are enough speeds</li>
            <li>I was loosing the dental hygiene battle because I could not tolerate flossing, so I barely remembered to do it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kinda loud since this is a tiny machine.  </li>
            <li>During his next visit to the dentist he was told he&#x27;d made a marked improvement.</li>
            <li>it is a very simple design.&lt;br /&gt;Could have been fixed parts</li>
            <li>The deep cleaning and gum massage promote soft tissue health.  </li>
            <li>We have been using a Waterpik for decades when our old one finally died.</li>
            <li>Only used by one adult in the household.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as loud as my last waterpik</li>
            <li>As near as I could tell, it was designed to snap back it.  </li>
            <li>The old waterpik finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>HOSES WILL CRACK NEAR THE PULSATOR UNIT, IT IS INEVITABLE.</li>
            <li>My old one finally gave out after 20 years of service!  </li>
            <li>Noticeably, the design has barely changed.</li>
            <li>and while there is some extra water that needs to be wiped away at the edge of the sink, this is far from messy and, I believe, well worth adding for improved protection against gum problems.</li>
            <li>This one was the least expensive and had best overall design and performance capability.  </li>
            <li>it is worth having a few of this for the family.</li>
            <li>When my first unit broke down, I bought an inalambric model.</li>
            <li>The motor now runs hot enough to produce the odor characteristic of burning insulation, which renders it a possible inhalation and fire hazard.</li>
            <li>There seems to be left only the choices of doing without or purchase a new unit.  </li>
            <li>New models apparently only last weeks.</li>
            <li>It needed to be returned to an \\&quot;authorized repair\\&quot;, which luckily was only a few miles away</li>
            <li>Sadly the controls for low pressure are not well calibrated so it quickly gets too powerful and at low pressure settings result in the pump being VERY loud.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought broke in less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li>how much less there was now as when she had first seen me a month before.</li>
            <li>Works OK but has sloppy design and/or manufacturing.</li>
            <li>It is slick and quick.  </li>
            <li>There is no good in between setting as all others are way too strong.</li>
            <li>Where the 2 black things  connect , are not making the proper connection, for the water to flow out right.</li>
            <li>This continued for about a week, some days getting more or less, but never a full spray ON ANY SETTING!  </li>
            <li>I hope other people will buy them also very soon.</li>
            <li>Our dental hygenist recommended it and our recent exams prove how useful this little wonder is.</li>
            <li>The other minor gripe is that the holder for the want is right under the water container</li>
            <li>Our first waterpik jammed within the first week, and we opened it up and pushed the little gear back in place several times.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally, I get tired and just floss real quick.</li>
            <li>The second failed because of my own error.  </li>
            <li>I thought perhaps the little motor was getting too hot</li>
            <li>The wand has a sloppy swival connection where the quick release coupling is connected to the main body of the wand.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I made a total mess...</li>
            <li>This product replaced my WaterPik personal unit which lasted barely 3 years.</li>
            <li>I have used waterpiks for a long time and this was a replacement for my old one that wore out.</li>
            <li>The second lasted barely a month.  </li>
            <li>When priming before use, the water dribbled out in tiny droplets at the lower setting and barely streamed in the highest setting.</li>
            <li>As a mature adult, I was concerned that I was having to get braces and after dealing with my children&#x27;s experiences with braces (almost 20 years ago), I knew that I had to be really careful about daily cleaning.  </li>
            <li>If so, they have no excuse for not doing a lot of research to improve their product.  </li>
            <li>I  hope it works as long as the old one and a lot longer than the 2 year warranty...</li>
            <li>If you have never used a water pik before, be prepared for a messy first experience.</li>
            <li>At first it was a messy learning proccess (should come with goggles,lol)</li>
            <li>A little blood at first is only clots being released....</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t have as much pressure as previous models.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend using it in the shower the first few times to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>is the surface is not flat.</li>
            <li>Appears this 260 &#x27;kids model&#x27; is exactly the same (except green plastic trim rather than blue) as the $79.99 WP-300 &#x27;Traveller&#x27; model...</li>
            <li>Having owned a Waterpik since the 1980s, I expected when I received this new model it would be lesser in design and build.</li>
            <li>The reservoir seems to seat securely on this model, and water did not leak on the counter, which has been a problem with other models and brands in the past.  </li>
            <li>it can get a lot more stuff broken loose from your gumline than flossing will ever do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months now, using it nightly, and other than getting oriented to a new product</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to not get wet as you use it; but, not having food impacted between your teeth is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Set it on a lower pressure when you first start using it - it can be very forceful and a little uncomfortable at first.</li>
            <li>That can be good or bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> This WaterPik is every bit as good as the one I bought in the 1970&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this device since it thoroughly cleans all areas between the teeth and under the gum lines.  </li>
            <li> Good design of attachment and wand storage.       </li>
            <li> The price was extremely good.    </li>
            <li> I heard how good this unit is.  </li>
            <li> use it twice a day really good</li>
            <li> However, it does a good job of cleaning between your teeth</li>
            <li> fair price, too.</li>
            <li> does good job of remooving food particles.</li>
            <li> has a good capacity for water.</li>
            <li> This is a good design for the waterpik.  </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> This product started out working good.</li>
            <li> Good machine for the price</li>
            <li> Tips don&#x27;t attach easily--overall does a good job</li>
            <li> Since the Waterpik idea is so good, I guess I will just have to buy another one.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the plastic nozzle seemed not as good.  </li>
            <li> Noisy, but good pressure.  </li>
            <li> WATERPIK DOES A GOOD JOB OF CLEANING  AFTER 1 YEAR, WATERPIK KEEPS TRIPPING MY GFIC CIRCUIT</li>
            <li> It works good</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> We feel like the price was good and the poduct works well.</li>
            <li> Good price at Amazon, no hassle swift delivery.  </li>
            <li> i have never been a good flosser and this has been my friend</li>
            <li> Unbelievably good product.</li>
            <li> I can brush my teeth real good, then floss and rinse and feel clean.  </li>
            <li> The waterpik water flosser has helped keep my teeth and braces so clean that my dental hygienist was impressed.</li>
            <li> It works great and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This one looks nice, and is fairly compact, and has a good range of spray pressures.  </li>
            <li> I had one many years ago and am happy to be using this product again.  </li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great price better</li>
            <li> I have owned this for two or three years and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Some are great with it, many are like me and can&#x27;t stand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and the price made it a worthwhile purchase ...</li>
            <li> am very satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> very pleased with its use</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> excellent product, worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this WaterPik&#x27;s performance until now.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The switch on the handle was shot from the rigorous cleaning it got and quite honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the mold/fungus was 100% out of the inside of the unit, so I was happy to replace</li>
            <li> Thank you very much and best wishes to you all.&lt;br /&gt;Aloha, George</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, right on time.</li>
            <li> Used the water pik for years - does a great job, easy to use, very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have never been better!</li>
            <li> I kept flossing and then did the Water Pik and got even more out!</li>
            <li> -65 does a much better job!</li>
            <li> My husband and I love it!  </li>
            <li> This one looks good, but it&#x27;s operation is erratic, someimes feels like it&#x27;s about to conk out, but it hasn&#x27;t, so far so good, but not the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It is so much more effective than floss!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied though!</li>
            <li> This thing makes more noise than a garbage truck backing up!</li>
            <li> (like so many products!)</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The adjustable strength of the water stream is easy to adjust on the fly.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was great and replaced it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The dentist used to probe my gums for &amp;#34;pockets,&amp;#34; not the most pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazing when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well wherever it is set.  </li>
            <li> So, now I bought my children their own waterpik and sent one to son in college along with getting myself one.  </li>
            <li> someone mentioned that Panasonic has it&#x27;s own oral irrigator.........</li>
            <li> She ha used them some years ago and found them to be quite effective.</li>
            <li> This is also good to maintain healthy gums.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a nice deal.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is fill the reservoir with warm water and put the mouth piece in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power for a through cleaning, Holds plenty of water, and a nice assortment of PICS.</li>
            <li> I sue warm water</li>
            <li> Adjustable pressure switch on the wand is nice.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how effective the flosser is in removing food particles that remain after brushing.</li>
            <li> If you still plan to by one, all I can say is be warned, and own a house.</li>
            <li> Two things are not so nice.  </li>
            <li> but i liked the wp-20</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have that problem with the plug in kind.</li>
            <li> The holders for the attachments are handy.</li>
            <li> It seems like a good product, as I had one of these that lasted for many years.</li>
            <li> I own one already and purchased this one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> so my husband and I each have our own.  </li>
            <li> I think it will make a nice gift, but it was not for myself.</li>
            <li> This item is nice and compact, but on the load side.  </li>
            <li> the decibels of a Motley Crue concert  circa1988.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it with warm water &amp; mouth wash.</li>
            <li> There was no way to replace it except for some kind of home repair.  </li>
            <li> Would purchase again nice size also thank u</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see anything I liked.</li>
            <li> My dentist is very impressed on how much healthier my gums are now</li>
            <li> Not as good as the old model (which was really excellent)</li>
            <li> but the competing products are worse.&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as the old model (which was really excellent)</li>
            <li> PERFECT HIGH QUALITY ITEM AND LOVE THE TRAVEL WATERPIK!</li>
            <li> I like it as its suitable for many ages, come with good package and nice item, would order again.</li>
            <li> This model is the older one and the best.  </li>
            <li> When you have the time to use it, it works great to make your teeth feel truly clean.</li>
            <li> good,  it is useful good,  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and has been working great for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> The disign is compact and its VERY easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The water force can be adjusted and on the highest setting is very strong...</li>
            <li> Quality is good and it works fine.</li>
            <li> We replaced it with the ConAir, lower rated but more effective.</li>
            <li> (2) the handle controller of jet force were more effective and discernible.</li>
            <li> It has kept my gums in good condition, and that&#x27;s important because gum disease has been linked to infection and inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great while it lasts.</li>
            <li> Give us real clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have used many waterpiks over the years and liked all, unfortunatley not this one.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li> This is a really good device to clean stains in between teeth....</li>
            <li> I am so happy I did, works great, simple to use.</li>
            <li> I mix about 3/4 warm water with 1/4 fluoride mouth wash for that fresh-from-the-dentist-but-no-copay kind of clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit continues to operate very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Cleans debris between teeth very effectively, but the unit is very, very noisy.  </li>
            <li> This is made very cheaply.</li>
            <li> Nice strong jet.</li>
            <li> However, if I were to buy again, this is the model for me because it is effective, practical and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I used for years, butr more effective and equally easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought the better unit: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GLRREU/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 .</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> These things work okay for a while</li>
            <li> Your dentist will be impressed and your teeth will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> worked ok for abot a year</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the waterpik.  </li>
            <li> love the power</li>
            <li> *Be sure that the tip you are looking for is for the model you choose, as not all waterpiks tools are interchangeable--</li>
            <li> Many studies will state that the Waterpik does not get everything that flossing would.</li>
            <li> My experience disagrees with these studies and my visits with the dentist are actually better now with the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for quality, it is a plastic system with a motor, nothing terribly sophisticated about it</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t expect it to last more than two or three years at best.</li>
            <li> , I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> In most cases I have had to replace the units because of leaks in the hose.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.      </li>
            <li> It provides better removal of food particles than dental floss by a mile.</li>
            <li> May be it is time to design a more practical one.  </li>
            <li> This makes sure there is not any build up in the lines.  </li>
            <li> The latest one leaks water</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many water pik</li>
            <li> I saw the x-rays and all the teeth roots are healthy, no cavities.    </li>
            <li> I love my waterpik</li>
            <li> The product was great and fast service .</li>
            <li> This one seems to work better.  </li>
            <li> A two year warranty led me to believe this is a mugh better product than I thought.  </li>
            <li> The WaterPik works much better than floss for me...</li>
            <li> This is my latest replacement and it works as well or better than all of the others I have owned over the years.  </li>
            <li> The Water Pik seems just as reliable to me as the one I used many years ago</li>
            <li> With this product I would say I am 90% pleased.</li>
            <li> It cleans between your teeth a lot better than flossing.</li>
            <li> Also it would be better if they had the pressure control on the unit instead of handle.</li>
            <li> I love WaterPik products.</li>
            <li> and I still love my WP-65 WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> a go suggested I use one and have for many years.  </li>
            <li> many alternatives, so I keep spending money on this brand.</li>
            <li> I mix lots of water, with several tablespoons of Listerine--nearly filling the WaterPik&#x27;s reservoir (all quite UNscientifically), and repeatedly, remain abundantly impressed with the junk this baby removes--</li>
            <li> Im glad</li>
            <li> Gums are better too.</li>
            <li> MFR CLAIMED I SHOULD EXERCISE MORE CARE IN RINSING AND USING.</li>
            <li> It flushes more particles</li>
            <li> Just make sure there&#x27;s a tip on the flosser if you leave water in it, or it will leak.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> After many years of service it died.</li>
            <li> what more would you expect?</li>
            <li> (instructions say they are safe for that use).  </li>
            <li> my teeth are &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; and more food debris is coming out in the rinse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t looked at many alternatives yet,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a good extra thing to do, and can be a great help if you have to deal with braces or hard-to-reach spots where food tends to get stuck.</li>
            <li> I have dentures, top and bottom.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this WATERPIK.</li>
            <li> ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION WITH STANDARD SHIPPING IN A TIMELY MANNER.</li>
            <li> made in USA is my favorite</li>
            <li> Mfg should made a better quality.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> Therefore, I was more satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The glass nozzle is sometimes balky at fitting into the clamp.  </li>
            <li> Now the teeth will be ok.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Great product and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion - More plastic in landfill than needed because wear parts not user replaceable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what all the reports say that flossing is better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, one more con which dentists and orthodontists discourage using the Waterpik,</li>
            <li> Just ordered two more because I did NOT like Model WP-660.</li>
            <li> The latest version is lighter and quieter than predecessors.</li>
            <li> Most of the devices you find in stores now have all the bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> Many people have this problem with this model.  </li>
            <li> Read more reviews and watch video online about replacing the hose.    </li>
            <li> I do sort-of wish it had a top cover to keep stuff from falling into the water reservior</li>
            <li> I like it better.  </li>
            <li> I love the waterflosser results</li>
            <li> Love this one, replaced a cordless one with this and like this one a lot better.  </li>
            <li> It has more power and leaves my mouth feeling like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took somewhat longer to get delivery, but i am pleased using it.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for many years before it wore out.  </li>
            <li> In that case, perhaps more R&amp;D needs to go into this technology before products are placed on the market.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> It holds more water and has much better pressure.</li>
            <li> A good range of useful attachments to enhance oral hygiene.       </li>
            <li> This is a great product and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> I am very conscientious with my great electric toothbrush and flossing; however, this thing makes my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have</li>
            <li> Have used one for many years and had to replace it.</li>
            <li> This one has way more pressure than needed</li>
            <li> Pressure is greater.</li>
            <li> I have many caps</li>
            <li> so I must maintain healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> I always seem to get more water on the mirror than I do in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> but I now love it</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This unit works much better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> finally figured out how to hook it up and every thing is working perfect.</li>
            <li> It used to look sturdy and more stable when placed in a countertop, now it is so lightweight, nosier and</li>
            <li> The price was better than Walmart price.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay more.</li>
            <li> I find it useful gets the junk off your teeth and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> , i AM ABLE TO FLUSH OUT</li>
            <li> My latest waterpik broke after just two weeks...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t intend to buy any more of these.</li>
            <li> I have had many waterpiks over the years.  </li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> I love it,</li>
            <li> The pulsing I&#x27;m not so sure of yet.</li>
            <li> In today&#x27;s world it would probably cost $8,000 to replace and the Waterpik keep this area and my whole mouth in great shape.  </li>
            <li> I have always been satisfied with them and love the way my mouth feels after using it.</li>
            <li> Works OK.</li>
            <li> The top of the unit does not sit properly&lt;br /&gt;Water</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t begin to work until you play with the fitting</li>
            <li> Maybe I should learn how to use this better.</li>
            <li> I love the design which keeps up to 3 nozzles on the side and under the water tank.</li>
            <li> Definitely love this waterpik.  </li>
            <li> Now our mouths are healthy.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone trying to have better dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> paired with regular brushing and flossing will make your dentist happy!  </li>
            <li> so I love it too.</li>
            <li> Should have included more tips.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t check more.    </li>
            <li> I heated it some, bent it some, and it was much better.  </li>
            <li> This Waterpik Water Flosser is even better than the waterpik</li>
            <li> Use warm water, it is more comfortable</li>
            <li> This product more than met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve used one of these things, you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever lived without it.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, helps maintain healthy gums.</li>
            <li> There sure is an opportunity for someone to make one of these things that works..</li>
            <li> After four uses - it still works.. more than could be said with the WP-65.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have tried many water picks over the years.  </li>
            <li> but they probably would not sell as many units.</li>
            <li> I have always used waterpik,,and this one works just as well as any that I have owned,,,I love water piks,,,,better than flossing</li>
            <li> If If you expect me to write reviews and try to tell me how many words to use.</li>
            <li> This also keeps gums healthy and plague build up at bay.</li>
            <li> and my hygienist is pleased with me</li>
            <li> If you are considering a waterpik, I say get it! :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years now.  </li>
            <li> I use the flosser and so many more food particles come out.</li>
            <li> I have used Teledyne Waterpiks for many years.  </li>
            <li> Want to keep those teeth for many years.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This gets more gunk out than my flosser at times.</li>
            <li> I sure don&#x27;t need ,or want the junk that the water container can attract .</li>
            <li> Great water flosser, highly portable, a good price, and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Water Flosser is very easy to use - set-up takes seconds, the intensity is easy to adjust, and clean-up is a breeze.  </li>
            <li> This is not the first one I have owned, but certainly the best one.</li>
            <li> a very clean feeling.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> works great, leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> After a month or two, full pressure just feels like a nice gum massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, you can&#x27;t fill the tank without picking up the fairly bulky apparatus and putting it underneath the faucet.  </li>
            <li> ; be aware that isn’t a good place to start, work your way up.</li>
            <li> I hope the motor is as good as the first two.  </li>
            <li> plus it is fun!!  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> Our new Waterpik is just great.</li>
            <li> and you should be able to suck out some water easily.</li>
            <li> I love the way it is easy to turn to get all the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> its what I expected and wanted works wonderfully thank you , why do you require me to tell you more about this product?</li>
            <li> The pressure is great - nice that you have various settings.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband by dentist request and it works great and it very easy to use wish that the tank held more water but no big deal.</li>
            <li> No suction, very loud bought Waterpik ultra water been a month now works great</li>
            <li> I was glad to fine one again...</li>
            <li> Never felt cleaner or more confident in my smile!</li>
            <li> It is quicker and better than flossing with dental floss and the clean feeling is a lot better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an incredible item and has health benefits far beyond just clean teeth.</li>
            <li> So far it is great</li>
            <li> My teeth already look great and gums also and I am 71 years old.</li>
            <li> My old Waterpik needed replacing and was so great</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important update:</li>
            <li> It works really well, has good pressure levels</li>
            <li> Really makes me wonder how good brushing is!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to quick</li>
            <li> This waterpik flosser is very adequate, good price and reasonable durability.  </li>
            <li> Nice to have clean enviro rated teeth and gums, and full mouth&lt;br /&gt;Great way to start a day</li>
            <li> In other words, a perfect transaction.</li>
            <li> I had the original, and it worked for many year.</li>
            <li> It works perfect, and maybe a little better.</li>
            <li> I started using the Waterpik a number of years ago, and once one realizes how much more it does than a toothbrush, one will never again feel that ones teeth are clean unless followed up with the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also does not have tank cover top, which would help to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> The ordering process was easy.  </li>
            <li> Practice working with the stream and force in your mouth, but otherwise easy to use and put together</li>
            <li> Easy to use (once you learn not to bathe yourself).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, too.  </li>
            <li> Nothing can give you that clean feeling in your mouth better that water flosser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to set up and use that instructions aren&#x27;t needed.</li>
            <li> (I have braces) to get the job done and this was not an easy task because you can&#x27;t turn the unit off with one hand anymore, no matter how you try to turn the unit off just to refill it, it slides all around the place.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel after Waterpik&#x27;ing and then brushing. &#x27;</li>
            <li> It is a easy and hygienic way to bring the tips along with you.</li>
            <li> Easy to maintain</li>
            <li> It works great but takes more minutes to get the same cleaning as a sonic brush.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy attachment and removal of cleaning tool tips that are color  coded for easy identification.       </li>
            <li> Water flow and pressure are easily adjustable and the wand rotates 360 degrees.       </li>
            <li> and they fall out easily when I remove the tank (when it is used as a cover).</li>
            <li> Slide switch can move too easily</li>
            <li> Inserting the attachment into the &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34; takes getting used to, but it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> Easy setup.</li>
            <li> This one has some apertures that you can place the tool heads in, but they fall out easily.</li>
            <li> I understand that the tubing and wand can be replaced easily.  </li>
            <li> After using this Waterpik, the hygienist kept remarking how easily the plaque was coming off and</li>
            <li> Exchange very quick and no</li>
            <li> Tips remove easily.  </li>
            <li> There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it is very quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> - Still going strong after almost 3 years.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of pretty good QC engineers out there; you might want to consider hiring some before you throw another design like this into full production.    </li>
            <li> It has a mechanism by which you can set how strong you want water to be pumped.</li>
            <li> The older model gave me good service for years.</li>
            <li> It has been around for over 40 years and still going strong.</li>
            <li> The older ones were good.</li>
            <li> It has a good range of pressures and  the highest setting is as high as you could ever need.  </li>
            <li> and it did feel pretty warm.</li>
            <li> Was my first water flower and am very pleased, I am amaze at how clean my teeth desk.  </li>
            <li> Now I use it every day and my mouth is as clean and fresh as a springtime rose.  </li>
            <li> The flosser works fine, but it is noisier than I hoped.  </li>
            <li> This device is admittedly somewhat cumbersome to use but seems to do a fine job of cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Half the time I think &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because when &lt;br /&gt;it works, it works fine</li>
            <li> so I use it instead of flossing, and my dentist said my gums were fine.  </li>
            <li> You need to do this each night you use it; by doing so, it will work fine.  </li>
            <li> I found the Water Pik to work just fine.  </li>
            <li> Once I get that going it works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, it works fine</li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> Meeting all expectations just fine.</li>
            <li> works fine, took some getting used to</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> works fine.  </li>
            <li> The power is fine</li>
            <li> When it works, the product is fine.  </li>
            <li> I thought this model would be fine...</li>
            <li> This unit works fine.  </li>
            <li> Been looking for one like my old one- super happy with this-</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a huge difference in water capacity</li>
            <li> Than put the jet in the sink and the water should continue to flow freely.</li>
            <li> Also, there are several positions for controlling the strength of the jet - start with the weakest one to find the strength most comfortable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the Waterpik arrived securely wrapped and in good time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the hose breaks every 3 months and they won&#x27;t replace for free</li>
            <li> --- that was the primary reason for my purchase.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> plenty of power, easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> Seller shipped item promptly with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Is a great alternative to traditional flossing</li>
            <li> Works great and only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Great product: my second Waterpik.</li>
            <li> This machine is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what you really miss.</li>
            <li> Then, when I filled the resevoir with water, it leaked out the bottom.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> easy to control, fill and clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much junk stays in your teeth after flossing and brushing.</li>
            <li> The WP-65 with the hydrogen peroxide solution remains mold free and we&#x27;ve owned it just about 10 months now.</li>
            <li> Yes this water flosser is essential for great oral hygiene</li>
            <li> This is the basic device and works great.  </li>
            <li> The big tank plus the variable power is great.</li>
            <li> switch needs to be in precise place</li>
            <li> Just get the unit as close to the sink and your head as possible, so that the hose never needs to stretch, and everyone will go home happy.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product and I plan to buy one for my sister.</li>
            <li> the material used looks cheap.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It seems cheaply made though.</li>
            <li> Veerryy cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The implements now fit into the handle without a fight - the manufacturing tolerances must have been reworked.</li>
            <li> and I discovered that it had become brittle because it was just really cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> Like, for example, the fact that the handle never seems to fit the receptacle unless you remove the tip each time.  </li>
            <li> My dentist says my problem gap areas are free of plaque, and should stay that way........</li>
            <li> I like to keep my wife happy with quiet surroundings.</li>
            <li> and I use it twice daily with great results.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the way it it flips over to become the cover making it nice and compact.</li>
            <li> It is truly amazing how much cleaner my teeth are since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the fact that replacement parts are readily available.</li>
            <li> Every time I turn it on, there&#x27;s a 90% chance there&#x27;ll just be a buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> The newer versions are cheaply made and flimsy.</li>
            <li> so far, it is doing a good job.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is doing a good job so far.</li>
            <li> This replacement is as good as the old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good</li>
            <li> To use warm, clean, pure water in your waterpIk, mix a cup of room temperature ZeroWater, with the cup of boiling</li>
            <li> healing that becomes possible, using a waterpik with warm, clean water, is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product for anyone, especially kids who need a quick and easy way to floss well.  </li>
            <li> That is because one is still faced with the reduced elasticity of the original hose into which the replacement hose is meant to fit.  </li>
            <li> It is quieter than the older model but just as effective.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and it fit perfectly in the small space I&#x27;d reserved for it.</li>
            <li> Waterpiks don&#x27;t last forever and this new one is the best I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> The machine worked great and for a long time--5 kids in the family; still works for all I know.  </li>
            <li> And I still have my original teeth at almost 65 years of age.</li>
            <li> I bought the Water Flosser after my original Waterpik (model 100) died after six or seven years of usage.</li>
            <li> and had the first for many years.  </li>
            <li> But the first two months that it was working, I love it.</li>
            <li> Original review:    </li>
            <li> My first one lasted for many years before giving up.  </li>
            <li> Now I waterpik first then floss, brush and waterpik once more.  </li>
            <li> Inferior to the original version</li>
            <li> This is sooo much better than the cordless one I bought first.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great as long as it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At recommendation of my dentist I have been a Waterpik user for over 25 years, and am never disappointed with the product.  </li>
            <li> When I started using the Waterpik, I started winning the war against cavities and my gums went from that reddish-pink that bleeds while flossing, which means bacteria has inflamed your gums and are eating away at your teeth, to a nice and healthy whitish-pink and absolutely no bleeding, even at the dentist&#x27;s office when they try to make them bleed!</li>
            <li> after 10 years, I figured it was time for a nice, shiny new one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first-time user of such a device --- and am very impressed so far.  </li>
            <li> Now, they are about as clean as possiable.  </li>
            <li> Think you teeth are clean after brushing?</li>
            <li> and yet it&#x27;s amazing if you read the reviews how many people still come back to give them another chance.  </li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li> Tthe size wasn&#x27;t as bulky as I thought it might be and with the speed I use I can clean all of my teeth with one fill.</li>
            <li> Turns out my setting is (3/5), to clean w/o bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> tank also flips to cover unit to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I sent it back and received a replacement which worked beautifully for the first two days.</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels really clean.  </li>
            <li> I use this device to clean my dentures well and clean and refresh my mouth and gums.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe the great fresh feeling it gives the entire mouth.</li>
            <li> After using the waterpik water flosser your mouth feels so clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so clean</li>
            <li> and clean where dental floss does not , i´m</li>
            <li> My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean unless I waterpik each morning.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> This waterpix is easy and fun to use..</li>
            <li> Cheap water supply cord breaks or cracks quickly and would purchase another brand out there if there were one that was competitive.</li>
            <li> i MAY EVEN START USING IT TO CLEAN MY TEETH.</li>
            <li> I have had several, and this is the best so far, if it turns out that it lasts well.  </li>
            <li> Contacted Waterpik, they said I had to clean out the rubber stoppers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip for how to produce clean water, for use in a waterpIk flosser.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> I brush and floss but felt like my teeth just weren&#x27;t as clean as they should be</li>
            <li> It has a good range of pressure settings, from gentle to very forceful.  </li>
            <li> So far I love this WaterPik!  </li>
            <li> , I believe it comes with the special tips automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I USE IT TO IRRIGATE MY SINUS CAVITIES WITH A SPECIAL TIP.  </li>
            <li> Had one of these previously and loved it!  </li>
            <li> Not as good as last one I bought.  </li>
            <li> Gradually build up the pressure until you can handle either full blast or one level below.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t used it full force yet</li>
            <li> Well, I can&#x27;t really remember how many of these I have purchased during the&lt;br /&gt;last 10 years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model even though it did not do quite as much as the top model</li>
            <li> Was not that much more to replace whole unit than it was to just purchase replacement tube  (which cracks after a while).  </li>
            <li> This is my third Waterpik flosser over the years - good service, durable for every day use.</li>
            <li> turn it on and run the water jet quick through all your teeth to clean them.</li>
            <li> The whole reservoir on the top idea...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Surely, modern technology can come up with better material choices than those of this dated product.</li>
            <li> If the hand piece is in it&#x27;s holder when you put the tank on to use, you can&#x27;t get it out without removing the full tank from the unit.  </li>
            <li> if it lasted 10 years, it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li> We use the waterpik daily for good dental care.</li>
            <li> This is a good investment now and the future concerning dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll return for full refund.  </li>
            <li> My dentist was amazed that my gums were in such good shape when I went to see him.</li>
            <li> Put it at full blast and this thing does some damage.</li>
            <li> and it just isn&#x27;t as good as the smaller unit they used to make.</li>
            <li> The warranty was only good for 30 days, so I&#x27;m out-of-luck.  </li>
            <li> really works and my teeth and gums are in better shape than they have ever been in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that to be true.</li>
            <li> IT WILL NOT GO FULL FORCE</li>
            <li> If you have a friend with dragon breath buy them one and tell them that you enjoyed it so much you wanted them to have one, too.  </li>
            <li> (Full disclosure: I bought mine at a well known brick n mortar chain, not at Amazon.)  </li>
            <li> So easy to use; no chasing the unit around the counter top, one handed turn on and turn off, a water capacity that easily holds enough water to do my full mouth of braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The assembly was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> was right and available quickly.</li>
            <li> It has greatly helped my issues with gum bleeding and other symptoms of periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> And the water massage keeps your gums happy and in the pink!</li>
            <li> The powerful water jets clean all food debris away and massage my gums - I have braces</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, my mouth feels fresh &amp; clean after using my Waterpik Flosser,</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve dissolved the salt in hot water before adding it to the Waterpik, and it&#x27;s been working fine for a month.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Of course, most people probably don&#x27;t do this so these companies are not only defrauding their customers, they are spoiling the enviornment with disposable products that can&#x27;t be safely disposed.   </li>
            <li> This model looks much better than the older models, but it&#x27;s a piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I didn&#x27;t, after using this model I could only imagine how many times I would have had to refill the portable pik.</li>
            <li> I think we would ALL like to see more convincing independent research on its long-term effectiveness on improving gum and dental health.)</li>
            <li> On top of that my older Waterpik never had a problem over the years I have had it.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> but my grandson said he was surprised how much debris a waterpik releases even after what he thought was a good brushing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a waterpik for many, many years and realized the same results.</li>
            <li> This model one below maximum is adequate for needed pressure.</li>
            <li> The Waterpic does the job it was designed to do but it is very noisy and has a cheap sound to it.</li>
            <li> Buying it on Amazon saved me money and the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise the units seem to last for many, many years.</li>
            <li> This is a super product that works well.  </li>
            <li> around until resevoir fits properly on top to let the water flow.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I highly recommend it for helping to keep teeth and gums&lt;</li>
            <li> Very powerful, quiet and effective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To sum up, there is a reason the waterpik is better than flossing and it is because of the high intensity water pressure.</li>
            <li> First, it feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> She promised me that it is here to stay and that I would benefit from it very much!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Well, operationaly this one seems to fit the bill pretty well.</li>
            <li> You may be able to spend a few more dollars to get a much better machine.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the large water tank is a plus.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik flosser is a strong machine for flossing and can certainly do the job</li>
            <li> I used one of the older versions, this is far superior.</li>
            <li> At night before bed, I Waterpik with a full reservoir of warm water mixed with a quick splash of mouthwash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably order a new one of the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; model as it&#x27;s cheaper, appears to be marginally more functional than the slicker one.</li>
            <li> the new unit is more convenient to use.</li>
            <li> ; I think I&#x27;ve had it for more than 10 years, so I bought this new flosser.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the new one</li>
            <li> Before I could send the first one back the new one was already here that was the best service, ever thanks.</li>
            <li> Waterpik has been one of the best companies for long lasting products I have ever dealt with.  </li>
            <li> The whole thing tips over easily.  </li>
            <li> Really has a strong motion to it.  </li>
            <li> All these years later I decided I needed another one, and I&#x27;m so pleased to have it!  </li>
            <li> the  FIRST  WEEK!  </li>
            <li> Should have shopped Amazon first!</li>
            <li> Overall, we really love this Waterpik and recommend it!</li>
            <li> it was ten times better!  </li>
            <li> Liked the one vibrate on previous model better than this one that has 3.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate and love the different pressure setttings.</li>
            <li> I bough it for my parents and they are not that good when it comes to dealing with electronic products since they are a bit old, but they are easily learnt how to use this since it is simple to use.</li>
            <li> The container is too large to allow a smooth insertion of the pik into its cavity.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little device to aid in your dental home care.  </li>
            <li> This particular model seems to work OK at first but</li>
            <li> and I recommend it very highly to anyone who wants under-the-gum cleaning for the most thorough cleaning you can get.  </li>
            <li> I use my water pik everyday and this was a great buy.  </li>
            <li> Shipped out real fast.</li>
            <li> the concept is good but they have to make a machine that actually works and without the jackhammer noise that shakes the whole house.</li>
            <li> my old one burned out, wanted to replace, but newbies were all $60 at the store, and had more features than I needed.  </li>
            <li> results of using it are well worth it.  </li>
            <li> This item is well worth the price but plan to replace it every three or so years.</li>
            <li> Waterpiks are such a vital part of complete dental hygiene and this one does an excellent job of eliminating remaining food between teeth and on the gumline.</li>
            <li> The reason I only gave it 4 stars is: Reservoir could fit better.</li>
            <li> and, how fresh my mouth feel thereafter.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ll say I love this thing.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth make sure you have the lurkwarm water (like it states in book to use).</li>
            <li> is extremely useful in keeping the progress of the disease at bay.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased with this unit.</li>
            <li> Over time, as the unit ages and weakens, I wonder if this will shorten the useful lifespan.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked them and they last for years.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The order was timely delivered to me, and so far I am pleased with the way it is operating.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> If this one lasts as long I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and does what a Waterpik is designed to do.  </li>
            <li> More sensitive gums need a weaker force of water to come out.  </li>
            <li> this worth it?</li>
            <li> I end up getting water everywhere, but it is powerful.</li>
            <li> Okay - I read some reviews stating that the Waterpik Water Flosser was &#x27;loud&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li> However the added capacity of the tank makes the unit well worth having.</li>
            <li> Far too many times</li>
            <li> Appliances like this have a finite life and given the engineering that&#x27;s required and the manufacturing time and materials I have to think this is a product that is worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay so far.</li>
            <li> but I left it in until I could think of a way to create my own lid.  </li>
            <li> Makes flossing fun.</li>
            <li> It has a nice big reservoir</li>
            <li> Now the kids finally have one of their own.  </li>
            <li> (she said that would soften the plaque for easier and more complete removal).</li>
            <li> WHICH IS WHAT IS USEFUL TO KEEP MY TEETH CLEAN.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oral irrigators are clearly beneficial for the gums, and the WaterPik brand seems to provide a stronger flow than others I have tried, and is more satisfactory to use.  </li>
            <li> so well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> : The pressure control slider on the handle goes from mild to very, very strong with no real middle ground.</li>
            <li> I was able to repair it with a piece of automotive vacuum hose that the broken ends of the tube happened to fit into perfectly.  </li>
            <li> My guess is that they are a very big American company that has a very good product idea and that grew to be very large.  </li>
            <li> The new one worked great for the first 3 months and now only will work on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> and it comes with a 2 year warranty both of which are very positive.</li>
            <li> I add a little mouth wash to kill any germs, and it keeps my mouth bright and clean between dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> The item seemed to do a very nice job for the short time in which it was operational; it left my mouth feeling very fresh.  </li>
            <li> There was NOT any significant delay, but it makes me wonder --- wouldn&#x27;t it have been more efficient to have INITIALLY used the US mail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this before and due to time and wear had to replace it and am very happy once again having my waterpic back in my home.</li>
            <li> Water comes out super fast!</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was how much more powerful his unit was compared to the old one....</li>
            <li> It has improved my health remarkably by helping keep my gums free of food debris in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> This one is just right.</li>
            <li> So, something about the design of this unit isn&#x27;t right..</li>
            <li> I can can&#x27;t seem to operate it right,</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that is right.</li>
            <li> I used it right after brushing.  </li>
            <li> This one is just right.  </li>
            <li> That said, this new machine is the best one yet (with several improvements over my last one, which was otherwise identical).  </li>
            <li> I had my dental appointment yesterday, and my checkup was positive!  </li>
            <li> long before the motor gives out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as far as getting the job done -- flossing with a water jet -- it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It really helps me to clean food from that area and refresh</li>
            <li> Look nice and small size. :)</li>
            <li> Keep doing what you are doing.&amp;#34; She made one suggestion, that I switch the order of the four steps I follow to put rinsing with a popular whitening mouthwash first rather than second</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Waterpiks in the past and been very happy with them, but this one is leagues better</li>
            <li> This new model is working fine for the month that I have had it.  </li>
            <li> I have one myself and it works great to get the small food pieces out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> you - like me - found the WaterPik to be the only design suitable, skip the 65 and get the 260.</li>
            <li> I reamed mine out a bit with a small clean drill bit and now get good flow.</li>
            <li> Their newer model seems to work a little better, but this one has a lower profile and fits in the space I have by the sink better.</li>
            <li> My mouth is much fresher throughout the day and this gets far more food debris out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a nice small instrument, easily handled.  </li>
            <li> Expect it to last a year or two before the motor starts failing, but hey, 40 bucks every two years is very cheap dental insurance.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much when it is operational.  </li>
            <li> Also, it was sent super-fast, and was very favorably priced, so I&#x27;m rating this transaction 5 STARS, because they won&#x27;t let me go higher!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little too noisy but it does a good job.</li>
            <li> The motor seems to be stronger, pushing out a more vibrant and thinner stream of water, which, when inadvertently aimed at soft skin tissue, under the tongue for example, causes a degree of pain.  </li>
            <li> The first one broke after 6 months.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik worked fitfully from first use.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted twenty years until the seal started spraying water.</li>
            <li> If you buy extra tools, be sure to include the Orthodontic tip.  </li>
            <li> My first waterpik lasted 7 years.</li>
            <li> The first Waterpik I purchased was the portable rechargeable one.  </li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t get more than a couple of uses out of it.  </li>
            <li> With all of the latest research on dental hygiene and cancer, longevity and overall health, this is a &#x27;power tool&#x27; I won&#x27;t be without.    </li>
            <li> Its exactly what I look for.</li>
            <li> The hose broke on my first WP-65 within the warranty period.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I have to move it back &amp; forth till the pressure comes thru the jet tip.</li>
            <li> The WaterPik lasts a long time &amp; does a great job especially for people who have dental bridges &amp; caps.  </li>
            <li> I have used variations of this Waterpik product for over 40 years and most last years before needing to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> After purchasing two battery charged water piks, the first was an Inter-Plak, and having them both die within weeks</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased died after four weeks.</li>
            <li> If you hold the pik higher than the reservoir</li>
            <li> start from the lowest strength setting the first time, until you find your limit.</li>
            <li> The motor did not function correctly after the first 10 uses.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that it&#x27;s a lot lighter</li>
            <li> Flossing is so much easier this way!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Waterpik to replace one I had used for many years that finally just wore out.  </li>
            <li> The force of the stream of water can be set higher than the handheld model.  </li>
            <li> Pretty.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;ve been using these make sure to start out on a low pressure setting otherwise</li>
            <li> Hydrogen Peroxide kills bacteria, fungus, and mold and is safe to use internally as a mouth rinse.</li>
            <li> I first pour that into the water well, then I Waterpik</li>
            <li> I like the procedure of using this to floss much better than using actual floss.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Waterpik first.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t set it to maximum power the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a product like this which consistently breaks after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Be aware of the following statement listed under \\&quot;Warning\\&quot; in the product&#x27;s operation manual: \\&quot;Do not use this product for more than 5 minutes in each two-hour period.  </li>
            <li> First:  </li>
            <li> The tank is the cover for the unit when not in use, With the hand unit in it&#x27;s holder and the tip in place, the tank (cover) does not work unless you remove the tip first (Bummer).  </li>
            <li> I am ordering the next model up and hoping I have better results.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ever using a water flosser.</li>
            <li> I encourage you to start with the flosser in your mouth before you turn it on; got everything on my counter nice and wet.</li>
            <li> The first two lasted about 20 years each</li>
            <li> I used to floss first in the morning then brush and then waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I hope it works better than the last one.  </li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and replaces the same item I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> It has more power than our last WaterPik and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about two years before the pump went out.  </li>
            <li> The price was really reasonable!  </li>
            <li> First one arrived and didn&#x27;t work out of the box.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is more water splashing on my hands (over the bowl)-- which I can&#x27;t explain.</li>
            <li> its exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Just took delivery and used for the first time this water pick flosser.</li>
            <li> I taped a piece of flexable plastic across the back of the resevoir which covers the opening on top.</li>
            <li> I may come up with a better solution in the future, but for now this is working for</li>
            <li> OK, Now it&#x27;s about a month later.</li>
            <li> My advice is \\&quot;don&#x27;t start any higher than the lowest setting\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Anything higher will strip paint!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Would like it to have one or two higher water pressure settings than those offered by the machine.</li>
            <li> This unit  fill to brim and you have more than enough time.</li>
            <li> Gotta say that it started shaking at first and it worried me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it every day, and it definitely works better than floss and brushing alone.</li>
            <li> I had one of these units when they first came out and it lasted for years.</li>
            <li> One month after purchasing this Waterpik it wouldn&#x27;t pulse water when sliding the selector to higher pressures.</li>
            <li> It seems as if the pause button was activating at the higher flow.</li>
            <li> I had a Waterpik Flosser for many years without a problem, using it daily.  </li>
            <li> He seems to like it better than regular flossing.  </li>
            <li> I will check around first to see if there are close competitors.    </li>
            <li> As others have recommended, starting with a lower setting will help your gums build up to being able to use the flosser at higher water pressure levels.  </li>
            <li> The first two, I just threw away and purchased another.</li>
            <li> produces more noise than my last unit</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need</li>
            <li> does exactly whatt it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have it on a middle setting and cannot imagine needing (or being able to stand) a higher setting.  </li>
            <li> The higher you set the power the quicker</li>
            <li> I have had the same experience as many of the people who bought this product.  </li>
            <li> Spend more and get one that will last longer than two weeks.</li>
            <li> I used it only once, but it was once too many.  </li>
            <li> Since the manufacturing went to China the quality has consistently declined.</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Idea is you cut off most of the old hose and attach new.</li>
            <li> In any case, this new one does everything the old one did but better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, easy to operate and has several settings.</li>
            <li> Use warm water - especially if you have sensitive teeth!  </li>
            <li> PRO: I have been recently told by a new dentist that I have excellent teeth, no gum disease, tight gums and no cavities.</li>
            <li> One drawback is the large size of product versus small vanity top, I should have been more aware of dimensions as it takes up large amount of space.</li>
            <li> Kids think it is fun too but be sure to tell them to be careful the first time they use it or they will get water everywhere.  </li>
            <li> took old one apart cleaned and lubed gears and little plastic piston, runs great</li>
            <li> This is a little loud but the results are great.  </li>
            <li> Another person did a pretty comical review of this model and mentioned how loud it was and something about a tractor I think and let me tell you, that reviewer wasn&#x27;t far from the truth.</li>
            <li> The higher settings are rough on your gums but if you start off in the lower ones and after a few weeks work your way up it is just perfect.</li>
            <li> We were so thrilled with our purchase, that we ordered another for our other home.</li>
            <li> The new unit has a little more pressure and a lot more quitter.  </li>
            <li> The tips move a little too easy , but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to come back here and purchase the full size model as the portable one was not only super messy, but not as effective or easy to move as the original.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine until last week, now the water does not come out right.</li>
            <li> I might prefer the thing to be more expensive and more sturdily constructed and last much longer, but I did have a good experience while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Does just as good a job as the more expensive units.  </li>
            <li> Very loud, loud enough to wake up my roommate, but does a good job.  </li>
            <li> If you love healthy teeth and gums, I suggest purchasing this small appliance!</li>
            <li> As compared to the unit it replaced (which we wore out over about three years of daily use), the motor is smaller, the unit runs louder, and the pump seems to require more torque than the motor can comfortably provide-</li>
            <li> This one much higher quality and really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much for that offer!</li>
            <li> I have been using waterpik for a long time and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have had many Waterpik flossers that lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it was a real eye opener...</li>
            <li> Works great has plenty of power, some of the other models don&#x27;t have enough pressure.</li>
            <li> Even though it is listed as lower, it is higher on both of my W65 units and allows me to really get into gum pockets where my wisdom teeth used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These devices are much better at cleaning the gum line plaque than floss by a long shot.</li>
            <li> My first one served very well for over eight years before developing a leak.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it, I was amazed on how much crud it got out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> They should really consider using that higher setting to mine diamonds.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It does feel good to use, but I&#x27;m not sure I can put up with the dismal quality.  </li>
            <li> I had a WaterPik when, as an adult, I found myself with a mouth full of braces.  </li>
            <li> new models pump is not as strong as the old model.</li>
            <li> The new one does not have as much pressure when flossing which is fine with me as the old one could really sting if you didn&#x27;t adjust it just right.  </li>
            <li> The main reason I gave it a 4 was that my old nozzles don&#x27;t fit it.  </li>
            <li> the rubber feet would not stick to the countertop surface and the damn thing slid all around while trying to set up, clean teeth, and then clean and dry the unit.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t leave warm water in the tub) tub and perhaps turn it upside down over the assembly over which it does not rest squarely, or store it elsewhere, or cover it with a towel , or whatever.  </li>
            <li> the effect is obvious good, teeth clean, comfortab, it has a little defect that it made some noise when you water your teeths.</li>
            <li> That is to take the unit apart (a tricky, but possible, thing to do) and fit the replacement nozzle head and hose combination directly onto the pump, thereby replacing the sclerotic original hose.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth one of these I&#x27;ve bought in 14 years so it has about an average life span of about 3and one half years;depending on how many in the household use this very good product.</li>
            <li> Easy to set the hose back in its cradle.</li>
            <li> We had followed Waterpik&#x27;s direction that if you use a mouthwash, you must always run water through the unit one more time to flush out any lingering mouthwash (indeed, they can dry to a sticky film).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to lift that and fill it by using a glass or cup that we all have sitting around the bathroom</li>
            <li> On my previous Waterpik I never needed to cover the tub at all, since after I emptied it, it had its own well-fitting</li>
            <li> We wore out our first one, but clearly had gotten our monies worth.  </li>
            <li> There is a third option which the Waterpik company strongly discourages.  </li>
            <li> So unless you have a strong grip with your thumb and wont mind a big dent in your finger, go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li> After the 80/20 solution has dripped out of the unit, I keep a special set of towels to clean and dry the whole unit.</li>
            <li> and it has reduced my pockets by a large percentage.  </li>
            <li> If this unit ever wares out I will certainly purchase another.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the nth time and was quite satisfied with it until recently when it came in with a new design style.  </li>
            <li> On mid range intensity it does great job without piercing pinpoint jet of my previous one.</li>
            <li> and I returned it for a refund, because of the hassle of shipping, I chose to buy another locally and that one works just fine.</li>
            <li> The fittings are tight, the style is the same and it works great.</li>
            <li> A nice little version of a waterpik.  </li>
            <li> Note that, on the advice of my dentist, I fill mine with a little salt and warm water.  </li>
            <li> I took away a star because it tends to leak a little (they all do) and for the noise, but overall a great value.</li>
            <li> I never had a Waterpik with so much spray..</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is well made, albeit plastic in the modern fashion.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and is well engineered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very, very noisy.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I am very hesitant to buy another Waterpik product.</li>
            <li> It has settings from gentle to really blast the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> This product was much cheaper than our Wal Mart store and the delivery was speedy too.</li>
            <li> Free shipping made a big difference.  </li>
            <li> If you put it on high it would cut your teeth out of your gums!  </li>
            <li> This water flosser is a fabulous addition to brushing and flossing as it blasts out debris from beneath bridges and in between teeth that sometimes get missed with traditional flossing.  </li>
            <li> And the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect much reliability from the device.</li>
            <li> Also it gets in between the teeth that are real close together with no problems.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this waterpik.</li>
            <li> However, it does splatter quite a bit, so you have to really lean close over the basin.  </li>
            <li> but I just really don&#x27;t like this water flosser routine.  </li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t floss so the waterpik has to do the whole job which it does.  </li>
            <li> and it did not work very well at all.  </li>
            <li> Daily use of my Waterpik is  an important part of my dental&lt;br /&gt;hygiene.</li>
            <li> THE WATER PIC HAS WORKED VERY WELL,  </li>
            <li> it is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I do not think this is to much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Sits on my counter without taking up too much room.</li>
            <li> and it was recommended by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Great machine for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> It worked really well until this week.  </li>
            <li> Either issue a statement about how to keep the units mold/fungus free or come out with a Waterpik \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; that meets our warranty needs and destroys these critters at the same time.</li>
            <li> It took about 2 days to get used to using it, but can see how much cleaner my teeth, gums and tongue are.&lt;br /&gt;Wished</li>
            <li> thanks for asking.</li>
            <li> I really like the waterpik</li>
            <li> The Waterpik works really well on my daughter&#x27;s braces.</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t use floss very well, and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It really cleans his teeth, gums and mouth.  </li>
            <li> Has two tips and is very compact.  </li>
            <li> i also like the fact that the pressure is adjustable so that an individual can build up to the level that is comfortable for them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This do not come with a lid and who is going to use that much water at one time.  </li>
            <li> The sound of an antique tractor brings back fond memories for me.  </li>
            <li> The sound of an antique tractor brings back fond memories for me.  </li>
            <li> This one works really well.</li>
            <li> this works really well..</li>
            <li> Waterpik  used too be  really  quality product.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Over all I really like this Water Pik.  </li>
            <li> and really that is all that matters.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t remember when I started using a Waterpik  </li>
            <li> I finally put a washcloth under it to muffle the sound, otherwise, it does the job.</li>
            <li> This item has made my mouth much cleaner.</li>
            <li> but this has made the job so much easier.</li>
            <li> thank you so much and will use again.</li>
            <li> My son really needed this item goes well with the flossing he does according to the dentist.</li>
            <li> It meets all of my needs at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> It has 2 tips which is much appreciated (but the tongue cleaner makes me gag).  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend it.  </li>
            <li> This order came very promptly.</li>
            <li> It takes a minutes to really set it for the water to pump, but otherwise it meet all of our expectations.  </li>
            <li> It just feels very cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it does its job, very well, I can&#x27;t complain with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using waterpik devices for years and this helps keep my dental cleaner from yelling too much at me .</li>
            <li> I wanted to give up on the whole task.  </li>
            <li> The whole assembly is very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> It is a real POS...</li>
            <li> The pump is MUCH quieter.</li>
            <li> but this is a very noisy</li>
            <li> The tongue cleaner didn&#x27;t seem to do much</li>
            <li> I never have much plaque build up or need intense cleaning.</li>
            <li> So far has been a reliable and useful product.</li>
            <li> It is smaller and works better than the old model I had (which lasted over 8 years).</li>
            <li> Only gave it four stars because it doesn&#x27;t seem quite as strong as the older model.</li>
            <li> It is still basically the same as my old one except this one has a lot more power and comes with a tongue cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Now I have this new model and found it very usefull, as the first one I had</li>
            <li> Very useful especially if you have bridgework done.</li>
            <li> an \\&quot;old things are good, new things are bad\\&quot; kind of complainer, but in this case, the old simple design didn&#x27;t have much to it and was hard to break  </li>
            <li> If you have strong gums, you can have the water forced out strong.  </li>
            <li> This product works OK but not nearly as good as the old WP 60 with more setting for cleaning gums.</li>
            <li> would prefer it be made other than China because China made products seem to break more often.  </li>
            <li> Removes food particles between teeth better than tooth picks, brushes, floss, and any other means I have found.</li>
            <li> I think the second setting is plenty powerful, and any higher would be too intense</li>
            <li> Other than the hose, the machine is OK.  </li>
            <li> I owned  Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser before this one, I still prefer the original it has a larger water capacity</li>
            <li> You can not get a better cleaning &amp; gum masssge with any other device.  </li>
            <li> Cleans extremely well, easy to use and is consistently reliable.</li>
            <li> maybe the older waterpiks work but not the newer ones, Waterpik has really lowered its standards.</li>
            <li> Recently visited my dentist and he told me that my teeth were perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> I have an older model of this Waterpik Flosser that I have had for years and has worked very well.</li>
            <li> WELL TO CLEAN OUT THE BACK TEETH</li>
            <li> Much improved over older model.  </li>
            <li> The control for this is in the wand, and has too much power even on the low setting, because the pump is always running full bore.</li>
            <li> I have deep gums where the wisdom teeth were pulled and this gets this area clean.</li>
            <li> The unit is quite noisey, it&#x27;s kind of hard for my daughter, who&#x27;s 8, to manage on her own, the water sprays out of control it you don&#x27;t know how to manipulate the little button while it&#x27;s in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The pump seems to be pretty strong (see caution about this below), and the reservoir is large enough for me to pik my way between all the teeth in my mouth and still have water left over.  </li>
            <li> This particular device is very quiet, holds a suitable amount of water for proper cleaning, and does not leak at all.  </li>
            <li> The only problem with the new one is the reservoir doesn&#x27;t fit when it is turned over with the wand in place.</li>
            <li> The old one clicked distinctly into each of the five settings while the new one slips from one to another with just the slightest touch.  </li>
            <li> - it is not very noisy, easy to use, and I really like the lever that lets you adjust the pressure.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s responsible for saving what teeth I have left, and within a week of use it improves gum health tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Generally, these provide a very clean mouth experience, especially when used with a shot of mouthwash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of lazy with flossing</li>
            <li> However, after a week of doing so with this machine, adding the salt directly to the water, it clogged up, and I had to spend quite a while cleaning it and flushing the lines with hot water.  </li>
            <li> I let it cool off and tried it the next day.</li>
            <li> For years I paid $35 on average and now the price has jumped to $50 and more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty loud..</li>
            <li> It came with the tongue cleaner which is great, but only one flosser, but the ones I had from the older Water-Pik fit perfectly, so no loss there.</li>
            <li> Surely they cut down on bacteria, and odor, but they don&#x27;t stop plaque.    </li>
            <li> I read many reviews and some good and some bad.  </li>
            <li> Made more cheaply, less adustible, etc.</li>
            <li> Keep hoping they will find a better design that is less akward to use.</li>
            <li> It was fine at first, but I left it for three weeks unplugged to go on a trip, and when I got back it would not charge at all.  </li>
            <li> Wore my previous one out after more than 5 years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than the previous two.</li>
            <li> Even better than the previous model that we had.  </li>
            <li> I read the information that came with the flosser, especially the Quick Start Guide.  </li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky ones, I got eight months   and two weeks use from my Waterpik WP-65 Personal Dental Water Jet.  </li>
            <li> Purchased as a replacement for an older model.  </li>
            <li> The competitor did not hold enough water to adequately flush out the deposits without having to refill it nor did it have the power the Waterpik&#x27;s have.</li>
            <li> I can send it back on my own expense and get partial refund.</li>
            <li> I had an older Waterpik and it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> We had an older Water Pik which we could no longer ge tthe parts for it.</li>
            <li> This cleans belter than the older models.  </li>
            <li> It sometimes requires time and effort to get the water hose properly coiled again and the top back in place.  </li>
            <li> I try and not press the handle button to stop the water flow but use the on off switch on the main unit.</li>
            <li> bought this to replace an older model of Waterpik Water Flosser.</li>
            <li> The older model&#x27;s tubing kept splitting because it had become brittle.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I wish someone would design and manufacture a decent product and put Waterpik out of its misery.</li>
            <li> But the main thing is, like someone else mentioned in another review.</li>
            <li> Older models the plastic tubing would get brittle and break.  </li>
            <li> This particular product was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> The older models of this type of Waterpik lasted years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use a \\&quot;Sunbeam Hot Shot Hot Water Dispenser\\&quot;, to instantly make and dispense, a cup of boiling</li>
            <li> I had the older version of this model and it lasted for 7 years before beginning to leak.</li>
            <li> I particularly like this brand.</li>
            <li> well however it is very loud and vibrates too much.</li>
            <li> This seems to work well, was fairly priced and hopefully will last as long as the last one did.</li>
            <li> you are new to Waterpik and if there seems to be no flow, make sure you press down on the connecting parts.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but the noise level can be a bit high.  </li>
            <li> This device is well built and is highly functional, but I consider it to have one drawback...</li>
            <li> /&gt;To take advantage of the high pressure you can.&lt;br /&gt;Clean the guck out around the sink</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t someone at WaterPik design a high quality and reliable product?</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the product to everyone.</li>
            <li> My dentist highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I owned another waterpik for a few years that broke recently and replaced it with this one because i loved the old one so much.</li>
            <li> so I set it at high before I turned it on</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I reccomend this unt highly</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for anyone who has any gaps between teeth or implants that harbor food particles.</li>
            <li> I had a Waterpik in high school that I got because I had braces.  </li>
            <li> However, if you use it on a high setting and have fillings, be forewarned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works fine, as expected..</li>
            <li> Off switch could have been placed a little more accessable on the front of the machine , instead of the side.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, they expect you to stand the wand up inside this little recess in the reservoir when not in use.  </li>
            <li> a stronger water jet stream, the more expensive one claims to have 10 PSI higher water pressure than the original</li>
            <li> Not a problem, little to put up with for my healthy gums.</li>
            <li> This EXTREMELY picky consumer, STRONGLY recommends you buy this product.  </li>
            <li> My WaterPik was great -- I did not mind the noise and found that I ould contol the twisted coil hose by putting it in a cup between brushes.  </li>
            <li> Best price I found (without having to wait for 7 day auctions to end grrrr)</li>
            <li> Bottom line is despite the flaky quality the advantages in my radically improved gum health from using a waterpik (vs no waterpik) are so great that if I have to sadly toss one into the electronics recycling</li>
            <li> They really help keep my fixed bridge in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> This replaces my old one that died and works very well.</li>
            <li> The disadvantage of this one is that the top does not fit when you are through.</li>
            <li> This is the same as our old one which died after many years of faithful daily use.  </li>
            <li> I get about 3 years out of these things before they have to be chucked, but that&#x27;s only $12 a year, so worth it.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with Waterpik&#x27;s latest model, the WP-100, which touts to have the same water capacity, measured in seconds as the WP-65, which is definitely not the case and clearly a marketing deception as the capacity is listed as 900s, as in 900 seconds each tankful.</li>
            <li> I always brush my teeth at least twice a day with a good electric toothbrush, and I flossed occasionally, so I couldn&#x27;t imagine there was that much gunk between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> There are, however, a few caveats to this goofy contraption:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is our second such device; the first one served us well for more than ten years.  </li>
            <li> If not careful, you could dump the reservoir full of water because you can actually lift up the whole unit with the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about WaterPiks, the Conair model, and a few others.  </li>
            <li> Looks like everything&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li> For being $35 I would expect material to be stronger and more firm..</li>
            <li> Stay away from the smaller unit niot as powerful.</li>
            <li> Before long I had mine at full force with no problem at all</li>
            <li> ZeroWater ZD-010 10-Cup Pitcher, with a fresh filter, to make local utility provided water that measures 0 to 3 on the TDS meter (that comes with the pitcher).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way it pulses and cleans stuff out that is trapped between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if the tubing will break, but overall it is definitely worth getting some type of waterpik.</li>
            <li> The new unit will require a little more counter space in our bathroom, but I have some hope (based on the large number of positive reviews) that it will last longer.</li>
            <li> The new Waterppik is much lighter than our old one.</li>
            <li> I thought the new model would be much quieter than the old one, it is not.  </li>
            <li> My old flosser did not work very well, even when it was new -</li>
            <li> The water tank is large enough to clean all my teeth without having to re-fill it like smaller units.</li>
            <li> Have been pleased with the WaterPik so far (in use less than a month).  </li>
            <li> (I fixed this with a rubber band and may super glue the next handle on high).&lt;br</li>
            <li> But your return policy was right on no problems with the second one.</li>
            <li> But if this one lasts as long as its predecessor, I&#x27;ll count myself lucky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only way that my mouth feels really, truly refreshed in the morning - that is to say, my teeth and tongue do not taste either like morning grossness, nor does it taste like toothpaste or mouthwash, and instead my mouth simply feels clean with the use of this product.</li>
            <li> Then you will have to throw the unit out and buy another one because they design it so you can&#x27;t fix or replace the hose, so plan on buying a new one every year or two.</li>
            <li> I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips.</li>
            <li> I just started using my new Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> The cost of repairing the hose almost equals the cost of a new unit, so I always end up buying one.  </li>
            <li> The new one is not as noisy as the olderone, and I like the lever on the side that can adjust the pressure.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Hope they make them like they used to, we&#x27;ll find out with this new one.</li>
            <li> I wish they would have included their new under-the-gum spout and that they would re-issure the multi-holed sprayer that used to come with the appliance.  </li>
            <li> This new Water Pik</li>
            <li> I had to refill the new WP-100&#x27;s water container twice</li>
            <li> all the Waterpik&#x27;s we&#x27;ve owned, 3 WP-65&#x27;s and 1 WP-100, we&#x27;ve learn each time something new about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this new model in 2012 and am writing this review in 2014.&lt;br /&gt;Within six months the model started choking.</li>
            <li> I live in a city that has some of the cleanest water in the country.</li>
            <li> They sent a new head tube unit</li>
            <li> new Waterpik</li>
            <li> new Waterpik</li>
            <li> We have used a WaterPik for years and, when we needed a new one, bought this.</li>
            <li> live in an apartment.  </li>
            <li> My new Waterpik is lighter weight, quieter, and easier to connect the water basin to the unit.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was so eager to use this to floss her new braces.  </li>
            <li> This for me is a can&#x27;t live without product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I will order because it&#x27;s cheaper than a new unit.</li>
            <li> I returned it for a new one, and it stopped working after about six weeks.</li>
            <li> The new one.</li>
            <li> I always had to put the handle down to refill despite that I had a huge glass of warm water with mouthwash already prepared to be dumped and no matter what I did with all the sliding and things I was trying to hold, the second refill always spilled outside the more narrow water well (more narrow than the WP-65) making a big mess to clean on the countertop now too in addition to everything</li>
            <li> So, when my last purchase died a month ago, I went ahead and ordered one with the reasonable expectation that this 2012 edition would be pretty much the same as the older ones.  </li>
            <li> The top doesn&#x27;t fit easily on the base.  </li>
            <li> I previously spent about $18 a month replacing sprinkler heads and now I just clean them and re-install them.</li>
            <li> Purchased mine in 2013 and have used it every night since; essential part of my bed-time ritual and it gets my whole mouth much cleaner than floss + brushing.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothers me about it is that it is not as powerful as the old one I had.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I think this was a great buy and have since become addicted to water piking my teeth on a very regular basis.</li>
            <li> This waterpik is small enough to be portable and transportable and large enough to hold a good rinse.  </li>
            <li> VERY loud.</li>
            <li> This is also very loud which could be an issue for apartment dwellers.</li>
            <li> The spray was very powerful and actually \\&quot;hurt\\&quot;, especially when it was by my tooth with a crown.   </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a very old Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> So we took another stab and bought a new one, exact same problem.  </li>
            <li> This newly designed version has a bigger housing than the original ones and the design of the handle is different.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully this will last 7 years like the first.</li>
            <li> Have used this one for about a month; replaced one that was 20 years old!</li>
            <li> I only had &#x27;leaks&#x27; the first couple days.</li>
            <li> This treatment worked the first two times but on the third try it was unsuccessful.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li> If you have an old water pick fix it!</li>
            <li> But once you get used to doing that it has more pressure than the ones in the past.</li>
            <li> I see many other reviewers had the same problem.  </li>
            <li> There are other brands in the market, but I recommend the original Water-Pik from Teledyne.</li>
            <li> In all fairness I bought a WaterPik unit almost 15 years ago and it lasted until this year, in spite of the fact that it was used by two teen-agers and an adult!</li>
            <li> The basic system is superb on all my teeth and essential on those that snag uncomfortable bits of food.  </li>
            <li> This one broke exactly 2 months later in August 2013.  </li>
            <li> Pretty simple design.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would go with the Waterpik name in that I have had their products in the past and got many years of use out of it.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a third step after first flossing with dental floss and brushing.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> the new WP65 is almost identical to my old WP60, but the motor is significantly quieter (yea!), and the power from the nozzle is a bit less (boo!).  </li>
            <li> First decent one I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
            <li> Like so loud that if you live in an apartment and do your teeth at 11:30 pm you will wake your neighbors</li>
            <li> far the new machine does work well</li>
            <li> Free flowing, less nosiy and graduated force control.</li>
            <li> But it galls me to know that the company saved money on the manufacturing with the light weight and then saved another 1 cent (or less) to reduce the length of the power cord.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Waterpiks for more than 20 years and on average I&#x27;d say they last 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> After just 3 days, it starts giving very loud noise -- as loud as a lawn-mower .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When the new one arrived I was excited to get started with it because of a few new features.</li>
            <li> It is also used to clean surfaces to a squeaky clean, so it doesn&#x27;t leave residue behind.</li>
            <li> All I can say is this removed much more debris from my teeth than traditional flossing, and in much less time.</li>
            <li> It worked fine shooting the water through, but there seemed to be only a very weak or a very strong pulse; therefore, when I wanted it on the medium setting (#3), the force was the same as on the high setting.</li>
            <li> This product has been around for a long time without any essential design or construction changes except that it is now made in China whereas it was originally made in America.  </li>
            <li> Water container is large enough so you don&#x27;t have to keep refilling at one session.</li>
            <li> The machine has a large tank for holding mouthwash or the like and comes with several mouthpieces.</li>
            <li> Large reservoir to hold enough water/mouthwash mixture to service two people.       </li>
            <li> instructions said to use the lowest setting initially, which certainly made sense.  </li>
            <li> - The best money I&#x27;ve spent in a very long time&lt;br /&gt;- Some of my teeth are very close together and it&#x27;s difficult to floss</li>
            <li> but I like the looks of OralBreeze (not near as noisy and not doesn&#x27;t look like very much there to break), and will probably avoid buying another WaterPik....    Message to WaterPik:  </li>
            <li> I have a nasal nozzle (a little alliteration) from the old one that doesn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> It works wonderfully to remove food particles behind the hard to get to wisdom teeth.  </li>
            <li> One thing I do after I use any type of mouthwash in the reservoir is afterwards I put in clear water and run it for 15-20 seconds to get the mouthwash out of the system.</li>
            <li> The machine is much, much too loud as to opposed last one I had.</li>
            <li> I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A CLEAR ACRYLIC COLOR RATHER THAN</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old, my dentist said I have the teeth of a 30 year old.</li>
            <li> The product performs satisfactorily so far.</li>
            <li> To preface this, let&#x27;s remember I am not a dentist and have zero professional training in dental care,</li>
            <li> I hear alot of people complain that the waterpik is so loud - and it is -</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old</li>
            <li> Unit seems far too bulky for what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> I decided to continue trying to use it when it worked until it stopped working completely, now because the pause button on the handle is not responding.</li>
            <li> No complainst thus far, and dont expect any..</li>
            <li> my old water pik  has been discarded.</li>
            <li> Its considerably cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely loud, however, so</li>
            <li> The WP-65 replaced my six year old</li>
            <li> WP-70 on which the hose had finally developed a leak I couldn&#x27;t fix.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> So far there is no leakage of water from anywhere on the unit, but that may come with time.</li>
            <li> As a dental office manager I can tell you first hand that these waterpik water flossers save people time and money in the long run.</li>
            <li> It is loud</li>
            <li> After four months the motor quit completely.</li>
            <li> then my old Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> My old Professor from Colorado State U (he invented it with his dentist) would not have approved with charging $99 for something that used to cost $1 for the old machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We thought because it was old.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely loud that my neighbor would hear it.  </li>
            <li> You would be surprised by the amount of debris that is hiding at your gum line that brushing (even power brushing) can&#x27;t remove.</li>
            <li> You also gain the benefit of having your gums massaged by the pulsating action.</li>
            <li> I had to throw it away this week because the tube became brittle and cracked near the handle unit, and there is no way to replace that piece itself.</li>
            <li> Note this is NOT the 20 year old model that others say lasted so well.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for our old unit which lasted 10+ years.  </li>
            <li> This flossed cleans in between teeth with no harsh pulsation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about 1/2 the weight of my old unit which lasted 8 years.  </li>
            <li> I had to cut off the cord from my old unit and</li>
            <li> I use the regular WP-65 tips for them without a problem and the hygienist mentioned that I keep that wire all-around cleaner than any of their patients.</li>
            <li> this replaced my old unit.</li>
            <li> I pried open the handle gently.</li>
            <li> and repaired my old Waterpik and have been using it since with no problems.</li>
            <li> You can read my review on this hose repair kit with handle and it tells you how I did it as the instructions that came with it would not work as my old hose was to brittle.</li>
            <li> both it and the old pump are loud.</li>
            <li> If you have an old water pick fix it!000A8EHU6 WaterPik hose repair kit with handle.]</li>
            <li> and repaired my old Waterpik and have been using it since with no problems.</li>
            <li> You can read my review on this hose repair kit with handle and it tells you how I did it as the instructions that came with it would not work as my old hose was to brittle.</li>
            <li> both it and the old pump are loud.</li>
            <li> Starts out pumping immediately unlike my old one that needed priming each time.  </li>
            <li> Loud?  </li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s loud, but I grew up around farm machinery, so I&#x27;m used to it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I feel like a freak, huddled over the sink, a loud buzzing in my ear, and water pouring out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Loud?  </li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s loud, but I grew up around farm machinery, so I&#x27;m used to it.  </li>
            <li> a loud buzzing in my ear, and water pouring out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, this product is completely unusable for anyone who lives in an apartment.  </li>
            <li> This was a replacement of one I had for about 4 - 5 years:  the hose developed a pinhole leak.  </li>
            <li> While I can appreciate that it must be both flexible and capable of containing the water pressure created by the pump so the hose materials are crucial.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot lighter than my old one maybe because the old one is about 25yrs</li>
            <li> I bought this when my old Waterpik bit the dust after 15 years.  </li>
            <li> this was a replacement for a wp-20 that died from old age 15</li>
            <li> so it seems like a no-brainer as far as dental hygiene (thank God for spell checker on that one...</li>
            <li> It cleans out all  the food between my teeth that even brushing does not do completely.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is how much space it takes up.</li>
            <li> and I have had no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> By the afternoon, all of the remaining liquid, apx 1/2 inch had drained completely out all over the sink and onto the floor.  </li>
            <li> Wantebeen improvedd it to replace 20 year old unit that died.</li>
            <li> Wow is it loud.</li>
            <li> I thought my Oster beehive blender was loud, but if you got that item and this going at once you&#x27;d probably be rockin&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have purchased probably six so far, all became throwaways.</li>
            <li> old Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Also, the price has jumped considerably.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> the wand doesn&#x27;t go back in very well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it or at least buy it at a reputable store when you can return it.</li>
            <li> It made the whole vanity shake, and you could hear it all over the house.&lt;br /&gt;Spend an extra couple bucks and get the wp100.</li>
            <li> This product works like a dream and my 5 yr old enjoys using it as well</li>
            <li> I now wish I had kept the old one.  </li>
            <li> My teeth hadn&#x27;t been professionally cleaned in about 6 years.</li>
            <li> , that was 3 years old before it died.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I noticed the &#x27;kids model&#x27; WP-260 has far fewer one-star reviews as a percentage.</li>
            <li> one thing I don&#x27;t care about it, it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> well I think, though it&#x27;s embarrassingly loud in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace one that was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this from Bed Bath and was really looking forward to getting started on my journey back to gum health .</li>
            <li> I object, not only to the cost of replacing my Water Pik every few years, but also to the effect on the environment of discarding so many of these machines.</li>
            <li> The flosser is powerful enough for daily use and seems to be holding up.</li>
            <li> First it was, you have to flush the mouthwash out of it (not doing that killed our first unit).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had if I hadn&#x27;t broken the fitting on the head by using too much pressure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning out particles but the water container is difficult to keep on the input and the flosser needs to have a lower spray for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Start on the top row, far front side and slowly move the pick forward and around your teeth at the gumline.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned with the lightness of this new flosser as the first two were much heavier.  </li>
            <li> I have an older version of the WaterPik that is much simpler in design, and limited in versatility.   </li>
            <li> I also prefer the higher pressure &amp; steady flow as opposed to the WaterPik&#x27;s \\&quot;rat-tat-tat\\&quot; pulsating pressure flow, but I also think if I&#x27;d kept using WaterPik, by now I would&#x27;ve had to order another replacement; these new models just don&#x27;t seem to last very long.    </li>
            <li> Effecive product to clean gums and in between tight spaces of teeth.  </li>
            <li> I do feel that WaterPik could easily correct this problem with a small spring stiffener at the handle if they wanted to</li>
            <li> We had a waterpik for years but wanted a new one for our new bathroom- big mistake</li>
            <li> Still no doubt that this little baby is getting the gum line clean.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day after smoothie time and this thing blasts out all of the little fruit and vegetable bits hiding in my mouth and leaves my teeth sparkling clean.  </li>
            <li> It becomes very top heavy and leaks a little around the gasket every time you put it on or take it off.  </li>
            <li> This powerful and efficient machine does, extremely well, the job it is designed for.</li>
            <li> Often times if you have a deep enough sink; gravity will do most of the work for you if you point the pik down into the sink.</li>
            <li> When I got it to the point that no more was coming out, I used the unit and it was fine.</li>
            <li> The water tank is easy to use; we normally put in two small glasses of water and when we are done, we let the hose drop into the sink and the water left in the container drains out into the sink.  </li>
            <li> My experience has shown that if I floss first and Waterpik second, I actually get out material the floss missed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a much older waterpik that finally died.</li>
            <li> It has the same power as the older models.</li>
            <li> I actually have no pros for this, except that once you get it working, it does the intended job, but by the time I get to that part, the air is pretty blue.</li>
            <li> This is my second one my first one finally gave out after about 8 yrs</li>
            <li> I did find a cool little battery operated brush (no name brand).</li>
            <li> Maneuvering the water container on top of the assembly so that it is tightly in place at the fitting where the water runs through is so difficult to do that</li>
            <li> then it will be necessary to prime at a high setting.</li>
            <li> I use a low power to flush out debris and then a high power for removing plaque.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik at high speed seems to pulverize plaque, which then can be rinsed or brushed away.  </li>
            <li> I chose it for its varible settings, especially the high ones.</li>
            <li> You have to keep moving it from low to high to try to find one that works.  </li>
            <li> It is very noisy and the pressure gauge goes from too low at lowest setting to too much and next low setting.  </li>
            <li> The old WaterPik I had lasted for years, and when I finally broke I replaced it with this new model.  </li>
            <li> Unit is reliable, sound is the same as previous models, works well.</li>
            <li> Flossing is very important; but often regular string floss can miss those hard to get pieces of food.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the noise is unavoidable based on how the motor works, but I don&#x27;t think that is a reasonable excuse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is loud and bulky, but I have to laugh at the other commenter who tries to get the whole apparatus under the tap --</li>
            <li> But I usually wipe it down with a clean cloth after use because excess moisture can quickly lead to grime.  </li>
            <li> This little gadget quickly gets rid of in between bits no tooth brush can reach.  </li>
            <li> Canister is large enough to do the entire mouth.</li>
            <li> Except for the color of the reservoir, this one is the same as and cost $15 less than I paid for the original.  </li>
            <li> Almost a machine gun sound for a lack of a better description - and uncomfortable to the ears while your head is bent down near it.  </li>
            <li> I had to struggle with it to push it down enough times so that it finally seated well enough that after turning the switch on, some water was able to come through the hand flosser tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This would seem a more efficient way of accomplishing the same thing, without the mess, and without the minor assembly</li>
            <li> I returned to a local repair shop who told me they don&#x27;t repair this equipment but return it to Waterpik who should send me a new one.</li>
            <li> I expect this new one to do the same.</li>
            <li> I had it by the 5th day of using the WP-100, contacted Amazon who accepted it back without a problem as I exchanged it for a new WP-65.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to order some extra piks, because the problem with my old one is that the pik broke, and I can&#x27;t replace it, because the old size is different from the new ones.  </li>
            <li> Top pressure may be slightly less than my previous old waterpik (would no longer hold a nozzle - stated blowing off</li>
            <li> for a personal water pic, it is much too big.  </li>
            <li> My only dissappointment is that I expected to receive 3 distinct tips, including a Pik Pocket tip.  </li>
            <li> Regularly maintaining it really makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li> hope it last as long as the first one I bought years ago.</li>
            <li> Fixed my old Waterpik but had to do a different install&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fixed my old Waterpik but had to do a different install&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, this is really the only &amp;#34;realistic&amp;#34; way for our kids to floss around their braces on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> My old, brand X, water flosser died after about 5 years of near daily use.  </li>
            <li> We have a 25 year old water pik and a 5 year old one in a different bathroom.</li>
            <li> Some people complained about the pressure of the water being too strong, but I almost think it is like a gum massage.  </li>
            <li> The water tub does not fit onto the bottom assembly firmly at all, and everything else kind of teeters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I assume that since I am getting between the teeth and down below the gums I am doing it right.</li>
            <li> I have to balance it on the sink since the cord is short and will not reach very far.</li>
            <li> I give major credit to Water pik.</li>
            <li> and I believe that the use of Water Piks has been a major factor in helping me to maintain the condition of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I have now only had the product for two months and it already needs completely replaced!</li>
            <li> Problem is that the stub of the old hose is brittle and cracks not long after the repair.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many of these in the past few years for this very reason.  </li>
            <li> My previous Waterpik had a nice sturdy cover with a little lidded insert in which a number of extra tools could be stored.</li>
            <li> The fact that it weighs about half of the old one should&#x27;ve been the first tell-tale sign that something is going to be messed up.  </li>
            <li> But...I do have solid experience in engineering, and the hard and social sciences, and I LOVE the \\&quot;WaterPik</li>
            <li> The new one is similar to the old one seems to work about the same.</li>
            <li> The new one offers more convenient (though not perfect) placement of controls and movable parts.  </li>
            <li> Shame on Waterpik for this cost cutting while at the same time charging more and taking advantage of its loyal customers.</li>
            <li> the older models lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, the wattage has gone down to half of what it used to be and consequently there is just not enough pressure to do any decent job.  </li>
            <li> Though WaterPik seems to offer better irrigating performance than other brands when the products work, I am beginning to believe that WaterPik&#x27;s quality and durability are poor, and I wish there were a higher quality, good-performing alternative.</li>
            <li> The little motor gives out and they are really worth the price.</li>
            <li> Make sure the reservoir is pressed down tightly onto the pic so that it seals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waterpik sent me a new unit, but since the first one failed so quickly, I can no longer recommend them.</li>
            <li> Finally, the blue plastic cover/supply reservoir is less strong than the white one of the WP-60.  </li>
            <li> And incidentally, if you&#x27;re plagued by halitosis (bad breath), cleaning under the gumline AND cleaning the tongue itself are both great ways to fight that problem, and you can do both with this flosser.  </li>
            <li> Before I take a look at the product and the quality itself, let&#x27;s talk Waterpiks in general.</li>
            <li> This has done wonders for my gums and general tooth health.</li>
            <li> If you could replace the pump/hose assembly reasonably, these things would last a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use it after meal if possible to clear out food between teeth.</li>
            <li> If they gave it a 6 month warranty, I would not had expected so much.  </li>
            <li> This one shoots out water in a pulsing action and they say to set it at its highest speed to prime the unit before each use so you are likely to get sprayed and spray your bathroom while you&#x27;re at it.  </li>
            <li> The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the insanely loud tractor noise this thing pumps out.</li>
            <li> Because I have sensitive gums there are enough speeds</li>
            <li> I was loosing the dental hygiene battle because I could not tolerate flossing, so I barely remembered to do it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kinda loud since this is a tiny machine.  </li>
            <li> During his next visit to the dentist he was told he&#x27;d made a marked improvement.</li>
            <li> it is a very simple design.&lt;br /&gt;Could have been fixed parts</li>
            <li> The deep cleaning and gum massage promote soft tissue health.  </li>
            <li> We have been using a Waterpik for decades when our old one finally died.</li>
            <li> Only used by one adult in the household.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as loud as my last waterpik</li>
            <li> As near as I could tell, it was designed to snap back it.  </li>
            <li> The old waterpik finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> HOSES WILL CRACK NEAR THE PULSATOR UNIT, IT IS INEVITABLE.</li>
            <li> My old one finally gave out after 20 years of service!  </li>
            <li> Noticeably, the design has barely changed.</li>
            <li> and while there is some extra water that needs to be wiped away at the edge of the sink, this is far from messy and, I believe, well worth adding for improved protection against gum problems.</li>
            <li> This one was the least expensive and had best overall design and performance capability.  </li>
            <li> it is worth having a few of this for the family.</li>
            <li> When my first unit broke down, I bought an inalambric model.</li>
            <li> The motor now runs hot enough to produce the odor characteristic of burning insulation, which renders it a possible inhalation and fire hazard.</li>
            <li> There seems to be left only the choices of doing without or purchase a new unit.  </li>
            <li> New models apparently only last weeks.</li>
            <li> It needed to be returned to an \\&quot;authorized repair\\&quot;, which luckily was only a few miles away</li>
            <li> Sadly the controls for low pressure are not well calibrated so it quickly gets too powerful and at low pressure settings result in the pump being VERY loud.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought broke in less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> how much less there was now as when she had first seen me a month before.</li>
            <li> Works OK but has sloppy design and/or manufacturing.</li>
            <li> It is slick and quick.  </li>
            <li> There is no good in between setting as all others are way too strong.</li>
            <li> Where the 2 black things  connect , are not making the proper connection, for the water to flow out right.</li>
            <li> This continued for about a week, some days getting more or less, but never a full spray ON ANY SETTING!  </li>
            <li> I hope other people will buy them also very soon.</li>
            <li> Our dental hygenist recommended it and our recent exams prove how useful this little wonder is.</li>
            <li> The other minor gripe is that the holder for the want is right under the water container</li>
            <li> Our first waterpik jammed within the first week, and we opened it up and pushed the little gear back in place several times.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, I get tired and just floss real quick.</li>
            <li> The second failed because of my own error.  </li>
            <li> I thought perhaps the little motor was getting too hot</li>
            <li> The wand has a sloppy swival connection where the quick release coupling is connected to the main body of the wand.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I made a total mess...</li>
            <li> This product replaced my WaterPik personal unit which lasted barely 3 years.</li>
            <li> I have used waterpiks for a long time and this was a replacement for my old one that wore out.</li>
            <li> The second lasted barely a month.  </li>
            <li> When priming before use, the water dribbled out in tiny droplets at the lower setting and barely streamed in the highest setting.</li>
            <li> As a mature adult, I was concerned that I was having to get braces and after dealing with my children&#x27;s experiences with braces (almost 20 years ago), I knew that I had to be really careful about daily cleaning.  </li>
            <li> If so, they have no excuse for not doing a lot of research to improve their product.  </li>
            <li> I  hope it works as long as the old one and a lot longer than the 2 year warranty...</li>
            <li> If you have never used a water pik before, be prepared for a messy first experience.</li>
            <li> At first it was a messy learning proccess (should come with goggles,lol)</li>
            <li> A little blood at first is only clots being released....</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t have as much pressure as previous models.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend using it in the shower the first few times to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> is the surface is not flat.</li>
            <li> Appears this 260 &#x27;kids model&#x27; is exactly the same (except green plastic trim rather than blue) as the $79.99 WP-300 &#x27;Traveller&#x27; model...</li>
            <li> Having owned a Waterpik since the 1980s, I expected when I received this new model it would be lesser in design and build.</li>
            <li> The reservoir seems to seat securely on this model, and water did not leak on the counter, which has been a problem with other models and brands in the past.  </li>
            <li> it can get a lot more stuff broken loose from your gumline than flossing will ever do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months now, using it nightly, and other than getting oriented to a new product</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to not get wet as you use it; but, not having food impacted between your teeth is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Set it on a lower pressure when you first start using it - it can be very forceful and a little uncomfortable at first.</li>
            <li> That can be good or bad.  </li>
            <li> If I could open the base of the unit I could probably attach the good hose directly to the pump.</li>
            <li> First I wet the towel with the Hydrogen Peroxide (think of it like it is soap), and I wipe down everything with it:</li>
            <li> Our previous WaterPik, used daily, lasted about three years before the high pressure hose sprung a leak.  </li>
            <li> I believe the new handle design is poorly done, and if the one I bought doesn&#x27;t fail completely pretty soon, I expect it&#x27;ll just malfunction one time too many</li>
            <li> Only down fall...this is LOUD!</li>
            <li> other issue was how loud it is.</li>
            <li> some out there are too weak even at full strength).</li>
            <li> and it also produces about half the pressure it did when new.</li>
            <li> I like the unit very much except for the fact that when you turn it on, it is spraying water unless you press a hard to press button on the wand to shut it off in bypass mode.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I&#x27;ve been a devoted Waterpik user for at least 20 years, so this purchase was a replacement for the last one I wore out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to them, my teeth never quite feel clean when I can&#x27;t use the Waterpik for a day or so --</li>
            <li> The unit is very compact and takes up only a small space.</li>
            <li> I wanted my flosser to sit on the back of the toilet</li>
            <li> Tank is overly large, which they say, means fewer fill ups, but I don&#x27;t like the idea of leaving water in between uses, so I fill halfway, use and empty balance of water, also not very easy because of size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Waterpik WP-60 user for the last 25 years, and in spite of the fact that I usually had to replace the unit every 4-5 years (either the hose or the pump wore out), I kept going back to it because it did a decent job flossing.  </li>
            <li> (3) bigger tank means less frequent refilling.</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to reach anywhere on your bathroom counter.   </li>
            <li> I wonder how long this will last.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is it takes a long time to Brush, Floss, Pick and then use the water flosser.</li>
            <li> It lasted a long time but finally broke.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect long life with any appliance that comes in contact with water, be it a washer, dishwasher, or flosser: They all equally unreliable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The good: (1) it functions as intended.</li>
            <li> I guess the old one had just worn down.  </li>
            <li> But although I&#x27;m pretty mechanically adept I can&#x27;t get the base open without destroying it.</li>
            <li> The first few times you use it you will make a big mess until you get a system established.  </li>
            <li> Other than that major offense, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I had one of this product before, it broke at the hose after three years for everyday use - no complain and bought a new one from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I can see that this one will not last very long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s twice as easy to return mere days after purchase than if it hung on for a couple of months before dying.</li>
            <li> but you only use it a few minutes a day, and the benefits far outweigh the noise.  </li>
            <li> It is similar to an old one I had a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Now that my second Waterpik is now a few months old, I can make informed critique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think its simplicity will mean it is hardier, and the various settings for power are very helpful.  </li>
            <li> As an aside, all units were quiet when new but became excessively noisy within weeks - like a minature jackhammer.</li>
            <li> The hose is very stiff, wound in a coil, and wants stubbornly to stay that way.  </li>
            <li> The hose is very stiff, wound in a coil, and wants stubbornly to stay that way.  </li>
            <li> I live in Peru, South America, so is not easy to get this product here.</li>
            <li> and I think it looks nicer than the other models with its deep blue bin that doubles as a cover.  </li>
            <li> It has absolutely NO power--it&#x27;s no where near as efficient as the former, less expernsive, model that I have always used.  </li>
            <li> Once we figured out that the small round rubber connector (where the tank meets the housing) had to be turned slightly, to stop it from leaking, our disappointment turned to joy!  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit loud, but it does the work.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud, but unless your baby is sleeping in the bathroom, so what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Uses too much space on the bathroom counter, previous models used much less.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to believe how much food debris can be lodged in the gums and in between the teeth even after rigorously brushing, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I had the same model purchased about 10 years ago, and the new one is a lot lighter in construction, weights a lot less, feels less sturdy.</li>
            <li> It was to much work to use so honestly I am not using the waterpik.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained about the noise, but all the models I have had made just as much noise as this one</li>
            <li> should note that a strange situation occurred during shipping.  </li>
            <li> So does it make noise, I don&#x27;t care, it could send up ballons, as long as it does its job.    </li>
            <li> Now, I have the option of shipping it back to the service center or buying another one.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased it, the box included a blue tip, a pink tip, and a tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this product  for a long time.</li>
            <li> Your dental hygene is not complete until you have finished up with the WaterPik...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Waterpik gave me in return a WP60 which makes me think the WP65 won&#x27;t be around for long.</li>
            <li> I hope this lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I would have expected it to last longer.</li>
            <li> They sell that case 2 ways, one empty and one populated with the different tips.</li>
            <li> Package arrived and it was much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> When you are finished using the flosser, you have to leave the entire assembly uncovered (since there is no cover) , otherwise you have to remove the empty</li>
            <li> Had this one too long to return it, so I won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
            <li> A minor miracle..</li>
            <li> Seems it will run for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Clearly not designed with thought to allow repairs.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I back down from a 50%/50% water-to-hygrogen peroxide solution to a 80%/20% solution as he said that should be enough to do the job</li>
            <li> I am certainly NOT a dentist--nor am I anything close to a qualified evaluator of ANY medical equipment.  </li>
            <li> Our last one got too much internal mineral buildup from our hard water, but this one didn&#x27;t last long enough for that to happen.  </li>
            <li> If you Google Waterpik, you will invariably find dozens of \\&quot;studies\\&quot; on the Waterpik versus plain old flossing.</li>
            <li> Generally about $10 less than their newer fancier model.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this model in the past and it started to get very very loud.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but always come back to Waterpik.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second one, my other one lasted over 6 years.</li>
            <li> At first it started ok then after a short while it started squealing real bad again.</li>
            <li> Works well, is quiet unlike some other water flossers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the other tips so cannot comment on them; the one tip is all I need daily.</li>
            <li> Just about impossible for someone to do by themselves and without many flat headed screwdrivers to pry off the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Waterpik for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Having gone thru 12 years(&#x27;87 - &#x27;99) of periodontal surgeries, cleanings, etc and spent enough money then to buy a new car, I have been a teeth cleaning fanatic with manual toothbrushes, floss, and proxy brushes.</li>
            <li> Also, difficult keeping connection clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think company executives actually order the engineers to \\&quot;design this thing so it will break in a few years and can&#x27;t be repaired\\&quot; but buy putting pressure on to make it as cheaply as possible</li>
            <li> The only negatives I have, which are minor, are the push button on the wand stops the water flow instead of starts it, which seems backwards to me, so unless you&#x27;re holding the button down water starts shooting out as soon as the unit is switched on.  </li>
            <li> I think the main problem is due to the small hole in the rubber grommet-plug in the resevoir.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older, different model which had grown weak after years of use.  </li>
            <li> but obviously this company is marketing something that IS NOT RIGHT</li>
            <li> Then I went out and bought the single cordless one.  </li>
            <li> I use this every single evening before sleep, and haven&#x27;t missed a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of years and haven&#x27;t had a single incident of bleeding gums since.</li>
            <li> I cannot imagine that it will last anywhere as long as my previous sturdy Waterpik Flosser.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, the water reservoir isn&#x27;t really &#x27;attached&#x27; to the base at all, so it&#x27;s pretty easy to knock the reservoir straight off of the base when moving it around or even turning it on, spilling water everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally</li>
            <li> Gums form a natural V in between the teeth, and excessive use can cause that tissue to recess.  </li>
            <li> Each waterpik last about three years on average, I work from home</li>
            <li> It replaces an old one that didn&#x27;t stop working, the wand cracked and parts were not available since it was at least 30 years old.</li>
            <li> I wish they had made it so the attachments are secured in the holder instead of loosely setting in a hole.</li>
            <li> Flossing can also irritate your gums if you are too aggressive trying to get those stringy foods loose.</li>
            <li> (I just cover mine with a plastic bag rather than going through the chore of unclipping the water reservoir and flipping it upside down) and I especially wish that it was not louder than a freight train crashing into a mountain of drum sets.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was simply a lemon or if Waterpik quality standards have gone down.</li>
            <li> Turned it back down to smallest setting and used it for a bit.</li>
            <li> I wish that I had thought of it a long time ago!!  </li>
            <li> Well, would you believe the second one lasted about two and a half weeks?</li>
            <li> There are design flaws that haven&#x27;t been addressed:  where the water tube comes outside from the pump, the stiffness of the tube causes stress that eventually caused the tube to break on the previous model.  </li>
            <li> A year after used, sometime it lost power and pressure is not steady.</li>
            <li> It last forever on one charge and it&#x27;s less money.  </li>
            <li> After removing the tip, the lid can cover the works for ease of traveling with this indispensable tool for removing all the small bits of food that stick between and behind the teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected as far as noise goes</li>
            <li> , it works for a week or two (if your lucky) and then it fails.  </li>
            <li> All the good points of a larger one &amp; all the bad points too (messy as usual).  </li>
            <li> The tub is so large and it fits poorly into the flosser stand.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;The unit is a little noisy, but again, not enough to complain about, unless someone is trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> says it&#x27;s a pleasure because I have so little oral plaque and no cavities for the last 15</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and efficient, this machine replaced a battery-operated water pik which only lasted a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> WILL grow inside the unit, despite religiously flushing the mouthwash out every single time with plain tap water.</li>
            <li> Then I use the other side of the towel to dry it all up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a little peroxide in my water for extra cleaning, but you certainly do not have to.  </li>
            <li> We recommend them to all of our patients and our patients have nothing bad to say about them :)</li>
            <li> I am always amazed at how much debris is left behind, after flossing!</li>
            <li> I expected it would.  </li>
            <li> There is not much to say about a waterpik.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To prevent the water leaking, PROPERLY and FIRMLY place the reservior onto the unit.  </li>
            <li> It only adds a few seconds to your routine, but nothing to be complaining to the company about.</li>
            <li> water is softened and I fully expected a longer life-span for this machine.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> The Pause button not really pratical (I always release it without thinking).</li>
            <li> It performs as expected, and has the features I need.</li>
            <li> The only trouble that I&#x27;ve had with the three of these that I&#x27;ve bought, is that over time,they tends to clog up.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say about this machine, except that it does the job.  </li>
            <li> Recent visits to the dentist revealed a few &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; deepening a bit.</li>
            <li> Waterpik flosser stopped working correctly after only a few months when the pump gave out.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it is noisy and it can be messy.</li>
            <li> Waterpik was absolutely no help since we were out of warranty.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik blasts debris out from everywhere (use a weaker flow over bridge-work and things like that), even at the gum line in front and back of the teeth that the floss can&#x27;t touch and the toothbrush may be missing.</li>
            <li> I closed the drain in the sink just so that I could evaluate the water as it dribbled out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Six months or so of streaked mirrors, wet pants, and being shot in the eye have informed me that resistance is futile.  </li>
            <li> Six months or so of streaked mirrors, wet pants, and being shot in the eye have informed me that resistance is futile.  </li>
            <li> It sounds like the pump is trying to pump but is all jammed up.</li>
            <li> It does the job as expected of it.  </li>
            <li> it works as expected</li>
            <li> For that reason, one must be careful when turning on the device.</li>
            <li> It shipped promptly, and it arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> The third day I had trouble getting any spray at all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to drive 25 miles to the nearest service center and hassle...</li>
            <li> Any rate, filled up the blue thing with water and turned it on - after putting it on the white base.</li>
            <li> When you run out of water, shut it off and empty any remaining water from the reservoir&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is money well spent to keep from having a cavity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it is much harder to insert the water container for use.  </li>
            <li> I just hang my head over the sink and blast away until the reservoir is empty.  </li>
            <li> The last one I had lasted for a few years before the tubing broke.</li>
            <li> Unless they are firmly locked in place there will be no or only minimal flow.</li>
            <li> This unit has an annoying pulse which makes it kind of tickle, not really flow as well.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to find this product online, probably due to the fact that it is necessary to type the odd name EXACTLY as listed.</li>
            <li> have gotten this model twice, thinking I got a bad one the first time, but the second one had the same</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several, and the little hose, or the hose connections tend to break (or leak!)</li>
            <li> I was told by several dentists that I was going to loose some teeth to unhealthy gums but one told me to get my teeth cleaned and use a waterpik religiously after each meal.</li>
            <li> This is my third generation Waterpik and, unfortunately, it has gone the way of the new coke fiasco.</li>
            <li> I would say there is NEVER a good time to use the Waterpik; it&#x27;s that loud.  </li>
            <li> Other Waterpik tips are not interchangeable.</li>
            <li> I have been using these a few years and noticed several negative comments about low pressure/volume.</li>
            <li> Then shoot through the other side of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Before I bought it, I read other buyers&#x27; comments and benefitted by them.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I had scanned reviews of other water flossers and didn&#x27;t want one that was too \\&quot;weak\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I could not hear the door bell ringing the other day while using the machine.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer that the stop button should be start button, other than that</li>
            <li> In the past two months I have replaced two and am on my third.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other users&#x27; experiences, my Waterpik has not malfunctioned in the three years that I&#x27;ve owned it.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve also used the WaterPik, quite unconventionally, to blast out the gunk from my razor, my ear and nose hair clipper, and other tools).  </li>
            <li> and I am just wasting all the rest (i.e., the other 30% of the Hydrogen peroxide solution).</li>
            <li> I heeded the noise concerns of other users thinking I would use the Waterpik at an acceptable hour, say 8pm instead of 11pm when I&#x27;m heading to bed.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely high-powered at maximum and I have used it there and at the lower speeds.  </li>
            <li> This newer version of the Waterpik Water Flosser is not as sturdy as the other model (which I had for 8 yrs).  </li>
            <li> The key word is excessive.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product, but I decided there was only a small possibility of that happening.   </li>
            <li> I got another one because I didn&#x27;t know of any other choices.</li>
            <li> Then of course when you go to use it the next time, you have to struggle to get the tub seated firmly over the little water outlet again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the tank also seems a little loose when mounted.   </li>
            <li> I used Waterpik actively for a year, and then discontinued using for 4 years.  </li>
            <li> This unit too, works erratically, and I have to constantly reposition and reset the container filled with water on the base.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have a broken item with just more than 30-days old -:(... do not know what to do .....</li>
            <li> This one however is only a little over a year old (beyond warranty) and is now leaking like crazy so that when you add water the water simply pours out.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get a hard pulse; only works on the lowest pulsing.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get the resevoir to seal and to get the fluid to flow and now the motor runs w/out creating pressure.</li>
            <li> they are poorly designed and don&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> I need a water pik, but the postage and the hassle of sending it somewhere is simply not worth it.</li>
            <li> But at least it has the larger water holding capacity, longer hose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It should last at least a year, don&#x27;t you think?</li>
            <li> By the time I got done, the water was grey and cloudy and contained lots of particles (and even a few chunks!) of food and who knows what else.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the attachments in the storage area are loosley setting in a hole</li>
            <li> The only negative is the hose that connects the pump to the handle</li>
            <li> This is my second one that I purchased lately.  </li>
            <li> not sure I need to do it that long, but I am determined to get my gum line spotless.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m an idiot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;that sits on top of the motorized base.</li>
            <li> Since fitting the top onto the base is part of every use, the flossed is annoying.</li>
            <li> When you have finished using the flosser you are forced to leave the water tub open to dust, dirt, etc.</li>
            <li> I then go to the back side of my teeth and slowly pick my way across them.</li>
            <li> This one is a little smaller than others I&#x27;ve had in the past, and takes up less space on the sink.  </li>
            <li> Two examples: very hard to insert or remove pick from handle; jet force control knob in handle is loose and slides back and forth when using the WaterPik.</li>
            <li> If you push down at that spot it unlocks the spring and lets the water flow.</li>
            <li> I had this model for 10 years before it broke down 2 months ago.  </li>
            <li> But anyway, stopped using it in the mirror and got down to business</li>
            <li> Insert the pic in your mouth and lean over the sink before you turn it on, unless you want to hose down your bathroom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is that you have to press hard on the corner so that the rubber seal is tight.  </li>
            <li> A little noisy is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it lacks a little power when it comes to water pressure.</li>
            <li> (2) the hose connections are bound to be the fail because of inadequate strain reliefs, (3) when a tip is in place, it is tough to get the handle to fit into the storage hole under the tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try half a teaspoon of bleach in the tub of water with every 5th use.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;During this period I have had quite a few different Water Pik units (I&#x27;d say at least 6).  </li>
            <li> This waterpik is quieter than any previous waterpiks that I have had.  </li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s plenty of pressure when the lever is put half way.  </li>
            <li> I just assumed that I got the odd lemon</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s slightly off, no water comes out of the jet...</li>
            <li> My previous one lasted 3 years before the hose broke.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a half dozen Waterpik flossers over the years --</li>
            <li> Who needs a half gallon of water to floss?</li>
            <li> IT LASTED LESS</li>
            <li> It is now less than I would like.  </li>
            <li> May have to &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; slightly to start the stream.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this model 1 and a half years ago.  </li>
            <li> He now uses this Waterpik which costs $39.99 on Amazon, but I used my Amazon reward points and got it for less than a dollar.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts longer than previous Waterpik&#x27;s that I had</li>
            <li> I have had this unit less than a year.  </li>
            <li> it seems to be less than five for me.  </li>
            <li> This replacement has a stiffer, less pliant hose.  </li>
            <li> We find that we are making less use of this model than we did of the previous one.</li>
            <li> That works out to less than $10/yr - less than $1/month.</li>
            <li> The clear reservoir makes it much easier to line up the holes when placing it on the base.  </li>
            <li> I wind up using it less often because I have to put it away in a closet each time.</li>
            <li> Bought this less than 30 days ago.  </li>
            <li> Typically I&#x27;d go to the dentist and get a half-hour lecture about gum care</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to keep replacing it every two months or less.  </li>
            <li> This one seems to work as well with some improvements over previous model.</li>
            <li> This WaterPik lasted less than 60 days and now won&#x27;t cycle water at all.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous, I had another brand for several years with no mouthwash issues.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will at least last a few months.</li>
            <li> 2nd update:  the replacement unit failed after one month of use - definitely not a quality item you can depend on.  </li>
            <li> Typical Waterpik product.</li>
            <li> The way this newer base is designed where the handle is stored causes the excess water to run out on your sink area, your must be aware of any other electrical devices you might have in the same area.  </li>
            <li> The pause button does take a little force to hold down.</li>
            <li> But who cares the pump is a little quieter if it breaks down and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> But who cares the pump is a little quieter if it breaks down and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I had to replace our previous Waterpik, same model seen here - the WP-65, because I finally figured out that there is mold inside the unit that was so bad, it was backing up the water flow inside the unit that only a trickle of water was coming out of the handle.</li>
            <li> The first two started leaking water like crazy at the handle; nothing came out the tip, it all came out in the handle.  </li>
            <li> Makes a mess.</li>
            <li> I told them this is not true.</li>
            <li> I do think that it makes quite a mess for me.  </li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t need to tell you twice because the first time you use cold water, you&#x27;ll howl like an enraged baboon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But no matter how loud, messy, wet, and weird it can be, just remember one thing...</li>
            <li> it still beats flossing.wice because the first time you use cold water, you&#x27;ll howl like an enraged baboon.  </li>
            <li> But no matter how loud, messy, wet, and weird it can be, just remember one thing...</li>
            <li> I would like to see a little less slop.    </li>
            <li> so cuts down on hidden food particles that cause decay!</li>
            <li> The product is highly recommended if you only want to buy one once...and NOT use it like an 8 year old to fight the forces of evil in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Waterpik is loud and held at the wrong angle, it can dribble down your arm.  </li>
            <li> After 3 months of use, it started leaking at the little rubber grommet at bottom of water tank.</li>
            <li> The adapter attachment &amp; little hose mean having some extra stuff there at the faucet, but there&#x27;s no more motor noise, no reservoir to fill, no fumbling with the WaterPik on the counter, etc.  </li>
            <li> It also takes up little space.</li>
            <li> I fill the little tank up all the way, and blast the bacteria away for about three minutes..............</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a little noisy, kinda like an RC car.</li>
            <li> Also, it leaked a little out the bottom when using, so that there was a little puddle under it when I turned it off.  </li>
            <li> It works well, but is a little noisey...</li>
            <li> if I could change anything it would be the plug, it becomes a little awkward when putting away, other than that, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had trouble finding this in stores, and found other types, even by Waterpick to have too little pressure, and water resevoirs that were too small.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using this Waterpik with the Sinus Tip on a daily basis, I have NOT have the usual sinus infections and allergy symptons that I used to have!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the pik, when stowed, is too hard to get out of its intended storage space.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst Waterpik Flosser  I have ever bought, and so poorly made that it is greatly overpriced.  </li>
            <li> Recently its hose was so old and worn that it cracked in places and leaked badly, but it didn&#x27;t owe me a dime</li>
            <li> purchase was an absolute disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It would merit a higher rating if:  (1) there were at least three regular tips (gingeval cleaning) and  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday.......</li>
            <li> This waterpik stopped pumping out water after 5 weeks and used a few times.</li>
            <li> It does remove the tiny particles that flossing seems to leave behind.   </li>
            <li> However, after a few months the pump Stopped working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad to see  what had been such a good product deteriorate so terribly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but once you learn it is not that messy.</li>
            <li> Messy till you learn how to do it.</li>
            <li> I decided to save a few bucks and buy a cheaper competitor.</li>
            <li> It also seems to &amp;#34;hesitate&amp;#34; or change stroke beat every few seconds while in operation</li>
            <li> So I wasted $12.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The mold or fungus is hideously unhealthy and will clog the unit too (water coming from under the waterpik onto your countertop and the handle at the same time</li>
            <li> These tips are not available for the WP-65, but are for the traveling Waterpik</li>
            <li> So yes, I set up 2 Waterpiks everyday and so does my husband.</li>
            <li> I was not happy about leaving the water/mouthwash exposed until the next flossing</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble for a few days but</li>
            <li> Replacement item is now about three months old and has failed.  </li>
            <li> am a heavy user of these devices, using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> This is really not a problem--water on counter surface is common.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle and nozzle handle, at the end of the plastic hose, did not fit well into the holder after use.  </li>
            <li> I put a heavy rubber band around it and that worked until the motor died.</li>
            <li> Ordered this, worked for a few weeks, then stopped working.</li>
            <li> Then the spray stopped dead.</li>
            <li> Fast-forward quite a few years to now.  </li>
            <li> No matter how firmly seated the reservoir, it would not pump water despite chugging away, and then the motor stopped altogether.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather be a noisy neighbor for a few minutes than not water floss my teeth</li>
            <li> After using this newer pik for a while I must point out that you must be careful when turning the tip so as not to press down and eject it!!!</li>
            <li> It crimps unless you hang it up very carefully, and I didn&#x27;t realize until too late that it was cracking.  </li>
            <li> The first failed because of a broken water line.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no other company making a device that does what this one does</li>
            <li> My previous WaterPik, the WP-100 &amp;#34;Ultra Flosser,&amp;#34; failed similarly.  </li>
            <li> However, after barely five months of less-than-daily use without any problem, this model suddenly failed.  </li>
            <li> I turned it on, the motor started, and the rpm slowly went down to zero.  </li>
            <li> make the mistake of ever using dirty water in your brand new waterpIk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li> The unit has failed, after only a few months.  </li>
            <li> We had the previous unit for at least 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fail regularly when the feed tube to the nozzle breaks, and later, when the motor fails (seized and/or fails to supply water due to cavitation of the fluid and pump failure).    </li>
            <li> My dentist says I am one of his top patients in oral hygiene, so take that all you stupid reports!</li>
            <li> It is small and compact but holds allot of water.  </li>
            <li> that was small and lasted for quite some time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;talking about the small rubber ring on the bottom of the water container having to meet the rubber ring</li>
            <li> I have a small sink</li>
            <li> I usually add mouthwash to the water to add zest to the flow..</li>
            <li> Two of these have failed in two months, both for the same reason - the motor stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this over the handheld small sized flosser.</li>
            <li> A small price to pay to protect you teeth.</li>
            <li> It is noisy, but I was expecting this, having had experience with the brand in the past.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this means that it is held back by substandard design</li>
            <li> I usually get 3 - 5 years out of each one.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses this everyday!</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist this past Monday</li>
            <li> 3 units in a row have failed after several weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Use the product no more than two times a day.</li>
            <li> ---small</li>
            <li> thought flossing got all the small food particles out from between my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always amazed to watch the small particles (and some not so small) flow out of my mouth and into the sink when I pik.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the usual waterpick.</li>
            <li> (I wish there were a cover over the water tank, but that&#x27;s a small quibble.)</li>
            <li> It is a lot lighter than past models.</li>
            <li> We have had very few cavities over the years, and NO periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> After tearing the thing apart, which was no easy task, I discovered that a very small part was not letting water pass through it.</li>
            <li> hose is very stiff and will not straighten out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then when I use the water pic I can usually see 2 to 4 or 5 small particle collect in the sink!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the button that pauses the water from spraying requires you to push down really hard or the water will still run.&lt;br /&gt;my fingers start to ache after a few seconds of using this.</li>
            <li> She has braces and this helps to get all the food out that is hard to reach with a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The water flow cutoff button on the wand is hard to use and is a momentary off.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t use water flossers because the pressure coming out is too hard.  </li>
            <li> I would find it hard to switch to another brand.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have a large bathroom, I don&#x27;t have a counter to set the base on.</li>
            <li> My family had a waterpik at least 30 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly shoddy quality control.</li>
            <li> they sell you something that is shoddy and give it a two year warranty</li>
            <li> Waterpik will be getting a complaint letter from me.</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with the idea of a water flosser.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about this item.</li>
            <li> I called Waterpik and complained.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the hose material loses its suppleness and hardens.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise stay away from this model at least.</li>
            <li> The nozzle is  located under the blue plastic container of water and we find it awkward to remove.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll never own another one.  </li>
            <li> So loud it was almost painful to the ear.</li>
            <li> My previous waterpik was broken and I was in serious need of another and the&lt;br /&gt;price</li>
            <li> It slowly died in February 2015.  </li>
            <li> No more bleeding!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems like all these oral irrigators are being made at lower quality the past few years</li>
            <li> Longer usage can overheat the motor and cause product failure as well as voiding the warranty.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The very small investment has saved me thousands in dental repair costs since I began to use it.  </li>
            <li> I am disgusted with such thinga being foisted on the public.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It seems as if this company has seriously lowered it&#x27;s standards.  </li>
            <li> seriously?  </li>
            <li> my unit failed after less than two months.  </li>
            <li> Reviewers who have complained about poor pressure probably aren&#x27;t adjusting it on the handle.  </li>
            <li> manual suggests flushing would prolong life but doesn&#x27;t indicate that unit will fail after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> If the glass tip is broken off, the stub is impossible to remove from the handle, and I have had to replace the entire unit when this happened.</li>
            <li> There is no actual warranty and quality is getting worse from bad.</li>
            <li> Anymore dumb questions?</li>
            <li> The pump worked but no water coming out or weak.</li>
            <li> the weak link is the flexible hose between the pump body and the nozzle head.  </li>
            <li> ; one all of which have failed within 30 to 60 days-pump fails to pump water thru pic or fails to have proper pressure.  </li>
            <li> Pressurem on flosser non-adjustable -weak.  </li>
            <li> a weak spray would come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has replaced the awful string of floss, delivered cleaning to the area below the gum line and makes me much happier now that I am taking my oral health seriously.</li>
            <li> and then it is very hard to replace.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a little awkward to get the wand into the holder.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t stupidly thrown out the box, I would have instantly returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is extremely poor.</li>
            <li> Get addicted like me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the secret sauce that dentist put in their water piks.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> You can fill the reservoir seperately and place it on the base later.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is that the nickel cadmium battery can&#x27;t be thrown out without environmental harm, they have to be returned to a qualified dealer.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this one is poor.        </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to this machine.</li>
            <li> Someone else before me mentioned the power behind the pulsing function.</li>
            <li> My experience with this one is that they made it worse.    </li>
            <li> Poor design.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the MATERIAL BUILD QUALITY IS POOR.</li>
            <li> I hate it and am going to return it and feel screwed for even having to pay for  shipping it back.  </li>
            <li> but the competing products are worse.</li>
            <li> The stupidity of the engineering is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> These unfortunately have a weak link.</li>
            <li> Also the pressure adjustment is on the handle which makes it virtually impossible to change pressure settings while holding pause without making a gigantic mess!  </li>
            <li> It may feel like a fire hose in your mouth, even a little painful, but listen to me folks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a different model waterpik and have been very disappointed with the device&#x27;s tips quality.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing because my teeth are so tightly packed together</li>
            <li> It seems every time I visit the dentist and am ask to demonstrate my flossing technique, I get told I do it all wrong.</li>
            <li> and I can return it if something goes wrong.</li>
            <li> Product was unable to be delivered and returned to sender.  </li>
            <li> design seems flawed a bit for the container.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there are&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is useless.</li>
            <li> I figured out why waterpiks fail.</li>
            <li> it is extremely difficult to insert pics.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t see anything wrong with this yet.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we&#x27;ve already been through three of these units in 3 months.</li>
            <li> If something goes wrong with it, I will immediately get another.  </li>
            <li> so it is now useless.  </li>
            <li> A bit of a scary experience.</li>
            <li> The button to squeeze to make it stop is difficult to press</li>
            <li> Not happy at all!  </li>
            <li> The poor quality of Waterpik is just infuriating.  </li>
            <li> Unit failed after about 2 months.</li>
            <li> If you purchase the Waterpic water flosser the hose will eventually fail.</li>
            <li> (I will update again when this one fails...</li>
            <li> Failed after 2 uses.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Guess which one fails?</li>
            <li> So, what is wrong with the flosser?  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> does not work well, very poor design, there is no cover to the water reservoir and the well gets dirty</li>
            <li> This one stinks.</li>
            <li> a disappointment.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It works, but is awkward to handle.  </li>
            <li> Awkward.</li>
            <li> Disappointing</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;d have to go to weeks of subgingival cleanings which were painful &amp; expensive.</li>
            <li> /shower.&lt;br /&gt;if used as a weapon you can blind an intruder at 10 feet!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> Yes, I had to have root planing, which is unpleasant.......</li>
            <li> The lowest pressure is useless, this product is worthless.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to slide the adjuster on the handle to increase the intensity of the water.  </li>
            <li> The coiled tube gets twisted and can be annoying to correct.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> You can buy replacement tubing, but it is almost impossible to put on.</li>
            <li> Amazingly bad quality control.</li>
            <li> I ordered it on Feb. 12th, not too bad on turnaround time.</li>
            <li> bad:  (1)</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> Reading all these water pick reviews is depressing!</li>
            <li> Crazy!  </li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTING.</li>
            <li> Within a day or two, water is no longer coming out of the stupid thing.</li>
            <li> You need 2 hands to turn off this stupid thing because it slides all over the place.</li>
            <li> I was an idiot to think I&#x27;d get it all out.</li>
            <li> and I hate that the floss cuts off the circulation to my fingers.</li>
            <li> the water well, all the nicks and crannies of the base unit, the tip I used, the on/off switch, the cut outs in the base to hold the tips and the handle and the handle.</li>
            <li> Now it is worthless.</li>
            <li> I even take it on the road because nothing is as annoying as a bit of food stuck between the molars.</li>
            <li> Bad move!  </li>
            <li> OMG, within 5 days of using it, I hated it because:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the mouthwash for a couple of reasons: #1 - water tastes terrible in my water district and #2 -</li>
            <li> I never saw a worst designed product, and after two months throw it away.</li>
            <li> item is the worst product I have ever bought at Amazon.</li>
            <li> My teeth are terrible and I needed to ramp up the care of my chompers.  </li>
            <li> and you see all the disgusting mold or fungus or whatever it is.</li>
            <li> Disgusting!  </li>
            <li> Hose attachment has been moved to beneath the base, unfortionately still no clamp!!  </li>
            <li> Then after a couple of uses it started making a real bad squealing noise.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I replaced the more expensive version with this one.  I like it just as well.</li>
            <li> A week later i check at walmart and they have The same product... Including 2 xtra ítems for 39.95 + tax.&lt;br /&gt;I Was so desapointed at My self.</li>
            <li> Purchased mine in 2013 and have used it every night since; essential part of my bed-time ritual and it gets my whole mouth much cleaner than floss + brushing.</li>
            <li> The unit worked well when initially received. As compared to the unit it replaced (which we wore out over about three years of daily use), the motor is smaller, the unit runs louder, and the pump seems to require more torque than the motor can comfortably provide- and it also produces about half the pressure it did when new. The motor now runs hot enough to produce the odor characteristic of burning insulation, which renders it a possible inhalation and fire hazard. It&#x27;s going into the e-waste bin. I just bought the better unit: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GLRREU/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 . The new unit will require a little more counter space in our bathroom, but I have some hope (based on the large number of positive reviews) that it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I bought the the Wp-65 model , after 1 week the pump would not work. returned it to the store for a second one but it had no water pressure after 4 days. this marks a 100% failer rate. maybe the older waterpiks work but not the newer ones, Waterpik has really lowered its standards. If they keep going the way they are the company will probably fold in 9 months. the concept is good but they have to make a machine that actually works and without the jackhammer noise that shakes the whole house. I will be looking for a competers brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two Waterpiks in the last year.  The first one broke after 6 months.  This one the water line is so coiled, you can&#x27;t close the lid without problems with jamming.  Other Waterpik tips are not interchangeable.</li>
            <li> I have been using these a few years and noticed several negative comments about low pressure/volume.I think the main problem is due to the small hole in the rubber grommet-plug in the resevoir.I reamed mine out a bit with a small clean drill bit and now get good flow.As a test fill resevoir with water,pull out the jet and you should be able to suck out some water easily.Than put the jet in the sink and the water should continue to flow freely.If not the hole needs to be opened up</li>
            <li> Works perfect.  It is small and compact but holds allot of water.  The adjustable strength of the water stream is easy to adjust on the fly.  I plugged it in, primed it as per the instructions, and it worked perfectly.  I love it and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> These things work okay for a while but then the plastic hose that goes from the pump to the wand will get brittle and it will just break. Then you will have to throw the unit out and buy another one because they design it so you can&#x27;t fix or replace the hose, so plan on buying a new one every year or two. The quality of this product is extremely poor. Another good example of the garbage coming out of China.</li>
            <li> Not as good as last one I bought.  Made more cheaply, less adustible, etc.</li>
            <li> The flosser works fine, but it is noisier than I hoped.  I made a foam pedestal that helps insulate the vibration from the washstand surface.</li>
            <li> I started using the Waterpik a number of years ago, and once one realizes how much more it does than a toothbrush, one will never again feel that ones teeth are clean unless followed up with the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I ordered this through Amazon is the fact that this model seems to have been discontinued by drugstores, etc. In fact, when searching for it, it was the last model displayed on the list of models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to Waterpik and if there seems to be no flow, make sure you press down on the connecting parts. Unless they are firmly locked in place there will be no or only minimal flow. Also, there are several positions for controlling the strength of the jet - start with the weakest one to find the strength most comfortable for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the Waterpik arrived securely wrapped and in good time.&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to order from this seller, again.</li>
            <li> Quality is good and it works fine. Keep hoping they will find a better design that is less akward to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product which flushes teeth and gums with plenty of water flow for better cleaning. On mid range intensity it does great job without piercing pinpoint jet of my previous one. One drawback is the large size of product versus small vanity top, I should have been more aware of dimensions as it takes up large amount of space. Tank is overly large, which they say, means fewer fill ups, but I don&#x27;t like the idea of leaving water in between uses, so I fill halfway, use and empty balance of water, also not very easy because of size. Also does not have tank cover top, which would help to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> PRO: I have been recently told by a new dentist that I have excellent teeth, no gum disease, tight gums and no cavities. I immediately burst out in praise of water pik. It&#x27;s not your teeth that rot, it&#x27;s the food stuck in your gums that rots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: The pressure control slider on the handle goes from mild to very, very strong with no real middle ground. It may feel like a fire hose in your mouth, even a little painful, but listen to me folks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Massage your gums every time with the water blast inside and outside of your gums. The enhanced stimulation will tighten your gums, reduce impaction of food particles between uses and it feels great. A little blood at first is only clots being released.... That&#x27;s a good thing. Get the inside of your teeth and linger with the blast. Let it shoot between each tooth vigorusly. Then shoot through the other side of your teeth. Your dentist will be impressed and your teeth will last a lifetime. Use it 2-3x daily. Get addicted like me. I am 50 years old, my dentist said I have the teeth of a 30 year old. I give major credit to Water pik. Expect it to last a year or two before the motor starts failing, but hey, 40 bucks every two years is very cheap dental insurance.  Try half a teaspoon of bleach in the tub of water with every 5th use. It&#x27;s the secret sauce that dentist put in their water piks. Get the food out, get your gums in line. Go with Water Pik.</li>
            <li> These  Item I purchase on 2/21/07 I used only for 3 week and it broke I do not kwon if I can return or not to have my money back or replace with another</li>
            <li> I am giving this a 4star, as I like the product, however, it does give you a bath until you get this thing started.. ha ha. I never had a Waterpik with so much spray.. I think it&#x27;s a good system and definetly for the money a good product.. It does the job..  &lt;br /&gt;Fast shippment!</li>
            <li> it is good for gingiva health</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, you have to keep replacing the wand. the hose breaks every 3 months and they won&#x27;t replace for free</li>
            <li> The Waterpik worked fitfully from first use.  After three days it quit entirely.  Thanks to Amazon we had no difficulty returning it.  We replaced it with the ConAir, lower rated but more effective.</li>
            <li> if i could find a substitute for water pic products, i would do so.  they are poorly designed and don&#x27;t last long at all.  for a personal water pic, it is much too big.  i had a personal waterpic a while ago that was small and lasted for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the WaterPik WP-65 for a couple of weeks now.  I&#x27;m a first-time user of such a device --- and am very impressed so far.  This device is admittedly somewhat cumbersome to use but seems to do a fine job of cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I should note that a strange situation occurred during shipping.  The item was initially sent to an intermediate shipping point of Dallas.  It was then trucked to Houston --- bypassing my location in Austin.  Then the package was placed into US mail for Austin.  There was NOT any significant delay, but it makes me wonder --- wouldn&#x27;t it have been more efficient to have INITIALLY used the US mail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE (3 years later) ***&lt;br /&gt;This unit continues to operate very smoothly.  And --- the end-results are especially gratifying.  I had been experiencing moderate gingivitis since 1990 --- that was the primary reason for my purchase.  NOW... my dental checkups for the last 2+ years indicate NO gum-problems... and no cavities either.  Yes... I use this EVERY day... at night. I am obviously very happy.</li>
            <li> I was told by several dentists that I was going to loose some teeth to unhealthy gums but one told me to get my teeth cleaned and use a waterpik religiously after each meal. I did and guess what, it worked and my gum problem has cleared up</li>
            <li> Their newer model seems to work a little better, but this one has a lower profile and fits in the space I have by the sink better.</li>
            <li> This is my second waterpick purchase. The first one lasted twenty years until the seal started spraying water. My dentist and I both loved it. I hope and expect this one to be just as good. If the noise bothers you get some earplugs and your teeth will last longer..</li>
            <li> worked ok for abot a year then the hose kept spliting</li>
            <li> VERY loud. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but I don&#x27;t enjoy using it. Gave it away at a garage sale.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, right on time.</li>
            <li> Works just the way it should.  plenty of power, easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is well made, albeit plastic in the modern fashion.  It works as advertised.  It is easy to use and the large water tank is a plus.  I recommend this Waterpik, a good value  for the money.</li>
            <li> Had a different brand of water flosser and it worked okay.  This one much higher quality and really gets the job done.  Has reduced gum problems.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This waterpik is small enough to be portable and transportable and large enough to hold a good rinse.  It works very well and is well engineered.</li>
            <li> I used Waterpik actively for a year, and then discontinued using for 4 years.  Still works!  I was concerned the rubber gaskets would be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very noisy.  But, it&#x27;s faster than flossing for clearing food between teeth.  Flossing is still required if food is stuck between teeth.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the service I received from Amazon.com.  I absolutely love the waterpik.  I had one many years ago and am happy to be using this product again.  Thank you so much. Kristy</li>
            <li> The product performs satisfactorily so far. It would merit a higher rating if:  (1) there were at least three regular tips (gingeval cleaning) and  (2) the handle controller of jet force were more effective and discernible.</li>
            <li> Been looking for one like my old one- super happy with this- love the power</li>
            <li> I bought a different model waterpik and have been very disappointed with the device&#x27;s tips quality.  The tips are extremely fragile. if the device tips over, they WILL break.  Mine broke within 2 days.  I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips. I will never buy another waterpik product.</li>
            <li> My family had a waterpik at least 30 years ago.  The machine worked great and for a long time--5 kids in the family; still works for all I know.  So, now I bought my children their own waterpik and sent one to son in college along with getting myself one.  I wish that I had thought of it a long time ago!!  So now we are following Dr. Prices research to save out teeth from the inside out and using waterpik to work from the outside in, including our gums.  Waterpiks are great to have.  If you buy extra tools, be sure to include the Orthodontic tip.  It isn&#x27;t just for braces--though it&#x27;s great for that, too.  **Be sure that the tip you are looking for is for the model you choose, as not all waterpiks tools are interchangeable--Which is the one thing I would change with this company.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik flosser is a strong machine for flossing and can certainly do the job but the individual piks should also include a brush to finish the job properly.</li>
            <li> my old one burned out, wanted to replace, but newbies were all $60 at the store, and had more features than I needed.  This one was perfect....about $35.00, everything I wanted, quiet, stable.</li>
            <li> I can brush my teeth real good, then floss and rinse and feel clean.  Then when I use the water pic I can usually see 2 to 4 or 5 small particle collect in the sink!  Now, they are about as clean as possiable.  I have always taken care of them and at 80+ they still serve me good.</li>
            <li> Cleans debris between teeth very effectively, but the unit is very, very noisy.  Also, difficult keeping connection clean.</li>
            <li> Before I take a look at the product and the quality itself, let&#x27;s talk Waterpiks in general. If you Google Waterpik, you will invariably find dozens of \\&quot;studies\\&quot; on the Waterpik versus plain old flossing. Many studies will state that the Waterpik does not get everything that flossing would. I disagree. To preface this, let&#x27;s remember I am not a dentist and have zero professional training in dental care, just years of flossing, brushing my teeth and using mouthwash. It seems every time I visit the dentist and am ask to demonstrate my flossing technique, I get told I do it all wrong. I assume that since I am getting between the teeth and down below the gums I am doing it right. My experience has shown that if I floss first and Waterpik second, I actually get out material the floss missed. My experience disagrees with these studies and my visits with the dentist are actually better now with the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this isn&#x27;t to say I throw the dentist&#x27;s opinion out the window, I like to cover my bases, so here is what I do. At night before bed, I Waterpik with a full reservoir of warm water mixed with a quick splash of mouthwash. I use the mouthwash for a couple of reasons: #1 - water tastes terrible in my water district and #2 - it can&#x27;t hurt to shoot some mouthwash (even diluted) between the teeth. After I Waterpik, I floss and brush my teeth followed by straight-up mouthwash. Occasionally, I get tired and just floss real quick. This has done wonders for my gums and general tooth health. It works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, however, the Waterpik takes some getting used to. Even if you floss now, expect it to hurt your gums. Gradually build up the pressure until you can handle either full blast or one level below. After a month or two, full pressure just feels like a nice gum massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for quality, it is a plastic system with a motor, nothing terribly sophisticated about it and I don&#x27;t expect it to last more than two or three years at best. Mine has been going a year and still works great with zero issues. I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy a replacement when this one does die though.as been going a year and still works great with zero issues. I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy a replacement when this one does die though.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much when it is operational.  However, each of the two that I purchased stopped working after one year of occasional use.  The motor simply dies.  I am very hesitant to buy another Waterpik product.</li>
            <li> This product works OK but not nearly as good as the old WP 60 with more setting for cleaning gums.</li>
            <li> I just started using my new Waterpik.  Before I bought it, I read other buyers&#x27; comments and benefitted by them.  I read the information that came with the flosser, especially the Quick Start Guide.  The Waterpik worked like I expected it would.  My only dissappointment is that I expected to receive 3 distinct tips, including a Pik Pocket tip.  Instead, I received two jet tips and the tongue cleaner.  I am going to see why this happened.  Other than that, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very Nice equipment as i have had WaterPik&#x27;s before but this latest one is the best of all.</li>
            <li> This is my third \\&quot;WaterPik\\&quot; in 20+ years.  And I still have my original teeth at almost 65 years of age.</li>
            <li> I have been using Water Piks for over 30 years and I believe that the use of Water Piks has been a major factor in helping me to maintain the condition of my teeth and gums. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;During this period I have had quite a few different Water Pik units (I&#x27;d say at least 6).  In most cases I have had to replace the units because of leaks in the hose.  The cost of repairing the hose almost equals the cost of a new unit, so I always end up buying one.  I object, not only to the cost of replacing my Water Pik every few years, but also to the effect on the environment of discarding so many of these machines.</li>
            <li> Our first waterpik jammed within the first week, and we opened it up and pushed the little gear back in place several times.  It would work for a while an then jam again.  After a while, it would only last a day or so between breaks, so we took it back for a replacement. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The replacement lasted about two months befor it stated jamming too.  As well as spraying out around the head and not holding the head.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is loud and bulky, but I have to laugh at the other commenter who tries to get the whole apparatus under the tap -- You can fill the reservoir seperately and place it on the base later.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does feel good to use, but I&#x27;m not sure I can put up with the dismal quality.  Can anyone recommend a good competitor?</li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky ones, I got eight months   and two weeks use from my Waterpik WP-65 Personal Dental Water Jet.  It works great, for a while.  I plan on buying another oral irrigator  but definitely NOT a Waterpik brand!  This is also very loud which could be an issue for apartment dwellers.</li>
            <li> My WaterPik was great -- I did not mind the noise and found that I ould contol the twisted coil hose by putting it in a cup between brushes.  But the thing quit--just quit.  What in the world is going on?  Is there any recourse for inferior units like this? I am disgusted with such thinga being foisted on the public.  Where is WAterPIk&#x27;s quality control?</li>
            <li> I hear alot of people complain that the waterpik is so loud - and it is - but you only use it a few minutes a day, and the benefits far outweigh the noise.  This model comes with 2 heads and a tongue cleaner and I think it looks nicer than the other models with its deep blue bin that doubles as a cover.  Best price I found (without having to wait for 7 day auctions to end grrrr) and it has various settings for the water pressure. I took away a star because it tends to leak a little (they all do) and for the noise, but overall a great value.</li>
            <li> I love this product.      It provides better removal of food particles than dental floss by a mile. The disign is compact and its VERY easy to use.</li>
            <li> My first waterpik lasted 7 years. As a replacement, my wife picked up a Conair Interplak. What a piece of junk. I had to point it at my hand to see if it was moving any water.    Saw this on Amazon and bought it. WOW. Hopefully this will last 7 years like the first. Nice strong jet. No doubt that its cleaning along the gum line. The pause button does take a little force to hold down. Not one cavity in seven years since I began using a water jet.  ---------------------------------------  After 3 months of use, it started leaking at the little rubber grommet at bottom of water tank. Will be calling WaterPik to get a replacement tank or grommet. Still no doubt that this little baby is getting the gum line clean. Waterpik replaced the tank grommet without hassel.  ----------------------------------------  January 2009 - Still going strong after almost 3 years.  ------------------------------  May 2010 - Still going after 4-1/2 years. Money well-spent.</li>
            <li> I had scanned reviews of other water flossers and didn&#x27;t want one that was too \\&quot;weak\\&quot;. This one is just right. It has settings from gentle to really blast the teeth and gums. I have no complaints. I can see the things falling into the sink that brushing alone didn&#x27;t catch. I think this is a good buy and definately cleans your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Waterpik continues to be the best.  The pressure settings are perfect for both me and my wife. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second WaterPik. I find this model to work well however it is very loud and vibrates too much. &lt;br /&gt;The results of using it are well worth it.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about a waterpik. This one arrived promptly, was well packed and worked.  The disadvantage of this one is that the top does not fit when you are through. The actual pik is in the way.  I shopped around however and for me this is the best model. May be it is time to design a more practical one.  The cord is long enough to reach anywhere on your bathroom counter.   I had the identical model before and it worked for years, until mysteriously the water stopped flowing throuhg the handle.</li>
            <li> Think you teeth are clean after brushing? This little gadget quickly gets rid of in between bits no tooth brush can reach.  The WaterPik also cleans out sinus congestion when you&#x27;re stuffy.  We had the WaterPik WP-70 before but could only find the WP-65 this time. We still don&#x27;t know what the differences are between the two models.  Our previous WaterPik, used daily, lasted about three years before the high pressure hose sprung a leak.  This item is well worth the price but plan to replace it every three or so years.</li>
            <li> This product was much cheaper than our Wal Mart store and the delivery was speedy too. Free shipping made a big difference.  Thanks so much for that offer!</li>
            <li> This waterpik is quieter than any previous waterpiks that I have had.  It came in a timely mannaer and I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The first Waterpik I purchased was the portable rechargeable one.  It was fine at first, but I left it for three weeks unplugged to go on a trip, and when I got back it would not charge at all.  I still had my receipt so I took it back and was reluctant to buy another one.  I did some research and decided to try the Personal Water Jet.  So far it is great - it is not very noisy, easy to use, and I really like the lever that lets you adjust the pressure.  I still haven&#x27;t used it full force yet - there&#x27;s plenty of pressure when the lever is put half way.  I like that it came with two tips and the tongue cleaner.  One thing I do after I use any type of mouthwash in the reservoir is afterwards I put in clear water and run it for 15-20 seconds to get the mouthwash out of the system. This makes sure there is not any build up in the lines.  I read that this could help prolong the life of the appliance.  I am saving my receipt, however, because there is a two year warranty and I can return it if something goes wrong.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I bought this model.  It works well but the noise level can be a bit high.  I could not hear the door bell ringing the other day while using the machine.  However, if I were to buy again, this is the model for me because it is effective, practical and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I went to amazon to order another Waterpik system(foolish me)and I just thought I&#x27;d check the customer reviews.  Virtually EVERYONE has had the same experience as me.  You get it home, it works for a week or two (if your lucky) and then it fails.  I actually didn&#x27;t get more than a couple of uses out of it.  I just assumed that I got the odd lemon but obviously this company is marketing something that IS NOT RIGHT and yet it&#x27;s amazing if you read the reviews how many people still come back to give them another chance.  Beside the product being a LEMON we must be LEMMINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!Don&#x27;t jump, go elsewhere....someone mentioned that Panasonic has it&#x27;s own oral irrigator.........Good Luck.</li>
            <li> It never worked!  Now I&#x27;m trying to return it for repairs......</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m an idiot.  My 3rd (or 4th?) Water Pik has given up the ghost after 2 months.  The first two started leaking water like crazy at the handle; nothing came out the tip, it all came out in the handle.  The latest one leaks water and so it&#x27;s obviously an electrical hazard.  Every one has only lasted 2-3 months.  Amazingly shoddy quality control.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped item promptly with free shipping.  I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase.  -G</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many water pik I have had over the years.  It is an integral part of my teeth and gum maintenance.  I am 64 years old and I just got a cleaning.  I don&#x27;t think I been to the dentist for two years.  I saw the x-rays and all the teeth roots are healthy, no cavities.    I don&#x27;t know what I would do without the waterpik, even after flossing, and brushing my teeth, the water pik finds something.  So does it make noise, I don&#x27;t care, it could send up ballons, as long as it does its job.    I love my waterpik</li>
            <li> This device is well built and is highly functional, but I consider it to have one drawback...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is way over powered. If you put it on high it would cut your teeth out of your gums!  Sadly the controls for low pressure are not well calibrated so it quickly gets too powerful and at low pressure settings result in the pump being VERY loud. Like so loud that if you live in an apartment and do your teeth at 11:30 pm you will wake your neighbors up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take advantage of the high pressure you can.&lt;br /&gt;Clean the guck out around the sink fixtures.&lt;br /&gt;Destroy any mold or mildew build up in your bathtub/shower.&lt;br /&gt;if used as a weapon you can blind an intruder at 10 feet!</li>
            <li> I looked for any make I could buy but Waterpic seems to have a lock on the market so I bought one and so far, it is doing a good job. It is smaller and works better than the old model I had (which lasted over 8 years).</li>
            <li> This product replaced my WaterPik personal unit which lasted barely 3 years. The problem I had with that &lt;br /&gt;unit is similar to this...the pumping of the water from the holding container to the jet isn&#x27;t reliable...This unit too, works erratically, and I have to constantly reposition and reset the container filled with water on the base.  Sometimes no water comes out and I realize the contact might be off...When I say \\&quot;contact&#x27;, I&#x27;m &lt;br /&gt;talking about the small rubber ring on the bottom of the water container having to meet the rubber ring &lt;br /&gt;that sits on top of the motorized base. If it&#x27;s slightly off, no water comes out of the jet...Half the time I think &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s perfect and it&#x27;s not. So, something about the design of this unit isn&#x27;t right..I gave it 3 stars because when &lt;br /&gt;it works, it works fine...I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what a perfect contact IS..and most of the &lt;br /&gt;time, there&#x27;s nothing obvious to notice.</li>
            <li> Just perfect for teeth cleaning, or even sinus irrigation!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.......a staple in our daily maintenance of the teeth.</li>
            <li> Have used this one for about a month; replaced one that was 20 years old! What an improvement. The new one is not as noisy as the olderone, and I like the lever on the side that can adjust the pressure. Would recommend this one to anyone.</li>
            <li> The product was great and fast service . I planning order again.   Doug C</li>
            <li> Picture doesn&#x27;t show there is no lid on the device so dust, etc can ge tin the fluid.  Would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I had a WaterPik when, as an adult, I found myself with a mouth full of braces.  It was a Godsend!  All these years later I decided I needed another one, and I&#x27;m so pleased to have it!  This water flosser is a fabulous addition to brushing and flossing as it blasts out debris from beneath bridges and in between teeth that sometimes get missed with traditional flossing.  With all of the latest research on dental hygiene and cancer, longevity and overall health, this is a &#x27;power tool&#x27; I won&#x27;t be without.    I opted for the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; model as I didn&#x27;t need whistles and bells.  Reviewers who have complained about poor pressure probably aren&#x27;t adjusting it on the handle.  I find the pressure just perfect, and adjustable!    I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase. I&#x27;m kind of lazy with flossing but this made everything easier. My boyfriend who hates to floss is using it and agrees with me. I agree with the other reviewer that the stop button should be start button, other than that It&#x27;s perfect for the job.</li>
            <li> The water pik works well.  It just needs a cover to prevent contamnation of the water in storage (no cover provided)!</li>
            <li> My previous one lasted 3 years before the hose broke.  This one seems to work better.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I look for.</li>
            <li> This machine does the job, no doubt about it.  The powerful water jets clean all food debris away and massage my gums - I have braces so I use it instead of flossing, and my dentist said my gums were fine.  The only problem I have with it is the design of the water reservoir.  First of all, you can&#x27;t fill the tank without picking up the fairly bulky apparatus and putting it underneath the faucet.  I have a small sink so it&#x27;s somewhat of a nuisance to do this.  Secondly, the water reservoir isn&#x27;t really &#x27;attached&#x27; to the base at all, so it&#x27;s pretty easy to knock the reservoir straight off of the base when moving it around or even turning it on, spilling water everywhere.</li>
            <li> The hose broke on my first WP-65 within the warranty period. The manufacturer replaced the unit but wouldn&#x27;t guarantee the replacement unit. Within three months the handle of the replacement unit lost the ability to hold the piks and they would shoot out of the handle whenever I turned it on, rendering it unusable. I purchased my third WP-65 and within fifteen months the motor/pump seized. As an aside, all units were quiet when new but became excessively noisy within weeks - like a minature jackhammer. Can&#x27;t someone at WaterPik design a high quality and reliable product?</li>
            <li> Uses too much space on the bathroom counter, previous models used much less.  Unit seems far too bulky for what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this before and due to time and wear had to replace it and am very happy once again having my waterpic back in my home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using  this for 6 months and expect a great checkup for my gums. I use it each night after flossing.with water/peroxide solution. No more bleeding! Never had a problem with leaking. You must see an air bubble when you attach reservoir...this means you&#x27;ve attached correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this WaterPik for 3 months.  It works great and I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.  My mouth has never felt so clean.  And the price was reasonable.  It&#x27;s well designed.</li>
            <li> This waterpik stopped pumping out water after 5 weeks and used a few times. It is still under a two year warranty. I returned to a local repair shop who told me they don&#x27;t repair this equipment but return it to Waterpik who should send me a new one. I don&#x27;t expect much reliability from the device. If it was within the 30 day period after shipment I would return it for a refund. Don&#x27;t get stuck with this product like I am.</li>
            <li> Recently visited my dentist and he told me that my teeth were perfectly clean. Is a great alternative to traditional flossing</li>
            <li> I hesitated before purchasing this, just because of the unsatisfied comments others have made.  But let me tell you, I now understand why they all made those comments and can say with conviction, THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT!  I also experienced water leakage and no water pumping through.  Both are simple fixes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To prevent the water leaking, PROPERLY and FIRMLY place the reservior onto the unit.  Doing so creates a seal and it wont leak.  If it does, it wasnt placed on properly.  Try it again, you will eventually get the hang of it.  I only had &#x27;leaks&#x27; the first couple days. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for it not pumping any water when it is turned on, you just need to read the instructions.  It says you need to PRIME it by removing the pic, placing the hose lower than the reservior, setting it to maximum, and turning it on until water runs through.  This isnt a one time thing.  You need to do this each night you use it; by doing so, it will work fine.  If you dont, then water wont pump through until you PRIME it again.  It only adds a few seconds to your routine, but nothing to be complaining to the company about. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The unit is a little noisy, but again, not enough to complain about, unless someone is trying to sleep. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It works great.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months now, using it nightly, and other than getting oriented to a new product, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item 8 months ago. All of a sudden, it stopped pumping water. It has a two year warranty.  Now, I have the option of shipping it back to the service center or buying another one.  I need a water pik, but the postage and the hassle of sending it somewhere is simply not worth it. And the time it will take to get it back.   This is how they make their money- they sell you something that is shoddy and give it a two year warranty then they give you no choice but to buy another one because  when the time comes to  make use of the warranty, the time and  expense  you have to take to make use of it cancels the benefit.  If they gave it a 6 month warranty, I would not had expected so much.  A two year warranty led me to believe this is a mugh better product than I thought.  It is a sales tactic. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and some good and some bad.  So far I love this WaterPik!  Only had it a short time, but no problems at all.  Dentist said I needed this because of my dental problems.  My teeth and gums have never been better!</li>
            <li> The WaterPik works much better than floss for me...when I can actually get it to work. Since the second week I&#x27;ve had it, it has worked intermittently. After tearing the thing apart, which was no easy task, I discovered that a very small part was not letting water pass through it. After calling WaterPik for a replacement part, I was told that the piece can not be sold individually and that I would have to replace the entire assembly. I decided to continue trying to use it when it worked until it stopped working completely, now because the pause button on the handle is not responding. I have now only had the product for two months and it already needs completely replaced!</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I&#x27;ve been a devoted Waterpik user for at least 20 years, so this purchase was a replacement for the last one I wore out.  That said, this new machine is the best one yet (with several improvements over my last one, which was otherwise identical).  Also, it was sent super-fast, and was very favorably priced, so I&#x27;m rating this transaction 5 STARS, because they won&#x27;t let me go higher!  In other words, a perfect transaction.</li>
            <li> My neighbor told me about it. Works great and only takes a couple of minutes. Only wish I would have bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> Waterpiks are such a vital part of complete dental hygiene and this one does an excellent job of eliminating remaining food between teeth and on the gumline. I recommend it as a daily part of oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a half dozen Waterpik flossers over the years -- I&#x27;m addicted to them, my teeth never quite feel clean when I can&#x27;t use the Waterpik for a day or so -- and, I simply wear them out.  This is my latest replacement and it works as well or better than all of the others I have owned over the years.  When I wear this one out, I&#x27;ll be buying another -- they work and my dental health is testament.</li>
            <li> Free flowing, less nosiy and graduated force control. One can regulate the flow and direction of the water flow..the cord is not a problem and can be coiled, as to not get in the way. The fluid basin is ample and deep enough to use twice. I usually add mouthwash to the water to add zest to the flow..No complainst thus far, and dont expect any..my old water pik  has been discarded.</li>
            <li> This was ordered for my wise as suggested by her dental Higenist.. She ha used them some years ago and found them to be quite effective.</li>
            <li> Product was unable to be delivered and returned to sender.  I will try to purchase it some place else.</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for my sister. She loves it! I have one myself and it works great to get the small food pieces out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The unit is quite noisey, it&#x27;s kind of hard for my daughter, who&#x27;s 8, to manage on her own, the water sprays out of control it you don&#x27;t know how to manipulate the little button while it&#x27;s in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I found the Water Pik to work just fine.  I had used one maybe 15 years ago and had switched to dental floss and an Oral B oscillating toothbrush.  My back tooth had shown some gum separation as reported by my dentist.  So I added the Water Pik to my regimen (additional 2 minutes or so) and find that it has tightened my gums such that some initial bleeding stopped after about 5 applications.  The Water Pik seems just as reliable to me as the one I used many years ago and while there is some extra water that needs to be wiped away at the edge of the sink, this is far from messy and, I believe, well worth adding for improved protection against gum problems.</li>
            <li> With this product I would say I am 90% pleased. It cleans between your teeth a lot better than flossing. Also it gets in between the teeth that are real close together with no problems. It does remove the tiny particles that flossing seems to leave behind.   The reason I only gave it 4 stars is: Reservoir could fit better. Most of the time I have to move it back &amp; forth till the pressure comes thru the jet tip. Once I get that going it works fine. Also it would be better if they had the pressure control on the unit instead of handle. Being left-handed causes a problem because my thumb will push up the pressure level. But that I solved by putting tape on it to where I want the pressure level to stay at. The plus side is that it has a 2 yr. warranty on it and all in all it does the job it claims it will do.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a replacement for an older model.  Only gave it four stars because it doesn&#x27;t seem quite as strong as the older model.</li>
            <li> The item seemed to do a very nice job for the short time in which it was operational; it left my mouth feeling very fresh.  However, the motor conked out after 5 days.  In some ways, that&#x27;s almost a good thing--it&#x27;s twice as easy to return mere days after purchase than if it hung on for a couple of months before dying.</li>
            <li> I love WaterPik products. The only reason mine stopped working after 5 years was because my son decided to hide in the bathroom and use it for a contraption he was making. *sigh*  The product is highly recommended if you only want to buy one once...and NOT use it like an 8 year old to fight the forces of evil in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Great product: my second Waterpik. My only complaint is that the pik, when stowed, is too hard to get out of its intended storage space.</li>
            <li> This machine is fantastic. It replaces an old one that didn&#x27;t stop working, the wand cracked and parts were not available since it was at least 30 years old. The only problem with the new one is the reservoir doesn&#x27;t fit when it is turned over with the wand in place. You have to find a place for it on the counter and it will take up a lot of room if you travel. My teeth already look great and gums also and I am 71 years old.Controling the pressure-output- is great. On and off control could have beeen placed in a different place. Buy it! Buy it!</li>
            <li> its what I expected and wanted works wonderfully thank you , why do you require me to tell you more about this product?</li>
            <li> Este producto es muy util para el cuidado dental pues limpia los dientes con agua a presion donde el cepillo no llega.</li>
            <li> I have an older model of this Waterpik Flosser that I have had for years and has worked very well. The new one is similar to the old one seems to work about the same. I only wish it had a cover on the water tank to keep out the dust etc.</li>
            <li> One month ownership and I still love my WP-65 WaterPik.  The ordering process was easy.  Delivery was fast.  Product is great.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is the best product on the market.  I purchased this item to replace one that had worn out.  The WaterPik lasts a long time &amp; does a great job especially for people who have dental bridges &amp; caps.  This is also good to maintain healthy gums.</li>
            <li> It flushes out what flossing doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s amazing what you really miss. The tips move a little too easy , but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this waterpik. The tub is so large and it fits poorly into the flosser stand. Who needs a half gallon of water to floss? Ridiculous. I&#x27;m constantly having to adjust it to allow the water to flow properly. Look for a different model. This one stinks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Waterpik products for over 30 years. I live in Peru, South America, so is not easy to get this product here. When my first unit broke down, I bought an inalambric model. I never saw a worst designed product, and after two months throw it away. Now I have this new model and found it very usefull, as the first one I had</li>
            <li> My Waterpik only lasted about two years before it quit pumping water.  Three times during my ownership period I treated the device with white vinegar hoping to address slowing flow that I assumed was caused by mineral deposits.  This treatment worked the first two times but on the third try it was unsuccessful.&lt;br /&gt;Our water is softened and I fully expected a longer life-span for this machine.&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Just like it.  My brother in law (who was a dentest) years a go suggested I use one and have for many years.  As soon as it breaks I am out the same day to get another one.</li>
            <li> &#x27;would give 0 star if possible...&lt;br /&gt;This item is the worst product I have ever bought at Amazon. After just 3 days, it starts giving very loud noise -- as loud as a lawn-mower .&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to cope with the noise until it broke and stopped working. Now, I have a broken item with just more than 30-days old -:(... do not know what to do .....</li>
            <li> I had the original, and it worked for many year. Did wonders for my gums. I was hoping to get the same quality product. However, after a few months the pump Stopped working.</li>
            <li> I have used variations of this Waterpik product for over 40 years and most last years before needing to be replaced.  In the past two months I have replaced two and am on my third.  The motor slows then stalls never to start again.  Of course, they are within warranty but I can&#x27;t be without the oral irrigation for the length of time required by repair.  It&#x27;s sad to see  what had been such a good product deteriorate so terribly.</li>
            <li> Effecive product to clean gums and in between tight spaces of teeth.  However, it does splatter quite a bit, so you have to really lean close over the basin.  My dentist told me that there are Waterpik shower attachments.  This would seem a more efficient way of accomplishing the same thing, without the mess, and without the minor assembly/disassembly each time.</li>
            <li> I have used waterpiks for a long time and this was a replacement for my old one that wore out. The only thing that bothers me about it is that it is not as powerful as the old one I had. It is still a good product, but I wish it had a stronger setting.</li>
            <li> design seems flawed a bit for the container. when you pull the cord out, it bumps the tank off sometimes.  the tank also seems a little loose when mounted.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i tried the newest Ultra Dental water pik type, but it only lasted 1 month then began to leak water.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect description of what this product has become and the people who use them.  After purchasing two battery charged water piks, the first was an Inter-Plak, and having them both die within weeks, I looked at the comments and found everyone has the same problem.  What&#x27;s worse is that the nickel cadmium battery can&#x27;t be thrown out without environmental harm, they have to be returned to a qualified dealer.  Of course, most people probably don&#x27;t do this so these companies are not only defrauding their customers, they are spoiling the enviornment with disposable products that can&#x27;t be safely disposed.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just bought the model that attaches to the shower.  Don&#x27;t know how it will work out, but it won&#x27;t burn out.  It won&#x27;t foul the environment.  It doesn&#x27;t use electricity and it won&#x27;t clutter my counter. Its considerably cheaper.  It seems like the way to go, doesn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> Water comes out super fast! Have a towel handy! Practice working with the stream and force in your mouth, but otherwise easy to use and put together</li>
            <li> Worked well with the adapter I use it with. The flosser is powerful enough for daily use and seems to be holding up.</li>
            <li> I bought the Water Flosser after my original Waterpik (model 100) died after six or seven years of usage. This model looks much better than the older models, but it&#x27;s a piece of garbage. The first one I purchased died after four weeks. Figuring that I must have gotten a defective one, I sent it back and got another one. Well, would you believe the second one lasted about two and a half weeks? Both did the same thing - the motor starts sounding louder, like it&#x27;s vibrating or something. Within a day or two, water is no longer coming out of the stupid thing. Waterpik will be getting a complaint letter from me. It&#x27;s a shame that the company is still selling these obviously defective units. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have used a Waterpik for years - After my morning brushing, I always use a Waterpik to finish cleaning whatever I may have missed.  It is a must for my daily cleaning.</li>
            <li> Works great!  It is similar to an old one I had a few years ago.  No problems with leaks.It was a great deal for the Price.</li>
            <li> Had the version sold 40yrs ago lasted about 35 with one jury rig at about yr15 to repair the tubing at the pump. Hope they make them like they used to, we&#x27;ll find out with this new one.</li>
            <li> So I almost purchased a portable handheld water pik just because I didn&#x27;t want something taking up my counter space. I am really glad I didn&#x27;t, after using this model I could only imagine how many times I would have had to refill the portable pik. Anyway, this is a really good product. Tthe size wasn&#x27;t as bulky as I thought it might be and with the speed I use I can clean all of my teeth with one fill. The reservoir is a good size and the pik itself has various speeds to graduate into. If you have never used a water pik before, be prepared for a messy first experience. This one shoots out water in a pulsing action and they say to set it at its highest speed to prime the unit before each use so you are likely to get sprayed and spray your bathroom while you&#x27;re at it.  By the way, I find that it isn&#x27;t always necessary to prime the unit at the highest setting. Often times if you have a deep enough sink; gravity will do most of the work for you if you point the pik down into the sink. If you hold the pik higher than the reservoir then it will be necessary to prime at a high setting. The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the insanely loud tractor noise this thing pumps out. Another person did a pretty comical review of this model and mentioned how loud it was and something about a tractor I think and let me tell you, that reviewer wasn&#x27;t far from the truth. So don&#x27;t go flossing your teeth when everyone is in bed. Otherwise I think this was a great buy and have since become addicted to water piking my teeth on a very regular basis.</li>
            <li> Well, I can&#x27;t really remember how many of these I have purchased during the&lt;br /&gt;last 10 years. They always died the same death, the hose between the reservoir&lt;br /&gt;and the tip began leaking and that was the end of it. Unfortunately there are&lt;br /&gt;not many alternatives, so I keep spending money on this brand. Let&#x27;s hope this&lt;br /&gt;unit will last.</li>
            <li> These unfortunately have a weak link. I&#x27;ve owned several, and the little hose, or the hose connections tend to break (or leak!) long before the motor gives out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as far as getting the job done -- flossing with a water jet -- it&#x27;s great. It has kept my gums in good condition, and that&#x27;s important because gum disease has been linked to infection and inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great while it lasts.</li>
            <li> Unlike other users&#x27; experiences, my Waterpik has not malfunctioned in the three years that I&#x27;ve owned it.  But I usually wipe it down with a clean cloth after use because excess moisture can quickly lead to grime.  Regularly maintaining it really makes a big difference.  It is extremely loud, however, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it when people are sleeping nearby.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a very good product that helps reduce gum inflammation and bleeding.  It has a good range of pressure settings, from gentle to very forceful.  When I purchased it, the box included a blue tip, a pink tip, and a tongue scraper.</li>
            <li> I am certainly NOT a dentist--nor am I anything close to a qualified evaluator of ANY medical equipment.  But...I do have solid experience in engineering, and the hard and social sciences, and I LOVE the \\&quot;WaterPik WP-65 Personal Dental Water Jet.\\&quot;  I mix lots of water, with several tablespoons of Listerine--nearly filling the WaterPik&#x27;s reservoir (all quite UNscientifically), and repeatedly, remain abundantly impressed with the junk this baby removes--and, how fresh my mouth feel thereafter.  (I&#x27;ve also used the WaterPik, quite unconventionally, to blast out the gunk from my razor, my ear and nose hair clipper, and other tools).  This EXTREMELY picky consumer, STRONGLY recommends you buy this product.  (Tho&#x27; I think we would ALL like to see more convincing independent research on its long-term effectiveness on improving gum and dental health.)</li>
            <li> The WP-65 replaced my six year old WP-70 on which the hose had finally developed a leak I couldn&#x27;t fix.  I wish they would have included their new under-the-gum spout and that they would re-issure the multi-holed sprayer that used to come with the appliance.  Except for the color of the reservoir, this one is the same as and cost $15 less than I paid for the original.  The only functional difference is the slider control on the head.  The old one clicked distinctly into each of the five settings while the new one slips from one to another with just the slightest touch.  I don&#x27;t rate that an improvement.  But if this one lasts as long as its predecessor, I&#x27;ll count myself lucky.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ll say I love this thing. My teeth feel amazing when I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: start from the lowest strength setting the first time, until you find your limit. I started a MAX STRENGTH(5/5) and ended up with bleeding gums. Turns out my setting is (3/5), to clean w/o bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommending to all my friends.</li>
            <li> arrived on time; simple to assemble; works like a charm. hope it last as long as the first one I bought years ago.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have a large bathroom, I don&#x27;t have a counter to set the base on. I have to balance it on the sink since the cord is short and will not reach very far. I wanted my flosser to sit on the back of the toilet but the water is exposed and could spill over is the surface is not flat. It was to much work to use so honestly I am not using the waterpik. Oh well to my gums.</li>
            <li> From the start mine has worked only intermittently.  Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth. I bought this only a week ago n have seen an improvement. At first it was a messy learning proccess (should come with goggles,lol) but once you learn it is not that messy. If you have sensitive teeth make sure you have the lurkwarm water (like it states in book to use). I have already notice a difference in my teeth.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;PROS- Works well. Easy to use (once you learn not to bathe yourself). Does get the stuff between your teeth. Multi setting allows you to control strength of water flow. For the price it is a nice deal. Place to hold up to 4 floss/tongue attachments.  &lt;br /&gt;Fill tank also flips to cover unit to keep clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;CONS- Louder than you think it would be. The Pause button not really pratical (I always release it without thinking). Messy till you learn how to do it. Do Not overuse it or it will have adverse effects. Tank just a tad bit smaller than what I need for the 5-8 seconds per tooth (I need to refill it 1 time before I&#x27;m done).</li>
            <li> I have always had Water Pik and never have had a problem. Not this time, however. I purchased the WP-65. It worked fine shooting the water through, but there seemed to be only a very weak or a very strong pulse; therefore, when I wanted it on the medium setting (#3), the force was the same as on the high setting. I sent it back and received a replacement which worked beautifully for the first two days. Then, when I filled the resevoir with water, it leaked out the bottom. Faulty gasket, I presumed. When I realized after several attempts that it was indeed the machine and not me, I sent it back again. I have switched to a different brand.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 2 months and find it to be a very good dental device. It performs as expected, and has the features I need. So far there is no leakage of water from anywhere on the unit, but that may come with time. The one downside is that it is a bit noisy, but I don&#x27;t think that can be avoided, given how the unit has to operate to do its&#x27; job.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this product  for a long time.Im glad I found it on Amazon.Its the best way to keep your teeth clean,The dentist said my teeth and gums became well again,I told him its because of the  water pic.</li>
            <li> This is a great little device to aid in your dental home care.  My husband and I both have periodontal disease and a water pik is extremely useful in keeping the progress of the disease at bay.  This particular device is very quiet, holds a suitable amount of water for proper cleaning, and does not leak at all.  It&#x27;s easy to use, too.  All you have to do is fill the reservoir with warm water and put the mouth piece in your mouth.  We wouldn&#x27;t be without this and I recommend it very highly to anyone who wants under-the-gum cleaning for the most thorough cleaning you can get.  And incidentally, if you&#x27;re plagued by halitosis (bad breath), cleaning under the gumline AND cleaning the tongue itself are both great ways to fight that problem, and you can do both with this flosser.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Have been pleased with the WaterPik so far (in use less than a month).  This one doesn&#x27;t have as much pressure as previous models.  There are design flaws that haven&#x27;t been addressed:  where the water tube comes outside from the pump, the stiffness of the tube causes stress that eventually caused the tube to break on the previous model.  So far, I&#x27;m pleased with this unit.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband by dentist request and it works great and it very easy to use wish that the tank held more water but no big deal. I would buy this again! Great price better then the hand held!</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with the idea of a water flosser.  I can not seem to get the hang of it.  Maybe it is just me but I just really don&#x27;t like this water flosser routine.  It is probably not the machine.  I can can&#x27;t seem to operate it right,</li>
            <li> I use it to floss my teeth.  Why what do you expect me to use it for?  Anymore dumb questions?</li>
            <li> always amazed at what comes out of my teeth after brushing.  easier than floss and my mouth feels really clean.  Gums are better too.</li>
            <li> Broke after 8 months. Only used filtered water in it. For the money it should have lasted quite a bit longer</li>
            <li> Finally, a really good water jet. Water container is large enough so you don&#x27;t have to keep refilling at one session. Good variable strength (some out there are too weak even at full strength). Looks nice. Easy to set the hose back in its cradle. Highly recommended. First decent one I&#x27;ve bought in a long time. Have been using it a month now.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive way to maintain oral health and avoid periodontal problems.  Periodontist at my Dentist&#x27;s office recommended.  Takes getting used to but operation is simple, but it is a liitle noisy.</li>
            <li> As a dental office manager I can tell you first hand that these waterpik water flossers save people time and money in the long run. Overall great product. We recommend them to all of our patients and our patients have nothing bad to say about them :)</li>
            <li> BAD-BAD-BAD PRODUCT EXPERIENCE. THIS IS THE LAST MODEL WATER PIC; I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF THE 2 EARLIER ONES I USED WERE EARLIER MODELS (WITH SEVERAL YEARS&#x27; LIFE)WERE MADE IN CHINA, BUT THIS ONE WAS MADE IN CHINA. IT LASTED LESS THAN A YEAR---WITHIN WARRANTY. THEY SENT 3 REPLACEMENTS FOR A TOTAL LIFE OF THE 3 A TOTAL OF ONE YEAR MAXIMUM; AND I RETURNED 2 OF THEM SO THAT MFR. COULD \\&quot;INSPECT\\&quot; THEM. THEY ALL SEIZED. MFR CLAIMED I SHOULD EXERCISE MORE CARE IN RINSING AND USING. I NEVER RECEIVED THEIR \\&quot;INSPECTION\\&quot; RESULTS.  I FINALLY REPLACED WATER PIC WITH A CONAIR \\&quot;INTERPLAK\\&quot; (MADE IN CHINA) MACHINE WHICH I HAVE BEEN USING OVER 2 YEARS---RELIABLY!!!---AT BEDTIME, SAME USAGE PATTERN AS I USED WITH WATER PIC.</li>
            <li> does not work well, very poor design, there is no cover to the water reservoir and the well gets dirty</li>
            <li> I use this dental wash every night.  It flushes more particles then you believe you could have.  It is loud</li>
            <li> The motor did not function correctly after the first 10 uses. After four months the motor quit completely. This product is defective in my opinion and should not be sold!</li>
            <li> Great water flosser, highly portable, a good price, and arrived quickly. I have nothing negative to say about this item. Just make sure there&#x27;s a tip on the flosser if you leave water in it, or it will leak.</li>
            <li> This is a nice small instrument, easily handled.  It has replaced the awful string of floss, delivered cleaning to the area below the gum line and makes me much happier now that I am taking my oral health seriously.</li>
            <li> A water pik is a part of my daily oral hygiene. When one wears out, I order another one. Amazon.com has the best price.</li>
            <li> This is the same as our old one which died after many years of faithful daily use.  Amazon had the best buy on it including in town, on sale.  My husband won&#x27;t floss so the waterpik has to do the whole job which it does.  He always has good reports from the dentist on how good he flosses!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that it&#x27;s a lot lighter then my old Waterpik.  That can be good or bad.  It depends on if it&#x27;s of better/lighter materials or just cheaper.  The main reason I gave it a 4 was that my old nozzles don&#x27;t fit it.  I have a nasal nozzle (a little alliteration) from the old one that doesn&#x27;t fit.  If I want to do the nasal irrigation they want me to pay $99 for a stand alone nasal irrigator, Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think the bean counters have taken over.  My old Professor from Colorado State U (he invented it with his dentist) would not have approved with charging $99 for something that used to cost $1 for the old machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the new machine does work well and it comes with a 2 year warranty both of which are very positive.</li>
            <li> I have been using the waterpikc fosser for years. Wore my previous one out after more than 5 years. Dentist always loves my gums!! Liked the one vibrate on previous model better than this one that has 3. for different tooth zones.</li>
            <li> I like this waterpik flosser.  The pressure is good and adjustable.  The tank holds plenty of water.  I had another brand and it did not work very well at all.  I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this model in the past and it started to get very very loud. We thought because it was old.  So we took another stab and bought a new one, exact same problem.  It was extremely loud that my neighbor would hear it.  The hose was shaking vigorously.  Without trying a second time, I returned it to the store the next day.</li>
            <li> It worked very good for about 45 days an then dead!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON IT!!!</li>
            <li> I had a Waterpik many years ago and it was a very good product. After many years of service it died. When I went shopping to replace it I decided to save a few bucks and buy a cheaper competitor. BIG MISTAKE ! The competitor did not hold enough water to adequately flush out the deposits without having to refill it nor did it have the power the Waterpik&#x27;s have. It got returned and I got the WP-65 and am happy again. You would be surprised by the amount of debris that is hiding at your gum line that brushing (even power brushing) can&#x27;t remove. You also gain the benefit of having your gums massaged by the pulsating action. Your dental hygene is not complete until you have finished up with the WaterPik...</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right.  This worked for me for only one day.  What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older, different model which had grown weak after years of use.  Simple yet performs like a champ.</li>
            <li> The only trouble that I&#x27;ve had with the three of these that I&#x27;ve bought, is that over time,they tends to clog up.  Perhaps it&#x27;s the minerals in my water system.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s responsible for saving what teeth I have left, and within a week of use it improves gum health tremendously.  My gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought broke in less than two weeks.  The second lasted barely a month.  I suggest buying something else.</li>
            <li> My family has used WaterPiks for over thirty years and there is no substitute that I know of. I have needed to replace four during that time because of mechanical failures so quality might stand some improvement but what more would you expect? It has a lot of benefit for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this elsewhere to replace my failing WP60.  I&#x27;ve owned perhaps 10 WP60&#x27;s, since the 1970&#x27;s.  They fail regularly when the feed tube to the nozzle breaks, and later, when the motor fails (seized and/or fails to supply water due to cavitation of the fluid and pump failure).    Generally, these provide a very clean mouth experience, especially when used with a shot of mouthwash (instructions say they are safe for that use).  Yes, you will see gunk come out of your teeth even after a thorough brushing.  Surely they cut down on bacteria, and odor, but they don&#x27;t stop plaque.    Now to compare:  the new WP65 is almost identical to my old WP60, but the motor is significantly quieter (yea!), and the power from the nozzle is a bit less (boo!).  It is now less than I would like.  Over time, as the unit ages and weakens, I wonder if this will shorten the useful lifespan.  Finally, the blue plastic cover/supply reservoir is less strong than the white one of the WP-60.  I could imagine it cracking in a couple of years.    If I had had the choice I would have simply bought another WP60.  I get about 3 years out of these things before they have to be chucked, but that&#x27;s only $12 a year, so worth it.</li>
            <li> Dentist said I should do whatever I was doing. As my  gums are in the best shape they have been in years.</li>
            <li> This is a good value.  The machine has a large tank for holding mouthwash or the like and comes with several mouthpieces.</li>
            <li> and had the first for many years.  When it pooped out on me, I purchased a cheaper waterpik water flosser.  It was basically junk.  Consequently oreder this one and it does a WONDERFUL JOB.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about this machine, except that it does the job.  With my extensive dental bridgework, a water flossing device is essential.....</li>
            <li> I invested in this along with the DentistRx Intellisonic toothbrush. Having gone thru 12 years(&#x27;87 - &#x27;99) of periodontal surgeries, cleanings, etc and spent enough money then to buy a new car, I have been a teeth cleaning fanatic with manual toothbrushes, floss, and proxy brushes. Recent visits to the dentist revealed a few &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; deepening a bit. The Water Pik and above toothbrush were recommended to be bought. Did so and I can tell in a month&#x27;s use, my teeth are &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; and more food debris is coming out in the rinse. This basic machine works! Read the instructions, prime the pump, use warm water, and let the machine do the work! Go along all gum lines and then between tooth gaps and see what you get. I kept flossing and then did the Water Pik and got even more out! The machine works well if you let it do its job and take your time going around each tooth. Don&#x27;t be like me and get to use all these upgraded instruments after the dental procedures. Buy now and use it daily and save yourself a lot of money before you get periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> I have owned this for two or three years and am very pleased with the results. It has greatly helped my issues with gum bleeding and other symptoms of periodontal disease. I had to throw it away this week because the tube became brittle and cracked near the handle unit, and there is no way to replace that piece itself. I might prefer the thing to be more expensive and more sturdily constructed and last much longer, but I did have a good experience while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I have been using waterpik for a long time and I love it. Nothing can give you that clean feeling in your mouth better that water flosser. But I always bought mine from store and this time I decided to buy it on Amazon. It stopped working after 2 months and I can&#x27;t request replacement per Amazon rules. I can send it back on my own expense and get partial refund. I don&#x27;t think that is right. But the first two months that it was working, I love it.</li>
            <li> Two of these have failed in two months, both for the same reason - the motor stopped working.  I&#x27;ve used waterpiks for 10 years and never had any problems.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;   It seems as if this company has seriously lowered it&#x27;s standards.  I will be trying another brand.  I suggest you do the same.</li>
            <li> [2009 update] I got an OralBreeze from Amazon to replace my third WaterPik: [[ASIN:B000H68J2S QuickBreeze - Dental Oral Irrigator]]  The adapter attachment &amp; little hose mean having some extra stuff there at the faucet, but there&#x27;s no more motor noise, no reservoir to fill, no fumbling with the WaterPik on the counter, etc.  I also prefer the higher pressure &amp; steady flow as opposed to the WaterPik&#x27;s \\&quot;rat-tat-tat\\&quot; pulsating pressure flow, but I also think if I&#x27;d kept using WaterPik, by now I would&#x27;ve had to order another replacement; these new models just don&#x27;t seem to last very long.    Original review:    The old WaterPik I had lasted for years, and when I finally broke I replaced it with this new model.  I&#x27;ve found that the water flow often stops and I have to fiddle around with the cutoff &amp; flow adjusters on the handle to get it working again.    I&#x27;m not normally an \\&quot;old things are good, new things are bad\\&quot; kind of complainer, but in this case, the old simple design didn&#x27;t have much to it and was hard to break  ---but I believe the new handle design is poorly done, and if the one I bought doesn&#x27;t fail completely pretty soon, I expect it&#x27;ll just malfunction one time too many and I&#x27;ll pitch it in the trash.  I&#x27;ve haven&#x27;t looked at many alternatives yet, but I like the looks of OralBreeze (not near as noisy and not doesn&#x27;t look like very much there to break), and will probably avoid buying another WaterPik....    Message to WaterPik:  There are a lot of pretty good QC engineers out there; you might want to consider hiring some before you throw another design like this into full production.    By the way, ask any dentist and they&#x27;ll tell you that these things are no subsitute for flossing.  It&#x27;s just a good extra thing to do, and can be a great help if you have to deal with braces or hard-to-reach spots where food tends to get stuck.</li>
            <li> I had to return the unit to Waterpik via the local outlet because it was only working intermittently. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Waterpik gave me in return a WP60 which makes me think the WP65 won&#x27;t be around for long.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how much stuff I was missing with my toothbrush. Only had my Waterpik for about a week or so, but I use it every night now! I hope this lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Having owned a Waterpik since the 1980s, I expected when I received this new model it would be lesser in design and build. Not so! The fittings are tight, the style is the same and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is my third Waterpik.  I&#x27;ve always liked them and they last for years.  This one, however, is WAY louder than the others I&#x27;ve had.  Almost a machine gun sound for a lack of a better description - and uncomfortable to the ears while your head is bent down near it.  It also seems to &amp;#34;hesitate&amp;#34; or change stroke beat every few seconds while in operation but the pulse pressure seems to stay constant.  Don&#x27;t know if this one is going to last or not.</li>
            <li> I have the waterpik this model now call the \\&quot;classic\\&quot;. You can still order it at Walmart and here places for as low as about $36.... Generally about $10 less than their newer fancier model.  Note this is NOT the 20 year old model that others say lasted so well. But at least it has the larger water holding capacity, longer hose.&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased it only about 4 years ago and the hose got brittle and cracked. I ordered a replacement squirter with hose and coupler for about $12 with shipping. Idea is you cut off most of the old hose and attach new. Problem is that the stub of the old hose is brittle and cracks not long after the repair. So I wasted $12.&lt;br /&gt;  If I could open the base of the unit I could probably attach the good hose directly to the pump. But although I&#x27;m pretty mechanically adept I can&#x27;t get the base open without destroying it. Clearly not designed with thought to allow repairs. I don&#x27;t think company executives actually order the engineers to \\&quot;design this thing so it will break in a few years and can&#x27;t be repaired\\&quot; but buy putting pressure on to make it as cheaply as possible the results are the same as if they had done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably order a new one of the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; model as it&#x27;s cheaper, appears to be marginally more functional than the slicker one. If Panasonic or anyone else makes a non-battery version of this device I mightout. Bottom line is despite the flaky quality the advantages in my radically improved gum health from using a waterpik (vs no waterpik) are so great that if I have to sadly toss one into the electronics recycling bin every 4 years that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> I have lost count of the number of Waterpiks I have purchased over the years.  It is an excellent part of oral hygiene.  And I still have all of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had an older Waterpik and it stopped working.  I purchased this model even though it did not do quite as much as the top model but it was, and is perfect for my use.  I have dentures, top and bottom.  I use this device to clean my dentures well and clean and refresh my mouth and gums.  You won&#x27;t believe the great fresh feeling it gives the entire mouth.</li>
            <li> It works, but is awkward to handle.  The top doesn&#x27;t fit easily on the base.  Since fitting the top onto the base is part of every use, the flossed is annoying.</li>
            <li> I have problems flossing my teeth in the back so my peridontics&lt;br /&gt;suggested a water pik.  It really helps me to clean food from that area and refresh&lt;br /&gt;my mouth.  Because I have sensitive gums there are enough speeds so I can adjust the water flow.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I purchased it.  It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Waterpik flosser stopped working correctly after only a few months when the pump gave out. Doesn&#x27;t appear to be under warranty.</li>
            <li> This waterpik is very good. It has a mechanism by which you can set how strong you want water to be pumped. It flosses your teeth well. It&#x27;s easy to use. I bough it for my parents and they are not that good when it comes to dealing with electronic products since they are a bit old, but they are easily learnt how to use this since it is simple to use.</li>
            <li> Was my first water flower and am very pleased, I am amaze at how clean my teeth desk.  Multiple settings and several attachments.  Love it</li>
            <li> . The older model gave me good service for years. I expect this new one to do the same. I like it.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this device, and what a surprise.  I&#x27;m really happy with it!  Flossing is so much easier this way! I had my dental appointment yesterday, and my checkup was positive!  My using the Waterpik has improved my gums and overall dental care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like the unit very much except for the fact that when you turn it on, it is spraying water unless you press a hard to press button on the wand to shut it off in bypass mode. I guess that I am not used to the way they are designed otherwise it does a great job of flossing.</li>
            <li> This is my third Waterpik - wouldn&#x27;t be without one!  My Dental Hygienist&lt;br /&gt;and my Dentist both say my teeth receive excellent care so don&#x27;t change&lt;br /&gt;anything.  Daily use of my Waterpik is  an important part of my dental&lt;br /&gt;hygiene.</li>
            <li> This Flosser works great!  This was a replacement for our old unit which lasted 10+ years.  Very happy with the unit.</li>
            <li> I have periodontal disease and I have been using the Waterpik and it has reduced my pockets by a large percentage.  I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I bought my WaterPik WP-65 because I got braces and flossing was a pain. The first time I used it I made a total mess...water shooting everywhere, but I have had it now for about 4 weeks and I love it. I will never go back to just flossing.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this WATERPIK. WATER FLOSSER. This is not the first one I have owned, but certainly the best one. Plenty of power for a through cleaning, Holds plenty of water, and a nice assortment of PICS. ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION WITH STANDARD SHIPPING IN A TIMELY MANNER. THANK YOU.!</li>
            <li> When I use any pressure setting but the minimum the nozzles pop off.  The lowest pressure is useless, this product is worthless.</li>
            <li> Great product for anyone, especially kids who need a quick and easy way to floss well.  Kids think it is fun too but be sure to tell them to be careful the first time they use it or they will get water everywhere.  LOL!</li>
            <li> would prefer it be made other than China because China made products seem to break more often.  made in USA is my favorite</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a waterpik of 15 yrs use.  It is a good value and we use it every day.</li>
            <li> I use my water pik everyday and this was a great buy.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else for what I paid for it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Water Flosser, that I ordered is satisfactory, and works well. The order was timely delivered to me, and so far I am pleased with the way it is operating.</li>
            <li> THE WATER PIC HAS WORKED VERY WELL,  I AM HAVING DENTAL WORK DONE AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THE WATER PIC, THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I purchased this Waterpik to replace one I had used for many years that finally just wore out.  It has a good range of pressures and  the highest setting is as high as you could ever need.  It does the job and my dentist remains happy with my teeth and gums which is the goal.  It is on the noisy side if that is a concern.</li>
            <li> This flossed cleans in between teeth with no harsh pulsation.  Comes with two pics. Would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Works great. Simple and effective. My first one lasted for many years before giving up.  If this one lasts as long I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> A year after used, sometime it lost power and pressure is not steady. Mfg should made a better quality.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I try to buy another product.&lt;br /&gt;I like to have the water flosses for cleaning my tooth @ evening,</li>
            <li> The force of the stream of water can be set higher than the handheld model.  Therefore, I was more satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> good,  it is useful good,  it is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every time.&lt;br /&gt;use it whenever I need it.</li>
            <li> About 2 months ago we purchased out WP-65. Since then we have been impressed with the way that it flosses our teeth. The adjustable spray that gives you a choice of spray is a great way to adjust to a water pik. The rotating head manges to get all the crevices in your teeth and gum lines.  The only drawback is that it is noisy and it can be messy. However, sine you use it over a sink my wife and I do not think this is to much of a problem. We had an older Water Pik which we could no longer ge tthe parts for it. This new Water Pik -65 does a much better job!</li>
            <li> My only problem with this product it that sometimes I have to wiggle&lt;br /&gt;it around until resevoir fits properly on top to let the water flow.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I highly recommend it for helping to keep teeth and gums&lt;br /&gt;healthy.</li>
            <li> We purchased a Waterpik in 2004 and loved it.  In fact, we bought one for each of our children.  In October 2011, we purchased one for our 2nd home.  It is only used four months a year and now won&#x27;t start.  Waterpik was absolutely no help since we were out of warranty.  We were told to buy another one.  I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> My teeth are terrible and I needed to ramp up the care of my chompers.  This is the third one I&#x27;ve had.  The first failed because of a broken water line.  The second failed because of my own error.  I hope this one lasts for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it works fine and I&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2004:  The unit has failed, after only a few months.  What a disappointment!  It should last at least a year, don&#x27;t you think?</li>
            <li> My old Waterpik needed replacing and was so great I wanted one just like it.  We have one in each bathroom.</li>
            <li> The flosser does an excellent job of cleaning my gums and rinsing food from my mouth.  The glass nozzle is sometimes balky at fitting into the clamp.  If the glass tip is broken off, the stub is impossible to remove from the handle, and I have had to replace the entire unit when this happened.</li>
            <li> But you have to spend time cleaning it every day and week or yuck. Easy to use. Works well. Pretty.</li>
            <li> I followed all the pre-use instructions to a T. When priming before use, the water dribbled out in tiny droplets at the lower setting and barely streamed in the highest setting. It would take an hour to prime 1 oz. of water. It wouldn&#x27;t move a fleck of pepper from a tooth! Hopefully I can return it and try another Interplak. This Waterpik is useless.</li>
            <li> it works well and my gums are healthier.  this was the second one we bought for our cottage.  I sue warm water</li>
            <li> Shipped out real fast. got it and it works jusst like the last one. Now the teeth will be ok.</li>
            <li> Sits on my counter without taking up too much room. Adjustable pressure switch on the wand is nice. Off switch could have been placed a little more accessable on the front of the machine , instead of the side.</li>
            <li> Does just as good a job as the more expensive units.  Good value.  Would purchase this unit again.  Like it.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter and I both use this Waterpik- I love it and it was recommended by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Great machine for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Great product and reasonably priced.  Good range of power for the water stream;  easy to control, fill and clean.  May have to &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; slightly to start the stream.  (As in using a drinking straw.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this model 1 and a half years ago.  It worked really well until this week.  The hose split where it enters the hand held end and it sprayed water all over the bathroom until I turned it off.  I would have expected it to last longer.</li>
            <li> The water tank is large enough to clean all my teeth without having to re-fill it like smaller units. It works great. We have 2 and we are both very happy with them. It&#x27;s amazing how much junk stays in your teeth after flossing and brushing. This gets it all out.</li>
            <li> Works just fine. I had a couple of the rechargable hand-held models and they are nothing compared to this unit.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price was the lowest anywhere even adding the shipping.    It was difficult to find this product online, probably due to the fact that it is necessary to type the odd name EXACTLY as listed. (No spaces, and using the hyphen).    I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months. Works great.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is doing a good job so far. It&#x27;s so easy to set up and use that instructions aren&#x27;t needed. Unless you&#x27;ve been using these make sure to start out on a low pressure setting otherwise it definitely hurts.  The only negatives I have, which are minor, are the push button on the wand stops the water flow instead of starts it, which seems backwards to me, so unless you&#x27;re holding the button down water starts shooting out as soon as the unit is switched on.  The other minor gripe is that the holder for the want is right under the water container and it&#x27;s just a little awkward to get the wand into the holder.</li>
            <li> This cleans belter than the older models.  I am very pleased. I hope other people will buy them also very soon.</li>
            <li> I have used a Waterpik for a very long time.  It&#x27;s a great device for oral hygiene.  Just for how this one works, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  It&#x27;s powerful and does what a Waterpik is designed to do.  So why the 2 stars?  First, it feels cheap.  It&#x27;s about 1/2 the weight of my old unit which lasted 8 years.  I wonder how long this will last.  My biggest gripe though is that the power cord is 4\\&quot; shorter than my old unit which did not have an especially long cord.  The cord is too short to plug into the outlet where I use it.  I had to cut off the cord from my old unit and splice/solder it onto this one.  I paid $20 eight years ago.  Now the price is $35.  If it were the same unit I wouldn&#x27;t care.  But it galls me to know that the company saved money on the manufacturing with the light weight and then saved another 1 cent (or less) to reduce the length of the power cord.  Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no other company making a device that does what this one does so there&#x27;s no competition.  Shame on Waterpik for this cost cutting while at the same time charging more and taking advantage of its loyal customers.</li>
            <li> Had waterpik before and knew what to expect.  The interface where the reservoir rest requires manipulating to actually start the pressure.  It sometimes requires time and effort to get the water hose properly coiled again and the top back in place.  Otherwise does what I want it to do.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I prefer this over the handheld small sized flosser. It works really well, has good pressure levels and I like the compact foldable design.</li>
            <li> My dentist was very happy with the way my gums had improved.  I just might give them as Christmas presents this year.</li>
            <li> Was not that much more to replace whole unit than it was to just purchase replacement tube  (which cracks after a while).  I have gone through many of these in the past few years for this very reason.  If you could replace the pump/hose assembly reasonably, these things would last a LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - More plastic in landfill than needed because wear parts not user replaceable.</li>
            <li> Nice to have clean enviro rated teeth and gums, and full mouth&lt;br /&gt;Great way to start a day&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik makes a great product</li>
            <li> Have been using a waterpik for 25 years. I have tried other brands but always come back to Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;If you have teeth no matter what age you need to take care of them. This is the quickest way to do it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the product to everyone. A small price to pay to protect you teeth.</li>
            <li> Works OK but has sloppy design and/or manufacturing. Two examples: very hard to insert or remove pick from handle; jet force control knob in handle is loose and slides back and forth when using the WaterPik.</li>
            <li> MY DENTIST RECOMENDED THE WATERPIK FOR AWHILE FINALLY ORDERED ONE AND TEETH CLEANING AT THE DENTIST IS A BREEZE WORKS WELL TO CLEAN OUT THE BACK TEETH</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the water strength is controllable.  If you have strong gums, you can have the water forced out strong.  More sensitive gums need a weaker force of water to come out.  You control how you want the WaterPik to send out the water by a lever on the pik.</li>
            <li> I had to replace our previous Waterpik, same model seen here - the WP-65, because I finally figured out that there is mold inside the unit that was so bad, it was backing up the water flow inside the unit that only a trickle of water was coming out of the handle. We had followed Waterpik&#x27;s direction that if you use a mouthwash, you must always run water through the unit one more time to flush out any lingering mouthwash (indeed, they can dry to a sticky film). We did this religiously. We had the previous unit for at least 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I detected internal (and external) mold (or fungus?). No I didn&#x27;t pull the machine apart, I ran 1 gallon of white vinegar through it and soaked all the parts in it too, but then the mold that died and was flaking off was doing it in bucketfuls, especially from inside the unit. I was an idiot to think I&#x27;d get it all out. When I got it to the point that no more was coming out, I used the unit and it was fine. The next day when we went to use the unit, it just would not work. The switch on the handle was shot from the rigorous cleaning it got and quite honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the mold/fungus was 100% out of the inside of the unit, so I was happy to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with Waterpik&#x27;s latest model, the WP-100, which touts to have the same water capacity, measured in seconds as the WP-65, which is definitely not the case and clearly a marketing deception as the capacity is listed as 900s, as in 900 seconds each tankful. The graph provided on Amazon&#x27;s WP-100 page shows the 900s for the WP-60 and WP-100, but when you look at the milliliters listed immediately under the 900s, you see the big difference of 650mL for the WP-100 vs. 1000mL for the WP-60 (the WP-60 is similar to the WP-65 which is what I buy from Amazon). That&#x27;s a huge difference in water capacity and I didn&#x27;t realize what I was in for. When the new one arrived I was excited to get started with it because of a few new features. OMG, within 5 days of using it, I hated it because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WP-100 CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. the rubber feet would not stick to the countertop surface and the damn thing slid all around while trying to set up, clean teeth, and then clean and dry the unit.&lt;br /&gt;2. You need 2 hands to turn off this stupid thing because it slides all over the place. Why is that a pain? Because you aren&#x27;t ready to let go of the handle because you are going to refill the well whether to rinse out the unit or to continue a needed second round of waterpik&#x27;ing because you have braces or something similar.&lt;br /&gt;3. the water capacity is in no way, shape, or literally form the same as this unit. I had to refill the new WP-100&#x27;s water container twice (I have braces) to get the job done and this was not an easy task because you can&#x27;t turn the unit off with one hand anymore, no matter how you try to turn the unit off just to refill it, it slides all around the place. You need 2 hands. I always had to put the handle down to refill despite that I had a huge glass of warm water with mouthwash already prepared to be dumped and no matter what I did with all the sliding and things I was trying to hold, the second refill always spilled outside the more narrow water well (more narrow than the WP-65) making a big mess to clean on the countertop now too in addition to everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had it by the 5th day of using the WP-100, contacted Amazon who accepted it back without a problem as I exchanged it for a new WP-65. Oh, the joy!!! So easy to use; no chasing the unit around the counter top, one handed turn on and turn off, a water capacity that easily holds enough water to do my full mouth of braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all who are looking to buy, here&#x27;s the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I hate flossing because my teeth are so tightly packed together and I hate that the floss cuts off the circulation to my fingers. Yes, I know about the preflossed tooth piks. I keep them with me, but they can&#x27;t wrap around your teeth like floss can. I was loosing the dental hygiene battle because I could not tolerate flossing, so I barely remembered to do it.&lt;br /&gt;2. I don&#x27;t care what all the reports say that flossing is better. It is not if you are a person like me who despises flossing to the point of not doing it. The Waterpik blasts debris out from everywhere (use a weaker flow over bridge-work and things like that), even at the gum line in front and back of the teeth that the floss can&#x27;t touch and the toothbrush may be missing. When I started using the Waterpik, I started winning the war against cavities and my gums went from that reddish-pink that bleeds while flossing, which means bacteria has inflamed your gums and are eating away at your teeth, to a nice and healthy whitish-pink and absolutely no bleeding, even at the dentist&#x27;s office when they try to make them bleed! My dentist says I am one of his top patients in oral hygiene, so take that all you stupid reports! They neglect to add to the report how people feel about flossing. Some are great with it, many are like me and can&#x27;t stand it.&lt;br /&gt;3. I love how clean my teeth feel after Waterpik&#x27;ing and then brushing. &#x27;Smack&#x27;n them germs to the ground! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con (I consider this to be one big flaw: mold/fungus):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the Waterpik&#x27;s we&#x27;ve owned, 3 WP-65&#x27;s and 1 WP-100, we&#x27;ve learn each time something new about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- First it was, you have to flush the mouthwash out of it (not doing that killed our first unit).&lt;br /&gt;- The second time it was, mold (or fungus? or both?) WILL grow inside the unit, despite religiously flushing the mouthwash out every single time with plain tap water. The mold or fungus is hideously unhealthy and will clog the unit too (water coming from under the waterpik onto your countertop and the handle at the same time is a hint you have a clog starting). I broke our unit trying to get the mold out, but like I said, it was best, health-wise, to not kid myself that I would get rid of all  the moldinside that machine and just kick it to the curb.&lt;br /&gt;- Now it is the third time around, we know we have to battle the bacteria, mold, and fungus and I have done my homework. Hydrogen Peroxide kills bacteria, fungus, and mold and is safe to use internally as a mouth rinse. It is also used to clean surfaces to a squeaky clean, so it doesn&#x27;t leave residue behind. I use a 80/20 solution: 80% water, 20% Hydrogen Peroxide at 3% strength. I first pour that into the water well, then I Waterpik my teeth with it which is simultaneously cleaning my teeth and the inside of the machine with it. After the flush is done, I lay the handle pointing downwards in the sink to let the water drain out of the unit. After the 80/20 solution has dripped out of the unit, I keep a special set of towels to clean and dry the whole unit. First I wet the towel with the Hydrogen Peroxide (think of it like it is soap), and I wipe down everything with it: the water well, all the nicks and crannies of the base unit, the tip I used, the on/off switch, the cut outs in the base to hold the tips and the handle and the handle. Then I use the other side of the towel to dry it all up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this worth it? Heck yes. My husband who wouldn&#x27;t use the unit just got a bridge that cost us well over $3000 out of pocket. He now uses this Waterpik which costs $39.99 on Amazon, but I used my Amazon reward points and got it for less than a dollar. Still $39.99 &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; $3000!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one more con which dentists and orthodontists discourage using the Waterpik, but I don&#x27;t know if they know Waterpik solved the problem: dentists and orthodontists say the Waterpik is not for braces or bridges. Well, they need to catch up with the times. Waterpik does make a tip for braces and a tip for bridges. These tips are not available for the WP-65, but are for the traveling Waterpik and we&#x27;d take these tips with us if we traveled anyway. So yes, I set up 2 Waterpiks everyday and so does my husband. No, it is nota big deal to do this and I promise you, both of us would not be flossing without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the specialized tips for use with the traveling Waterpik when I purchased the traveling case that holds the tips. They sell that case 2 ways, one empty and one populated with the different tips. I bought the tip populated case for traveling. It is a easy and hygienic way to bring the tips along with you. You don&#x27;t have to gather up all the tips you need, find some container to put the in, and then remember to put the tips in the container. All the tips are already altogether in the case. Our case stays on our countertop for ease of access to the bridge and orthodontic tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who don&#x27;t mind chasing the WP-100 around the countertop and fumbling around to turn it on and off, and yes, this is a Pro for the WP-100, I believe it comes with the special tips automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/27/2014: I no longer wear braces, well except for the permanent wire along the back of my lower teeth. I use the regular WP-65 tips for them without a problem and the hygienist mentioned that I keep that wire all-around cleaner than any of their patients. My dentist recommended that I back down from a 50%/50% water-to-hygrogen peroxide solution to a 80%/20% solution as he said that should be enough to do the job and I am just wasting all the rest (i.e., the other 30% of the Hydrogen peroxide solution). He&#x27;s correct. I had a great check up even at that weaker solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important update: The WP-65 with the hydrogen peroxide solution remains mold free and we&#x27;ve owned it just about 10 months now. Healthier for us and our teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word to Waterpik:&lt;br /&gt;Please, Please, Please do something \\&quot;official\\&quot; about the mold/fungus issue. Either issue a statement about how to keep the units mold/fungus free or come out with a Waterpik \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; that meets our warranty needs and destroys these critters at the same time. There&#x27;s even a site on YouTube or something where this guy opens up a unit and you see all the disgusting mold or fungus or whatever it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and the price made it a worthwhile purchase ... I have always had one for years but couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;find the same one until I searched Amazon ...Thank You!!</li>
            <li> Had one of these previously and loved it!  Just ordered two more because I did NOT like Model WP-660.</li>
            <li> Delivery as promised. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saved ten bucks over the local chain drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works fine, as expected..</li>
            <li> Makes a mess. Awkward. Gets the job done though.</li>
            <li> Yes this water flosser is essential for great oral hygiene</li>
            <li> This is the best product. I have owned them for years and they last forever without problem. The water force can be adjusted and on the highest setting is very strong...</li>
            <li> It took about 2 days to get used to using it, but can see how much cleaner my teeth, gums and tongue are.&lt;br /&gt;Wished I would have bought one years ago.  My dentist highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> this replaced my old unit. the new unit is more convenient to use.Also received this purchase on time. thanks for asking.</li>
            <li> I really like the waterpik but after about a week it started to leak so not too happy with that</li>
            <li> Update: I figured out why waterpiks fail. The spring on the  button on the handle that suppose to temp stop water flow doesn&#x27;t spring back after a while. It stop the flow. I pried open the handle gently. You can than see a clip on the opposite side of the button. If you push down at that spot it unlocks the spring and lets the water flow. You can now put the handle casing together and use it. I try and not press the handle button to stop the water flow but use the on off switch on the main unit. If I forget and press the temp water flow button, I can now take apart the casing handle with my hands and press the button back out and fix the problem whenever it happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace an older model of Waterpik Water Flosser. The older model&#x27;s tubing kept splitting because it had become brittle.&lt;br /&gt;This new models pump is not as strong as the old model. I bought this new model in 2012 and am writing this review in 2014.&lt;br /&gt;Within six months the model started choking. The pump worked but no water coming out or weak. I called Waterpik and complained. They hymned and hawed and claimed that it was build up because of water quality. I told them this is not true. I live in a city that has some of the cleanest water in the country. It comes from a granite lined reservoir in the mountains and the city water has to add so that it doesn&#x27;t eat at the pipes. On top of that my older Waterpik never had a problem over the years I have had it. They sent a new head tube unit this did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned it with running vinegar through. Sometimes this worked sometimes not. I found just filling the reservoir with water and putting the handle in the sink and letting it drip out sometimes solved the problem. Eventually the unit stopped working all together no matter what I did. I will contact Waterpik again. I don&#x27;t expect anything because I am probably beyond their warranty period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a repair handle tube on Amazon [[ASIN:B000A8EHU6 WaterPik hose repair kit with handle.] and repaired my old Waterpik and have been using it since with no problems. You can read my review on this hose repair kit with handle and it tells you how I did it as the instructions that came with it would not work as my old hose was to brittle. My review title on the repair kit is &amp;#34; Fixed my old Waterpik but had to do a different install&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Waterpik they are using a different pump that is supposedly quieter. Relatively it is but both it and the old pump are loud. You can&#x27;t pump water quietly. But who cares the pump is a little quieter if it breaks down and doesn&#x27;t work. If you have an old water pick fix it!000A8EHU6 WaterPik hose repair kit with handle.] and repaired my old Waterpik and have been using it since with no problems.

            <li> Works well but there is no cover for the water tank.  Hope it lasts longer than previous Waterpik&#x27;s that I had</li>
            <li> I have several of these.  The latest version is lighter and quieter than predecessors.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik works really well on my daughter&#x27;s braces. She can&#x27;t use floss very well, and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> This device works well.  It feel as if I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist every morning after using it!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Removes food particles between teeth better than tooth picks, brushes, floss, and any other means I have found. It may not be for everyone, but, I have found it to be good for dental hygene.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has bridge work.  Excellent for cleaning all this up.</li>
            <li> Once we figured out that the small round rubber connector (where the tank meets the housing) had to be turned slightly, to stop it from leaking, our disappointment turned to joy!  This powerful and efficient machine does, extremely well, the job it is designed for.</li>
            <li> Starts out pumping immediately unlike my old one that needed priming each time.  Adjustable pressure.  Only option to flossing with dental floss.</li>
            <li> great for your mounth cleaning.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it.  It really cleans his teeth, gums and mouth.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, my mouth feels fresh &amp; clean after using my Waterpik Flosser, if I could change anything it would be the plug, it becomes a little awkward when putting away, other than that, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I continually get &amp;#34;you&#x27;re doing a great job flossing, your gums are in great shape&amp;#34; from my dental hygienists time after time.  The truth?  I use a Water Pik, not floss.  You can floss, followed by Water Pik&#x27;ing - and see the bits of food that flossing missed.  And the water massage keeps your gums happy and in the pink!</li>
            <li> It works great and is very easy to use. Easy to maintain and I recommend it very much great product</li>
            <li> Most of the devices you find in stores now have all the bells and whistles.  This is the basic device and works great.  Has two tips and is very compact.  Does a great job at a great price.</li>
            <li> Alright Alright Alright!!!  Used it.  Then flossed.  Nothing was left to floss out!  Remember this isn&#x27;t intended to replace flossing!</li>
            <li> The machine is much, much too loud as to opposed last one I had. Plus it is bulkier..Can be returned?</li>
            <li> The big tank plus the variable power is great. I think the second setting is plenty powerful, and any higher would be too intense</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how effective the flosser is in removing food particles that remain after brushing. i also like the fact that the pressure is adjustable so that an individual can build up to the level that is comfortable for them. My mouth feels cleaner after use. The unit is very compact and takes up only a small space.</li>
            <li> Used the water pik for years - does a great job, easy to use, very satisfied.  This is my third Waterpik flosser over the years - good service, durable for every day use.</li>
            <li> I have had many Waterpik flossers that lasted a long time.  This one didn&#x27;t.  It started leaking from the bottom.  Waterpik recommends BUYING a hose kit and also paying for shipping.  Many people have this problem with this model.  I also watched a video of replacing the hose that someone had online.  Great if you have three hands.  Just about impossible for someone to do by themselves and without many flat headed screwdrivers to pry off the bottom.  Then when it&#x27;s time to replace bottom the on and off switch needs to be in precise place or it doesn&#x27;t work.  Read more reviews and watch video online about replacing the hose.    [...]  [...]</li>
            <li> This has been a great purchase. Cleans extremely well, easy to use and is consistently reliable. A great compliment to brushing.. .</li>
            <li> Got this after my parent recommended we start using a waterpik. Very powerful, quiet and effective.  Very good product, quite happy.</li>
            <li> I am always amazed at how much debris is left behind, after flossing! Guaranteed, your mouth, gums and teeth will be world&#x27;s cleaner!</li>
            <li> Have had this thing for a year now. Works great with NO issues. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like the procedure of using this to floss much better than using actual floss. I think anyone who has a Water Pik would say all sorts of good things about them. I cannot give this enough stars, it&#x27;s a life-changing product. Very easy to quick turn it on and run the water jet quick through all your teeth to clean them. I do sort-of wish it had a top cover to keep stuff from falling into the water reservior (I just cover mine with a plastic bag rather than going through the chore of unclipping the water reservoir and flipping it upside down) and I especially wish that it was not louder than a freight train crashing into a mountain of drum sets. If your teeth need attention at 1am, you&#x27;re stuck using floss because you would wake your entire house with this contraption. I&#x27;d give it 6 stars out of 5 if Amazon would let me.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Been using this for several months with no issues. I have used these for years and the only thing that ever broke was when I dropped it off on the floor.</li>
            <li> PERFECT HIGH QUALITY ITEM AND LOVE THE TRAVEL WATERPIK!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Waterpik first.  Then I went out and bought the single cordless one.  I like it better.  This do not come with a lid and who is going to use that much water at one time.  If you leave the water in it, it&#x27;s ope to everything you do in the bathroom until you use it up.  Buy Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W.  It last forever on one charge and it&#x27;s less money.  You also get to tips.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and has been working great for my daughter.  She has braces and this helps to get all the food out that is hard to reach with a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This one is a little smaller than others I&#x27;ve had in the past, and takes up less space on the sink.  The only thing is that you have to press hard on the corner so that the rubber seal is tight.  But once you get used to doing that it has more pressure than the ones in the past.</li>
            <li> Best value in water pics.</li>
            <li> This is a really good device to clean stains in between teeth....I do think that it makes quite a mess for me.  I end up getting water everywhere, but it is powerful. Practice helps. I have the portable model of this too. I am considering trying the Waterpik sonic brush. I had the sonic brushes since they were invented. I cleaned one with bleach and got corrosion inside. I would stick with alcohol for cleaning. I did find a cool little battery operated brush (no name brand). It works great but takes more minutes to get the same cleaning as a sonic brush. Very nice!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist and met all of my expectations. The higher settings are rough on your gums but if you start off in the lower ones and after a few weeks work your way up it is just perfect.</li>
            <li> After using the waterpik water flosser your mouth feels so clean.  It is almost like after getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the product.  It is quicker and better than flossing with dental floss and the clean feeling is a lot better.</li>
            <li> We have had waterpik years ago; it does wonders for your gum bleeding problems and removal of debris not only between your teeth but above your bridged teeth.  I&#x27;m not a religious flosser but a devout \\&quot;waterflosser\\&quot;!!     This newly designed version has a bigger housing than the original ones and the design of the handle is different.  After using this newer pik for a while I must point out that you must be careful when turning the tip so as not to press down and eject it!!! The way this newer base is designed where the handle is stored causes the excess water to run out on your sink area, your must be aware of any other electrical devices you might have in the same area.  I love the waterflosser results but this design could be improved in my opinion.</li>
            <li> All in all it works fairly well.  The pump seems to be pretty strong (see caution about this below), and the reservoir is large enough for me to pik my way between all the teeth in my mouth and still have water left over.  The first time I used it was a real eye opener... I always brush my teeth at least twice a day with a good electric toothbrush, and I flossed occasionally, so I couldn&#x27;t imagine there was that much gunk between my teeth.  Boy was I wrong!  I closed the drain in the sink just so that I could evaluate the water as it dribbled out of my mouth.  By the time I got done, the water was grey and cloudy and contained lots of particles (and even a few chunks!) of food and who knows what else.  Disgusting!  I&#x27;ve seen cleaner water come out of my local swamp.  I was instantly hooked on water flossing.  Now I use it every day and my mouth is as clean and fresh as a springtime rose.  It&#x27;s so clean I could... um... eat with it.  I mix about 3/4 warm water with 1/4 fluoride mouth wash for that fresh-from-the-dentist-but-no-copay kind of clean feeling.  There are, however, a few caveats to this goofy contraption:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Whatever you do, DON&#x27;T be a hero!  Don&#x27;t set it to maximum power the first time you use it.  I did, and had sore gums for days afterward.  Trust me - the pump on this thing will peel paint at 50 paces.  Start with the lowest setting and work your way up as your gums get stronger and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The whole reservoir on the top idea... seriously?  It becomes very top heavy and leaks a little around the gasket every time you put it on or take it off.  What&#x27;s more, they expect you to stand the wand up inside this little recess in the reservoir when not in use.  Problem is, the wand is just as tall as the recess, so you&#x27;re constantly bumping it when putting it in and out, all the while thinking that this is the dumbest design since the inflatable pincushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Use warm water - especially if you have sensitive teeth!  I probably won&#x27;t need to tell you twice because the first time you use cold water, you&#x27;ll howl like an enraged baboon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I used the tongue scraper once.  Once!  If you want some idea of what waterboarding feels like, try the tongue scraper.  I think the US government could save a lot on implements of torture and interrogation by stocking up on Waterpik tongue scrapers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Loud?  Yeah, it&#x27;s loud, but I grew up around farm machinery, so I&#x27;m used to it.  The sound of an antique tractor brings back fond memories for me.  Close your eyes and picture a pre-WWI J.I. Case steam tractor pulling a 6-bottom plough through the mud and you&#x27;ll have some idea of what the Waterpik Water Flosser sounds like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) The hose is very stiff, wound in a coil, and wants stubbornly to stay that way.  Any effort to straighten it will result in a machine-gun like staccato of water spurting all around the bathroom and all over you as you try to regain control of the wand.  Six months or so of streaked mirrors, wet pants, and being shot in the eye have informed me that resistance is futile.  Just get the unit as close to the sink and your head as possible, so that the hose never needs to stretch, and everyone will go home happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I feel like a freak, huddled over the sink, a loud buzzing in my ear, and water pouring out of my mouth.  But no matter how loud, messy, wet, and weird it can be, just remember one thing... it still beats flossing.wice because the first time you use cold water, you&#x27;ll howl like an enraged baboon.  4) I used the tongue scraper once.

            <li> worked perfect. arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Reservoir leaks and it is extremely difficult to insert pics. We had a waterpik for years but wanted a new one for our new bathroom- big mistake</li>
            <li> A nice little version of a waterpik.  All the good points of a larger one &amp; all the bad points too (messy as usual).  Good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the last Waterpik which lasted about 2 years before the hose broke. The new one worked great for the first 3 months and now only will work on the lowest setting. I&#x27;ve tried priming the pump to no avail. It appears that Waterpik has low quality control on these units. I&#x27;m looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li> Love this one, replaced a cordless one with this and like this one a lot better.  It has more power and leaves my mouth feeling like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> We have used a WaterPik for years and, when we needed a new one, bought this. It is quieter than the older model but just as effective.</li>
            <li> The item come on time.  It work.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t see anything wrong with this yet.  I used it right after brushing.  I also use it after meal if possible to clear out food between teeth.</li>
            <li> Different from tthe waterpik I used for years, butr more effective and equally easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took somewhat longer to get delivery, but i am pleased using it.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for many years before it wore out.  This one works really well. I was glad to fine one again...</li>
            <li> My husband and I love it!  Give us real clean feeling.  Easy to use. Kinda loud since this is a tiny machine.  Look nice and small size. :)</li>
            <li> When it works, it&#x27;s great. Unfortunately, we&#x27;ve already been through three of these units in 3 months. They all worked for about 2-4 weeks then they just stop working. It sounds like the pump is trying to pump but is all jammed up. We didn&#x27;t clog it with anything and yes, we did our best to prime the pump. I&#x27;ve never seen a product like this which consistently breaks after 2 weeks. Amazingly bad quality control.</li>
            <li> This WaterPik is every bit as good as the one I bought in the 1970&#x27;s. It&#x27;s a great product and works as it should if you follow the instructions.  The price is very fair.</li>
            <li> this works really well.. I had another one for 10 years, finally died .. does the job well</li>
            <li> Okay - I read some reviews stating that the Waterpik Water Flosser was &#x27;loud&#x27;. I had no idea what I was in store for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in an apartment.  In my opinion, this product is completely unusable for anyone who lives in an apartment.  I heeded the noise concerns of other users thinking I would use the Waterpik at an acceptable hour, say 8pm instead of 11pm when I&#x27;m heading to bed.  I would say there is NEVER a good time to use the Waterpik; it&#x27;s that loud.  If you have any respect for your neighbors, you will not want to use this product at any time.  The noise can best be described as a motorcycle idling in your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, I think a one star review is warranted because of this unacceptable flaw.  Maybe the noise is unavoidable based on how the motor works, but I don&#x27;t think that is a reasonable excuse.  In that case, perhaps more R&amp;D needs to go into this technology before products are placed on the market.  If you still plan to by one, all I can say is be warned, and own a house.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement of one I had for about 4 - 5 years:  the hose developed a pinhole leak.  I&#x27;ve always loved this device since it thoroughly cleans all areas between the teeth and under the gum lines.  I&#x27;ll keep buying these.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the product.  It does the job as expected of it.  What else do you expect me to say.</li>
            <li> I had the newer model waterpik and I Juarez it.  This model is the older one and the best.  It holds more water and has much better pressure. It works great</li>
            <li> this is my second waterpik water flosser. the effect is obvious good, teeth clean, comfortab, it has a little defect that it made some noise when you water your teeths.</li>
            <li> The only thing that this waterpik lacks is a lid for the water tank. But I prefer it to the more expensive model which I replaced with this one. One problem with all of them is that the hose kinks and breaks and cannot be replaced.</li>
            <li> good quality for the price! Working perfectly by now</li>
            <li> I have an older version of the WaterPik that is much simpler in design, and limited in versatility.   What I like:       A good range of useful attachments to enhance oral hygiene.       Good design of attachment and wand storage.       Controls are placed for ergonomic ease of use.       Easy attachment and removal of cleaning tool tips that are color  coded for easy identification.       Water flow and pressure are easily adjustable and the wand rotates 360 degrees.       Large reservoir to hold enough water/mouthwash mixture to service two people.       The price was extremely good.    What I don&#x27;t like:       The water flow cutoff button on the wand is hard to use and is a momentary off. I would prefer a button that is easier to operate. The quality of this one is poor.        The wand has a sloppy swival connection where the quick release coupling is connected to the main body of the wand. I would like to see a little less slop.    Summary:  This is a great product and is reasonably priced. It has improved my health remarkably by helping keep my gums free of food debris in hard to reach areas. It is hard to believe how much food debris can be lodged in the gums and in between the teeth even after rigorously brushing, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This is phenomenal.  I googled and checked all kinds of reviews from different sources and over and over again I heard how good this unit is.  It exceeded our expectations.  I am very conscientious with my great electric toothbrush and flossing; however, this thing makes my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have and it actually flosses.  I also just got two bridges and this is ideal for flushing.  It is extremely high-powered at maximum and I have used it there and at the lower speeds.  Works amazingly well wherever it is set.  If something goes wrong with it, I will immediately get another.  I&#x27;ve had other Waterpiks in the past and been very happy with them, but this one is leagues better and I won&#x27;t buy another one except this.</li>
            <li> I have had this unit less than a year.  It has been leaking for quite some time and now I can&#x27;t adjust the water pressure.  It is stuck at too low a setting so it is now useless.  These things should last longer.  I see many other reviewers had the same problem.  Junk.</li>
            <li> I use this Waterpik for nasal irrigation, on the lowest setting, along with the Sinu Pulse Tip (separate purchase).  It is noisy, but I was expecting this, having had experience with the brand in the past.  Be aware of the following statement listed under \\&quot;Warning\\&quot; in the product&#x27;s operation manual: \\&quot;Do not use this product for more than 5 minutes in each two-hour period.  Longer usage can overheat the motor and cause product failure as well as voiding the warranty.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product has been around for a long time without any essential design or construction changes except that it is now made in China whereas it was originally made in America.  Unfortunately, this means that it is held back by substandard design choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my personal experience the weak link is the flexible hose between the pump body and the nozzle head.  While I can appreciate that it must be both flexible and capable of containing the water pressure created by the pump so the hose materials are crucial.  However, the longevity of the hose material is inadequate.  I note that some people report getting seven years use, that has not been my experience:  it seems to be less than five for me.  The problem is that the hose material loses its suppleness and hardens.  When it hardens, it can break if flexed beyond its decreasing flex limits.  There is no point in buying the replacement head (see http://www.amazon.com/WaterPik-hose-repair-kit-handle/dp/B000A8EHU6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1354727663&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;waterpik+replacement), as I did, and attempting to attach it as the instructions suggest.  That is because one is still faced with the reduced elasticity of the original hose into which the replacement hose is meant to fit.  The old hose splits rather than expanding when one tries to insert the supplied male-male couple.  There seems to be left only the choices of doing without or purchase a new unit.  The implicit cost of the latter option is about $10 per year (+electricity).  Is it worth it?  There is a third option which the Waterpik company strongly discourages.  That is to take the unit apart (a tricky, but possible, thing to do) and fit the replacement nozzle head and hose combination directly onto the pump, thereby replacing the sclerotic original hose. That saves about $25 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely, modern technology can come up with better material choices than those of this dated product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot lighter than my old one maybe because the old one is about 25yrs old.&lt;br /&gt;I took old one apart cleaned and lubed gears and little plastic piston, runs great so I gave it to my Dad!</li>
            <li> Have used one for many years and had to replace it. Great product! When this one dies I will order another one!</li>
            <li> use it twice a day really good</li>
            <li> Nope,  don&#x27;t  do  it!  It  stopped  running  properly  the  FIRST  WEEK!  I  went  back on  line  to  figure out  what  could I  do,  and it  didn&#x27;t  help.  Waterpik  used too be  really  quality product.  Disappointing</li>
            <li> This is my second one, my other one lasted over 6 years. I prefere using this over flossing, it just feels cleaner!</li>
            <li> Brought this for my grandson who was have problems with his gums.  During his next visit to the dentist he was told he&#x27;d made a marked improvement. Don&#x27;t know whether or this unit was the reason but my grandson said he was surprised how much debris a waterpik releases even after what he thought was a good brushing.  I&#x27;ve used a waterpik for many, many years and realized the same results. Every family should have one (with pics for each member).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Waterpik for for over 25 years, and my dental hygienist always complements me on the condition of my gums.  My new Waterpik is lighter weight, quieter, and easier to connect the water basin to the unit.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> Over all I really like this Water Pik.  Two things are not so nice.  First:  If the hand piece is in it&#x27;s holder when you put the tank on to use, you can&#x27;t get it out without removing the full tank from the unit.  Second:  The tank is the cover for the unit when not in use, With the hand unit in it&#x27;s holder and the tip in place, the tank (cover) does not work unless you remove the tip first (Bummer).  However the added capacity of the tank makes the unit well worth having.</li>
            <li> I owned another waterpik for a few years that broke recently and replaced it with this one because i loved the old one so much. Unfortunately the button that pauses the water from spraying requires you to push down really hard or the water will still run.&lt;br /&gt;my fingers start to ache after a few seconds of using this. So unless you have a strong grip with your thumb and wont mind a big dent in your finger, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise stay away from this model at least.</li>
            <li> I have used this device for over 20 years.  My &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; one has worked flawlessly for over 10 years.  I am now returning my THIRD &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one all of which have failed within 30 to 60 days-pump fails to pump water thru pic or fails to have proper pressure.  Do yourself a favor DON&#x27;t buy one.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It has great pressure and does a good job. Water capacity is great. My only complaint is that the attachments in the storage area are loosley setting in a hole and they fall out easily when I remove the tank (when it is used as a cover). I wish they had made it so the attachments are secured in the holder instead of loosely setting in a hole. It is fustrating to have to keep cleaning the attachments because they fall out when I am setting up the unit for use..</li>
            <li> I bought this when my old Waterpik bit the dust after 15 years.  This one looks nice, and is fairly compact, and has a good range of spray pressures.  Note that, on the advice of my dentist, I fill mine with a little salt and warm water.  However, after a week of doing so with this machine, adding the salt directly to the water, it clogged up, and I had to spend quite a while cleaning it and flushing the lines with hot water.  Since then, I&#x27;ve dissolved the salt in hot water before adding it to the Waterpik, and it&#x27;s been working fine for a month.  I&#x27;m planning to order some extra piks, because the problem with my old one is that the pik broke, and I can&#x27;t replace it, because the old size is different from the new ones.  Just something to consider if you order this.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s working quite wonderfully. No problems. Meeting all expectations just fine. Thank you very much and best wishes to you all.&lt;br /&gt;Aloha, George</li>
            <li> Works great has plenty of power, some of the other models don&#x27;t have enough pressure. This one has way more pressure than needed it can get a lot more stuff broken loose from your gumline than flossing will ever do.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have for everyone who cares about dental and gum health. I had the same model purchased about 10 years ago, and the new one is a lot lighter in construction, weights a lot less, feels less sturdy. It came with the tongue cleaner which is great, but only one flosser, but the ones I had from the older Water-Pik fit perfectly, so no loss there. There are other brands in the market, but I recommend the original Water-Pik from Teledyne. It has been around for over 40 years and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I purchased the WaterPik flosser knowing it received mixed reviews. All I can say is this removed much more debris from my teeth than traditional flossing, and in much less time. This is a great tool for those who just wanna pass out at night, it takes 30 seconds and feels great. This is a great improvement to my routine.</li>
            <li> this was a replacement for a wp-20 that died from old age 15+ years it works as expected but i liked the wp-20</li>
            <li> I have this unit, a WP-65C that just broke and a WP-65W and I prefer the 65 series for the following reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Pressure is greater. Even though it is listed as lower, it is higher on both of my W65 units and allows me to really get into gum pockets where my wisdom teeth used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The tips stay in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The water reservoir is larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Replacement heads are still available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Slide switch can move too easily (I fixed this with a rubber band and may super glue the next handle on high).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Hose broke. This was after years and replacement head with hose is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Larger footprint on counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Noisier than Ultra&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took my 65C unit apart after the hose broke and it is a very simple design.&lt;br /&gt;Could have been fixed parts I had if I hadn&#x27;t broken the fitting on the head by using too much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These devices are much better at cleaning the gum line plaque than floss by a long shot. I can even get stuff out from between my teeth after flossing so it seems like a no-brainer as far as dental hygiene (thank God for spell checker on that one...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the Ultra model: [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]</li>
            <li> I used a battery powered waterpik for a couple of years and the battery seemed to get weaker as well as the pump pressure.&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t have that problem with the plug in kind.</li>
            <li> This is our second such device; the first one served us well for more than ten years.  This replacement has a stiffer, less pliant hose.  The motor seems to be stronger, pushing out a more vibrant and thinner stream of water, which, when inadvertently aimed at soft skin tissue, under the tongue for example, causes a degree of pain.  The nozzle is  located under the blue plastic container of water and we find it awkward to remove.  The water tank is easy to use; we normally put in two small glasses of water and when we are done, we let the hose drop into the sink and the water left in the container drains out into the sink.  We find that we are making less use of this model than we did of the previous one.</li>
            <li> I had this model for 10 years before it broke down 2 months ago.  I ordered the same model thinking if it lasted 10 years, it&#x27;s good enough.  Not so.  I can&#x27;t get a hard pulse; only works on the lowest pulsing.  I have many caps so I must maintain healthy gums.  I won&#x27;t give up on Waterpik, however, so I am ordering the next model up and hoping I have better results.</li>
            <li> My daughter was so eager to use this to floss her new braces.  Just trying to keep the enthusiasm up, though.</li>
            <li> ortondestiny@yahoo.com  Niagara falls Canada  great</li>
            <li> excellent product i should have purchased replacement piks , i used to sell this&lt;br /&gt;products years ago from teledyne is is a wonderful tool for your teeth keeps them&lt;br /&gt;clear and clean where dental floss does not , i´m very pleased with its use</li>
            <li> Now that my second Waterpik is now a few months old, I can make informed critique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  (1) The location of the ON/OFF switch needs to be changed. Far too many times I&#x27;ve grabbed the side when seeking to move it and found myself inadvertently pushing up the ON/OFF handle and turning the unit on; the result is water sprays all over me and the bathroom.  (2) the hose connections are bound to be the fail because of inadequate strain reliefs, (3) when a tip is in place, it is tough to get the handle to fit into the storage hole under the tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: (1) it functions as intended. (2) Having the flow control on the handle is convenient, an improvement over earlier designs. .  (3) bigger tank means less frequent refilling.</li>
            <li> Received waterik water flosser today and it was well packaged.  I ordered it on Feb. 12th, not too bad on turnaround time. The assembly was pretty easy. This was my first time ever using a water flosser. A bit of a scary experience. I encourage you to start with the flosser in your mouth before you turn it on; got everything on my counter nice and wet. Also don’t put on clothes you plan on leaving out the house in.&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, there is a reason the waterpik is better than flossing and it is because of the high intensity water pressure. I saw a comment where it said that the pressure wasn’t all that great so I set it at high before I turned it on; be aware that isn’t a good place to start, work your way up. The water pressure contends with that of a dentist instrument. Overall great product and I plan to buy one for my sister. </li>
            <li> I use the Waterpik after regular flossing, but before brushing with my Sonicare toothbrush.  The deep cleaning and gum massage promote soft tissue health.  The very small investment has saved me thousands in dental repair costs since I began to use it.  The only negative is the hose that connects the pump to the handle has a tendency to break.  I have not tried the repair kit.  This is my fourth Waterpik.  I usually get 3 - 5 years out of each one.  That works out to less than $10/yr - less than $1/month.</li>
            <li> Works well but, as noted by others, it is noisier than the one it replaced.  Also the hose seems to get in the way of replacing the brush in the holder.  However, it does a good job of cleaning between your teeth and really that is all that matters.</li>
            <li> Wanted one for years.  Sounds like a construction crew in  your bathroom running a jack hammer.  I always seem to get more water on the mirror than I do in my mouth.  The button to squeeze to make it stop is difficult to press so i tend to also wash my nostrils and eyes.</li>
            <li> This for me is a can&#x27;t live without product.  I have been using this product since it was invented.  They last for years and  when they finally bite the  dust I order another one.  I can&#x27;t live without it. It cleans out all  the food between my teeth that even brushing does not do completely.  I know when I&#x27;m sleeping nothing is contaminating my teeth.</li>
            <li> We have been using a Waterpik for decades when our old one finally died. This replacement is as good as the old. The holders for the attachments are handy. Inserting the attachment into the &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34; takes getting used to, but it&#x27;s easy. The new Waterppik is much lighter than our old one. For that reason, one must be careful when turning on the device. If not careful, you could dump the reservoir full of water because you can actually lift up the whole unit with the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik does a great job of flossing--better and easier than dental floss. We have had very few cavities over the years, and NO periodontal disease. We are in our mid-60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fair price, too.</li>
            <li> It shipped promptly, and it arrived sooner than I expected. It seems like a good product, as I had one of these that lasted for many years.</li>
            <li> works fine, took some getting used to but I now love it and I don&#x27;t spray water all over the room anymore</li>
            <li> Works great and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I used to have a rechargeable powered waterpik but it didn&#x27;t last long. I don&#x27;t mind the power cord at all.</li>
            <li> I have owned three Waterpik products over the last 40 years. I really can&#x27;t remember when I started using a Waterpik  This is my fourth one.  The first two lasted about 20 years each and I still have a battery operated travel model that still works.  Waterpik has been one of the best companies for long lasting products I have ever dealt with.  This new model is working fine for the month that I have had it.  I was a little concerned with the lightness of this new flosser as the first two were much heavier.  I hope the motor is as good as the first two.  The clear reservoir makes it much easier to line up the holes when placing it on the base.  Some reviewers have complained about the noise, but all the models I have had made just as much noise as this one so this is not an issue for me.  I used to floss first in the morning then brush and then waterpik.  Now I waterpik first then floss, brush and waterpik once more.  My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean unless I waterpik each morning.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I thought the new model would be much quieter than the old one, it is not.  I finally put a washcloth under it to muffle the sound, otherwise, it does the job.</li>
            <li> When you have the time to use it, it works great to make your teeth feel truly clean. It gets them way cleaner then brushing and flossing can. The only problem is how much space it takes up. I wind up using it less often because I have to put it away in a closet each time. It&#x27;s too big to keep on a bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This unit was a replace for one that we had for years and it works perfectly just like the one it replaced.</li>
            <li> The handle valve stops working in 4 month. They printed on box: 2 years warranty. Called customer service. They do not provide repair. They basically send you part and you have to do it yourself! There is no actual warranty and quality is getting worse from bad. This is my third waterpik and I know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth clean. It is a little bit loud, but it does the work. Will get a second one.</li>
            <li> This is the third one of these I&#x27;ve owned and (I in my opinion) it&#x27;s better than the previous two. Appliances like this have a finite life and given the engineering that&#x27;s required and the manufacturing time and materials I have to think this is a product that is worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.  I own one already and purchased this one for my daughter.  Waterpik makes great products.</li>
            <li> I have had another water pik which I wore out. This one did not work AT ALL and I returned it for a refund, because of the hassle of shipping, I chose to buy another locally and that one works just fine.</li>
            <li> This was just a replacement for the same type of unit I have used for years.It works perfect, and maybe a little better. I would absoutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this everyday!</li>
            <li> This is my second one that I purchased lately.  I hope it works better than the last one.  It&#x27;s okay so far.</li>
            <li> This is our 2nd Waterpik so my husband and I each have our own.  Our dental hygenist recommended it and our recent exams prove how useful this little wonder is.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Very happy with flosser.  Works great.  Had the portable unit and was dissatisfied with it.  This unit works much better.</li>
            <li> It works fine. It does what it advertised that it does and I have had no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and replaces the same item I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested this product,he used it for years, so I ordered it based on his recommendation. I am so happy I did, works great, simple to use. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> What was I thinking???  A flosser with OUT a lid?!!!  I put mouthwash in with my water to floss and oftentimes I don&#x27;t use all of the liquid in the resevoir so I just save it til the next flossing.  I was not happy about leaving the water/mouthwash exposed until the next flossing but I left it in until I could think of a way to create my own lid.  Bad move!  By the afternoon, all of the remaining liquid, apx 1/2 inch had drained completely out all over the sink and onto the floor.  The pressure is okay/good but the pause button is on the finger side when you hold it and I&#x27;m used to pausing with my thumb.  Also the pressure adjustment is on the handle which makes it virtually impossible to change pressure settings while holding pause without making a gigantic mess!  Not happy at all!  Definitely returning!!!</li>
            <li> It worked fine until last week, now the water does not come out right. Where the 2 black things  connect , are not making the proper connection, for the water to flow out right. Have been using the product about a month. It is the waterpik water flosser shown here  Mrs Jean Walker</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a much older waterpik that finally died. This seems to work well, was fairly priced and hopefully will last as long as the last one did.</li>
            <li> This item has made my mouth much cleaner. My gums have always been sensitive so regular flossing has always been harder for me but this has made the job so much easier. My mouth is much fresher throughout the day and this gets far more food debris out from between my teeth. The</li>
            <li> Inferior to the original version</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to get this and I told her I remember my grandmother having one and that I thought it was just a fad. She promised me that it is here to stay and that I would benefit from it very much! I have been using it now for about a month and I love it. Never felt cleaner or more confident in my smile!</li>
            <li> finally figured out how to hook it up and every thing is working perfect. thank you so much and will use again.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of once a day use it emitted a smell like a motor burn-out then did not run again. The next day it pumped water but could not establish any pressure. We dumped it.</li>
            <li> We use the waterpik daily for good dental care. This waterpik was sent to our sons home so that we would have a waterpik to use when we visted them. The control of water and the pressure of the water is excellent.</li>
            <li> Works great-helps promote dental health..</li>
            <li> Our new Waterpik is just great. It has more power than our last WaterPik and works like a charm. I would recommend this to anyone in need of water irrigation.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik flosser is wonderful for dental care.  I use a low power to flush out debris and then a high power for removing plaque.  The Waterpik at high speed seems to pulverize plaque, which then can be rinsed or brushed away.  I am expecting a very good checkup by my dental hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered an additional use for the Waterpik that I was thinking of patenting until I wrote this review -- now all of you will know about it.  I save one of the tips for back-flushing sprinkler heads from my irrigation system when they get clogged.  I previously spent about $18 a month replacing sprinkler heads and now I just clean them and re-install them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the nth time and was quite satisfied with it until recently when it came in with a new design style.  It used to look sturdy and more stable when placed in a countertop, now it is so lightweight, nosier and the material used looks cheap. Even the design has been modified.  If i were based in the United States, I could have returned the product but since I have to bring it home with me to my home country, the Philippines, I have no choice but get stucked with it. Frankly, it&#x27;s quite a disapointment.</li>
            <li> One added feature I would like:  a lid over the reservoir to shield it from dust and splashing from washing face, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for My son in law. I think it will make a nice gift, but it was not for myself.</li>
            <li> My son really needed this item goes well with the flossing he does according to the dentist. Says it works well.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase. It meets all of my needs at a very affordable price. Packaging was perfect.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores. Wantebeen improvedd it to replace 20 year old unit that died. Does the job well and has improved</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist this past Monday and we discussed the waterpik. This is a good investment now and the future concerning dental hygiene. The waterpik works great and the ease on assembling makes it attractvie as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had trouble finding this in stores, and found other types, even by Waterpick to have too little pressure, and water resevoirs that were too small.  This one is just right.  Should have shopped Amazon first!</li>
            <li> Bought this less than 30 days ago.  I have been having trouble for a few days but tonight it won&#x27;t even pump water.  I&#x27;m exchanging it in hopes it was a fluke.  If not...I&#x27;ll return for full refund.  Thank goodness Amazon has a great return policy.</li>
            <li> does good job of remooving food particles. I preferred the Conair with finer spray that went out prior to this one.</li>
            <li> This item is nice and compact, but on the load side.  Overall, we really love this Waterpik and recommend it!</li>
            <li> This waterpix is easy and fun to use..I only have to fill it one time.The price was better than Walmart price.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly.  I do have to check each time to assure&lt;br /&gt;top is well connected, and put lots of water for it to work --&lt;br /&gt;but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Wow is it loud. I thought my Oster beehive blender was loud, but if you got that item and this going at once you&#x27;d probably be rockin&#x27; the decibels of a Motley Crue concert  circa1988.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works. The kids dig it.&lt;br /&gt;It seems cheaply made though. Veerryy cheaply made. Why can&#x27;t they just make stuff in the USA anymore? I&#x27;d pay more. Wouldn&#x27;t you?</li>
            <li> I like it.  Works well.  People don&#x27;t use water flossers because the pressure coming out is too hard.  Hurts my gums or bleeding.  Set as low as possible and work up from there.  I find it useful gets the junk off your teeth and does a good job.  picks up where flossing and stick brush leaves.  Only drawback is it takes a long time to Brush, Floss, Pick and then use the water flosser.</li>
            <li> This newer version of the Waterpik Water Flosser is not as sturdy as the other model (which I had for 8 yrs).  It is very difficult to slide the adjuster on the handle to increase the intensity of the water.  It takes 2 hands to do this.</li>
            <li> Water flosser are the greatest way to keep your teeth &amp; gums healthy...  plus it is fun!!  Use it with warm water &amp; mouth wash.</li>
            <li> Much improved over older model.  Hose attachment has been moved to beneath the base, unfortionately still no clamp!!  The implements now fit into the handle without a fight - the manufacturing tolerances must have been reworked.</li>
            <li> 3 units in a row have failed after several weeks of use. Waterpik indicates when using mouthwash and not flushing with water after caused problem with pump seals. Wp60 manual suggests flushing would prolong life but doesn&#x27;t indicate that unit will fail after a few weeks of use. Obliviously a big problem is building.  Manual touts using mouthwash if dentist agrees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these things and I&#x27;ll never own another one.  The first one lasted about two years before the pump went out.  The second one lasted about a year before the switch broke.  I bought an spst toggle switch at Home Depot and repaired it with that.  Then, after about a year, the tubing broke.  I was able to repair it with a piece of automotive vacuum hose that the broken ends of the tube happened to fit into perfectly.  I secured it with an adhesive product called \\&quot;Shoe Goo\\&quot;.  Then the tube broke in another place and I discovered that it had become brittle because it was just really cheap plastic.  The poor quality of Waterpik is just infuriating.  The stupidity of the engineering is unbelievable.  Like, for example, the fact that the handle never seems to fit the receptacle unless you remove the tip each time.  I wish someone would design and manufacture a decent product and put Waterpik out of its misery.</li>
            <li> Cheap water supply cord breaks or cracks quickly and would purchase another brand out there if there were one that was competitive. I have purchased probably six so far, all became throwaways. BUT I NEED IT.</li>
            <li> I USE IT TO IRRIGATE MY SINUS CAVITIES WITH A SPECIAL TIP.  i HAVE BECOME ALLERGIC TO SOMETHING GROWING HERE, AND HAVE HAD SEVERE HEADACHES.  BY USING THE WATERPIK, i AM ABLE TO FLUSH OUT ALL THE DUST AND POLLEN FROM MY SINUS CAVITIES, AND THEN i HAVE NO HEADACHES.  THIS IS A GREAT ITEM, AND AT A GREAT PRICE.  i MAY EVEN START USING IT TO CLEAN MY TEETH.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Water Flosser is very easy to use - set-up takes seconds, the intensity is easy to adjust, and clean-up is a breeze.  It also takes up little space. The price was really reasonable!  Best of all - it promotes great oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and am very pleased.  I am a person who HATES to floss.  After twenty something years of irregular flossing habits, I decided that I needed to do something.  I read many reviews about WaterPiks, the Conair model, and a few others.  I decided that this would be the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;Provides a very clean feeling.&lt;BR&gt;Does not hurt.&lt;BR&gt;Easy to use.&lt;BR&gt;Attractive.&lt;BR&gt;Quality Design.&lt;BR&gt;It holds a lot of water.&lt;BR&gt;You can mix mouthwash with the water.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly Loud.&lt;BR&gt;The coiled tube gets twisted and can be annoying to correct.&lt;BR&gt;The &amp;quot;pause&amp;quot; button should be a &amp;quot;go&amp;quot; button.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am happy with my purchase.  I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;BR&gt;Note:  My mother was a dental hygienist for twenty years.  After I purchased this product she informed me that people who overuse waterpiks can cause unwanted damage.  Gums form a natural V in between the teeth, and excessive use can cause that tissue to recess.  The key word is excessive. Use the product no more than two times a day.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these in June 2004.  First one arrived and didn&#x27;t work out of the box.  Amazon was great and replaced it very quickly.  Replacement item is now about three months old and has failed.  Only used by one adult in the household.  I would not recommend this unit.  In all fairness I bought a WaterPik unit almost 15 years ago and it lasted until this year, in spite of the fact that it was used by two teen-agers and an adult! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The WP-65 seems to be basically JUNK, I cannot recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing to blast the plaque from under my gums, and it works perfectly.  Yes, I had to have root planing, which is unpleasant.......and I don&#x27;t want to have to do that again.........so I bought this tool.  I had used a water pik years ago, and it must have died, and I foolishly did not replace it.  My dentist says my problem gap areas are free of plaque, and should stay that way........I do not want to lose any teeth......but the best reason to use the water pik, is that it makes your teeth feel wonderful.  I fill the little tank up all the way, and blast the bacteria away for about three minutes..............not sure I need to do it that long, but I am determined to get my gum line spotless.  I use this every single evening before sleep, and haven&#x27;t missed a day.</li>
            <li> works fine.  excellent product, worth the money.  my wife thinks it is a bit noisy, but works well.  has a good capacity for water.</li>
            <li> I purchased my WP-65 in May &#x27;05 and started using it just about every night for the last five months. My dentist was amazed that my gums were in such good shape when I went to see him. Typically I&#x27;d go to the dentist and get a half-hour lecture about gum care and then I&#x27;d have to go to weeks of subgingival cleanings which were painful &amp; expensive. Not anymore... my WaterPik has saved me the pain, the bills &amp; the lectures.</li>
            <li> I was overwhelmed by the choices, and selected this model, in part, because of the reasonal price.  I had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product, but I decided there was only a small possibility of that happening.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The instructions said to use the lowest setting initially, which certainly made sense.  However, the INSTRUCTIONS said to move the adjustment \\&quot;toward the tip\\&quot;, which turned out to be the highest, not the lowest setting!  The diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the LARGER opening, but I read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later.  The spray was very powerful and actually \\&quot;hurt\\&quot;, especially when it was by my tooth with a crown.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The next day I tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink, not in my mouth!  It felt wonderful on the lower setting!  I reread the directions again (and again over the next several days) to see if the error was mine or theirs.  I still think the directions were not written properly.  The third day I had trouble getting any spray at all.  This continued for about a week, some days getting more or less, but never a full spray ON ANY SETTING!  My guess is that it was in a permanent \\&quot;pause\\&quot; mode. I gave up and pursued returning the item.  It needed to be returned to an \\&quot;authorized repair\\&quot;, which luckily was only a few miles away (there were only three in my state).  The repair man had told me, over the phone, it was a discontinued model and hadn&#x27;t been made in about  a year.  When he looked at it, he found it had been made in 2006.  He said he could fix it, but wasn&#x27;t allowed to; I am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail.</li>
            <li> My first one served very well for over eight years before developing a leak.  The basic system is superb on all my teeth and essential on those that snag uncomfortable bits of food.  The new one offers more convenient (though not perfect) placement of controls and movable parts.  The only drawback is more water splashing on my hands (over the bowl)-- which I can&#x27;t explain.</li>
            <li> I have used waterpik for years...the older models lasted a long time. My latest waterpik broke after just two weeks...the pump stopped working. Prior to that, the waterpik I had lasted one year. I don&#x27;t have time to drive 25 miles to the nearest service center and hassle...I don&#x27;t intend to buy any more of these. A friend has an interplak, and it has proved reliable.</li>
            <li> This is a good design for the waterpik.  I have had several, and this is the best so far, if it turns out that it lasts well.  It has 2 tips which is much appreciated (but the tongue cleaner makes me gag).  And I like the translucent  water bowl.</li>
            <li> I have had many waterpiks over the years.  This one looks good, but it&#x27;s operation is erratic, someimes feels like it&#x27;s about to conk out, but it hasn&#x27;t, so far so good, but not the best I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I bought one August 29, 2004.  It lasted a long time but finally broke.  I bought a replacement July 25, 2012.  It lasted not quite a year.  I bought another replacement February 23, 2013.  This one broke exactly 2 months later in August 2013.  I love the product but I don&#x27;t want to keep replacing it every two months or less.  They are supposed to have a warranty but I can&#x27;t find any details about how to get warranty service.</li>
            <li> I love it, its exactly what I was looking for. It has all the features I was looking for.Holds plenty of water and has several different speeds.</li>
            <li> It is slick and quick.  A little noisy is my only complaint.  I like to keep my wife happy with quiet surroundings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to this machine. It is so much more effective than floss! I even take it on the road because nothing is as annoying as a bit of food stuck between the molars. It has also enhanced my gums. I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of years and haven&#x27;t had a single incident of bleeding gums since.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I would say essential of one has bridges under which one can&#x27;t floss.</li>
            <li> Just took delivery and used for the first time this water pick flosser. I&#x27;ve had others, and of course we always like what we&#x27;ve gotten used too. Well, operationaly this one seems to fit the bill pretty well. The power is fine and I&#x27;ll play around with the adjustment on that. The pulsing I&#x27;m not so sure of yet. Never had one that did that.&lt;br /&gt;  But the main thing is, like someone else mentioned in another review. It needs a cover. We don&#x27;t want to have to turn the resevoir over to use as a cover to keep the dust out. I taped a piece of flexable plastic across the back of the resevoir which covers the opening on top. It&#x27;s easy enough to lift that and fill it by using a glass or cup that we all have sitting around the bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;  I may come up with a better solution in the future, but for now this is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;  OK, Now it&#x27;s about a month later. Someone else before me mentioned the power behind the pulsing function. Personally I can&#x27;t handle anything stronger than the lowest setting. My advice is \\&quot;don&#x27;t start any higher than the lowest setting\\&quot;. Anything higher will strip paint!&lt;br /&gt;  Hope this helps you,&lt;br /&gt;  Ted</li>
            <li> Makes flossing fun. Only complaint is that it lacks a little power when it comes to water pressure. Would like it to have one or two higher water pressure settings than those offered by the machine.</li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning out particles but the water container is difficult to keep on the input and the flosser needs to have a lower spray for sensitive teeth. Also the price is way up now it is called a Flosser even though it is no different from&lt;br /&gt;my old Waterpik. Price is almost doubled.</li>
            <li> This product started out working good. Then after a couple of uses it started making a real bad squealing noise. I thought perhaps the little motor was getting too hot and it did feel pretty warm. And it wasn&#x27;t because it ran out of water to pump. I let it cool off and tried it the next day. At first it started ok then after a short while it started squealing real bad again. So loud it was almost painful to the ear.It was like it needed to be greased or oiled or something. I read one review after I purchased it of a person saying their&#x27;s quit working shortly after as well. I did get a refund upon returning the product. But I wouldn&#x27;t order this product if I were you.</li>
            <li> Used one of these for eons..They really help keep my fixed bridge in my mouth.  In today&#x27;s world it would probably cost $8,000 to replace and the Waterpik keep this area and my whole mouth in great shape.  I bought one for my Great Grandaughter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Waterpiks for more than 20 years and on average I&#x27;d say they last 3-4 years. I have always been satisfied with them and love the way my mouth feels after using it. This one however is only a little over a year old (beyond warranty) and is now leaking like crazy so that when you add water the water simply pours out.  I don&#x27;t know if this was simply a lemon or if Waterpik quality standards have gone down. Also, the price has jumped considerably. For years I paid $35 on average and now the price has jumped to $50 and more.</li>
            <li> Works OK. I had one just like it that broke. The pump seized up and the motor overheated. I got another one because I didn&#x27;t know of any other choices. Don&#x27;t expect long life with any appliance that comes in contact with water, be it a washer, dishwasher, or flosser: They all equally unreliable.</li>
            <li> The top of the unit does not sit properly&lt;br /&gt;Water leaks and it doesn&#x27;t begin to work until you play with the fitting</li>
            <li> The multiple settings is a plus.  Just enough water area for cleaning.  Cleans well with the proper pressure.  Good buy!!!</li>
            <li> Best model for best price. User since 1970&#x27;s. Fllosser ---small tank---waste  of money This unit  fill to brim and you have more than enough time. Pressurem on flosser non-adjustable -weak.  This model one below maximum is adequate for needed pressure.</li>
            <li> My previous waterpik was broken and I was in serious need of another and the&lt;br /&gt;price was right and available quickly. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Harris</li>
            <li> Works perfectly---love it. Easy to operate and love the different pressure setttings. I would absolutely recommend it.  My mouth feels so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is sooo much better than the cordless one I bought first.  This product is just like the Waterpiks that I have been using for years.  It works!!</li>
            <li> The Waterpic does the job it was designed to do but it is very noisy and has a cheap sound to it. I would not recommend this product. You may be able to spend a few more dollars to get a much better machine.</li>
            <li> Package arrived and it was much smaller than expected. Maybe 5-6 inches tall, happy about that. Any rate, filled up the blue thing with water and turned it on - after putting it on the white base. Gotta say that it started shaking at first and it worried me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the instructions. Looks like everything&#x27;s normal, it&#x27;s just a little noisy, kinda like an RC car. No biggie though. Put it at full blast and this thing does some damage. Wow. Turned it back down to smallest setting and used it for a bit. Worked great, except it kinda splattered a bunch out of my mouth. Maybe I should learn how to use this better. But anyway, stopped using it in the mirror and got down to business and it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing packed up neatly, can&#x27;t complain about that. I&#x27;m satisfied though!</li>
            <li> This has been the perfect answer to my problems.  As a mature adult, I was concerned that I was having to get braces and after dealing with my children&#x27;s experiences with braces (almost 20 years ago), I knew that I had to be really careful about daily cleaning.  I love the design which keeps up to 3 nozzles on the side and under the water tank. The waterpik water flosser has helped keep my teeth and braces so clean that my dental hygienist was impressed.</li>
            <li> Waterpik makes a great water flosser. I use it every day, and it definitely works better than floss and brushing alone. Buying it on Amazon saved me money and the delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I had one of these units when they first came out and it lasted for years. This one seems to work as well with some improvements over previous model.</li>
            <li> I chose it for its varible settings, especially the high ones. Can&#x27;t beat a Waterpik for power, if it is a plug in model.</li>
            <li> Definitely love this waterpik.  It works wonderfully to remove food particles behind the hard to get to wisdom teeth.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with this unit and my older one lasted for about a year and a half.  Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> This order came very promptly. The product did just what it said it would and I use it twice daily with great results.  Even my dentist thinks it is great.</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper one from Walmart from Waterpik which they no longer make- it was ten times better!  This unit has an annoying pulse which makes it kind of tickle, not really flow as well.  Yes, it does the job of cleaning but it&#x27;s too big and cumbersome, the wand doesn&#x27;t go back in very well and it just isn&#x27;t as good as the smaller unit they used to make.</li>
            <li> It is a great waterpik.  It takes a minutes to really set it for the water to pump, but otherwise it meet all of our expectations.  I love the way it is easy to turn to get all the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> This is made very cheaply. For being $35 I would expect material to be stronger and more firm.. It just feels very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The hose is very stiff and will not straighten out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does its job, very well, I can&#x27;t complain with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty loud.. it sounds almost like it &amp;#34;chugs&amp;#34; too. But what do you expect?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again if I had to, though. It saves me the &amp;#34;You don&#x27;t floss that&#x27;s why your gums are bleeding&amp;#34; speech from my dentist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as loud as my last waterpik and it was about the same price. It has a nice big reservoir and I really like the way it it flips over to become the cover making it nice and compact.</li>
            <li> The dimensions are incorrectly listed. I took a chance and it fit perfectly in the small space I&#x27;d reserved for it. It&#x27;s powerful, easy to operate and has several settings.</li>
            <li> I have used waterpiks for 15 years. When it works, the product is fine.  The problem is that the unit will break in 3 to 6 months. I am so fed up with this product and could kick myself for not returning them.  I have now ordered oralbreeze which connects to the faucet.  Waterpik in my opinion is junk.  The older ones were good.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have replaced. It has the same power as the older models. Canister is large enough to do the entire mouth. Stay away from the smaller unit niot as powerful.</li>
            <li> I have been using waterpik devices for years and this helps keep my dental cleaner from yelling too much at me . Works great.</li>
            <li> Even better than the previous model that we had.  Quick delivery.  Easy setup. Use it every day.  No problems noted.</li>
            <li> I had one of this product before, it broke at the hose after three years for everyday use - no complain and bought a new one from this vendor.</li>
            <li> It has absolutely NO power--it&#x27;s no where near as efficient as the former, less expernsive, model that I have always used.  I hope to exchange it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to review this product.  Joanne Jenks</li>
            <li> Excellent product - I just wish I could buy it locally!  My wife and I have had one for years and the kids have used ours.  Now the kids finally have one of their own.  Using this regularly reversed the gingivitis gum disease we were experiencing.  Now our mouths are healthy.  Plus, this is really the only &amp;#34;realistic&amp;#34; way for our kids to floss around their braces on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> One month after purchasing this Waterpik it wouldn&#x27;t pulse water when sliding the selector to higher pressures. It seems as if the pause button was activating at the higher flow.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is great for getting food out of your teeth!  First time I used it, I was amazed on how much crud it got out of my mouth.  Really makes me wonder how good brushing is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterpik is loud and held at the wrong angle, it can dribble down your arm.  Some people complained about the pressure of the water being too strong, but I almost think it is like a gum massage.  I would recommend this to anyone trying to have better dental hygiene.  You can also add Listerine to the tank for added cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paired with regular brushing and flossing will make your dentist happy!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst Waterpik Flosser  I have ever bought, and so poorly made that it is greatly overpriced.  I had a Waterpik Flosser for many years without a problem, using it daily.  Recently its hose was so old and worn that it cracked in places and leaked badly, but it didn&#x27;t owe me a dime; I think I&#x27;ve had it for more than 10 years, so I bought this new flosser.  Here are my cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The water container is topless. When you have finished using the flosser you are forced to leave the water tub open to dust, dirt, etc. because no cover was provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Maneuvering the water container on top of the assembly so that it is tightly in place at the fitting where the water runs through is so difficult to do that I wanted to give up on the whole task.  I had to struggle with it to push it down enough times so that it finally seated well enough that after turning the switch on, some water was able to come through the hand flosser tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The whole assembly is very flimsy.  I cannot imagine that it will last anywhere as long as my previous sturdy Waterpik Flosser.  The water tub does not fit onto the bottom assembly firmly at all, and everything else kind of teeters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  When you are finished using the flosser, you have to leave the entire assembly uncovered (since there is no cover) , otherwise you have to remove the empty (I don&#x27;t leave warm water in the tub) tub and perhaps turn it upside down over the assembly over which it does not rest squarely, or store it elsewhere, or cover it with a towel , or whatever.  It&#x27;s a pain.  Then of course when you go to use it the next time, you have to struggle to get the tub seated firmly over the little water outlet again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  My previous Waterpik had a nice sturdy cover with a little lidded insert in which a number of extra tools could be stored. This one has some apertures that you can place the tool heads in, but they fall out easily. On my previous Waterpik I never needed to cover the tub at all, since after I emptied it, it had its own well-fitting cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  The whole thing tips over easily.  I have it on my vanity counter, off to the side, but if I happen to bump it with my arm, it tips over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was an absolute disappointment.  I actually have no pros for this, except that once you get it working, it does the intended job, but by the time I get to that part, the air is pretty blue.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it. He likes using it and it greatly improves his dental hygiene so I love it too.</li>
            <li> This WaterPik lasted less than 60 days and now won&#x27;t cycle water at all.  The warranty was only good for 30 days, so I&#x27;m out-of-luck.  Don&#x27;t buy it or at least buy it at a reputable store when you can return it.</li>
            <li> Noisy, and does not tolerate addition of mouthwash to the water. Unit failed after about 2 months. Contacted Waterpik who advised me not to use mouthwash in the flosser tank because there is a materials issue involving a gasket that swells because of the mouthwash ingredients . Ridiculous, I had another brand for several years with no mouthwash issues. Waterpik sent me a replacement part which I installed . I should not have to deal with a product that has gross limitations. Will never purchase a waterpik product again!</li>
            <li> Since I started using this Waterpik with the Sinus Tip on a daily basis, I have NOT have the usual sinus infections and allergy symptons that I used to have!!</li>
            <li> He seems to like it better than regular flossing.  Really has a strong motion to it.  Good machine for the price</li>
            <li> Ordered this waterpik for my mother. She loves it and the price. You will save about $30 ordering this online than in stores. The package arrived promptly too.</li>
            <li> I used the wp 100 model for over 2 years and it was time to replace it. I thought this model would be fine... MISTAKE!! The control for this is in the wand, and has too much power even on the low setting, because the pump is always running full bore. If you mis-aim, this will cut your gum, or the roof of your mouth, OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;The other issue was how loud it is. This thing makes more noise than a garbage truck backing up! It made the whole vanity shake, and you could hear it all over the house.&lt;br /&gt;Spend an extra couple bucks and get the wp100. You&#x27;ll be happier with that. I sent this one back and traded up.</li>
            <li> This waterpik flosser is very adequate, good price and reasonable durability.  Pretty simple design.  I understand that the tubing and wand can be replaced easily.  Older models the plastic tubing would get brittle and break.  There was no way to replace it except for some kind of home repair.  Otherwise the units seem to last for many, many years.</li>
            <li> Flossing is very important; but often regular string floss can miss those hard to get pieces of food.  Flossing can also irritate your gums if you are too aggressive trying to get those stringy foods loose. I grew up with a Water Pik in the 70&#x27;s.  They have updated the look; but the system hasn&#x27;t changed one bit.  It takes a little practice to not get wet as you use it; but, not having food impacted between your teeth is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I did not have any of the problems that some of the reviewers had with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I believe it does a great job of flossing your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone wanting to buy a flosser.</li>
            <li> Not as compact as my last model.  Should have included more tips.  Tips don&#x27;t attach easily--overall does a good job</li>
            <li> I had an infected molar and flossing wasn&#x27;t helping un-lodge the vile piece of hamburger meat that had worked it&#x27;s way between my teeth. This product works like a dream and my 5 yr old enjoys using it as well</li>
            <li> I thought I would go with the Waterpik name in that I have had their products in the past and got many years of use out of it.  This particular model seems to work OK at first but within 60 days the control for the different settings stops working.  You have to keep moving it from low to high to try to find one that works.  Maybe it works for a day or two but then you have to try another setting.&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten this model twice, thinking I got a bad one the first time, but the second one had the same problems.&lt;br /&gt;I am a heavy user of these devices, using it twice a day.  I would expect it would hold up to this use.</li>
            <li> Bought in April 2013.  It slowly died in February 2015.  I turned it on, the motor started, and the rpm slowly went down to zero.  It was not the switch.  I couldn&#x27;t check more.    I bought this to replace a unit I had from the 1970s (or before).  It was still working.  I bought this because it looked prettier.  I now wish I had kept the old one.  Sadly, I simply discarded it--I can&#x27;t keep everything.  Since the Waterpik idea is so good, I guess I will just have to buy another one.  I will check around first to see if there are close competitors.    There are smaller things I didn&#x27;t like.  The shape of the plastic nozzle seemed not as good.  I heated it some, bent it some, and it was much better.  Also, it leaked a little out the bottom when using, so that there was a little puddle under it when I turned it off.  This is really not a problem--water on counter surface is common.  I haven&#x27;t researched Waterpik.  My guess is that they are a very big American company that has a very good product idea and that grew to be very large.  If so, they have no excuse for not doing a lot of research to improve their product.  My experience with this one is that they made it worse.    And there is another thing about the design.  The nozzle and nozzle handle, at the end of the plastic hose, did not fit well into the holder after use.  After a while, the plastic connector on the end of the hose popped out of the handle.  As near as I could tell, it was designed to snap back it.  But it wouldn&#x27;t stay in well.  I put a heavy rubber band around it and that worked until the motor died.</li>
            <li> This particular product was recommended by my dentist. My teeth hadn&#x27;t been professionally cleaned in about 6 years. After using this Waterpik, the hygienist kept remarking how easily the plaque was coming off and how much less there was now as when she had first seen me a month before. Way to go Waterpik!! Would have bought this sooner if I&#x27;d known it would work this well!!</li>
            <li> This Waterpik Water Flosser is even better than the waterpik my daughter used 30 years ago when she had braces...</li>
            <li> Very loud, loud enough to wake up my roommate, but does a good job.  As others have recommended, starting with a lower setting will help your gums build up to being able to use the flosser at higher water pressure levels.  Would definitely recommend using it in the shower the first few times to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Excellent improvement with the curved tongue cleaner attachment. Unit is reliable, sound is the same as previous models, works well.</li>
            <li> I have used water picks for over twenty years.  My dentist is always amazed at the health of my gums.  I do not like flossing, and the water pick seems to be an excellent alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Waterpik Waterflosser about a year, and the hose crimps where it comes out of the handle, and cracked.  It crimps unless you hang it up very carefully, and I didn&#x27;t realize until too late that it was cracking.  Poor design.  Other than the hose, the machine is OK.  Noisy, but good pressure.  Our last one got too much internal mineral buildup from our hard water, but this one didn&#x27;t last long enough for that to happen.  Unfortunately, it seems like all these oral irrigators are being made at lower quality the past few years (like so many products!) and I don&#x27;t know what brand or model to try next.  Reading all these water pick reviews is depressing!</li>
            <li> Awsum excellant  what can i say its a carwash for your teeth. Would purchase again nice size also thank u</li>
            <li> I like it it works. You will bleed from the gums at the beginning just like when you start flossing. Only down fall...this is LOUD!</li>
            <li> I have owned three of these. The water hose on all three has split giving me an unwelcome spray in the face. The first two, I just threw away and purchased another. This time i&#x27;m writing to waterpic to see if they will replace it.If not, I&#x27;ll just have to buy another one. It&#x27;s great as long as it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followup: Today Waterpic sent me to a site where I could order a replacement hose.Hose is $8.99, tax .81, shipping 3.95, total 13.75. I will order because it&#x27;s cheaper than a new unit. Just a warning. If you purchase the Waterpic water flosser the hose will eventually fail.</li>
            <li> Ordered this, worked for a few weeks, then stopped working. I returned it for a new one, and it stopped working after about six weeks. Contacted Waterpik, they said I had to clean out the rubber stoppers. Did that, still didn&#x27;t work. Had this one too long to return it, so I won&#x27;t be buying another one. The older models of this type of Waterpik lasted years. New models apparently only last weeks. Stay away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this waterpik for about three years now - and my dental hygienist loves it. I just went for my six month checkup and without telling her about my &amp;#34;teeth cleaning routine&amp;#34; she said - &amp;#34;there&#x27;s nothing I can advise you on about your dental hygiene. Keep doing what you are doing.&amp;#34; She made one suggestion, that I switch the order of the four steps I follow to put rinsing with a popular whitening mouthwash first rather than second (she said that would soften the plaque for easier and more complete removal). So, here are the steps I take:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Rinse with well-known whitening mouthwash&lt;br /&gt;2. Floss&lt;br /&gt;3. Waterpik&lt;br /&gt;4. Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really works and my teeth and gums are in better shape than they have ever been in. The dentist used to probe my gums for &amp;#34;pockets,&amp;#34; not the most pleasant experience. They haven&#x27;t had to do that in three years - my gums are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the pik itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use warm water, it is more comfortable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Set it on a lower pressure when you first start using it - it can be very forceful and a little uncomfortable at first. Before long I had mine at full force with no problem at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Make sure the reservoir is pressed down tightly onto the pic so that it seals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Insert the pic in your mouth and lean over the sink before you turn it on, unless you want to hose down your bathroom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It is a little loud, but unless your baby is sleeping in the bathroom, so what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Start on the top row, far front side and slowly move the pick forward and around your teeth at the gumline. Then repeat the process on your lower teeth. I then go to the back side of my teeth and slowly pick my way across them. If there is still water left I go back and catch the front again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. When you run out of water, shut it off and empty any remaining water from the reservoir&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought flossing got all the small food particles out from between my teeth and gums. WRONG! I&#x27;m always amazed to watch the small particles (and some not so small) flow out of my mouth and into the sink when I pik. It is truly amazing how much cleaner my teeth are since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an incredible item and has health benefits far beyond just clean teeth. I&#x27;m getting one for my daughter as a gift.</li>
            <li> Had to return 1st one, stopped working after 2 uses.  Exchange very quick and no hassels.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good</li>
            <li> The old waterpik finally bit the dust.  Was going to try to repair it, but after 10 years, I figured it was time for a nice, shiny new one.  First thing I noticed was how much more powerful his unit was compared to the old one....I guess the old one had just worn down.  In any case, this new one does everything the old one did but better.  I  hope it works as long as the old one and a lot longer than the 2 year warranty...we shall see.</li>
            <li> This product more than met my expectations. I used one of the older versions, this is far superior. I like the fact that replacement parts are readily available. If this unit ever wares out I will certainly purchase another.</li>
            <li> I owned  Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser before this one, I still prefer the original it has a larger water capacity a stronger water jet stream, the more expensive one claims to have 10 PSI higher water pressure than the original I don&#x27;t believe that to be true. Each waterpik last about three years on average, I work from home so I can have the opportunity to use it after each meal or snack my dental hygienist says it&#x27;s a pleasure because I have so little oral plaque and no cavities for the last 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;It is money well spent to keep from having a cavity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Waterpik-WP-100-Ultra-Water-Flosser/dp/B000GLRREU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1359149171&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;WaterPik</li>
            <li> The Waterpik flosser is used with a sinus irrigation tip.  It works well, but is a little noisey...produces more noise than my last unit, that was 3 years old before it died.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve used one of these things, you&#x27;ll wonder how you ever lived without it.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, helps maintain healthy gums. Love it!</li>
            <li> Do not buy it! It is a real POS... Worked for about 5 minutes. Then the spray stopped dead. Pump started to smell like burning out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was plenty of water in the tank - and the tank was properly connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On occasion - a weak spray would come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Useless Junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason for 47 one-star reviews - now 48.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its going out in the trash tomorrow. If I hadn&#x27;t stupidly thrown out the box, I would have instantly returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/3/2013 Update:&lt;br /&gt;After my disasterous experience with the WP-65, I went looking for another Brand - any Brand.. Didn&#x27;t see anything I liked. There sure is an opportunity for someone to make one of these things that works..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I noticed the &#x27;kids model&#x27; WP-260 has far fewer one-star reviews as a percentage. Controls are on the housing itself (The Pressure control is continuous - not just 1-2-3..). Maybe the pump is different - as its rated 110-240 VAC. Decided to take a chance - and bought one. (Saved box this time..:&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the reservoir is smaller - it is sufficient. After four uses - it still works.. more than could be said with the WP-65. The pump is MUCH quieter. Top pressure may be slightly less than my previous old waterpik (would no longer hold a nozzle - stated blowing off everytime I used it.. reason for replacement) - but it is still high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you - like me - found the WaterPik to be the only design suitable, skip the 65 and get the 260. Maybe it will at least last a few months. (I will update again when this one fails...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10/2013 - another week, and the 260 is still working! A minor miracle..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/26/2013 - still working great! Appears this 260 &#x27;kids model&#x27; is exactly the same (except green plastic trim rather than blue) as the $79.99 WP-300 &#x27;Traveller&#x27; model... (Also well rated)</li>
            <li> But your return policy was right on no problems with the second one. Before I could send the first one back the new one was already here that was the best service, ever thanks. Sam</li>
            <li> WATERPIK DOES A GOOD JOB OF CLEANING  AFTER 1 YEAR, WATERPIK KEEPS TRIPPING MY GFIC CIRCUIT SO CANT USE IT&lt;br /&gt;WROTE TO WATERPIK AND NO REPLY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DR B</li>
            <li> My husband and I have tried many water picks over the years.  This one was the least expensive and had best overall design and performance capability.  We were so thrilled with our purchase, that we ordered another for our other home.</li>
            <li> I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A CLEAR ACRYLIC COLOR RATHER THAN BLUE.&lt;br /&gt;THIS ONE BROKE AFTER JUST 6 WEEKS OF USE. IT WILL NOT GO FULL FORCE WHICH IS WHAT IS USEFUL TO KEEP MY TEETH CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS MY 3RD ONE BOUGHT OVER 30 YEARS. OBVIOUSLY NOT AS WELL MADE AS USED TO BE. VERY DISAPPOINTING.</li>
            <li> It works good but this is a very noisy equipment.&lt;br /&gt;It bothers family while using. This is why I didn&#x27;t like the product</li>
            <li> This replaces my old one that died and works very well.</li>
            <li> Good product. Exactly what I need</li>
            <li> I use this item religiously and got this one for my granddaughter who has braces.  Biggest problem is the breaking hose problem but have now found replacement items on Amazon so it&#x27;s not such a big deal.  I do feel that WaterPik could easily correct this problem with a small spring stiffener at the handle if they wanted to but they probably would not sell as many units.</li>
            <li> Works well, is quiet unlike some other water flossers. The adjustable pressure control is great. I would definitely recommend this as it works well.</li>
            <li> waterpIk flosser, energy usage measured using a \\&quot;KILL A WATT\\&quot; meter:&lt;br /&gt;WATTS: 12.2 - 15.7&lt;br /&gt;AMPS: .24&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip for how to produce clean water, for use in a waterpIk flosser.&lt;br /&gt;my Utility water, tested with a TDS meter (Total Dissolved Solids) displaying PPM (parts per million): 165&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t make the mistake of ever using dirty water in your brand new waterpIk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use a ZeroWater ZD-010 10-Cup Pitcher, with a fresh filter, to make local utility provided water that measures 0 to 3 on the TDS meter (that comes with the pitcher).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a \\&quot;Sunbeam Hot Shot Hot Water Dispenser\\&quot;, to instantly make and dispense, a cup of boiling ZeroWater.&lt;br /&gt; To use warm, clean, pure water in your waterpIk, mix a cup of room temperature ZeroWater, with the cup of boiling ZeroWater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The healing that becomes possible, using a waterpik with warm, clean water, is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> - The best money I&#x27;ve spent in a very long time&lt;br /&gt;- Some of my teeth are very close together and it&#x27;s difficult to floss&lt;br /&gt;  This product is terrific!</li>
            <li> Does a great job of cleaning and stimulating your gums.  I reccomend this unt highly does exactly whatt it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This is my third generation Waterpik and, unfortunately, it has gone the way of the new coke fiasco. They have increased the size of the water container to the detriment of the pik. The container is too large to allow a smooth insertion of the pik into its cavity.  Also, it is much harder to insert the water container for use.  I can see that this one will not last very long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the usual waterpick.Lower end of the water massagers.inexpensive but does the job.Did not come with any extras which I had to buy later such as the deep cleaning adapters.</li>
            <li> It is great, I love it!  I Hope my teeth agree, lol. It was reccomended to me by my dentist.</li>
            <li> My old, brand X, water flosser died after about 5 years of near daily use.  I bought this Waterpik to suppliment my daily routine of manual flossing + waterpik + brush after every meal.  I love the way it pulses and cleans stuff out that is trapped between your teeth.  My old flosser did not work very well, even when it was new - but I didn&#x27;t know it until I bought this unit to replace it.  It pays to stay with the name brand, Waterpik.  Update - my unit failed after less than two months.  Waterpik sent me a new unit, but since the first one failed so quickly, I can no longer recommend them. 2nd update:  the replacement unit failed after one month of use - definitely not a quality item you can depend on.  I RATE THIS AS DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Failed after 2 uses.&lt;br /&gt; I had the older version of this model and it lasted for 7 years before beginning to leak.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little too noisy but it does a good job. We feel like the price was good and the poduct works well.</li>
            <li> I have always used waterpik,,and this one works just as well as any that I have owned,,,I love water piks,,,,better than flossing</li>
            <li> While I regard this method essential to my dental health because of consequential gingivities without it,&lt;br /&gt;the MATERIAL BUILD QUALITY IS POOR. HOSES WILL CRACK NEAR THE PULSATOR UNIT, IT IS INEVITABLE. Two cracked&lt;br /&gt;within weeks of one another and I am the only one in the house who uses it. OVERPRICED for quality delivered. Wish there were alternative manufacturers!</li>
            <li> amazing, works perfect, durable and does what is suppose to do.&lt;br /&gt;100% recomended.&lt;br /&gt;buy two, not one it is worth having a few of this for the family.</li>
            <li> At recommendation of my dentist I have been a Waterpik user for over 25 years, and am never disappointed with the product.  Good price at Amazon, no hassle swift delivery.  After removing the tip, the lid can cover the works for ease of traveling with this indispensable tool for removing all the small bits of food that stick between and behind the teeth. Multiple power levels in blue slider on handle. I don&#x27;t use the other tips so cannot comment on them; the one tip is all I need daily. Highly recommend this for anyone who has any gaps between teeth or implants that harbor food particles. Not noisy. Tips remove easily.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I had a Waterpik in high school that I got because I had braces.  I continued to use it after I got them off until my brother helped himself to it when he moved out.  Fast-forward quite a few years to now.  I brush and floss but felt like my teeth just weren&#x27;t as clean as they should be so I bought this Waterpik.  It is still basically the same as my old one except this one has a lot more power and comes with a tongue cleaner.  It is so perfect!  I drink a fruit smoothie for breakfast in the morning and a kale smoothie at night.  I use it twice a day after smoothie time and this thing blasts out all of the little fruit and vegetable bits hiding in my mouth and leaves my teeth sparkling clean.  I have it on a middle setting and cannot imagine needing (or being able to stand) a higher setting.  They should really consider using that higher setting to mine diamonds.  The first few times you use it you will make a big mess until you get a system established.  I just hang my head over the sink and blast away until the reservoir is empty.  The higher you set the power the quicker you will go through your water.  I put a little peroxide in my water for extra cleaning, but you certainly do not have to.  The tongue cleaner didn&#x27;t seem to do much so I only do that once a day.  If you have a friend with dragon breath buy them one and tell them that you enjoyed it so much you wanted them to have one, too.  It will make both of you happy.  Happy cleaning!</li>
            <li> I have had the same experience as many of the people who bought this product.  (Full disclosure: I bought mine at a well known brick n mortar chain, not at Amazon.)  It broke after only three months--one day the water just wouldn&#x27;t come out of the end of the tube no matter what I did. The engine was running but no water; then the motor stopped too. 50 bucks for three months of operation is definitely a gyp!</li>
            <li> I have used this every night since it was delivered. There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it is very quick and easy to use. I am incredibly happy with this purchase and it has gotten me to commit to flossing, something I could never ever do with string flossing.</li>
            <li> The pressure is great - nice that you have various settings.&lt;br /&gt;Nice to have different types of attachments, but I prefer the basic one.&lt;br /&gt;Love that you can detach the canister for cleaning and filling purposes.&lt;br /&gt;The canister is quite a bit larger than is needed.</li>
            <li> Oral irrigators are clearly beneficial for the gums, and the WaterPik brand seems to provide a stronger flow than others I have tried, and is more satisfactory to use.  The reservoir seems to seat securely on this model, and water did not leak on the counter, which has been a problem with other models and brands in the past.  I have been very pleased with this WaterPik&#x27;s performance until now.  However, after barely five months of less-than-daily use without any problem, this model suddenly failed.  No matter how firmly seated the reservoir, it would not pump water despite chugging away, and then the motor stopped altogether.  My previous WaterPik, the WP-100 &amp;#34;Ultra Flosser,&amp;#34; failed similarly.  Though WaterPik seems to offer better irrigating performance than other brands when the products work, I am beginning to believe that WaterPik&#x27;s quality and durability are poor, and I wish there were a higher quality, good-performing alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Waterpik! Nothing makes your mouth cleaner! My husband and I used one for years. It finally gave out and had to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind rating it but don&#x27;t write reviews. Please quit requiring this. If If you expect me to write reviews and try to tell me how many words to use. I&#x27;ll stop altogether&lt;br /&gt;MHB</li>
            <li> I had one years ago but lost it in a move.  To replace it, I got one of those rechargable portable waterpiks.  I ended up having to come back here and purchase the full size model as the portable one was not only super messy, but not as effective or easy to move as the original.  Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> It works great. Has several settings for pressure. My gums have improved since I&#x27;ve started using it.&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing I don&#x27;t care about it, it&#x27;s loud. Not a problem, little to put up with for my healthy gums.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t like to floss, this product is the perfect &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;! Have teeth that are close together? Waterpik flosser cleans every nook and cranny so cuts down on hidden food particles that cause decay! This also keeps gums healthy and plague build up at bay. Reduces and reverses gingivitis. If you love healthy teeth and gums, I suggest purchasing this small appliance! Price is right!&lt;br /&gt;Start your way for the best of oral care at home and buy one of the these and see the difference it makes!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a very old Waterpik.  The new one does not have as much pressure when flossing which is fine with me as the old one could really sting if you didn&#x27;t adjust it just right.  I am pleased with the new one and my hygienist is pleased with me</li>
            <li> I like it as its suitable for many ages, come with good package and nice item, would order again. Thx</li>
            <li> This type of machine should be recommended to everyone by their dentist. I don&#x27;t know why they are not.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every time I eat at home. I use it as a third step after first flossing with dental floss and brushing.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth and gums are in great shape for being over 60.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest fear with this machine is the weakest part of the design, which is that the tubing, which can break or split and then it is very hard to replace. Every time I use it I wonder if the tubing will break, but overall it is definitely worth getting some type of waterpik. The last one I had lasted for a few years before the tubing broke. You can buy replacement tubing, but it is almost impossible to put on. I particularly like this brand. If you are considering a waterpik, I say get it! :)</li>
            <li> This is my second one my first one finally gave out after about 8 yrs so well worth the investment. I bought a cheaper off brand one it did last two months. I have deep gums where the wisdom teeth were pulled and this gets this area clean. I never have much plaque build up or need intense cleaning. I add a little mouth wash to kill any germs, and it keeps my mouth bright and clean between dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> So far has been a reliable and useful product. I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li> This is the second waterpik I&#x27;ve received and both of them stopped working within two weeks.  Spend more and get one that will last longer than two weeks.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and efficient, this machine replaced a battery-operated water pik which only lasted a little over a year.  I think its simplicity will mean it is hardier, and the various settings for power are very helpful.  (I wish there were a cover over the water tank, but that&#x27;s a small quibble.)</li>
            <li> Have used unit for several years. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Typical Waterpik product. I have used this product for many years now.  I would find it hard to switch to another brand.</li>
            <li> i bought this because my dentist suggested it for when i got braces. it has been a great help. i have never been a good flosser and this has been my friend</li>
            <li> I have used many waterpiks over the years and liked all, unfortunatley not this one.  It is very noisy and the pressure gauge goes from too low at lowest setting to too much and next low setting.  There is no good in between setting as all others are way too strong.</li>
            <li> If you have crowns or veneers in your mouth, you NEED a waterpik. I have both and use this every day.</li>
            <li> the switch is not working already</li>
            <li> Unbelievably good product. I have a Braun toothbrush and AFTER using it I use the flosser and so many more food particles come out. My dentist is very impressed on how much healthier my gums are now I have been using it for 6 months.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only waterpik I will ever use.</li>
            <li> Works well I think, though it&#x27;s embarrassingly loud in my opinion. I&#x27;m not sure what I expected as far as noise goes but I&#x27;d rather be a noisy neighbor for a few minutes than not water floss my teeth</li>
            <li> My old one finally gave out after 20 years of service!  It was noisy but worked great.  The new unit has a little more pressure and a lot more quitter.  Great item for the price.</li>
            <li> We have a 25 year old water pik and a 5 year old one in a different bathroom. Guess which one fails? The new one. Every time I turn it on, there&#x27;s a 90% chance there&#x27;ll just be a buzzing sound. If you bang it against the counter and suck on the hose while it&#x27;s buzzing, the motor might start spinning (or it might not). then you can put the reservoir on and do your thing. Other than that major offense, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth one of these I&#x27;ve bought in 14 years so it has about an average life span of about 3and one half years;depending on how many in the household use this very good product.Why would I have bought 4 of these!</li>
            <li> Lasted 2 weeks Return for and second one and that lasted 2 weeks. No suction, very loud bought Waterpik ultra water been a month now works great</li>
            <li> Hard to get the resevoir to seal and to get the fluid to flow and now the motor runs w/out creating pressure. Get something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Waterpik WP-60 user for the last 25 years, and in spite of the fact that I usually had to replace the unit every 4-5 years (either the hose or the pump wore out), I kept going back to it because it did a decent job flossing.  So, when my last purchase died a month ago, I went ahead and ordered one with the reasonable expectation that this 2012 edition would be pretty much the same as the older ones.  DEFINITELY NOT.  Some yahoo at WaterPik decided to cut corners and &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; on it, and by doing that they totally screwed it up.  Waterpik should be ashamed to even put this item on the market.  So, what is wrong with the flosser?  The fact that it weighs about half of the old one should&#x27;ve been the first tell-tale sign that something is going to be messed up.  Sure enough, the wattage has gone down to half of what it used to be and consequently there is just not enough pressure to do any decent job.  I hate it and am going to return it and feel screwed for even having to pay for  shipping it back.  I used it only once, but it was once too many.  SHAME, SHAME.</li>
            <li> This is one of the earlier versions of the Waterpik.  Bought it to replace one that was 15 years old.  Sturdy and built to last.  Love, love, love it!  The newer versions are cheaply made and flimsy.</li>
            <li> works great, leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean, easy to use. every thing is included no need to purchase any thing else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only way that my mouth feels really, truly refreshed in the morning - that is to say, my teeth and tongue do not taste either like morning grossness, nor does it taste like toothpaste or mouthwash, and instead my mouth simply feels clean with the use of this product.</li>
            <li> A must have for oral health.  You can not get a better cleaning &amp; gum masssge with any other device.  Your dental bills will decrease if used regularly.</li>
            <li> Great product, lot of pressure.  Can feel and see the great difference it makes on your teeth and gums. Very useful especially if you have bridgework done.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th waterpik over several decades.  Use it every evening and never have an issue. Noticeably, the design has barely changed.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the old model (which was really excellent) but the competing products are worse.&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as the old model (which was really excellent) but the competing products are worse.</li>
            <li> I have used Waterpik products since 1979. Since the manufacturing went to China the quality has consistently declined. This unit lasted 2 months before it died. Are you kidding me......2 months! Bring manufacturing back to America where people actually care about the products they make.</li>
            <li> I have used Teledyne Waterpiks for many years.  This unit works fine.  It is a lot lighter than past models.</li>
            <li> It is still running after months of use.  It cleans my teeth pretty well.  Seems it will run for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> This is a super product that works well.  We wore out our first one, but clearly had gotten our monies worth.  This is a little loud but the results are great.  Want to keep those teeth for many years.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This gets more gunk out than my flosser at times. However, if you use it on a high setting and have fillings, be forewarned.</li>
            <li> I just bought this from Bed Bath and was really looking forward to getting started on my journey back to gum health . Set it up on my counter and as you can see from the image ,the water container has no lid . Crazy!  They make something to remove bacteria ,with something that can cause bacteria. I&#x27;m returning it for the Platinum . It comes with a lid. I sure don&#x27;t need ,or want the junk that the water container can attract . I hope this helps you in your decision making . Wish someone would have warned me .</li>
            <li> Waterpiks don&#x27;t last forever and this new one is the best I have ever had.  Years ago I took mine to a repair place but they are all gone.  The little motor gives out and they are really worth the price.</li>
