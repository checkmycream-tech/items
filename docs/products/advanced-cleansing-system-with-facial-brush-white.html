            <li>The best part the strength of cream is not over powering</li>

            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best quality</li>
            <li>Very impressed!  </li>
            <li>The bummer was that it takes batteries, but I bought rechargeable and am happy as a clam!</li>
            <li>olay profesional is the best</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It seems ideal for people like myself who have combination skin!  </li>
            <li>An excellent product.  </li>
            <li>So now I get the best of both worlds, with my higher-quality cleaner and my Pro-X.    </li>
            <li>This is the best cleaning system I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this product is best for unclogging pores and preventing blackheads.  </li>
            <li>This has a reusable head (great!)</li>
            <li>This is the best beauty purchase I made in 2011.</li>
            <li>With the three products I have seen great results!</li>
            <li>Best price I had seen on this.</li>
            <li>for what i paid for this for my wife, it has been excellent.</li>
            <li>I am very happy.</li>
            <li>/pm cleanser is Aveeno&#x27;s ultra calming cleansing cream, which works wonderfully with this device.  </li>
            <li>It feels wonderful....</li>
            <li>However, Olay is the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>Excellent value too.</li>
            <li>I adore this product because it works so well and feels so awesome on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>This has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li>The best result I saw was the nose and chin area:</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the cleanser.</li>

            <li>it is perfect.</li>
            <li>but I use Oil of Olay and it works great!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>

            <li>I was soo impressed that I immediately returned my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I was going to buy the $150 one, but the Olay one is awesome</li>
            <li>For best results, replace the brush head every 3 months or sooner if bristles become deformed.    </li>
            <li>I ordered this instead and am very happy.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research to find the best face scrubber, the clearasonic was named the best</li>
            <li>My skin looks the best</li>
            <li>But the best part is the massage that my face gets - it feels like a spa treatment every time I use it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>Great price!</li>
            <li>I was concerned about the quality of this product when comparing the price to others but it is great!  </li>

            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels wonderful afterwards.</li>

            <li>The brush is perfect!</li>
            <li>The combination seems to be excellent - this brush and the cleanser.</li>

            <li>I especially love the price tag of this rather than spending over $100 on the clarisonic.</li>

            <li>Works as intended - great price and quality.</li>
            <li>i also started using this with another cleanser, Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub and it works great.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of removing makeup.</li>
            <li>I feel it does a great job at cleansing my face.  </li>
            <li>every 6-7 months and every time I go my lady says how great my skin is, so if a dermatologist says it...</li>
            <li>Honestly, it is the BEST beauty purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say...</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m happy to tell both them and all of you.</li>
            <li>If you can spare the cash to purchase this, great.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it three weeks now, and my face feels and looks great.</li>
            <li>I am quite happy with this</li>
            <li>A great travel size too.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the chin and nose.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>This is great.  </li>
            <li>Great alternative to the pricy ones in the department stores or makeup specialty stores.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Given it 4 stars because I have heard great things about it but haven&#x27;t yet tested it out.</li>
            <li>I knew it was a matter of time that someone would come up with this great product.</li>
            <li>She is really happy with it.  </li>
            <li>, it is great for the shower.    </li>
            <li>This one is a great deal</li>
            <li>and I believe it has done a GREAT job.</li>
            <li>It is a great dupe for the clarasonic if you don&#x27;t have the money to spend .</li>
            <li>Great value if you think about the amount we ladies spend on face products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I decided to try this one instead.  </li>
            <li>great-</li>
            <li>This is a great value.</li>
            <li>This product is great to increase circulation to the skin without stressing my skin.  </li>
            <li>This Cleansing System works great</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>The brush does a great cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I was always blessed with great skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s diminished outbreaks greatly</li>
            <li>Great value and great product.</li>
            <li>It is a great product, and I don&#x27;t often leave rave reviews.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>I did buy one that had to be returned because the brush wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;click\\&quot; onto the unit, but amazon was great with the return.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at removing makeup and my pores look cleaner, but they haven&#x27;t reduced in size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy camper.    </li>
            <li>I am happy that the unit is waterproof, so I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating cleanser is great  </li>
            <li>The brush system itself is great and withstands use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>2013- Still working great.</li>
            <li>made it a joy to use.</li>
            <li>The olay microdermabrasion kit is also great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for cleaning</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and looks great.  </li>
            <li>Combine that with the dollar amount and oyu know you get two great things in one.</li>
            <li>and when I did I was so happy</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the problem of water leaking into the housing while using it in the shower (that another reviewer experienced).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced problems with my skin reacting to its use, although I use it every day twice a day.</li>
            <li>Great results.  </li>
            <li>The product does a great job of cleansing my face and stands up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li>So yes, for $20, the Olay cleanser is great, but if you&#x27;re looking for the effects of the Clarisonic, this isn&#x27;t a substitute.g for the effects of the Clarisonic, this isn&#x27;t a substitute.</li>
            <li>I had heard great things but even at the cheaper price of the Mia</li>
            <li>However, at the Olay price point, I&#x27;m 100% happy with this product</li>
            <li>but I use it 3 or 4 times a week with great results.  </li>
            <li>Since then, the blackheads where my glasses sit under my eyes, my chin and my nose are showing great improvement.  </li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for two weeks and skins feels great.</li>
            <li>and im happy I did..</li>
            <li>I use it two to three times a week, and it has been great so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for travel!&lt;br /&gt;Water proof so it can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>Works great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Great price and daughter loves it works great</li>
            <li>The reason I purchased this machine from Olay was the price differential (30 dollars is a great buy).  </li>
            <li>LOL...</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Having used both the Clarasonic and Olay Pro X, I can honestly say that I am very impressed at the Olay brush, considering it costs 1/5 the price of the Clarasonic.</li>
            <li>but this product works great.</li>
            <li>Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Totally waterproof.</li>
            <li>Great price and use it one or two times a week.</li>
            <li>However, I am definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Even my Esthetician has been commenting on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>My skin stayed looking great</li>
            <li>The cleansing system itself is great ...</li>
            <li>She tells me it works great, hence the 5 stars.</li>
            <li>and it still works great.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so great after I use it..</li>
            <li>Its great to keep in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning pores.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>A washcloth might, but it won&#x27;t do a great job.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I read the great reviews and thought it would work wonders on my skin.  </li>
            <li>it leaves the face feeling great</li>
            <li>I think pro x does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li>but I used a great hydrating moisturizer after that</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels great</li>
            <li>I then switch to the slower speed which is a great feature.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I cant even tell you how great this product is.</li>
            <li>And what a great price you cant beat it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>I am happy to have bought this.</li>
            <li>the product that came with the brush wasn&#x27;t too great either.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>the face wash they send with the brush isn&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, and I am extremely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Great gift idea for teenagers too.</li>
            <li>I think the value is great for the price.</li>
            <li>However, considering how I&#x27;ve been so absolutely happy with the pro-x products (lotions, creams, treatments), I convinced myself to try this out.</li>
            <li>Great for the price.</li>
            <li>I just know that this battery powered device is great.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Boots No 7 skincare line and receive a lot of compliments on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li>Great gift idea for teenagers too.</li>
            <li>great brush and does the job of cleaning off my makeup..</li>
            <li>It does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great alternative.</li>
            <li>Great customer service.</li>
            <li>Great power.</li>
            <li>I think this product does a great job.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>Great addition to my life.</li>
            <li>This is a great cleansing system.  </li>
            <li>and now my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>But for the price I paid, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>a great value.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>This is great for deeper cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I use this once a day and have seen great results.</li>

            <li>This thing is great.</li>
            <li>I have always been an Olay fan, and this cleanser has worked great for me</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Also has done a great job of smoothing out the texture and has evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It is not as great as they advertised it.</li>
            <li>but I didnt feel a great chance.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>I will not be getting the Clairsonic because I am so happy with the results from this (and my skin was ultra-funky).</li>

            <li>It works great for me.</li>
            <li>Great value and works well.  </li>
            <li>like I said great water resistant and also the cream</li>

            <li>Feels great.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a cleaner in a tube that works great.</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser brush at a great price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen great results.</li>
            <li>I still use my exfoliator stuff because it feels great</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>and I find this does a great job on your skin.</li>
            <li>The attachments and face wash make this a great bargain.</li>
            <li>Wife used this product, and thought it was great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still running great.</li>
            <li>I got it for a great price on here too.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Both items are great.</li>
            <li>I had a higher-end one that worked great before</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>I can bring it in the shower with me too which is great</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I purchased this item.</li>
            <li>I heard some great reviews of the Olay cleaning system, and decided to invest in one - knowing that if it didn&#x27;t work, I wasn&#x27;t out $200.</li>
            <li>The handheld cleansing system works great.  </li>
            <li>must buy if your looking for a great  face cleaning system</li>
            <li>Great concept, ineffective because of the loss of power with the tiniest pressure.  </li>
            <li>i have heard great things about this cleansing system</li>
            <li>Great before an evening out.</li>
            <li>anyways, I had great skin as a kid.</li>
            <li>This was perfect, it cleaned amazingly and lasted months.</li>
            <li>this is great for the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for any cleanser.</li>
            <li>I read all these great reviews on the Olay knock off and I agree</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great for a $30 product, however IT DOES NOT COMPARE TO CARISONIC.</li>
            <li>and it felt great.</li>
            <li>but this is a cheaper comparison and works great.</li>
            <li>Also, I got a great deal on Amazin for it $12.99 in comparison to the one I bought from Target in sale for $24.08.</li>
            <li>it works great, havent any problems.</li>
            <li>great product and sell</li>
            <li>It does a great job on exfoliating and</li>
            <li>I was so happy I could buy this cleanser instead of paying the $200 for the Clarisonic version.</li>
            <li>Cleanser is great too</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>I love this my face feels awesome</li>
            <li>The most impressive result of using this cleansing system is the effect it has on pores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product and I ordered more of the sample cleanser that came with it.</li>
            <li>Although my pores aren&#x27;t perfect afterwards, they are so much better</li>
            <li>Affordable and effective!</li>
            <li>My face feels wonderful after using this with my Mary Kay products :)  </li>
            <li>the speed is good and feels great on the face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The included Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser is good but not that great</li>
            <li>I love this product and how wonderful it makes me feel about my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard good thing about the Olay ProX brush &amp; am happy I took a chance.  </li>
            <li>An excellent object I am glad I tried.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product and recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a reason to pay more for another brand of brush, this one works great!</li>
            <li>Something with more of a texture works best.</li>
            <li>After two weeks I can tell a remarkable difference.  </li>
            <li>I have never had the kind of skin that \\&quot;glows.\\&quot; I want to glow, damnit!</li>
            <li>an excellent product, I love it.</li>
            <li>It has two speeds for greater control and is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>Just trying to give a fair evaluation as I love skin care products that deliver!!</li>
            <li>Shipment was great, very good price and work so awesomely love it</li>
            <li>, I also enjoyed that it came with 2 Duracell batteries which is awesome because everyone knows Duracell is a good brand of batteries.</li>
            <li>My face does feel smoother and it is a pleasant experience</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly suprised -no redness, rawness and when looking into my 10X mirror, no skin debris in my pores.</li>
            <li>It was tingly but not in a pleasant way.</li>
            <li>Literally the best way to clean your skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and it has been greatly beneficial to my complexion.  </li>
            <li>This product was delivered very quickly and works wonderful!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use and perfect size!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect, lightweight and easy to hold compared to the name brand version.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and does an excellent job of cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li>Buy a good cleanser, toner, a mask to control the oil in the warm seasons, this beautiful product, and a good moisturizer for afterwards because the brushing does cause drying.</li>
            <li>Buy a good cleanser, toner, a mask to control the oil in the warm seasons, this beautiful product, and a good moisturizer for afterwards because the brushing does cause drying.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use!  </li>
            <li>and my face looks amazing and feels great.</li>
            <li>Those kind that vibrate are incredible and amazingly effective.</li>
            <li>Ladies love it great way to express your legs,face,and if you want to keep your body looking great.</li>
            <li>(I have to use benzoyl peroxide 2.5% every day to keep my skin from huge breakouts but even that regimen has never made my skin as great as this brush has done!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for a great price-- much better price than the Clarisonic version.</li>
            <li>This is really good product</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Olay brush for two months now, once a day before bed with an acne wash, and I can say that my skin has not felt this good since before puberty hit.  </li>
            <li>It was a good purchase though and does come with a cleanser.</li>
            <li>This product is really good for the price.</li>
            <li>but it is good for the money..</li>
            <li>My skin feels really good after using this system and I would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a good thing--</li>
            <li>Works like it should - for the price a good deal.</li>
            <li>Using the one provided is a good product though.</li>
            <li>I loved that olay had this option for $30 as opposed to the $100 alternatives.</li>
            <li>I found the Olay to be just as good.</li>
            <li>Works really good.</li>
            <li>was good</li>
            <li>Just breathe and have a good attitude.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them, so I can&#x27;t compare, but this is a good product.</li>
            <li>This is a good option if you&#x27;re considering one.  </li>
            <li>Well, it feels good.</li>
            <li>Quite good.</li>
            <li>For this price, it is good.</li>
            <li>I feel it was a good investment.</li>
            <li>Of course, Olay knows how to make a good product.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li>the gadget itself is good.</li>
            <li>Good brush for the price.</li>
            <li>And I use my own cleanser instead of the one provided, the results are just as great.</li>
            <li>Good battery life  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the good news:  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It feels so good while you&#x27;re using it</li>
            <li>It definitely is superior.     </li>
            <li>The reviews were good</li>
            <li>Good design...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved to exfoliate</li>
            <li>Then my wise daughter reminded me I&#x27;m using an exfoliant gel and to just let the gel work around with the brush and do its job.  </li>
            <li>I had loved the cleanser sample that had came with it</li>
            <li>To be fair, I &#x27;ll add to this review after I&#x27;ve used the brush</li>
            <li>Seemed like a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so good after I use it.</li>
            <li>Its been working good for a year now, and i drop it ever time</li>
            <li>seems to be fairly resistant to shower water and steam.</li>
            <li>the good brand to.  </li>
            <li>a good deal for around $20.</li>
            <li>A good product.</li>
            <li>Good purchase for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold in my hand and the size of the brush is perfect for every area of my face, even around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is good product.</li>
            <li>Feels good.</li>
            <li>For this price, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>The scrubbingfelt really good.</li>
            <li>durable and good device</li>
            <li>It performs as promised at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just loved this product.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>The price is good also.  </li>
            <li>For the price appears to be a good purchase.</li>
            <li>This in conjunction with a good skincare regimen will do wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li>This feels really good combined with the olay cleanser</li>
            <li>I use a good moisturizer when I am done.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>so it looks like it was a good buy</li>
            <li>While this product worked well for a good amount of time, it no longer powers on.</li>
            <li>It came in good condition.</li>
            <li>The person who received it said she loved it</li>
            <li>As good as an &amp;#34;outside spa&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and my skin has never looked this good since I was a baby</li>
            <li>This was a gift and the person loved it</li>
            <li>Fair warning-</li>
            <li>but it is a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li>God is so good</li>
            <li>It feels so good on your skin, and yes I had an immediate glow afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I believe $30 is a good price for it.</li>
            <li>Its a good purchase.</li>
            <li>This product is good for a while</li>
            <li>I wanted to splurge and buy the Clarisonic, but I decided to give this one a try because of the price and the good reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for in home facials.</li>
            <li>What I like about the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System is that it is the perfect tool for skin cleansing.</li>
            <li>I have used Philosophy&#x27;s microderm abrasion products for years, so I know when my face gets a good exfolliation.  </li>
            <li>A good comparison of the difference between the Olay and a pricier Clarisonic is, the Clarison is like a Sonicare toothbrush, whereas the Olay is like a Colgate spin brush.  </li>
            <li>Both are equally good in quality.</li>
            <li>It is a good system for cleansing the skin and is affordable.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>I suppose by now, I have just gotten used to it feeling good</li>
            <li>Just as good as a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Though, for the price, it is a good budget brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to use an exfoliate with abrasive particles with this unit, it may damage your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t about to cough over hundreds for the Clarisonic version, so I was thrilled to see this item and its great reviews.</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro-X spin brush does a fair job.</li>
            <li>just use a good face wash and moisterizer</li>
            <li>This is good as well</li>
            <li>Good priced too.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: Good value for the money.</li>
            <li>I loved this when I got it.</li>
            <li>Good but cheaper at cvs</li>
            <li>Does a good job cleaning my face with a minimum of effort from me.  </li>
            <li>It is a self contained unit and is fairly water-proof.  </li>
            <li>pair this with a fog free mirror in shower for best use.</li>
            <li>Pricing is good and the added $3 coupon is a bonus.</li>
            <li>I still feel I get a good exfoliation with it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s for good reason, because I keep this in the shower</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a basis of comparison (clarisonic) but this does a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s have the Clarisonic Mia, and we believe this brush is almost as good.  </li>
            <li>I expect good results.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Clarisonic, and I can say that you will get results that are as good with the Olay as you will with Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>And you still get good results, so again, for the price, the Olay wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note - don&#x27;t \\&quot;grind\\&quot; it into your face.  </li>
            <li>I use the Olay cleanser because it is a really good exfoliator and works well with the pro x, but I don&#x27;t use their cream.  </li>

            <li>Good price.</li>

            <li>Over the weekend, I noticed my skin was looking really, really good</li>
            <li>I had a clarisonic given to me as a gift, but it broke &amp; as much as I loved it</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if this was a good product &amp; if it made a visible difference</li>
            <li>I purchased this hoping that it would work just as good as the clarisonic mia.</li>
            <li>good product...</li>
            <li>good price</li>
            <li>I figured I could have my dad, who&#x27;s good with electronics since he used to be an electronic technician, take a look at it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for pores.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for pores.</li>

            <li>Olay made a good product here</li>
            <li>I used the included cleanser and loved it as well.</li>
            <li>A fair priced replacement of clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Just give it a good scrub with your fingernails between bristles every once in a while.</li>
            <li>but it good for the price.</li>
            <li>When I started to use this, I consider this to be good.</li>
            <li>This is quite good for the money.  </li>

            <li>Good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works just as good as a $200 product for cheaper .</li>
            <li>My husband suggested that I give it a try, just by looking at it, I was feeling not so good about it.  </li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>GOOD JOB OLAY.</li>
            <li>When I found a good deal on th Olay Profressional Pro-X, I figured, what do I have to lose?</li>
            <li>My skin has not looked this good in years.</li>
            <li>But if it is that good, it would be the holy grail of skin care.</li>
            <li>This product is a good value.</li>
            <li>Have not found this product to be as good as the hype surrounding it.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and works good.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anybody who needs a good scrub and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>but for the price its a good value</li>
            <li>It is just as good as  the $200 model.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good one like this ,</li>
            <li>i heard lots of good things about this product ..</li>
            <li>it is really good.</li>
            <li>PRICE IS GOOD ALSO.</li>
            <li>It feels good when I hand it.</li>
            <li>Not so good.</li>
            <li>Otherwise , everything is good .I</li>
            <li>So, I really loved having olay pro X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good change on face within 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I loved this device .</li>
            <li>Just as good</li>
            <li>While researching, I stumbled upon this and thought it would be a good thing to try out.  </li>
            <li>It feels soooo good to use and improves the look and feel of my face.</li>
            <li>I bought this product figuring it would be good for the circulation of the skin, which it is.</li>
            <li>My daughters loved the brush but the switch started to not work after 1 week.</li>
            <li>Good customer service, but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good buy not bad;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really good  </li>
            <li>brush feels good</li>
            <li>I think this does a good job cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>but I think my results have been so good with the cleanser that came with it, I will stick to using just this for</li>
            <li>I loved the way it made my skin feel immediately afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I loved it till it stopped rotating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush cleansing system is really good.</li>
            <li>but I think it will be a good product for me.</li>
            <li>and they were all good</li>
            <li>and I was really good at keeping it out of the water (which I am not).</li>
            <li>Feels good too.</li>
            <li>Good try though.</li>
            <li>The good part is..</li>
            <li>good stuff~</li>
            <li>so it might not as good as Clarisonic~  </li>
            <li>I like it, the price is good.</li>
            <li>but I use a lot of cleansers and they work good with this piece of work.</li>
            <li>it was on sale, and had heard good things about these cleansing products.</li>
            <li>I have a Clarisonic and thought this would be a good travel alternative.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>and yet my skin feels so good after using it.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again, replacement heads seem fairly priced as well.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for a good inexpensive alternative to the Clarisonic Mia give this a try.</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was a good investment (I have not tried the Mia</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>its a good product, needs a stronger motor.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the Clarisonic and way cheaper.</li>
            <li>My skin feel soooooo good.  </li>
            <li>Purchased it for my mom, she loved it and uses it every night.</li>
            <li>this brush DOES NOT remove all the blackheads...which is surprising b/c</li>
            <li>off good</li>
            <li>I would never spend $100+ on a Clarasonic brush, when this is just as good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This brush did a good job.</li>
            <li>ALWAYS HAD GOOD SKIN, BUT</li>
            <li>The price was really good</li>
            <li>I loved this product.  </li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I am over age 65plus and have always taken good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>In addition, this a good price.</li>
            <li>whether that is a good thing or not, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>He loves it, and I have to say his face is looking really good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use makeup, but I do appreciate a good exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how good</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>and she expressed that this was a good choice as well as she has used both the Clarisonic and this item.  </li>
            <li>I use my own cleanser or scrubbing grains and it works great for at home microdermabrasion type scrub for the skin.  </li>
            <li>Really good for cleaning makeup and for the price which is really good.</li>
            <li>I can always leave one in the shower, and one by the jacuzzi, so I never forget to have a good cleansing product around.  </li>
            <li>This cleaning system is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Good for milia...</li>
            <li>I used it on the highest of the two settings and loved the amount of exfoliation it gave me.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.  </li>
            <li>A really good value.</li>
            <li>Good thing Amazon let me return it even though I used it and had thrown away the packaging.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to feel good.</li>
            <li>Everyone is commenting on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li>It felt good.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good to know.  </li>
            <li>Also good to know that you can use it under running water, so I got two, one for shower and one for sink.</li>
            <li>Teens will find it good for cleaning acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>At $20, I thought this would be a good way to try out these sort of brushes without sinking a lot of cash at once.  </li>
            <li>AND CLEANS SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this forever (about a year) and it still works good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>Feels really good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>However this does a good job.</li>
            <li>Seems to work to a good extent.</li>
            <li>what is it good</li>
            <li>NOT A CLEARASONIC BUT A GOOD STARTER PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Really good, I like it.</li>
            <li>and I LOVED it.</li>
            <li>It feels really good, and I use it every night before going to bed.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>Good product for price.  </li>
            <li>It still works just as great with my own face wash as it did with the Olay brand that came with it.</li>
            <li>I liked it the product works great</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>but this would be good for a baby-</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it cleans my sweaty face well after a good workout.</li>
            <li>Everyone loved this product.</li>
            <li>Good brush to use all the time to wash your face.</li>
            <li>Good quality and price as well.</li>
            <li>It works good for the price.</li>
            <li>The machine does a good job</li>
            <li>supplementary cream is a good product, too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember seeing it on the description, so I just conconsider it as a good bonus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s misleading for others in the sense that a good product is a good product if the value and quality are aligned.</li>
            <li>I bought this after my sister got one and loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li>It does a good job cleaning the face and neck area.</li>
            <li>I use another foam product she recommended and my skin has not looked this good in years.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product  is good and its upto my expectations.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, great results!!  </li>
            <li>Good, good and good.</li>
            <li>I thought i was doing a good job washing my face, but this product makes your face really flawless and clean.</li>
            <li>(the tingly one is my favorite,) and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li>While she wasnt overly excited to get it as a gift, she does use it every day and says thats its the best she has ever used.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true!!!</li>
            <li>Clean, exfoliated, beautiful skin for a steal of a deal price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect way to clean my face before putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect for a handheld device and it is easier to clean around your nose with it.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so wonderful and clean after I use this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like the product, it gets my face clean, but don&#x27;t expect it to make your skin perfect</li>
            <li>I like it ...dont think its exceptional but for the price i think its good</li>
            <li>A great product, again very easy on the pocket and works wonders.</li>
            <li>The facewash is nice but nothing remarkable I prefer my exfoliating creme while using this.</li>
            <li>I loved this product it made my face feel great hope to find more olay products that work as good as this</li>
            <li>and she looks more radiant and beautiful.</li>
            <li>both are great for detoxifying pores &amp; the cream cleanser skin care is great for getting rid of fine lines &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The thing is very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li>Quick results - very happy with it</li>
            <li>I am sure that the Clarisonic models are better, however, for the price, this is a great deal!      </li>
            <li>Although the brush is incredibly soft,it still provides a a nice refreshing massage to the face.  </li>
            <li>This is the best facial machine for the best price.</li>
            <li>I buy one about once every 6 months, I just wish they would lsst longer, but this one lasts much longer, is consistently great quality and works perfectly!</li>
            <li>but this product does work, if you have never had any real cleaning done to your face this is a great product, I understand that I am not the best person for information</li>
            <li>I have mild acne, but still best results than just scrubbing using my hands.</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro-X spin brush is super awesome.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the worthy buy.</li>
            <li>She is very happy with the results, we just wish it came with a better variety of heads and more cleanser.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful to use and really makes my face feel great.</li>
            <li>Super happy with my purchase and looking forward to using this all the time!</li>
            <li>Perfect product if you have cystic acne, mild acne, or a pimple here and there.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m delighted to say it&#x27;s one of my favorite purchases!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product - reasonable price!!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the cleansing effect is good!</li>

            <li>\\&quot;Olay Prof Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System\\&quot; &amp;    The ideal piece would be combining the Olay&#x27;s brush and the Conair&#x27;s mechanics.    </li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very glad that I got this.</li>
            <li>Very glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the Olay product.  </li>
            <li>It is very better for women, even though men.</li>
            <li>Ok, it&#x27;s been working GREAT on my skin.</li>
            <li>My face looks lovely, it feels great, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend $150.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with purchase</li>
            <li>This works great (love it comes with batteries).  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>and it comes off real easy.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure the rest of Olay&#x27;s Pro-X line is just as great</li>
            <li>besides that, it&#x27;s great. :)</li>
            <li>I know some people love their Clairsonic, but for the price, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>There is distinct differences after using the product for one month and I am happy with the result!</li>
            <li>I agree with the good reviews on here, its amazing and affordable.  </li>
            <li>You might just be happy with the more affordable 2 speed brush like this one.</li>
            <li>and im very satisfied with that.</li>
            <li>This product is great value for money!&lt;br /&gt;Imagine it does what a $200 or more system does in cleansing your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would prefer something with more variable speeds, but I am happy with what I got for my money.</li>
            <li>I already have a Clarisonic which I think works great, but still, being a women, I had to try this product also.  :)</li>
            <li>I use a CeraVe foaming cleanser, which I love and has greatly helped my leaning-towards-oily and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>my wife is very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I was somewhat hesitant because I wanted the Clairisonic, but I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I used the Olay pro x for 9 days and after great results I went and purchased the \\&quot;more powerful\\&quot; clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>but my skin feels great -  smooth and not greasy anymore!</li>
            <li>Great product, I added it to my face cleaning routine every night :)</li>
            <li>She liked it but not as good as Clarisonic</li>
            <li>Whats good is you can use your own face wash with this product.  </li>
            <li>After I used up the sample face wash that was included I&#x27;ve been using ones of my own and the brush still works just as good.</li>
            <li>for its good points:  it fits the hand nicely, is waterproof to use in the shower,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make it work better, just go easily over your face and you will have the best results.  </li>
            <li>You can tell your skin feels about 10x&#x27;s smoother and with the right cleanser, your skin will come out flawless from time to time.</li>
            <li>Love love this!!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this on first  -  great value for great skin!!!</li>
            <li>very good, if the product introduction can be more detail, then it would be better.</li>
            <li>Instead of looking greasy, my face almost seems to have a matte complexion (not the best explanation, but the most accurate I can think of at the moment).</li>
            <li>With all of the great reviews and the great price I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth that applying night cream is wonderful as it absorbs almost immediately and spreads more evenly too.</li>
            <li>This is ideal for anyone who appreciates a clean, smoothe complextion.  </li>
            <li>I feel that it does a good job in giving a good cleaning--definitely better than just wiping your face.</li>
            <li>My face comes and goes with breakouts - there&#x27;s just so many factors that decide if one day is going to be good and another not so good.</li>
            <li>Good product, good price, pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>Brilliant my skin has never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this product, very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I like this product so very much, it cleanses my face so awesome!!</li>
            <li>- it feels great and my skin feels so clean and exfoliated after using!</li>
            <li>My skin feels WONDERFUL immediately after using this, smooth and very clean.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>With this product, I was able to get that!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I feel so much better in my own skin!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>My face has never felt better!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad i did!  </li>
            <li>These sell for 2 1/2 times more in the store!</li>
            <li>The higher speed does an excellent job of cleasing my face in the winter as it tends to get dryer then.</li>
            <li>Conair - Love it!  </li>
            <li>So glad I did!</li>

            <li>After first using the Pro-X I can honestly say I wasn&#x27;t that impressed, however I continued to use it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use, light-weight and does a great job.</li>

            <li>Easy to find replacements heads and works great.  </li>
            <li>Excellent gentle exfoiation--an excellent price--when these items first came out they were uber-expensive at the cosmetic counters in the mall.</li>
            <li>I own one and bought two more for daughters as stocking stuffers!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely smooth skin, cleans out pores so much better than my own fingers can, leaves skin moist!!</li>

            <li>Great mild exfoliation!</li>
            <li>Since I have not tried the Clarisonic, I cannot attest to which is better, but I do know that the Olay brush has done a great job and that I am super happy with what it does for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it works for you, fine.. great product.  </li>

            <li>algae, yeasts, and goodness knows what else, so that isn&#x27;t amazing or anything.  </li>
            <li>I thought for the $200 price tag I would achieve amazing results.  </li>

            <li>This brush feels so amazing on my skin.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It is a great home device so light and wont take a space in ur bathroom</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>but it works amazingly..</li>
            <li>The compact size and readily available batteries would make this a great unit for travel.</li>

            <li>Says it leaves her skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel amazing.</li>
            <li>The brush is almost like a massage for your face, which is amazing to use in the midst of a migraine or headache.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s amazing to me.</li>
            <li>Still works amazingly for the price, eventually will upgrade to clairsonic when I have the money though.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>My face felt AMAZING after just one use.</li>
            <li>This is amazing and works almost as well as my clairsonic.</li>
            <li>good for its price, if it is provided with a lithium battery it would have been better</li>
            <li>I actually liked the way this worked on my skin, but it died after 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>The price is perfect and it really works</li>
            <li>I use my own cleanser with this.</li>
            <li>The product itself is nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li>Thrilled about the price.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice \\&quot;treat\\</li>
            <li>and it feels nice on my face.  </li>
            <li>Conair is like a nice sports car going 70 mph.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way it felt and the results.  </li>
            <li>I use it once a day in the shower for about a minute with one of my own cream cleansers.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a bag for the system to protect from contamination when not in use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use my own judgement on that.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad I bought a good thing</li>
            <li>And of course you can use it with the Olay scrub or another of your own, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it with anything</li>
            <li>It feels nice</li>
            <li>Olay sent a sample cleanser, but I&#x27;ve also used my own (not soap -</li>
            <li>The exfoliant lotion that comes with this, is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>I used my own cleanser with this in the morning and at night in the shower.</li>
            <li>I can use any kind of cleanser on the brush head.  </li>
            <li>- it is a good device to use maybe once a week, even better if once</li>
            <li>but I just prefer using my own cleanser.</li>
            <li>I had to buy my kids their own because mine kept disappearing from my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I thought before I spend all that $$ on the $$$ model, let me try the Olay to see if I liked it.  </li>
            <li>As good or better than the over priced competitor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice that it is water poof .</li>
            <li>A headband would solve that problem nicely.    </li>
            <li>So yeah, it is better than fingers and a scrub, but not as good as the reviews make you believe it is.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s kind</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handy that this product is waterproof so you can use this in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone in the family should own one.</li>
            <li>Has visibly reduced blackheads even with my own face wash.</li>
            <li>and it came with it&#x27;s own batteries</li>
            <li>I started using my own soap/cleanser</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I don&#x27;t have any fancy cleansing gadgets in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to honestly say,</li>
            <li>I immediately stopped using it and just put my own cleanser on.</li>
            <li>I immediately stopped using it and just put my own cleanser on.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a cheaper alternative to the extremely popular clarisonic, but this is just not it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I can cleanse with excellent results and save $$$ at the same time!</li>
            <li>and so I can give an honest review.  </li>
            <li>I liked that about this product.  </li>
            <li>It cleanses effectively with a one-minute use.  </li>
            <li>draw your own conclusions.</li>
            <li>does it with a gentle hand is best.     </li>
            <li>And while I liked the cleanser, and the way the Pro-X felt as I washed my face, I honestly didn&#x27;t see the point of taking the time to do this when you can just wash your face with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this kind of cleaner before spending $100+ on the Clarasonic to see if I liked it.</li>
            <li>I bought this item and liked the weight of the unit and the strength of the motor.</li>
            <li>speed veeeery nice and waterproof</li>
            <li>so I just use my own.</li>
            <li>I used the clarisonic a couple of times and I debated whether to buy my own or buy this Olay.</li>
            <li>My wife keeps blaming me that I should have not bought this kind of product.</li>
            <li>I have friends who swear by their much pricier Clarisonics, but I am very happy with this scrubber.</li>
            <li>recommend it for ease of use, brush replacement costs, freedom to use your own cleaning products and being waterproof (or resistant).</li>
            <li>I saw many good reviews about this product and wanted to try.</li>
            <li>Now, I cant compare it to a Clarisonic since I dont own one.</li>
            <li>so it can be used with any kind.</li>
            <li>I do use my own face cleanser because of the dermatitis instead of the cleanser it came with in the box.</li>
            <li>There are nice manual brushes on amazon.</li>
            <li>The cleanser it comes with is nice too.</li>
            <li>but this is good as it makes it more waterproof, I suppose.</li>
            <li>If you just need a makeup remover, this will do nicely.</li>
            <li>kind of skin care issues.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a nice luxury doesn&#x27;t not cure acne.</li>
            <li>, I threw it away and made my own.</li>
            <li>Shake it up before using and it will produce a nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Effective at cleaning surface level dirty/clogged pores</li>
            <li>I use my own cleanser of choice with the brush</li>
            <li>And effective.</li>
            <li>I have heard so many good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>like, I would rather use my own hands with a wash cloth</li>
            <li>, I am using my own face wash with it instead.</li>
            <li>Nice tool for home facials.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day, because I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s that effective.</li>
            <li>This unit was affordable and effective.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>I use my own facewash.  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job removing make-up</li>
            <li>I paid $18.99 and in my opinion I&#x27;d pay way more for something with this good in quality</li>
            <li>My face feels so much cleaner since I have been using this awesome product!</li>
            <li>Also the face cleanser that they sent with the cleansing thingy is really nice.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I thought I liked it until I purchased a Clarisonic instead.</li>
            <li>Loving this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good and probably better.</li>
            <li>Apply the exfoliant it comes with or your own.</li>
            <li>Turn water on warm.</li>
            <li>Rinse face with warm water.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 star cause its a nice machine</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the products because I use my own soaps.</li>
            <li>I have been using my own face stuff with it, not the product it came with.</li>
            <li>Used with Olay scrubs, it is effective.</li>
            <li>It feels nice, increases circulation</li>
            <li>The prouduct arrived in  a amazon prime box, nice packing with bubble paper.</li>
            <li>most things that I use from them are good.</li>
            <li>this exfoliates nicely and leaves skin glowing after 1st use.</li>
            <li>It came with a nice sized sample</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just the perfect brush, it doesn&#x27;t rotate too fast...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I use a 1:1 ratio of the exfoliating gel w/ my own face wash.</li>
            <li>nice product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be completely honest, I&#x27;ve heard and been wanting to purchase the Clarisonic Mia forever because so many people praised at how good it works.</li>
            <li>when I use this, my face feels cleaner and softer (and I use my own cleansers).  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good cleaning system and I love this one because I can use it in the shower</li>
            <li>I think it will travel nicely.</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t say which kind</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare this to the Clarisonic because I don&#x27;t own one.......yet.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Olay, for this great product!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>Good choice, the brush is soft and I massage it all over my face...works wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for cleansing your face, leaving it fresh, rejuvenated, and with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>One nice point is that this product can be used in the shower, because it is water-proof.</li>
            <li>Once per week should be a nice interval to use it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own a Clearasonic</li>
            <li>I bought my own Olay brush</li>
            <li>I use my own cleanser</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice alternative.</li>
            <li>I dont use the pro-x cream that it came with just my own face washes.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am impressed that a cleansing tool this inexpensive really does work</li>
            <li>The travel sized Olay cleanser included is a nice cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really handy to have on hand.</li>
            <li>She also liked to give me \\&quot;a makeup\\&quot;</li>
            <li>nice product to purchase.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t give it five stars because it doesn&#x27;t blow me away like I was kind of hoping for.</li>
            <li>It is good for circulation and will keep skin healthy looking</li>
            <li>This information would have been nice to know weeks ago</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to fork over all the cash for a Clarisonic just yet, so I decided I&#x27;d try this based on the wonderful reviews and reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe tomorrow when I use it, I will use my own cleanser that I am used to.</li>
            <li>Until now, I have liked Olay products, but this experience makes me loathe the brand name.</li>
            <li>Made a hit - seems to be well liked by spouse</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent cleansing power , brushes are gentle and get the job</li>
            <li>Works as good as those priced 3x more.</li>
            <li>I have not been convinced to change my toner and moisturizer, however, because the pro-x machine and olay cleanser seem to do the deed on their own.  </li>
            <li>thayer&#x27;s witch hazel rose</li>
            <li>Used twice, already loving it.  </li>
            <li>Nice cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice that there&#x27;s an inexpensive cleaning brush out there for those of us who can&#x27;t afford to spend hundreds on one.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice brush...</li>
            <li>The Olay professional scrubber for the face is good the very best.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I liked the results though.</li>
            <li>YOU CAN USED ANY KIND OF FACE CLEANSING WITH THIS PRODUCT.ITS</li>
            <li>never use this kind of product before, so no comparison.</li>
            <li>a choice of brushes would be nice .I</li>
            <li>Love Oil of Olay products but this one is not so good.  </li>
            <li>So, I thought I would start with this Olay version and upgrade if I liked it.</li>
            <li>Its nice to have 2 speeds.  </li>
            <li>I use this with my own face wash and it is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works nice to exfoliate and prep my beard before shaving.</li>
            <li>The price was affordable and it&#x27;s nice that I can use it with whatever face product I want.</li>
            <li>After each use, I wash the brush head with Hibiclens to sterilize the bristles, along with warm water.  </li>
            <li>I llke that I can use my own cleansers with it</li>
            <li>so I felt it wasn&#x27;t as effective as using my hands to exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li>: as of now, not as effective</li>
            <li>this brush along with my own cleansers have done the trick to control outbreaks</li>
            <li>but I know in my heart that this is the honest truth</li>
            <li>He tried mine out and said he liked what it did for his skin and is looking forward to getting his own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Reviewing the brush on its own, I like it</li>
            <li>I believe the Clarisonic is probably the king of these things, but I refuse to pay that kind of price.  </li>
            <li>It exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li>but it works with my own face wash.</li>
            <li>Perfect makes makeup so much easier to take off.</li>
            <li>B0085WHBHU Deluxe Shave</li>
            <li>im loving this</li>
            <li>When I got home, I purchased my own.</li>
            <li>I found that I prefer using my own brand of cleanser but the Pro-X itself</li>
            <li>I now own both the Clarisonic Mia and the Olay</li>
            <li>no cleanser seemed to work and honestly some of them made the problem</li>
            <li>I used the sample size exfoliating scrub and it was nice and non-drying although I already had the Regenerist 7 in one scrub.</li>
            <li>Did not seem to make any difference in my skin honestly.</li>
            <li>Nice however Not miracle cleaning</li>
            <li>It is like loving your face when you use it.</li>
            <li>, it feels really nice and makes washing my face convenient.</li>
            <li>Use it every day and it does a nice job of cleansing my complexion.</li>
            <li>They kind of got bent and useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I found it effective, I&#x27;d get a Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>From my own experience, it has reduced acne and pimple and I am using this with the regenerist cream cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am loving it</li>
            <li>I honestly would reach for the Clarisonic instead of purchasing this.</li>
            <li>so far, it works awesome in good price .</li>
            <li>I prefer using my own brand of soap though, not the one</li>
            <li>works just as described just use a nice face rub with it</li>
            <li>Then thought, I&#x27;m not blowing that kind of cash for something akin to an electric tooth brush for the face, &amp; gave this product a whirl instead.</li>
            <li>speed of the is just nice.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use the Olay cleanser for these results, I used my own exfoliating cleanser and it worked wonders.  </li>
            <li>And to be honest, if my unit broke after one month of use.</li>
            <li>The brush is awesome, really helps your skin feel cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li>The two speeds are nice and I use both.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish it was stronger?</li>
            <li>I love this brush it works just as good as the clairsonic</li>
            <li>The face wash that came with didn&#x27;t help at all, so i had to go a buy my own.</li>
            <li>I use the cleanser it comes with, but I also use my own (Murad).</li>
            <li>I use my own face wash that I trust.</li>
            <li>Ive also used my own cleansing lotion.  </li>
            <li>This product is the perfect tool to gently cleanse skin.</li>
            <li>I use it with my Philosophy face wash in the shower, and it leaves a nice tightening feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>imagine it might work nicely with a sugar scrub and Castile soap.</li>
            <li>I was on the search for a good cleansing brush, but didn&#x27;t feel like spending the $$$ for the most popular brand, Clairsonic.</li>
            <li>I saw this product on sale, and I liked the thought of a spinning brush.  </li>
            <li>I was really beyond impressed with this brush.</li>
            <li>It comes with some face wash, but I ended up using my own that I already had.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t purchased the scrubbing heads for this yet, but I&#x27;m sure they will be just as good as the brush head that comes with thism</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for how much I paid.</li>
            <li>but i liked it,</li>
            <li>I liked how it oscillates in circles</li>
            <li>However, it does come with its own olay product.</li>
            <li>It removed all traces of my make-up and gave my skin a nice glow when I was done.  </li>
            <li>Works great, better than most.</li>
            <li>, my skin looked so nice</li>
            <li>This is nice</li>
            <li>it feels nice on my skin, like a massage.</li>
            <li>I do not have anything to compare it to but would never spend anymore than what I did for this so with that said I do feel like my skin had a nice glow</li>
            <li>Seems perfect... fast shipper....</li>
            <li>I suggest giving it a try or even try this one to be sure you will stick to a good skin care ritual and eventually upgrade.</li>
            <li>Where I would be more inclined to believe that the Olay product were truly superior would be in the brush-heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled about this product.</li>
            <li>i bought this and liked the way it works.  </li>
            <li>nice item, nice seller.</li>
            <li>I do not use the exfoliating cleanser that came with the brush; instead, I use my own cleanser/exfoliater since I have sensitive/dry skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own a Clarisonic brush</li>
            <li>rating the Pro-X with two stars because I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cost effective.  </li>
            <li>After I moved I didn&#x27;t want to fork out the money to buy my own</li>
            <li>I liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li>I tried a a name brand department store cleansing brush, and loved it, but was looking for a more budget-friendly alternative.</li>
            <li>, it is nice to know I can still depend on a company to deliver what it boasts about.  </li>
            <li>This is a spectacular product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just thrilled with it</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day with my own cleansing product.</li>
            <li>The brush is good but it will soften even more as you use it.  </li>
            <li>I use a clarisonic, but didn&#x27;t have that kind of money to spend on a gift.</li>
            <li>This is a nice brush for the face.  </li>
            <li>Can I use my own cleanser with this product?</li>
            <li>I also like the way it feels while I&#x27;m cleaning my face, kind of like a spinning massage for my face.</li>
            <li>The cream with it is nice too.</li>
            <li>It also came with a sample of the face wash they make (however I make my own exfoliant scrub using sugar, olive oil and lemon</li>
            <li>It feels very clean after washing face with it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love, love, love it!!  </li>
            <li>Perfect power for rotation and not weak</li>
            <li>It has the greatest ability of getting my pores clean and removes more dirt from my face better than anything else.</li>
            <li>For a cheap product, it is very effective</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve popped the head off and run it through the dishwasher a couple times, and that&#x27;s been a great way to keep everything nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I think this is good to use if you wear makeup, it will help to remove it and get your face very clean.     </li>
            <li>Was quite happy with my purchase, it was worth every penny !</li>
            <li>and it works great with the Pro X to get my skin clean.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with Olay products in general and believe me when I say they are good and affordable for working women.</li>
            <li>All happy with our really clean skin.</li>
            <li>It has done a great job keeping my face clean</li>
            <li>Great way to keep a clean face and look youthful.</li>
            <li>My skin gets squeaky clean after I use it and looks really great.</li>
            <li>, I feel that it does a great job and just makes taking off make-up and getting my skin clean easier.</li>
            <li>awesome price, fast shipping! :)</li>
            <li>Works great, makes my face feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simple to use, guy friendly, waterproof, excellent results to date, &amp; makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something significant to keep myself up without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li>Clean face happy face.</li>
            <li>Works great in getting face feeling and looking clean.</li>
            <li>This is going to be great to help keep my face clean.  </li>
            <li>i feel this is a wonderful investment and a much better price than the higher priced system and does the job just as well.</li>
            <li>Great Christmas gift and keep your pores clean</li>
            <li>Feels great in use, my skin feels so clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>The Olay is a great exfoliator and my face feels so clean.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great way to exfoliate and clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, travels great, cheap price!</li>
            <li>I can say I am very, very PLEASED and SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and love the way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li>After the first use, my skin felt incredibly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling incredibly clean and refreshed!!</li>
            <li>can feel your face clean and flash!!</li>
            <li>it is ok, but not as effective as I would have liked,</li>
            <li>The warm water opens up your pores making it more effective.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product at an even more amazing price.</li>
            <li>I have never had great skin (I&#x27;ve had acne for the last decade), but this has made an incredible difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I will stick to using a facewasher and warm water every day, much more effective.</li>
            <li>Love this, pores greatly reduced, smooth skintone, no acne.</li>
            <li>The cleaner they included could have been better, probably because I&#x27;m used to much better, but good nonetheless.</li>
            <li>I received it ahead of estimated arrival date and was pleased it came with good copper top batteries and a trail size of the ProX scrub cleanser.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just looking for a quick fix to the radiance your skin lacks, then the Pro-X is great for the job.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a sample size of the Olay Pro-X exfoliating Cleanser, which is nice, but I have own my favorite products, and you can use it with any.</li>
            <li>Good size and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use, feels good, and the compact size is great for the shower/travel.</li>
            <li>Good product with easy transportation.</li>
            <li>It is easy to keep in the shower for a good face scrub.  </li>
            <li>Was super happy to find it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>that´s ok, a good piece, grand seller</li>
            <li>Super clean face, feels great!!</li>
            <li>This is the most absolute best product!  </li>
            <li>Great product for the price, works as good as some of the much pricier models.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and a good size to handle.</li>
            <li>Great product, quick ship.  </li>
            <li>Best yet, my face feels very soft and awake.  </li>
            <li>It was very easy to pop out of the box, snap the brush on, insert the batteries that come with it, push the button and use.  </li>
            <li>It is also very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use once you get the batteries in place.</li>
            <li>head falls very easily .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li>Also very easy to use  ...</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and travel with.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This one is very easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>Also, the Olay brush, I noticed, gets water inside of it very easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use in sink or shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to put together</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro-X system is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>What a marvelous surprise for my 63 year old skin!  </li>
            <li>They all love it, but my granddaughter loves it the most!</li>
            <li>i love my olay cleaning system even more than the clarisonic!</li>
            <li>it love it love it!</li>
            <li>Love, love it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend using it more than once or twice a week, but love it!</li>
            <li>I bought this cleansing system hoping it would allow me to better exfoliate and cleanse my face during my night routine, and it did THAT AND MORE!</li>
            <li>Based on the sample face wash the cleansing system came with, I&#x27;m super impressed and want to buy the full size.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this is the gentle brush tool which leaves your skin feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>As for the Olay cleansing system, it works fine and as mentioned, a good size for travel.  </li>
            <li>The brush is excellent and works great, however I use it with other scrub because the one came with the brush</li>
            <li>Works fine and feels good.</li>
            <li>and I am happy to report that this is the best $20 I have ever spent for my skin!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product &amp; it works fine, but it&#x27;s  just not what I was expecting</li>
            <li>My face looked clean, fresh and it felt so awesome.</li>
            <li>Does a great job keeping my face clean, refills are cheap too if you wait for sales!</li>
            <li>Love a great clean face this will help you get it</li>
            <li>It really does feel very good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product after reading many reviews and seeing that it was listed as the #1 best seller by Amazon.</li>
            <li>Cheap and good.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of quality brush...</li>
            <li>But after that, my face is almost flawless and it feels really soft.</li>
            <li>Good for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth and bright.</li>
            <li>Be sure to recommend this kind of cleaning device.</li>
            <li>I looked into this and the Clarisonic and ended up choosing this one because I couldn&#x27;t justify the cost of the Clarisonic when I wasn&#x27;t sure if this kind of product would even work for me.</li>
            <li>A two dollar wash cloth is more effective.</li>
            <li>And I can&#x27;t help but feel that it&#x27;s a trendy thing, and you won&#x27;t be able to find those replacement heads forever.</li>
            <li>And I can&#x27;t help but feel that it&#x27;s a trendy thing, and you won&#x27;t be able to find those replacement heads forever.</li>
            <li>I liked the burts bees better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Washing the face with your own hands gives more sense of what you doing .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the best cleansing brush I have ever used so far.</li>
            <li>The words on the packaging are all you get, so you&#x27;re on your own when it comes to figuring how to use it, how many times a day or week, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really impressed and frankly surprised.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, radiant, even, and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>this one by far is the best...</li>
            <li>I liked this item okay</li>
            <li>and the olay is best by far in terms of price and cleaning.</li>
            <li>The point is not to have amazing skin after one scrub, but to routinely use the brush so as to see improvement over time :)  </li>
            <li>Good price and speed of light shipping.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how wonderful it felt while I was using it.</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it every day and is very happy with the results this product gives , her skin glows and is soft to the touch .</li>
            <li>And this is the best product I&#x27;ve used to keep my skin looking young and that can remove all my makeup and dirt build up.</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro-x is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a slightly more aggressive and thorough brushing but in my honest opinion, it is way overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>face feels softer and I feel that the skincare products I use are more effective.</li>
            <li>no one has perfect clear skin.</li>
            <li>it is amazing how much more makeup comes off of my face with using this rather than just washing my face with my hands.</li>
            <li>This product took it from nice to fantastic!</li>
            <li>Blemishes are mostly gone &amp; skin has a nice glow to it.</li>
            <li>I  use my own obagi cleanser with it, and OMG, I love how my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li>A bit more power would be nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as effective as the $100-$200 competitors from Clarisonic, but it does a lovely job for a product that costs &amp;#60;25%.</li>
            <li>I bought the Clarisonic Mia and was using it for about 2 months when I started looking for something more effective.</li>
            <li>This is so wonderful, leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this works better than washing with my two hands.</li>
            <li>good help my skin to get smooth but</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic that I wanted was about $150, it was nice to be able to try the Olay before committing to the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>It is effective in cleaning all the dirt and grime from your face using your favorite cleanser.  </li>
            <li>so far she reports to me that it is awesome .</li>
            <li>The brush is good and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it more in the winter.  </li>
            <li>My skin is AMAZINGLY soft after using this, great product for the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this product so far.</li>
            <li>my son is also having great success with keeping his acne at bay.  </li>
            <li>Refreshed, Well-Rested, Bright, Cheerful and Glowing.  </li>
            <li>it works perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying it in the shower, I felt as if I would honestly get a better wash using my hands alone to massage in my face wash.</li>
            <li>While it does&#x27;t have the USB rechargable cord that comes with the Clairsonic, I couldn&#x27;t imagine the Clairsonic being any more effective.</li>
            <li>My moisturizer is more effective too.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly tell a difference after using the lovely scrub brush.</li>
            <li>I love the portability of this, would be nice to have a brush head though</li>
            <li>It works okay to cleanse the face, but in my opinion, does not work nearly as effectively as the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>, this is a great buy - and the price is worth it.  </li>
            <li>7x more effective, and after using it twice a day I&#x27;d say I agree.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful and my face always feels so soft after.</li>
            <li>but supposedly this is more effective than handwashing.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best thing I have every used on my skin.</li>
            <li>this one is cheap and that is what you get... not so good.</li>
            <li>Too many people with amazing skin were raving about it on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would do the job because the bristles are so soft but it worked great!  </li>
            <li>But this works great and is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive skin or acne prone skin the two speeds are just perfect.</li>
            <li>I was expecting some sort of soft orbital sander luffa type deal for your face, what I got was at best an oversize version of an electric toothbrush with softer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i think it could use some vibration and be much more effective.</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth and good</li>
            <li>works good and enjoy using it</li>
            <li>Great product, well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and it feels really good too.</li>
            <li>Nice but needs more soap</li>
            <li>It clears up blackheads, and is wonderful on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>what more can i sayitis nice</li>
            <li>I guess when that happens I will be able to afford a new one since the price is very good!</li>
            <li>Just as good as Clarisonic without the high price!!!!</li>
            <li>I have Amazon Prime -- another excellent gift to myself -- so ordering was easy and shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>Excellent for gently exfoliation, Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>great for the legs, right before shaving and underarms to prevent in-growns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in moderation and with the right cleansing solution this is a great tool.</li>
            <li>in moderation and with the right cleansing solution this is a great tool.</li>
            <li>The cleansing system works great for me and the price was right.</li>
            <li>but they just made that decision easy!  </li>
            <li>By the way, putting in the batteries isn&#x27;t rocket science, it was quite easy!    </li>
            <li>it comes with has very fine exfoliating granules.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliating cream is very fine grained</li>
            <li>It has very fine particles so it exfoliates</li>
            <li>/&gt;HIGHLY recommended and easy on the pocketbook!</li>
            <li>How easy does that make it!  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>I have never written a review before, but feel so strongly about this product that I want to recommend it!</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this!</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!</li>
            <li>It really works great and love that it is water proof as well!</li>
            <li>Awesome for any makeup wearer who wants to make sure your face is clean at night!</li>
            <li>Cheap and does a great job just as good as the higher priced ones.</li>
            <li>I originally owned a Clarisonic and Loved it.  </li>
            <li>It cleans very well and feels so good!</li>
            <li>my skin is so clean and bright after use this.</li>
            <li>This does a good job to clean and massage face.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean really good.  </li>
            <li>The quicker speed is great for a more powerful exfoliation, however, with my skin anyways</li>
            <li>and u cane tell the before and after on how  well ur porse get clean good product</li>
            <li>Good to use to clean off facials.</li>
            <li>I will keep using it, as it seems to clean deeper than just fingers, but it isn&#x27;t as good as I hoped.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean good</li>
            <li>Feels great while you are cleaning your face and it feels great afterwards as well as your face definitely feels cleaner.</li>
            <li>I liked my Clarisonic best when using about it only about every 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li>This was fairly priced and seems to work well to help clean out pores and keep blemishes away.  </li>
            <li>MY face feels great, a nice way to exfoliate gently but thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Loved the product it worked as expected the exfoliating cream was the perfect size for just a trail to see if I would like the product.</li>
            <li>But for the price, I&#x27;m happy and I&#x27;ll get more than my money&#x27;s worth from it.</li>
            <li>but again it&#x27;s going to massage more than scrub so not the most effective but does get the job done.</li>
            <li>I think healthy skin comes from the inside and diet, exercise, or supplemetns are more effective.</li>
            <li>good thing,inexpensive,and more importantly my wife like</li>
            <li>I love love love love how it feels when it&#x27;s scrubbing my skin!</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and makes my skin feel great.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels incredible after using this though, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, after I use this I use a toner and my face is so clean!</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful, really cleans the skin very well, easy to use in the shower and the price is great value - prices</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to spend money on products that work, but honestly this is all I need!</li>
            <li>I like the higher speed for the decolletage area, which feels great, even though the brush is not specifically designed for this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and would suggest it for anyone on a budget.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that my clearer skin has remained consistent since using the pro-x.</li>
            <li>Great price and the product was exactly what it said it would be.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased this product I thought it was great.</li>
            <li>Great quality and cleans very well!</li>
            <li>Works great, and exactly what I was looking for for the price.  </li>
            <li>I just love it, my skin feels real clean after I use it</li>
            <li>This brush is so useful and amazing!</li>
            <li>is exactly what she wanted and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It was so great the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Im just happy to see him washing his face ;)</li>
            <li>This product was great at first, but no even 2 months in</li>
            <li>i think combine to oily skin will be more suitable.</li>
            <li>I think this product does a pretty great job.  </li>
            <li>Great deal for a much lower price than the &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; and price product!</li>
            <li>Great size works really well!</li>
            <li>I love the cleaner it came with, but it also works wonderfully with my own basic gel face cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I got this product with a good deal, so I would say it is not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price for fairly good quality.</li>
            <li>Talk about your face feeling super clean!!!</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to have really clean skin every morning with a gentle brush.  </li>
            <li>does a nice job, gets your face nice and clean without scrubbing harshly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just turn it off and pop the brush off and your hair is fine!</li>
            <li>and it came so quickly!!</li>
            <li>Let me say this brush was very cheaply made...</li>
            <li>My skin feels VERY smooth and is well on its way.  </li>
            <li>My skin is VERY smooth now.</li>
            <li>so it is very important that I wash my face</li>
            <li>The brush is very smooth</li>
            <li>Compact and very light.</li>
            <li>After I use it, my skin ends up very smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li>It feels very smooth when you are done.  </li>
            <li>My skin was very smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>My skin looks healthy and happy for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy I went with this first to make sure it&#x27;s what I wanted as well as</li>
            <li>I liked how easy this was to use.</li>
            <li>It easily fits in your hand and has a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li>It helps to gently exfoliate the top layer of skin, and gives you a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li>its good for a quick face cleaner,  I also like the cleanser that is included.</li>
            <li>Really nice and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>for the price this is an effective  and easy to use cleanser option.</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin is smoother and brighter, the product is easy to use and seems to effectively do the job.</li>
            <li>I have been using olay products and all of them were super good.</li>
            <li>Easy, durable, and effective.</li>
            <li>easy to use nice to have in shower</li>
            <li>Also, it has a very strong massage feel to it, which I like even better than the cleaning action - it&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever done for any skin care product, but that is how much I love this thing!!</li>
            <li>I decided to try this one given the positive reviews and the great price.</li>
            <li>I do think this does a great job, my face seems clean and it really does a good job removing makeup way better than just soaping with your hands or a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>I was too cheap to by the fancier version of this, but I love the Oil of Olay one!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>but I loved it from the very first use.</li>
            <li>but I can speak for Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System--I love it!</li>
            <li>and it does a great job of exfoliating, minimizing blackheads, and make your face feel super smooth.</li>
            <li>Takes all of my makeup off very easily and my face feels so clean when I am done using it!</li>
            <li>the brush very soft, and it feels good, good price,good quality, i like it</li>
            <li>I always feel great after using this and think that everyone is due for a good clean once in awhile, great feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m paying that kind of money when this works just fine.  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, so if you don&#x27;t mind having a product that is decent at best, it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling fresh, clean and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Does a pretty good job in cleaning and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I would recommend this very highly.  </li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling soft and beautiful follow up with face moisturizer right afterward!!!</li>
            <li>for me that is a huge deal!</li>
            <li>HUGE gynormous pores that you can see all the way to China!  </li>
            <li>and it seemed okay,</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This works ok</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to tey the clearsonic,  because so many people rave about the product.  </li>
            <li>Still, she couldn&#x27;t do much more than read the directions.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this brush</li>
            <li>I use it with my favorite gel or foaming cleanser...</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I  love  the  brush</li>
            <li>and  that  it has more  than  one  speed.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t magically make your skin over in one or two uses, but it does cleanse deeper than your fingers.  </li>
            <li>Do you use appropriate moisturizers and creams for your skin type?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is better than washing your face with just your fingers/ wash cloth, but it doesn&#x27;t stand a chance in comparison to the clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m planning on buying more.</li>
            <li>&amp;lt;--my favorite effect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product itself is lightweight, and visually appealing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Both my girls love it.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure once I don&#x27;t go overbaord</li>
            <li>cleans my face like magic.</li>
            <li>The Pro-X exfoliating cleanser was ok</li>
            <li>I love this system...</li>
            <li>I decided this would be a better deal...</li>
            <li>It works great and makes my skin feel soft and nice</li>
            <li>Really does a great job in cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li>I absolutley love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>YOU PAY MUCH MORE IN THE STORES AND</li>
            <li>, if you are considering this over the Clarsonic, I have to say I love this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The brush is ok.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love what this product has been doing to my skin.</li>
            <li>For instance, I use Avon&#x27;s Glycolic Acid peel and after just one time of using it I felt that it worked 10X better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>I feel like the glycolic peel was able to do its job much better as well as my moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I also apply Aloe Vera gel to my skin and that has been working a lot better as well.</li>
            <li>I don’t feel like this brush works any better than my hands.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re like me and used to more abrasive</li>
            <li>Its just another level of cleansing - better, more thorough, and able to reach that tricky corner where your nose meets your face.</li>
            <li>I felt cleaner and more refreshed after one time with this brush than I have in years.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I love the unit..</li>
            <li>glad I have it</li>
            <li>but I think hers is a much better product.  </li>
            <li>and I think it does a better job than this does.</li>
            <li>and I am amazed at how much better my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin looks even better than it did before.</li>
            <li>I have the clearest complexion of my life and my skin is getting more youthful all the time.</li>
            <li>But add this to an anti-aging skin care line that works for you (Arbonne RE9 for me) and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that this is waterproof.</li>
            <li>Being over Fourty, you can imagine how many gadgets, creams, potions and promises I have tried.</li>
            <li>One more thing.</li>
            <li>Its definitely better than not using anything.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my friend.&lt;br /&gt;Its better and cheaper than clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>much satisfied with this one...</li>
            <li>Olay is like a sedan going at 30 mph at top speed.  </li>
            <li>I do believe that this works better than just using your hands to rub your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be gone</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love it, and use it often.</li>
            <li>I used a face cream that is more abrasive</li>
            <li>No doubt my $$$ anti-aging products are better able to do their job, too.</li>
            <li>It works okay, but I think this item is overpriced.</li>
            <li>It has been fantastic!</li>
            <li>Perhaps people feel that by spending more they get a better product, but truly I could not tell the difference.</li>
            <li>works okay nothing to write home about though</li>
            <li>Love Olay Prox, wish more cleanser and brushes was include.</li>
            <li>I hope Olay continues to manufacture more products like this one.</li>
            <li>when you consider the payoff of better feeling, better looking skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a week now, and my skin never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, the product works so well!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it with the Olay cleansing gel, but I just use it with any of my cream face wash (make sure there at NO exfoliation beads, this will scrap your face).</li>
            <li>but since then my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I initially had awesome results with this product.</li>
            <li>I can tell it cleans better than my hands</li>
            <li>Olay had OK review</li>
            <li>It is significantly better quality compared to Olay.</li>
            <li>My esthetician recommended I purchase a spin brush to exfoliate better and specifically recommended the Olay system instead of Clarisonic because she thinks they are overpriced.</li>
            <li>Love this cleaning system.</li>
            <li>A wash rag works much better.</li>
            <li>This mostly just sloshes the cleanser you&#x27;re using around.</li>
            <li>Try it, you will love the way your face feels and cleans so well.</li>
            <li>I believe it helps keep your skin glowing and healthy.   </li>
            <li>I am pleased to say I did see a bit of improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this product because its the best one I found that actually works.</li>
            <li>I used my trusted technique of calling customer service while I was struggling and magically, the flap slid off before I connected to an agent.</li>
            <li>I saw that a lot of people weren&#x27;t sure how often to replace their brush.</li>
            <li>During Day 2 after using this product, my skin appeared slightly better.</li>
            <li>I love this cleaning system.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does cost WAY more (like $119</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>My skin does too:)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve probably used longer on many occasions.</li>
            <li>Love this product, definitely great comparison to clarisonic mia but much much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it to exfoliate my arms and upper chest with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>The best, this is second one I bought during lightening deal.  </li>
            <li>Just okay.  </li>
            <li>It feels better from the inside.  </li>
            <li>Freaking love my olay pro x.</li>
            <li>I love it?  </li>
            <li>I get much better results using a    </li>
            <li>I just hope it does a much, much better job than the Pro-X.</li>
            <li>AND FEELS SO SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has been better since using this product.</li>
            <li>Glad it&#x27;s worked for the majority of users</li>
            <li>skin feels better after using this.</li>
            <li>This is more of a buffer than a scrubber.</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for a better scrubber.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>I say more?</li>
            <li>like this one so much better.</li>
            <li>My daughter likes it, but wishes the brush held its shape better.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too pleased.</li>
            <li>Maybe using just a cream cleanser with the apparatus would lead to better results, but why not just use a washcloth and some vigorous scrubbing?</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love the spa experience on my time and terms.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I purchased the Olay one, and boy am I glad.</li>
            <li>I totally love this product</li>
            <li>We have been using it for well over a year now and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>This will help me to use the unit more often.</li>
            <li>I get more exfoliation from rubbing a soapy towel to my face.  </li>
            <li>Amazon always a great place to shop, n reasonable price too.</li>
            <li>An exfoliator by nature, I have used many differnet types of products to exfoliate, including, wash cloths, scrubs, buf-pufs, loofahs, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s there...:)</li>
            <li>thanks amazon for this great product.</li>
            <li>I love how it is safe to use in the shower without interfering with the function of the product.</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin felt better and cleaner</li>
            <li>and I think my skin accepted the moisturizer better after using this to cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mostly, I liked how the brush felt on my skin--a nice gentle massage, something nice to do for myself each day.</li>
            <li>Love the Olay model.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Olay products, but this didnt make the cut.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and does a great job.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>eh - okay.</li>
            <li>It actually cleanes your face NO PROBLEM and leaves your skin looking FLAWLESS.</li>
            <li>I love this thing</li>
            <li>The cleaner scrubes deep in your face like nothing else can and leaves your skin feeling AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li>I also wish it had one more intensity speed to it.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels while using it.</li>
            <li>and I like that you are able to use exfoliating cleanser with the brush...</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this</li>
            <li>It was a grand item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is better than I imagined.</li>
            <li>You could basically use your favorite skin cleanser with this and it would be just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to spend any more money after buying this product, unlike the Neutrogena Sonic Wave.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s a great product for the price!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>Obviously most people can&#x27;t talk about this without mentioning the Clarisonic, and I was torn between getting this and dropping $200+ on a Clarisonic Plus, and in the end decided to try this out.</li>
            <li>Sure, I could buy the Clarisonic, it would look a lot prettier in my bathroom</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a lot fancier and has more bells and whistles, but</li>
            <li>I have to say that the Clarisonic is better in every way</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen products like this for in excess of $150, and I can&#x27;t imagine them being any better than this one.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I do and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>have no idea if the Clarisonic is better than the Olay ProX</li>
            <li>so perhaps it works better for them, I wouldn&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>I love my Olay ProX cleansing system.  </li>
            <li>After using it for almost a month, my skin looks SO much better.</li>
            <li>My face feels softer after using it, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>and i use this machine with my regular face wash and it cleans so much better!!!!</li>
            <li>Got this today, and love it already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I hadn&#x27;t purchased the Clarisonic, it might work better - never tried it, but I&#x27;m not complaining about the Olay cleanser</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m satisfied with this.</li>
            <li>the batteries died, I wouldn&#x27;t be out more than, say, a dinner at Chili&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am extremely satisfied with the Pro-X&#x27;s performance and results.</li>
            <li>This helps to bring out a healthy glow and radiance</li>
            <li>absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>thanks Olay for a great product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I even bought more for my friends.</li>
            <li>OK, I had to try it.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this item , but reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head and it exfoliates my scalp, just love this thing.</li>
            <li>I am in need of more.</li>
            <li>I love this thing</li>
            <li>I love this, buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>My face has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t spend $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than a lot of brushes I used before.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I tried to use it for a couple more days to see if my skin would improve, but it did not.</li>
            <li>deep cleansing at it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li>This works MUCH better and doesn&#x27;t take up room on the counter while charging...just needs two batteries.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This has been such a great find that I signed up to get one monthly through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save service, and now I&#x27;m giving one to all my friends for their birthdays this year!</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Ok so I read alot of the reviews on here.  </li>
            <li>Which made me want it even more ok.  </li>
            <li>Ok also I got to call out some peoples reviews.  </li>
            <li>It works Great, Price is also reasonable.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I will say that the Clarisonic is better though.  </li>
            <li>I would say that you could get this Olay and feel satisfied because of the cost decrease.  </li>
            <li>and it burned my skin more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my face.  </li>
            <li>I love having an every day post-facial glow.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>You will love it.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels now that I have been using it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got this</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>A cotton ball that probably costs a penny by itself exfoliates more than a 30 dollar skin brush.</li>
            <li>Love this more than I thought.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love my ProX.</li>
            <li>I love the result and I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put any lotion on your hands before you try! :)</li>
            <li>I love my pro x brush</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>but this works just as well and in my opinion much better</li>
            <li>I immediately went on Amazon to see how much of a better price I could find it.</li>
            <li>I use it every night before bed and almost immediately my skin has had more of a glowing even tone.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Best Facial brush ever.  </li>
            <li>I like the way this makes my face feel better than the cleaning effects that it gives me.     </li>
            <li>great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>Iam glad I bought it instead of Pricey Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>It works OK but slings soap on the highest setting.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>My cheeks were rosy, and my skin just looked so healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend $200</li>
            <li>But we shall see.... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My skin and break outs have become so much better</li>
            <li>I did a ton of research in deciding between this and just going for it with the Clairsonic, and I&#x27;m really glad I got this one.</li>
            <li>The rite aid one I had before this was much better</li>
            <li>I used to have to rub a lot to get all my makeup off, but with this lil gadget it cleans my face for me :)  </li>
            <li>I now have a Clarisonic, and it does a much, much better job.</li>
            <li>Ok product.  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay for as this product is not as efficient as others that cost quite a bit more.  </li>
            <li>Most people have a tendency to overuse creams, which can cause blocked pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and my make-up is staying on better.</li>
            <li>Clarisonic might be more thorough</li>
            <li>(Amazon&#x27;s price is better than Wal-Mart &amp; Meijer).  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I think my skin looks significantly better after about 4 weeks of using the Olay system.  </li>
            <li>and I think his skin looks better also.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Ok, this was something for my wife.</li>
            <li>but I love what the benefits are,</li>
            <li>I wish the difference between the two speeds was more pronounced</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>It claims it&#x27;s 6X better than washing alone</li>
            <li>which i like I bit better.  </li>
            <li>I just love the way my face feels after using this.</li>
            <li>Love this Olay Pro-X Cleansing System.  </li>
            <li>As my title says it is an OK alternative to the coveted Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I am not quite sure what&#x27;s contributed to it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>so I think twice a week or maybe three if u use it lightly is ok.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it in the shower too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>St Ives works much better for me.</li>
            <li>without creating more problems.</li>
            <li>While plenty of makeup came off on that, I knew there was plenty more.</li>
            <li>or so I&#x27;d rinse the Olay, with more makeup visibly coming off each time.</li>
            <li>After that was done I immediately applied my acne-fighting moisturizer, which seemed to absorb much better than when I was just cleansing without a device.</li>
            <li>I love Olay products but this one needs to be recalled.</li>
            <li>Cleans the pores well and my face looks better now that I am using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t advise using this more than once a week, as that&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks noticeably better with each use.  </li>
            <li>if you have more than one person in the household that will be using this, you could change the head between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have way more acne on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>The Pretika brush washed my face faster, and much more thoroughly than this brush does.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a week for deep cleansing and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re gonna love it.</li>
            <li>I like being able to scrub my skin without hurting it.</li>
            <li>Love this system...</li>
            <li>The love affair was short-lived however.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>So hats off to the seller :)</li>
            <li>I buy most everything here at Amazon, however I bought this at Walmart (and it cost more) than on this Amazon Site.  </li>
            <li>I am fairly sure that our water supply here contains</li>
            <li>and I am in love with cleaning system .</li>
            <li>It would be better if this was a rechargeable unit, but then it might cost significantly more.  </li>
            <li>This is probably ok to use on the t-zone of the acne prone or maybe just on a weekly basis.  </li>
            <li>and I came across this as a top seller under beauty items on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Then on impulse I bought this brush, it was so cheap!  </li>
            <li>but then again I was expecting something more like microdermabrasion kit.</li>
            <li>and I am able to use any cleansing product I wish with it-or in my case, just water.  </li>
            <li>I love using this every morning.</li>
            <li>well more it did not agree with my face.</li>
            <li>and I have used the Olay pro-x with Purity, Philosophy&#x27;s face wash, which worked much better, but didn&#x27;t necessarily help with my acne, but the pro-x still worked great!</li>
            <li>The greatest part is that it is water proof, so you can take it in the shower, and you can use any facial cleanser with it.</li>
            <li>Love Olay.</li>
            <li>I love using this product in the shower every day.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the reviews on Amazon as I was looking for a more inexpensive option to the Ultra Sonic version.</li>
            <li>However, it works fabulously!</li>
            <li>But this not only takes care of that, it keeps me from breaking out and makes my face feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>I can tell if it&#x27;s doing any better of a job then a wash cloth does.</li>
            <li>I find that my skincare products go on much more evenly.</li>
            <li>It would be better if this was a rechargeable unit, but then it might cost significantly more.</li>
            <li>Might be slightly better than using just your hands to wash your face but not that much better.</li>
            <li>I have to say I was looking over the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator,and this in the beauty isle.</li>
            <li>That is where I use it most of the time.</li>
            <li>and they both love theirs also.</li>
            <li>I love this scrubber.  </li>
            <li>WOULD LOVE IT</li>
            <li>My skin feels wonderful, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it all the time now</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Teresa Santillan :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s water proof :)  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I have gone through so many face washed and nothing</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>I did and I love it.</li>
            <li>I just like how it cleans so well. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I am well pleased with this machine.</li>
            <li>that is just too much multi-tasking lol.</li>
            <li>and I used this for 20 miutes because I love how it feels.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an OK device.</li>
            <li>It cleans better than your fingertips and it is not abrasive.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be placing orders for more. :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>and now it is getting more moist and more softer.</li>
            <li>It works faster than the clarasonic and feels like its working better.</li>
            <li>The customer service rep was sympathetic.</li>
            <li>I want to know where to buy more brush heads</li>
            <li>I would give this exfoliator five starts if it had a better way to get to the batteries.  </li>
            <li>I was hopeful when buying this product, but I received more</li>
            <li>There are so many reviews on this</li>
            <li>I like the brush a lot it makes my skin feel nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Still feel that it cleans better than cleanser alone or with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>and I was wondering whether this would be comparable to those, but it is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I even bought 2 more for gifts.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought two more as gifts.  </li>
            <li>That is why I wonder how much better those 100.00 ones would be?</li>
            <li>I love everything about it.</li>
            <li>I love the system.</li>
            <li>So I grabbed this real quick, and when I got it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love to spend cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li>Worked okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I switched.</li>
            <li>but I have to believe my face is getting a more thorough cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing the Olay Microderm/Peel today :-)    </li>
            <li>I am so intrigued to try the Clarisonic though because so many of you swear it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li>I may one day cough up the $150 for one, but for now this works wonders :-)</li>
            <li>I noticed an immediate and remarkable improvement in the look and feel of my skin even after the first use.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about highly-effective and budget-friendly?  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is ok.</li>
            <li>The brush is perfect for daily exfoliating while cleaning.</li>
            <li>and I plan to buy it again, but I think that any exfoliating cleaning product would work okay.</li>
            <li>Although, I was exfoliating my skin with cleansers every day, the Olay brush does a much better job.</li>
            <li>, THE VIBRATION JUST SEEMS TO DO MORE.</li>
            <li>My husband and I use this every day and we both love it.</li>
            <li>Got one for my mom and sister and they love theirs also.</li>
            <li>&quot; my mineral make up much better.</li>
            <li>I would suggest that even someone with an oily face make sure to apply some moisturizer after use.</li>
            <li>Over all I am pleased and would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did, I&#x27;m clearing up now.</li>
            <li>Acne is much better too.  </li>
            <li>I watch what I use on my face and thought that this olay product would be okay</li>
            <li>and I must say I like this much better because the brush spins much more circular motion than the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love that I can use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you clean/rinse the brush head throughly after each use.</li>
            <li>These are okay</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>Before I started using the System, I had a lot of clogged pores which always bugged me because they were so visible; now I have 95% clearer skin, which also looks flawless when I put any sort of coverage on such as foundation.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the circulation and results using this item.</li>
            <li>I tried everything u can think of proactiv, oil cleansing method, dermalogica (which worked the best of them all) along with countless store brand face washes</li>

            <li>Really glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>This product was just ok.</li>
            <li>For people who are happy with a hand-and-towel cleansing routine, this could be more of a gimmick than a real plus.</li>

            <li>I no longer have enlarged, clogged pores and best of all, I look younger because my skin is better able to absorb all the anti-aging products I use.</li>

            <li>The Olay is lighter, so you can control the force on your face better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant to exfoliate the top layer(s) of your skin,</li>

            <li>wash hands one more time to get nail gunk</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything, blackhead removers, eating better, acne cleansing systems, sacyclic acid nothing helped.</li>

            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with the results, it definitely does everything it promises.  </li>
            <li>You would be better off just using a washcloth or just get ProActiv and get on with your life.</li>
            <li>I will recommend it to anyone :)</li>
            <li>This cleanser is fabulous!</li>

            <li>Both of us love this brush and the cleansing cream, and I can see a difference in my son&#x27;s face already.</li>
            <li>i have never been confident in my skin and now i am because of a $20 cleaning system.</li>
            <li>Better than it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I ended up upgrading to the newer model with the microdermabrasion brush and am pleased with that one as well.</li>
            <li>Okay, I give this product five stars because it is a convenient, well made, inexpensive product with quality that exceeds its price.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I absolutely love the brush, I use just a teeny bit of my [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask</li>

            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>love how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this and love the cleanser too.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value for twenty bucks.h in a short</li>
            <li>I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>your face is hilarious.</li>
            <li>We both love the brush cleaning system.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>so glad</li>
            <li>I tried using it after washing my face at the sink but stopped because I found it works much better if you use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love the brush and over time my skin gets better and better.</li>
            <li>So, I use it with my Derma e Glycolic acid cleanser, and I am okay with both.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s improving my skin, but I love the way</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love their products but was expecting a deeper cleaning with this system.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this cleansing system.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use their cleanser in order to use the system.</li>
            <li>it seems to work better than using it just to wash your face in the sink.</li>
            <li>I would prefer a more exfoliating brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy because it effectively keeps adult acne away when I use it 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li>Or end up purchasing something i really love for an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really enjoying this.</li>
            <li>Im glad</li>
            <li>, I had a manual one, but I love the electric one better.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>My complexion looks better already.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Even so, it still worked wonderfully and even better the next morning WITH wet/moist face.</li>
            <li>It is keeping my skin cleaner than I was able to do with just make-up remover and cleanser with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased it</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d just save a lot more money in the end.</li>
            <li>I love this device.</li>
            <li>Although, I was exfoliating my skin with cleansers every day, the Olay brush does a much better job.</li>
            <li>and I will buy it again, but I suspect any exfoliating cleaning product would work okay.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I found out about the Pro-X, so before dropping another $75 dollars into a better Clarisonic I gave the Pro-x a try.</li>
            <li>I found it to be better than the Mia at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I love the Pro-X system.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more even.  </li>
            <li>I feel my complexion looks better since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li>It even specifies that it is safe for use in shower.  </li>
            <li>Love what this does for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Ok but the electric is better</li>
            <li>It cleans better than anything I have used, including the Clairsonic.(Sells for over $100)</li>
            <li>I may buy more for my granddaughters as then tend to neglect their skin</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything for my blackheads, and honestly I do better with a washcloth and STRONGER exfoliate than the one they give you with this product.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it would get better</li>
            <li>Thanks Olay for making a great product.  </li>
            <li>like the clarisonic better  </li>
            <li>me, the question became, which unit better cleaned my face?</li>
            <li>Many people say to use foaming cleansers, but I&#x27;ve used all kinds.  </li>
            <li>so I gave it so more time.  </li>
            <li>Skin is so smooth!</li>
            <li>This cleans my face better than ever before</li>
            <li>sooo glad</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This cleansing brush is compact and perfect for my facial cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>most of the time just switching heads for each person and our faces have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Makes my complexion smooth and clean.....love it!</li>
            <li>and I seriously love it.</li>
            <li>So i love this product.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li>Love Olay products.</li>
            <li>love this brush....</li>
            <li>better deal than the $200 ones</li>
            <li>Just received mines and im in love with it already.</li>
            <li>It was ok for the price.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT WILL LOVE TO GET ALL MY BEAUTY THINGS</li>
            <li>LOVE YOUR SITE WILL STAY WITH YOUR SITE</li>
            <li>i think it&#x27;s perfect for the daily routine.</li>
            <li>I love it and couldn&#x27;t imagine not having it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I also love the cleanser that came with the kit.</li>
            <li>I have just used it for two days, but I am already in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Also, I think anything that massages your face will probably have to help flex your skin and give it more elasticity which will in turn help to moisturize and lighten your wrinkles.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it:)</li>
            <li>But once I got using it, I realized there&#x27;s not that much more to say.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and soothing and I use it with with massaging, cleansing cream to give me the \\&quot;crisper, more invigorating\\&quot; massage.  </li>
            <li>the Pro-X is what seems to bring about the better skin</li>
            <li>I love it.........  </li>
            <li>The tube cleaner is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li>And figure there had to be something better out there.</li>
            <li>but my skin is now looking better.</li>
            <li>The shipping was great n fast.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not gonna say it&#x27;s better than clarisonic</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this cleansing system.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things is that I have the option to use any cleanser that I choose, not just Olay&#x27;s, unlike the Nutrogena Wave.</li>
            <li>In fact, I took the batteries out and put them back in again, wondering if they weren&#x27;t seated just perfectly or something.   </li>
            <li>One more thing, I don&#x27;t get the problem people are having with opening the battery compartment.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it. :)</li>
            <li>I got better results using an exfoliating cloth.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, I am unsure as to why you would need more than two speeds.</li>
            <li>I think my moisturizer does a better job of sinking in after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t compare apples to apples here since I&#x27;ve never tried the more expensive/popular</li>
            <li>Let me start out by confessing how much I love face brushes.</li>
            <li>A firmer brush would do a better job at scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe the Clarisonic could be any better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Having been on Retin-A for a year now, my skin has for the most part adjusted to it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this</li>
            <li>I love using it each night and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>So I thought, ok, I just need to let it charge up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got microbeads in it, which paired with the brush is great for gentle exfoliation and cleansing.</li>
            <li>It also cleaned my skin ok, but</li>
            <li>It also cleaned my skin ok, but</li>
            <li>:)    </li>
            <li>i LOVE</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, but it is more on the dryer side.</li>
            <li>Consider it more of massage for your face.</li>
            <li>Feels better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s an outstanding alternative.</li>
            <li>I bought this to make cleaning my face more efficient and I believe this does the job.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use it, but I am satisfied with the brush itself.</li>
            <li>You can use your favorite soap or scrub with it, so your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give it up either! :)</li>
            <li>have tried so many products (proactive, dermalogica, prescription medications, microdermabrasions, etc.)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft, and the two-speed function is great.  </li>
            <li>and I love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Well the item was supposed to get to me at the latest by today</li>
            <li>A great and reasonable cleansing system.  </li>
            <li>Pay more for one with a better brush for your face.  </li>
            <li>She says she feels like her circulation has improved and that her skin feels better.</li>
            <li>I love love love this.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I got this product as it had so many great reviews and was at a very affordable price point.</li>
            <li>But every time I came across this and read the reviews, I was getting more and more tempted.</li>
            <li>However, 100% positively satisfied</li>
            <li>I purchased this and its ok.</li>
            <li>I found a wash cloth worked better.</li>
            <li>Love the system and bought more brushes to keep using.</li>
            <li>Better to use a washcloth.</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels after using this cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>I was under the impression with the name Olay on it, it would be more feminine more durable...</li>
            <li>It does ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously this product has worked for many people, so I won&#x27;t tell you not to buy it.</li>
            <li>Just be warned that your skin may not be pleased with it.</li>
            <li>As I use it more, time will tell.</li>
            <li>I have dryness and peeling around my nose and this has helped make it so much better.</li>
            <li>We just could not justify the price of the Clarisonic, and after reading the online review for it through Amazon, we decided the Olay Pro -X had alot better track record, for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t expect this to make magic happen :)</li>
            <li>I love this product anyway.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews...</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Works like magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for a while now, and am glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>I used this after makeup removal to make sure there is no residue on my face.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s OK for now.</li>
            <li>Best product you could possibly invest in for skin care.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s more is that you are not stuck to the Olay brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Ok</li>
            <li>but wush I had bought a more stronger one</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing system.</li>
            <li>I feel like I get better results using a washcloth.</li>
            <li>I immediately purchased replacement brushes and cleanser on Amazon, and my face has been the better for it.</li>
            <li>Love this cleansing system.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>so i am glad i ordered it.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt it&#x27;s more efficient than using your hands or a towel.</li>
            <li>and it had better effects when used every now and then.</li>
            <li>If you can afford it, get it, otherwise this us better than nothing.</li>
            <li>It made my skin break out more, and didn&#x27;t help my complexion, even when I sanitized it in alcohol.</li>
            <li>Gave it to my granddaughter thought she could make better use of it</li>
            <li>It also removes make-up much better than just scrubbing with my hands.</li>
            <li>Really glad I didn&#x27;t buy the clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I should have known better...</li>
            <li>I had a Clarisonic and after many years it would no longer accept a charge</li>
            <li>I am also upgrading my rating because after acquiring a face brush I can say the ProX does a decidedly better job around the nose.</li>
            <li>Bought thise as gifts because I love the way it works.  </li>
            <li>, I have okay skin</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>glad I purchased the Pro X instead</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks smoother, fresh and bright.</li>
            <li>She always was a favorite of Olay products, it seem to work for her&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I love this face brush.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m allergic to most face products so that part of it is just me.</li>
            <li>I love it and have had it for a couple months now</li>
            <li>I love this item I use it all the time when I take a shower</li>
            <li>while pulling at the top.</li>
            <li>I slap on some Neutrogena (oil free!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it another couple weeks to be safe.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>After breaking out I thought that perhaps my pores just needed to be cleaned more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>However, after using this for a couple of weeks, I really love it.  </li>
            <li>The heads are easy to clean and fairly inexpensive to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my skin nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleaning system.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt better, and I am a grandma.</li>
            <li>and I am really pleased with this cleaning system.</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself and was so pleased, I bought another as a gift.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this until I used it</li>
            <li>My skin truly feels and looks better.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I think it could use more power.</li>
            <li>I love the price and quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>my skin got brighter, more elastic</li>
            <li>I do however wish that It brought more cream exfoliate with it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I see no downside to it, and the price is so much better than the clarsonic.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to moisturize and apply sunscreen afterwards.</li>
            <li>ok I guess.</li>
            <li>After reading many of the reviews, I decided to try the Olay PROx  version.  </li>
            <li>and I must say its phenomenal, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for a cleaner and the price.</li>
            <li>I am planning on purchasing more for holiday presents.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice heft to it, doesn&#x27;t feel at all cheap.</li>
            <li>I cant believe how much better my face looks and feels since buying this product.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Olay Pore Scrub and my face has never looked better.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>OTHERS STORES COST MORE.</li>
            <li>Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Batteries - I love that this product uses batteries instead of charging.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this, and I&#x27;ve been using it about a month or more.</li>
            <li>Part of me wonders if I should invest the money in the clarisonic and see if I could get even better results.</li>
            <li>had anticipated forking out the £120 for a Clarisonic cleansing brush this month, but the more times I went to the website, the more I didn&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say this is better than a clarisonic as I have never used it, but I have no desire to get one now, because it works so well.</li>
            <li>and so I&#x27;m more than happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thinking an electical one would be better and</li>
            <li>Using it twice a day has kept my skin free of breakouts (yes, breakouts even over 70!).  </li>
            <li>and it makes my skin smooth!</li>
            <li>My face feels instantly better</li>
            <li>was expecting much more exfoliating properties from this gadget</li>
            <li>but many of my friends raved about their &#x27;name brand&#x27; ones.</li>
            <li>Well, I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve played with the name brand version at the store and don&#x27;t see many differences that would make me need to stray from this Olay two-speed version....</li>
            <li>i saw better review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a change for the better since using this product.  </li>
            <li>She love this product.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be more abrasive than it turned out to be.</li>
            <li>I am amazed that it worked even better than I imagined and faster than I had dared hope.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s how much I  love this</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>SO MANY ARRIVE</li>
            <li>Thank u Amazon :)</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t say enough great things about this!</li>
            <li>This product did nothing but make my face even more irritated.</li>
            <li>5 more stars</li>
            <li>Gives a through cleansing, love it saved a ton of money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, considering its price.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s practically the clarisonic, but a lot more affordable and within my price range.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend alot.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Two of my friends have bought the Olay Pro-X system because they saw for themselves how much better my skin is.</li>
            <li>my face feels alot more cleaner than hand washed.</li>
            <li>For those days I can devote more time to my face.  </li>
            <li>it really works great.</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>The price that I was able to get this item for was les than I could have purchased at any retail store.  </li>
            <li>And it has gotten more oily in the T-zone.  </li>
            <li>I have one and love it.  </li>
            <li>so i know that it&#x27;s cleaning my face better than before.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I love to have received more of the cleanser or maybe a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for myself and my sister and we both love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to wash my face now, and it feel so good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Sure, the pro x/battery powered tooth brush does a better job and makes a difference, but the clarisonic/sonicare simply does the best job.</li>
            <li>I love using this.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love all Olay products</li>
            <li>this cleanser did more for me in 1 week than Epiduo did in 5 months.</li>
            <li>One of the best brush for daily routines, you can notice the difference within a week</li>
            <li>Very happy I purchased and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many many years.</li>
            <li>Although I do have to admit that what I&#x27;m about to say no one is probably going to believe me; and that&#x27;s Ok if you don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>SATISFIED</li>
            <li>my face is much better now  </li>
            <li>Was hoping it would be more like my daughter&#x27;s Clinique cleansing brush...</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt; (where I paid more than this price,btw ,Costco no longer carries</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a week now and my skin has never looked or felt better since I was a kid.  </li>
            <li>and my moisturizer seems to have soaked into my skin much better.  </li>
            <li>I came across this product by looking over the top 100 products in the Beauty Dept and this was in the top 5.</li>
            <li>Do I need to say more?</li>
            <li>Skin looks better after one week for me.</li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure about the use of it.  </li>
            <li>My mother loves all Olay products and the Pro-X Advanced Cleansing system is no exception!</li>
            <li>gifted item.. doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with it</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Anyone looking for an affordable way to keep your skin looking healthy, this is it.</li>
            <li>(I bought more).</li>
            <li>Using this brush is certainly better than just using your hands to wash your face.</li>
            <li>I thought this was kind of cheap though.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and i wish it can really do more magic than towel to my skin.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This product will do all most everything the Clarisonic will do at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>A dip in alcohol, or spritzing of vinegar, just to be safe.  </li>
            <li>One thing I have noticed is that I seem to get more?</li>
            <li>I have never got along :).</li>
            <li>She has passed away and her skin looked better than mine</li>
            <li>After many years and my noticing my aging</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suggested it to many friends</li>
            <li>It gave me the WEIRDEST, GROSSEST, MOST INTENSE breakout I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase and the price.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li>I must say, she does wear make-up for work and before this brush she had significantly more issues than she does now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO glad I bought this rather than a Clairsonic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>And the refills are cheap too!  </li>
            <li>love love love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will purchase more of these as gifts for my family.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my girlfriend, daughter and granddaughter and they love it.</li>
            <li>Love love this cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend using this more than a minute or your skin will start to sting.</li>
            <li>im looking forward to seeing better skin now that i have this.</li>
            <li>I love my brush.</li>
            <li>feels refreshing after using it and pores do not clog anymore.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay to use it once  </li>
            <li>I use argan oil as a moisturizer, and the effects of the brush seem to help the oil absorb into my skin better and leave it more supple than before.  </li>
            <li>How could a product purchased in the supermarket do a better job?  </li>
            <li>I love my Olay Cleansing System and would buy again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li>Definitely love this cleansing  product.</li>
            <li>I really enjoying using this product.</li>
            <li>This is 10x better and removes my makeup.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this products.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I took a chance and bought this system.</li>
            <li>I love using this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li>I love how it can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>:) will be using this product for awhile</li>
            <li>and I am pleased that I did.</li>
            <li>I Love this cleansing system.</li>
            <li>save your money or splurge on a clarisonic, this is just like using your fingers but takes more time.</li>
            <li>Some people say the magic is in the cleansers you use, but for my money it is also in the device.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $ and does a good job</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend enjoyed it as a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li>[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much I posted a review in my own magazine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>/&gt;While researching a number of products I noticed many, many ways to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I am sure there is more than one way to address any problem that you may have.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love using this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the cleanser included.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I get better exfoliation from my St. Ives apricot scrub.</li>
            <li>ive had this cleansing system for about 2-3 months now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li>i love how it feels ahhh</li>
            <li>ah i love it</li>
            <li>My moisturizers go on so much better</li>
            <li>it was ok it did make my face a bit better</li>
            <li>St. Ives face scrub product does a way better job</li>
            <li>I love this cleaning system.</li>
            <li>I have one of these and love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this...</li>
            <li>This cleaner is good but not as powerful as others.</li>
            <li>The cleanser that was included with it is okay, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>LOVE makeup...</li>
            <li>the more, the better...</li>
            <li>but more often than not, I will fall asleep in my caked up face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found I use mostly the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; speed.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use whatever cleanser I like with it as well.</li>
            <li>Purchase two of these cleaning systems for my daughters and they love them.</li>
            <li>Love the cleaning cream that comes with it.  </li>
            <li>It is okay cleaning brush..</li>
            <li>I ordered one from QVC (w/ installed payments) and LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>But I was able to find Olay&#x27;s replacement brush heads for this product 2 for $6 on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Checked the reviews for this item before purchasing and must say it&#x27;s better quality for the cost of others.</li>
            <li>I could see the change on my face skin day by day, now I say bye shiny skin :)</li>
            <li>Love this product for my face.</li>
            <li>Love this face brush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is clearer and more refined.  </li>
            <li>it came with, and I love it.</li>
            <li>so haven&#x27;t got that to compare with but for me its better than hands.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looking and feeling a lot better after using this machine.</li>
            <li>I dont really use the cleanser it came with as I prefer the soap I use, but it works great.</li>
            <li>Much better than washing with my hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use, and expect the results to even get better.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with batteries and a travel size cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my face feels softer after and better balanced after using it.</li>
            <li>excellent product with instant result.</li>
            <li>Better than cleaning with your hands.</li>
            <li>Bought as gifts for my daughters and they both love them</li>
            <li>A washcloth probably does a better job.</li>
            <li>okay recommends.</li>
            <li>The price compared to in-store prices is so much better.</li>
            <li>Love is not even the word to describe what I feel for this product.</li>
            <li>I also love using this after taking my makeup off.</li>
            <li>i love this brush cleanser.</li>
            <li>It cleans my face better then just using my hands and a cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine that they do anything more or better.</li>
            <li>Way better than overpriced clarasonic cleansing system.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>but im not in love with it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I got it for such a good price.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like it or even use it every day.  </li>
            <li>So yes, would recommend it to my friends and family. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product because it is helping me with something that I have suffered with for years.</li>
            <li>Its safe for shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchased this instead of wasting a bunch of money on a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I love more about it</li>
            <li>Love this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying the results of this electric brush.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was on time and product intact, I was not overly impressed with the spin speed of the brush, a friend recently introduced me to the newer and cheaper neutrogena product, I think I might switch.....</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>also was recvd in a very timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou for a great product.</li>
            <li>I try not to exfoliate more than 3-4 times a week</li>
            <li>I love any and all Olay products, but had put off purchasing this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this because I began taking better care of my health</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>but this did a wonderful job on my fragile skin</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cure acne, but it sure helps.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone who does not want to pay top dollar for something that works just as well...</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>it rotates, which seems more abrasive.  </li>
            <li>I can use it in the shower!!!! :-)</li>
            <li>It also helps my moisturizer work better.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love this product it works better than my hands..</li>
            <li>i think this is TOTALLY A BETTER BUY than the clearsonic</li>
            <li>Satisfied with it</li>
            <li>I love that I can use an exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li>do wish there were options for the heads, but I&#x27;m okay with the one they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had been looking at this and the $200 products for many months now.</li>
            <li>I used it on the slowest setting across my nose and cheeks because that&#x27;s where I used my Pore cleanser most</li>
            <li>/&gt;That works 100x better than this machine.</li>
            <li>A wash cloth does a much better job at cleaning and exfoliating than this product.</li>
            <li>I feel like the rotating brush cleaned better than hands alone..</li>
            <li>I love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I feel one could achieve better results with a toothbrush on the face.</li>
            <li>There are much better and even cheaper drugstore alternatives.</li>
            <li>It is OK.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is just ok.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I use this daily, and I am very happy with the results after using this product since February.</li>
            <li>Plus it made my skin feel smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>NOW, AN EXFOLIATER WORKS BETTER.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Walgreens for $25 :).</li>
            <li>ran out, i bought the clarisonic Refreshing gel CLEANSER which is about $20 and used it with</li>
            <li>It replaced a facial bristle brush I purchased from a dollar tree, and I have been thoroughly impressed with the difference.</li>
            <li>I love the way it cleans my face.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling of using this brush system.</li>
            <li>May want to spend more money for more power.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is okay</li>
            <li>Makes my night time routine easier and my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent device for the price compared to pricier types that do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could use it more efficiently on my body.</li>
            <li>I might buy more as gifts for my siblings.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; and thank you for reading my review.  :)</li>
            <li>Like many others I wanted the Mia</li>
            <li>This is an excellent facial cleansing tool.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use too many products, with this</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It seems sturdy &amp; it works OK.  </li>
            <li>Pay more get more...</li>
            <li>After about 2 months of using this, my wife&#x27;s skin is noticeable smoother and more radiant.  </li>
            <li>easy to clean and looks good when you have a bunch of stuff on the shelf or in your shower.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li>Love it, I bought one for each my mom, sister, and me.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I assumed it stopped working because I dropped it so many times.  </li>
            <li>another would have been better.</li>
            <li>only thing i dont like is the roughness of the brush...other than that it is GREAT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>This brush is okay..</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing system from olay.  </li>
            <li>Boy am I glad i found this product instead.</li>
            <li>all I can say is I get better results by scrubbing with a baby washcloth &amp; soap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the price.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of cheaply made though.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my sister and she&#x27;s in love with it.</li>
            <li>Retin-A that I use are greater and therefore creating better results with skin texture and tone.</li>
            <li>If any of you are trying to get better looking, healthier skin this year</li>
            <li>It lived up to its hype and I am truly content with it and the fact that I didn&#x27;t have to go out and spend $150 is even better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>it needs to have more in it.</li>
            <li>I love the Olay line</li>
            <li>I would buy it again. :)</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare, but I do love the way the ProX makes my face feel after using.</li>
            <li>but if you have acne prone skin probably not the best consider you are reusing the same brush.</li>
            <li>I figured being an Olay Branded product, it would have worked out better.</li>
            <li>I eat healthy and wash my face and medicate over the counter but still have had problems.</li>
            <li>I love it and wish I had bought it sooner.</li>
            <li>and I have have healthier, better looking skin.</li>
            <li>The buttons seem touchy at times, I have to hit it more than once for it to turn on or change speeds.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>So glad I got this.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Cleans better than washing with your hands.</li>
            <li>Im in love with this</li>
            <li>The number one factor that influenced my buy was the price and that Revlon is a reputable brand.</li>
            <li>An OK cleansing device .</li>
            <li>Wish it had more power.</li>
            <li>This gets the job done and I feel like it is cleaning my face much better than just using a facewash.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it four stars is because it could be stronger, but for the price its great!</li>
            <li>Great price, works very well.</li>
            <li>This system is so easy to use and feels so good while doing it and after, one&#x27;s face feels refreshed and so clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good at removing the oil and dirt before it becomes blackheads, the exfoliation is alright, but not as great as a teen</li>
            <li>He asked what I was using because he wanted to try it too &#x3D;).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this brush....</li>
            <li>I love Olay products because they work.</li>
            <li>I LOVE HOW IT SRUBS.</li>
            <li>Why spend $99 or more?</li>
            <li>:) I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this system.</li>
            <li>Can use with any product, but I use the Olay facial cleansers and get great results!</li>
            <li>Researched this product against clarisonic and felt that this was a better buy for the benefit.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this, just wish It worked better cleaning the pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt and looked better.  </li>
            <li>I Love it.  </li>
            <li>and it worked much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure after I&#x27;ve used it awhile</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase the replacement heads for it because I don&#x27;t feel like it works any better than a washcloth.</li>
            <li>I use exfoliating scrub, and this cleans WAY better...</li>
            <li>and I love them both -</li>
            <li>This cleanses and exfoliates/softens, and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I would love it even more.</li>
            <li>i love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of the brush on my skin, however mine kept pausing during use.  </li>
            <li>some should pay more attention to (e.g. pores, blackheads, etc. )</li>
            <li>MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used the sonicare toothbrush for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I have them both.</li>
            <li>but I have used many exfoliating scrubs, masks, and peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even better than the clarisonic in my opinion</li>
            <li>I love this and will be buying this for my family and friends</li>
            <li>this gives you that luxury with a more sensible price tag than paying over $100.</li>
            <li>I like that it is waterproof, and I like that it is battery-operated versus rechargable because it makes it much more portable and compact.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>I get better results by just using my hands.  </li>
            <li>Complexion looks better in three days.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can use it in the shower too.</li>
            <li>This works ok.</li>

            <li>So, if anyone who is still smoking/tanning, no product is going to be able to give you results but if you are not then I recommend trying Olay Pro-x</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li>I do believe that it cleans better than your hands or a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this awesome because it is waterproof</li>

            <li>Ty ProX by Olay Advanced!</li>
            <li>However, after weeks of usage I am convinced that this is a worthwhile addition to one&#x27;s beauty set.</li>
            <li>The cleanser it comes with is okay.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok, I didnt notice any difference.</li>
            <li>I love using it.</li>
            <li>I hesitated to order this product because my go-to cosmetics reviewers at beautypedia say it&#x27;s not any better than a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad i found it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery great price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it, wish it spun even faster.  </li>

            <li>It leaves skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>My face has never looked better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not the product&#x27;s fault, it is more how my skin reacted.  </li>
            <li>switch up the days I use it, in hopes that it gets better.</li>
            <li>Now, my skin is softer and more radiant.</li>
            <li>love most of the Olay products.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as I couldn&#x27;t afford the famous Clarisonic</li>
            <li>It does make the cleanser foam up a bit though, so the creamy ones work better.</li>
            <li>I had been doing better with a soapy washcloth and my fingertips and have returned to that method.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure clarisonic has</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a better one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and effective...can&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li>But, indeed, it&#x27;s a good product and can make you feel fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>100X better than the cheap-o Neutrogena Sonic</li>
            <li>Works ok at beginning.</li>
            <li>I Absolutely Love it&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I love the two speeds, and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li>Wonderful facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It does help to remove more makeup than just using a cleanser or face pad</li>
            <li>I am glad it is safe to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>but I guess it does okay.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is more radiant these days.</li>
            <li>it works just as well for a better price.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much better they are, or how much better they could be for that amount of money.</li>
            <li>I was so tempted to get the Clarisonic but did not want to shell out $200 for it and am so glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Does what it says, and I leave it in the shower for greater convenience.</li>
            <li>This cleansing brush is ok.</li>
            <li>I use this brush twice a day with the tea tree face wash from the Body Shop, my skin feels much better and the acne has reduced drastically.</li>
            <li>Make sure you order extras.</li>
            <li>Yes, I have researched the Clarisonic, and most people would say that it does more than just \\&quot;clean your face\\&quot;, but I think the Pro-X is a pretty good alternative for the price!</li>
            <li>it makes my face feels so clean and smooth !!</li>
            <li>I bought this item because people were saying good things about it and they were right.</li>
            <li>Just use the right moisterizer and sunscreen and you should be good.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for someone who wants smooth, clean skin - without a lot of effort and investment.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel smooth and clean after each wash:)I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>only regret is that I didn&#x27;t take before and after pictures - honestly the results are that good!</li>
            <li>This is the first of this kind of product that I have tried and I love it!</li>
            <li>I dont have to wear as much makeup because my skin has better texture (smoothness!!)</li>
            <li>It is gentle, but very effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but very effective at cleansing the pores in my skin.</li>
            <li>Gentle, but VERY effective.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin and very effective, and a fraction of the price of my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>This is very nice and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The brush is very soft, yet it exfoliates beautifully.  </li>
            <li>And the free clean gel is good.</li>
            <li>love it keeps my face nice and clean</li>
            <li>I have used this product twice so far, at night in the shower, to clean my face thoroughly, and I am very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>My face feels cleaner and my moisturizer is more effective with a clean face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use, feels good when you are using it, and my face is smoother than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li>Contemplated and read reviews for weeks before I bought it (especially excited of all the positive reviews).</li>
            <li>exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li>You do not need to spend that much on a machine and goes in circles!!!!</li>
            <li>although I did want to get a facial cleanse brush, so glad I got this one!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best, but&lt;br /&gt;it is great for traveling, small, light weight and works well.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product out.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to started using</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not completely giving up on the product, because I really like it and when my skin is happy, it looks flawless; however, if I keep getting break outs, I will have to stop using it.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>But so far, so good!  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>but so far it seems to be good, and I hope the quality of my skin will continue to improve!</li>
            <li>I use this system twice a day and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Iwas given this as a gift and even though my complexion is not bad, I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>My fiance was so impressed with the results he asked if they make one with a little more power for men so he can get one! :)</li>
            <li>If not, grab a washcloth, your favorite cleanser, some baking soda - and you probably have a pretty fair match.</li>
            <li>You can use pretty much any cleanser that you want, but exfoliating kinds work best.</li>
            <li>Gives my face a nice clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding that Olay is becoming more and more my product of choice for skincare.  </li>
            <li>After using it, my face feels really nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I am going to purchase my own!</li>
            <li>However, It does do a good job of removing makeup and for a lazy person like me who doesn&#x27;t like scrubbing, this is awesome.</li>
            <li>it feels nice when i used the brush to clean my face though</li>
            <li>Pretty good but doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans my skin significantly more than without it</li>
            <li>I sent this to a truly beautiful 15 year old who has a lovely complexion in the hope that she&#x27;ll continue with that beaufitul</li>

            <li>I loved this so much, I bought it for a friend for her birthday!</li>
            <li>Had first ordered the Clarisonic Plus from another site (good discount) but it would not charge.</li>

            <li>My pores are tighter even though they were pretty good before the product I can still notice the difference after using.  </li>
            <li>and I think it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>But being a fan of Olay for 30 years I knew going in that the chances were pretty darn good that this product would meet or exceed my expectations.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, works well to wash your face.</li>
            <li>I am a frugal person who does not believe in throwing my money away on the trendy things in life just to be cool.</li>

            <li>I am definitely not disappointed!</li>
            <li>For the price it is totally worth it!!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I am still using the original batteries!</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth the price though!!</li>
            <li>Has significantly cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use the face wash sample with it because it made me breakout, but this isn&#x27;t uncommon for me when trying new soaps.</li>
            <li>This one does an awesome job, lasts a very long time even though I use it in the shower every day.</li>
            <li>pretty SWEET!!!</li>
            <li>This entire line is yielding amazing results for me and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>and though it&#x27;s really scratchy and not quite pleasant, it keeps the area</li>
            <li>and I love how easy it is</li>
            <li>Easy &amp; safe to use</li>
            <li>Easy and done. :)</li>
            <li>I love that its battery powered and easy to tote between the sink and shower.</li>
            <li>it works so easy this is better than doing it with a manual brush.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but this device is so easy and enjoyable to use</li>
            <li>Amazing price, and super portable.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and is a nice quality.  </li>
            <li>Can put the face to get rid of excess cutin, I use two times a week now, each time finished face is exquisite and smooth, combined with the mask, the next day, feel the skin look brand-new</li>
            <li>This one uses nice soft bristles that feel good on the face.  </li>
            <li>I have also bought a lot of different cleansers- both high-end brands and drug store, trying to find the best fit for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very frugal, cut &amp; color own hair, make own jewelry,etc &amp;</li>
            <li>more like once a week because I&#x27;m incredibly lax about my facial regime.  </li>
            <li>and I wonder if I could have done better with a slightly more advanced product.</li>
            <li>It did seem kind of harsh, but the brush itself felt great!</li>
            <li>Feels good to get a good facial scrub!</li>
            <li>Additionally, use the Oxy Advanced Cleaning in the shower or after, to ensure that your pores are open and the brush can do the best job it can.</li>
            <li>Good for teens but not as pricey and the replacement brushes are more reasonable too.</li>
            <li>I use this once or twice a day (with both the included cleanser and my own, in conjunction with another facial products) and my skin condition has greatly improved.</li>
            <li>I love using this brush, it makes my skin soft and happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and kind of cheap feeling.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it&#x27;s gentle and yet it does a good job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Great product at a very modest price.</li>
            <li>This machine is very easy to use and leaves my skin felling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad most users are experiencing good results, but I&#x27;m not reading anything extraordinary that would make me run right out and buy it.  </li>
            <li>This brush paired with a great moisturizer has completely solved the problem, almost immediately!  </li>
            <li>Great tool for a modest price!</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that has actually helped me achieve that beautiful flawless skin I&#x27;ve dreamed of all my life.</li>
            <li>in all it works, and it&#x27;s better than using paper towels (better for the environment/less trash), which is what I normally use because wash clothes aren&#x27;t supposed to be good for your face (unless you bleach them).</li>
            <li>I love it, it leaves my skin very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I was considering diving head first into the clarisonic craze since there are so many good reviews out there, but I thought I might as well try this first since it&#x27;s so amazingly priced.  </li>
            <li>You think your manual toothbrush is just fine, until you see how great and clean your teeth feel after using an electric toothbrush for the first time</li>
            <li>My skin is fresher and clean!</li>
            <li>and it was completely clean!</li>
            <li>and my face seemed fine, better even.  </li>
            <li>After two uses, my face feels so clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean!</li>
            <li>My face is finally clean!</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so clean!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gay and my skin feels better</li>
            <li>I also use it to clean my rings!</li>
            <li>My face feels really, really clean, haven&#x27;t felt that way in years!</li>
            <li>You can feel it clean through your skin and just exfoliate your pores!</li>
            <li>my face was never washed this clean before!</li>
            <li>My face felt so clean!</li>
            <li>I always feel clean and it is so relaxing, plus you can take it in the shower!</li>
            <li>&amp; I look &amp; feel relaxed, clean &amp; exfoliated!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my face and pores were!</li>
            <li>I can feel the clean and soon as i start putting on on my face!</li>
            <li>I have been wanting something to clean my face thoroughly and this is it!</li>
            <li>My face feels tingly and clean!</li>
            <li>and then I used this on what I thought was my clean face and immediately saw the difference on the pad- DIRT!</li>
            <li>Face looked brighter and so clean!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin clean and&lt;br /&gt;Fresh!</li>
            <li>Works best with the Olay &amp;#34;designed&amp;#34; cream, which I do not particularly like...</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin nice and clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I truly believe the brush does a better job at enabling products to clean the skin better than a washcloth.</li>
            <li>I think it is a great product.t provides a much deeper clean than you can get with just using a cleanser and wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I love the way the brush spins 360 degrees, it feels like I&#x27;m getting a deeper and more thorough clean than the Clarasonics 10 degree spin.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my face feel, so clean and smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finally able to properly clean all the junk out of my pores every day, giving my face a better chance of healing and looking the clearest it has looked in a while.</li>
            <li>It scrubs my pores clean and my face is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>have used mine for more than a year and my skin looks clean and Healthy</li>
            <li>I used my awesome Delon cotton rounds (sold on amazon) to remove what the face wash and pro x didn&#x27;t remove and NOTHING showed up on my still white and clean rounds.</li>
            <li>My products do better with my skin because of the clean that I am able to get with this device.</li>
            <li>It face wash very clean, compact, easy to carry.</li>
            <li>Very nice cleansing - leaves my face very soft.  </li>
            <li>Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li>I saw a segment from Dr. Phils s company \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot; and the plastic surgeon said you would get very good results if you used it regularly.</li>
            <li>Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very good product.  </li>
            <li>the cleanser that came with it was very good and even seemed to get off any left over makeup after i used my makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and extremely easy to keep clean and store.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job at cleansing and I recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap and high quality brush.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and am super pleased with it!</li>
            <li>Ive used this product for a month now because I wanted to make sure that my review was accurate.</li>
            <li>but I do know that the Olay version is amazing and well worth the $.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on A LOT better and it wears longer because I&#x27;m not sweating it off with my huge pores.</li>
            <li>I get the most satisfaction when I&#x27;m applying foundation because now it&#x27;s so smooth and glowing</li>
            <li>It feels great on my face which I consider it to be sensitive since I have Rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I love my Olay Pro-X - as my face feels really smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating which comes with the box is great and i am using it every day although I am having sensitive skin \\&quot;oily</li>
            <li>THIS WORKS GREAT FOR MY ACNE PRONE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been used for about a month, and so far works great for a low-cost item.</li>
            <li>I reacted to the free sample exfoliator (sensitive skin) but the brush is excellent and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Excellent, cleans skin better than a wash cloth and brush is soft on the skin, not irritating.</li>
            <li>First, I want to start out my review by saying WOW, I AM SO IMPRESSED!!!</li>
            <li>Enjoy, I am sure you will.</li>
            <li>Might be ideal for traveling since it&#x27;s lighter and smaller</li>
            <li>the results are basically the same you end up with beautifully exfoliated healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>My skin cleared up, and my makeup goes on much more smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love it and my skin looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have been using it with the Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser (which is great) but as soon as that&#x27;s gone I will give the Olay Pore Scrub a try.</li>
            <li>but so far, the Olay brush has been great.  </li>
            <li>this cheap anyway.  :)</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and works great</li>
            <li>So far, this has been a great buy.</li>
            <li>Most companies are too cheap to supply you with batteries.</li>
            <li>Its soft, but cleanses great.</li>
            <li>It feels more scratchy than anything and after using it my skin doesn&#x27;t feel smooth like they say.</li>
            <li>It works great and leaves my skin so soft and dewy looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to use a light touch and go over your face a couple of times than to push the brush into your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended it and wow it is great.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth feels after washing with this brush.</li>
            <li>When i first opened the product i was very satisfied with the look because it had reached my expetations.</li>
            <li>Does an excellent job for a minimal price.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful for a smooth face with better tone</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with it and will recommend to others.</li>
            <li>Now I have a soft face, and I am so happy.  </li>
            <li>Great on sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>Yes, an Advanced Cleansing System, but I wish it had a easier-to-grasp  and more descriptive name.</li>
            <li>I checked on Amazon for something more affordable, and I came across this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>It seems too soft at first but when it spin it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li>Use it for 30 seconds and it&#x27;ll be the best 30 bucks you ever spent on your face.</li>
            <li>And it truly does seem to make my face cream more effective from the first try.</li>
            <li>My opinion, is that this is going to be great, but if your skin is sensitive, just use the face cleanser that you know works with your skin</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, because it is pretty powerful, but it is great for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I love the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>My face is extremely smooth after using this product and I will continue to use this until something better comes out.</li>
            <li>, I feel my face is more smoothly, ^_^&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li>first time I used the PROx with the included cleanser, I have to say I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It is the best money I have spent on a face product in ages.  </li>
            <li>it is the best beauty secret I now own!  </li>
            <li>And the most important thing i got it for 17 $ with the coupon.</li>
            <li>: always make sure you moisturize after you use this (even if you have oily skin - use an oil free moisturizer) to prevent it from becoming flaky.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I find myself touching my face to see if it&#x27;s still really so smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an avid user of scrubs, scrubbing pads, etc, and this has given me the best results by far, without irritation.</li>
            <li>and when I go get my makeup done professionally, they tell me how great my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>anyway~ enjoy~ :) .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this tool, and I would completely recommend it.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and the 2 speeds are great.</li>
            <li>I really love the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>When I use it, my face feels more smooth and it does help with exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using it and would take even more time with it.</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System is okay</li>
            <li>This is an incredible idea, but lacks the real punch that most of us with problem skin really desire.</li>
            <li>My 4-star rating is primarily because I love the Olay line of products.  </li>
            <li>fabulous love</li>
            <li>I noticed that even for it&#x27;s soft bristles compared to the Clarisonic it still does a really great job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Felt great on the skin, soft but my skin broke out and that&#x27;s even with cleaning the brush.</li>
            <li>I just love my Olay Pro-x Advanced Cleansing System..</li>
            <li>Best of all, you can use this on rough areas of your body like your elbows as well- for that purpose</li>
            <li>I have never felt my face this smooth in many months (I get quarterly facials).</li>
            <li>have to admit, I am so glad I gave the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System a try.  </li>
            <li>pretty good leaves smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive yet oily skin, and it works great on me.</li>
            <li>It feels good after I use it but can&#x27;t tell much difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this one, hoping it would work as good as the reviews indicated and it absolutely does.</li>
            <li>This helps really get a good scrubbing on your face.</li>
            <li>This is gentle and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>, It really works good, hold batterey power</li>
            <li>do not use it as much as i should but for the money stimulates your skin,  good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reviewing the Pro-X because I also own a Clarisonic Pro and thought my opinion may be useful to some buyers.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought my grandmother one</li>
            <li>Good luck, and thanks for reading my review</li>
            <li>Good luck, and thanks for reading my review</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already used this product before and loved it so much i decided to buy another one to bring with me on holidays.</li>
            <li>I also have tried the Clarisonic and think the Olay Pro-X is just as good for much lower price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I loved it so much I bought one for my sink as well.  </li>
            <li>so soft~its made in china，his material feels very soft，small and exquisite。very good ~！Exfoliate</li>
            <li>This brush is not as powerful as I would have liked, but I am keeping for the price.  </li>
            <li>So I waited awhile to review this to really get a good feel for</li>
            <li>Loved the gentle yet thorough exfoliation with 2 speed brushes.  </li>
            <li>This is so much cheaper than the Clarisonic face brush and works just as good.</li>
            <li>Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying the whole kit that comes with the brush and the pad, just having the brush is okay, but both are more effective.</li>
            <li>so I see no difference between before and after use, but my mother says that it is really good and works very well after every use</li>
            <li>good for gentle cleaning, not as power as clarisonic</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>loved it so much</li>
            <li>Great product, very easy to use, and if automatic heating to dry the better ...</li>
            <li>because this is a rotating brush instead of a sonic technology but for the price seems just right, its better than just washing your face for sure, it has helped my makeup to stay longer and look better.</li>
            <li>I have not tried any of the higher end cleansing brushes but this brush works great and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Super cheap and effective, my wife loves it！</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, cute, easy use.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Make-up goes on smoother, moisturizers and acne products soak in more quickly and over-all better.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed at the quick results especially with reduction in blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>Love, this is I&#x27;ve always wanted to buy, I feel very great, light makeup skin care no longer discharge makeup, is washed clean, cheap, but forgot to buy the brush head, the next time also come</li>
            <li>Wash clean and very comfortable</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and can help me clean my face.</li>
            <li>so I used my own, it washes all right</li>
            <li>I had to wash it off right away, then start over with a cleanser of my own.  </li>
            <li>wash face with olay pro-x brush + exfoliating creme (right now I&#x27;m using korres rose scrub)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling super clean and I love it!</li>
            <li>I then used the rotating soft bristle device and my skin has never felt smoother or looked more even in tone... and that is after just 1 use!!</li>
            <li>This brush is what I was looking for - soft, but very effective.</li>
            <li>after some days,I found skin more fine and smooth.</li>
            <li>My face feels very clean and smooth after each use.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my face very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product, works great and last long.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a wonderful product</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I know...sounds corny, but it it true!</li>
            <li>well, I&#x27;ve tried other machines but this one is the best!</li>
            <li>I use mine every other day and the cleansing brush is still in great shape!!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably due to my glasses and the build up of oil under them, but when I started using this thing it was great!</li>
            <li>easy to use, and it is comfort when touch the skin, clean the skin pretty good</li>
            <li>I had one of the original Olay face cleaners and that was so much better.</li>
            <li>So after watching a shopping channel show on the Clarisonic Mia, I began researching that product and more budget friendly versions.</li>
            <li>I love Oil of Olay products and I was not disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li>Other then that, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This was such a good buy!</li>
            <li>I would like it to have a variable speed or direction, but other than that it is awesome.</li>
            <li>Due to this I try to take care of my face the best I can.</li>
            <li>so I went looking for a more budget friendly alternative.  </li>
            <li>But other then that it was a great purchase!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made the most significant difference in my skin of anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I know I shouldn&#x27;t be so excited about washing my face, but with this I just can&#x27;t help it :)  </li>
            <li>Not a bad product!</li>
            <li>I have large pores, that tend to clog easily and form lots of blackheads and no exfoliant on it&#x27;s own has ever been able to solve the problem, so I bought this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tiny and light device and works very good, but I had some problems with dispatch and it took a month.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say the first time I use this product.i saw a immediate difference in my skin,this is a awesome product ,it left my skin smooth and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Face feels very clean and bright after use, and is very soft to touch.</li>
            <li>Yes many acne products contribute but in the end, keeping it clean is the most essential component of having great</li>
            <li>Batteries went in easily (contrary to another review), BUT I couldn&#x27;t get the brush head to snap on.</li>
            <li>Easily blemished.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this Olay cleansing brush, I wondered if it could clean better than a washcloth using either the Olay cleanser that comes with it or my Dove/baking soda combination.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love how clean my face feels after.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Water got inside or these easily and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>No matter how many face cleansers I would use, I would get out of the shower and still my face would have make up and not feel or look clean.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>It will travel easily.</li>
            <li>I found the motor to be very adequate for the purposes this device was built for.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a way to make sure I got my face completely clean once the day was over.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and refresh after every use, and I have noticed that my skin looks even better than it did before.</li>
            <li>I believe that it does clean the skin better than just using a washcloth or your hands.</li>
            <li>Love this, my face is shiny clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>but I really love how clean it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that, I can easily get around all the curves and angles of my face, even my nose, with ease.</li>
            <li>Easy to use in the shower</li>
            <li>and that makes it easy to get.  </li>
            <li>and that makes it easy to get.</li>
            <li>I take it easy</li>
            <li>It also makes it easy to take with you when you travel.</li>
            <li>I like feeling more clean with using this product.</li>
            <li>They swap out easily so</li>
            <li>skin is oily, t-zone oily and my pores are easily clogged</li>
            <li>The brush is easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>The brush head is easy to remove and replace.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit stubborn, but it&#x27;s easy to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Brush has always worked great, replacing batteries every few months to keep a good spin.</li>
            <li>be sure to have a good moisturizer near by.</li>
            <li>I just manuever around that and spend more time on each part of my face, but it gets my face really clean</li>
            <li>and then it comes off easily.  </li>
            <li>I just love it, it leaves my skin clean with no make up and after use my skin looks radiant.</li>
            <li>not something you can easily do when washing with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>considering some similar products cost $50-$75 or more, the price was great and the product&lt;</li>
            <li>If any start to sprout, it goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li>End of the day works great for me because it gets rid of the grime from the day and lets my night cream seep in more, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>It was easy to put together as well.</li>
            <li>I love how clean my face feels after using this at night.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, if you&#x27;re considering the name brand, you may as well just buy this to give it a try and make sure you want to invest that much.  </li>
            <li>Can be used in the shower and is easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use in the shower.  </li>

            <li>The Olay Pro-X works great and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use it with the acne free severe kit and it has made a huge difference with my skin, I am just so glad I decided to try this because nothing was working for my acne.</li>
            <li>It works great, and I use it with my favorite Origins facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just does a better job in keeping your face clean.</li>
            <li>I use the generic wal mart brand of Cetaphil cream cleanser with this and it works great :)</li>
            <li>This brush seems to clean deeper because the bristles are more separated.</li>
            <li>This is really easy to&lt;br /&gt;use.</li>
            <li>Easy 5 stars...</li>
            <li>It zapped off all of my makeup easily, and my witch hazel</li>
            <li>I works with any cleanser and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and everone should have one.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic gives you a better clean feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it myself and the blackheads on my nose are easily removed without me having to squeeze them out.</li>
            <li>so you can easily wash the soap off your face.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use, unless to install the battery.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>Easy to use once or twice a day depending on what you prefer.</li>
            <li>It does clean my face better than just my hands, but I prefer the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I truly believe better skin starts with the way you clean your skin.</li>
            <li>We have 2 of these things and they do work well and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Dermabration is still a better way to clean the skin.  </li>
            <li>easy to hold and cleans efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>Will be easy to take on trip.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could use it more often because I believe the moisturizers I use are better absorbed after using it.</li>
            <li>The products works well and it was easy to replace batteries after reading the instructions in amazon.</li>
            <li>Wow I really like this product, leaves my face feeling just wonderful.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>can astringe the pores on my face and easy to bring for traveling.</li>
            <li>I love this because it&#x27;s perfect to slough off dead skin around my nose.  </li>
            <li>however, ii makes my skin feel super nice and clean; and helps remove excess makeup.</li>
            <li>So squeaky clean and smooth feeling after!</li>
            <li>Then it&#x27;s extremely easy to take off.</li>
            <li>I received the product very quickly and I like the way it cleans my face and</li>
            <li>I STRONGLY ADVISE EVERYONE NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>The brush itself itsnt quite as strong as I thought it would be</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong as to damage the skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over a month without breakouts or issues and the batteries are still going strong (the ones that came with it).</li>
            <li>The brush will pop off from time to time, but it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly considered returning it, but she does use it, so I kept it since it was not that expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than some of the name more popular ones, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>I guess the produce was too strong for my face.</li>
            <li>There are two speed settings, but neither one is too strong.</li>
            <li>Unless you have exceptionally strong hands, don&#x27;t even think about ordering this brush.</li>
            <li>I saw the Pro-X in the store, but just assumed it was an inferior product until I saw the strong rating on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I is not as strong as I would like, I bought it based on reviews</li>
            <li>The two speed setting is nice and the brush is soft yet effective.  </li>
            <li>I have one of those 5x mirrors, so I&#x27;ve been able to really see how effective this product has been.</li>
            <li>And the motor doesn&#x27;t seem that strong.  </li>
            <li>A good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li>So Thanks to Good Morning America &amp; Olay Pro-X Advanced  Cleansing System</li>
            <li>While this product does work fairly well and do what it claims, It isn&#x27;t a very natural cleanser, which is much more important than you might think.</li>
            <li>It is a great product, feel like my face is very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t high tech or fancy, but does a good job.  </li>
            <li>But I highly recommend to use a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, but effective.</li>
            <li>She has pretty flawless skin anyway, but this just get&#x27;s all those impurities out and leaves her face clean and clear.</li>
            <li>My face felt so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>The liquid cleanser isn&#x27;t special at all, nor does it have an appealing smell.</li>
            <li>Its ok nothing special if I would have known I would have purchased a manual face brush</li>
            <li>good product, good price, much better price that the other name brand, cleanes well use it often to keep pores clean</li>
            <li>Overall, a very good product, it is great for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>my face feels very clean and fresh !</li>
            <li>and it felt great on the face, not rough.</li>
            <li>Great system, easy to use, and does the trick to keep skin clean and clear at affordable price.</li>
            <li>and I noticed an amazing difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>It is nice getting my face nice and smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for guys, too, so don&#x27;t be turned off by the fact that it&#x27;s made by Olay and generally marketed towards women.</li>
            <li>now that&#x27;s pretty amazing,</li>
            <li>This device is amazing at reducing blackheads, shrinking pores, and overall giving the user a smooth, bright complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Weeks have passed and I am still very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone even considering throwing away so much money on the Clairsonic.</li>
            <li>so I cannot compare but this product on it&#x27;s own is amazing, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging dock, and the brush heads are more affordable, smaller than the mia2.</li>
            <li>This is the first product of this kind that I have tried.</li>
            <li>After I got mine and used it the first time, I looked around the house and ended up making my own travel protector sleeve out of a (used) K-Cup -</li>
            <li>I liked the novalty of this when i first bought it</li>
            <li>I did try the exfoliating cleanser sample that came with it this morning and that seemed pretty nice.</li>
            <li>This was a great deal, good price, and fast, affordable international shipping.</li>
            <li>it is pretty effective.</li>
            <li>With the kind of price, it is doing its job very well!</li>
            <li>and I really liked it the first time i used it my face looked so radiant</li>
            <li>I have also dropped it many times on the floor and in a full tub of water.</li>
            <li>I honestly saw results the day after the first use.  </li>
            <li>and if I liked it I could always invest in a higher end product.  </li>
            <li>This was my first brush of this kind.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with Freeman&#x27;s Feeling Beautiful Pineapple Enzyme Facial Mask</li>
            <li>Hot water, soap, a washcloth, and your own hands.  </li>
            <li>you have enough to have a beautiful skin</li>
            <li>In fact, about two weeks after starting to use the product a woman walked up to me in the grocery store and told me I had beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>My skins is more visibly softer, and it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>even though I live in Italy, it took only 10 days, and the packaging was very safe, very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with the ProX face cleaner, it leaves your face feeling clean and baby soft.  </li>
            <li>But this product gives you a great clean and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This thing really works and i get a good clean face after using it.</li>
            <li>Love it- super easy to travel with, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>But when I make sure to clean it after use, then my skin looks fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to take a chance with the Olay Pro-X. Leaves my face feeling so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Best part is I do not have to buy all the other products in order to get this as a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; gift from the TV ad!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product and was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and effective right in the comfort of your own bathroom.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for a good price and it will definitely make your skin cleaner, but does not get rid of pimples right away.</li>
            <li>A pulsing back and forth would probably be more effective, and the sonic products that cost a lot more are definitely more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wash hands in warm water mild soap, clean under nails (even short ones) rigorously with nail clipper file thing lol.</li>
            <li>works great  at a very reasonable price, I can not see why somebody would pay $200 for a simular product really what fools they must be</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and smooth and for the first time in forever, I&#x27;ve been able to go outside with no BB cream&lt;br /&gt;or foundation :D</li>
            <li>A good price and my face feel new everytime</li>
            <li>Then, of course, you need to buy new brushes fairly often.</li>
            <li>It was fine.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed that you will need to buy more brushes and those extra brushes would&#x27;ve been nice!</li>
            <li>I became more and more interested in the clarisonic mia brush (the cheapest model) but that week I saw an ad for this Olay brush.</li>
            <li>This machine seems just fine.  </li>
            <li>I thought my exfoliating cleansers were doing a fine job with removing make-up and oils at night.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t try to scrub your face, this is just fine.  </li>
            <li>It still works fine..</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works out fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof too, so it&#x27;s shower friendly if you like to clean your face while showering!</li>
            <li>This was the first facial cleansing brush I have purchased, and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>but it worked fine.</li>
            <li>and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>After a year the brush is still fine and the batteries still working.  </li>
            <li>I would like to fine another with some horse power.</li>
            <li>But I enjoy using it, it comes with two speeds, easy to use.</li>
            <li>The cleaner looks fine in quality。But</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro works just fine to exfoliate</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It just does not meet my needs but is fine for now.</li>
            <li>My skin feels wonderful and I am having less breakouts now as well.</li>
            <li>the sample cleanser worked fine.</li>
            <li>The ProX is fine.</li>
            <li>and it still works just fine...</li>
            <li>does the job just fine, may get another one as a gift.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cleans skin well and works fine with any soap.  </li>
            <li>I have had considerably less breakouts since using this and to me, that is priceless.</li>
            <li>and she said if I got one of these brushes, I should be fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, smoother, and the fine lines around my eyes and lips are gone, and my skin is always hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I tried the cleanser that came with it and was less impressed.  </li>
            <li>It was fine, but nothing I would buy again.  </li>
            <li>I use mine nightly and have fewer fine lines, glowing skin and look rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>This one is the perfect replacement but for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li>While I could not take this product seriously at first (Mr. and I were going through a bag of goodies we were gifted and this was included), I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This brush from Olay works just fine.</li>
            <li>IT WAS FINE SINCE APRIL 2014, BUT, NOW THE BRUSH WILL NOT STAY ON.  </li>
            <li>I Love Olay products and this is my first time using this :).</li>
            <li>It works in the shower just fine.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>bought the face wash that goes along with it, but I also use another face wash and they both seem just fine.</li>
            <li>but for now this one will do just fine.  </li>
            <li>and it kept working just fine.  </li>
            <li>have purchased many many products from Amazon and this is the first review I have writen</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable on your face an easy to you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, I suppose.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s light weight and can travel easily, too.</li>
            <li>the Olay Pro-X does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are diminished around my eyes.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford that system, then this will do just fine, while it lasts.</li>
            <li>Works fine for me.  </li>
            <li>but this one does the job just fine.  </li>
            <li>i used this for the first time this morning and left the shower with my face feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li>It works fine in the beginning.</li>
            <li>Great product fast delivery thanks!</li>
            <li>The cleaner supplied is god, but I&#x27;ve tried Nivea ones and they also work fine.</li>
            <li>It worked fine and had two speeds.</li>
            <li>This does the job just fine, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and it works just fine on the spinning brush head.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and works fine</li>
            <li>and I think they all work fine.</li>
            <li>and it is still working fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Moisturizer absorbs more quickly than before and offsets and additional dryness caused by this method of cleansing.    </li>
            <li>Luckily, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about that!</li>
            <li>Super affordable for a quality product!</li>
            <li>You may want to start off with something more mild, like the L&#x27;Oreal 360 scrubbing tool before graduating to this type of cleaning system.might.</li>

            <li>lucky me, she loves it!  </li>
            <li>It strongly reminded me of one of those cheap portable hand fans you buy at the dollar store attached with a baby brush.</li>
            <li>However, after using the Olay Pro-x, the number of breakouts reduced tremendously!</li>
            <li>something is clearing up my mild acne!</li>
            <li>A quick google search shows the many awards this product has received and the hundreds of reviews attest to its quality.</li>
            <li>Any moisturizing product that is applied after cleaning absorbs quickly and much more thoroughly than before.  </li>
            <li>I  am in love, my new fave!!!!</li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin) but it still does a good job.</li>
            <li>At 28 my fair skin still is very sensitive, and I break out often.</li>
            <li>like it so much I am hoping to get two more as gifts!</li>
            <li>Hahaha, I love this product!</li>
            <li>Not to mention this product makes it very fun and easy.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft but it does a good job, and the brush itself cleans easily.  </li>
            <li>and the soap that comes with it isn&#x27;t any better than the super cheap stuff.  </li>
            <li>Has a fairly strong movement, but soft on the face and neck, just what I wanted and feels good.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li>its easy to clean and easy to store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>A great buy, face feels super soft after use.</li>
            <li>It has fine beads in it for exfoliating (it doesn&#x27;t suds at all if that is important to you).</li>
            <li>You can run your fingernail across in a certain way and they ooze out, but you can&#x27;t see them unless you&#x27;re investigating your own face in the mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular unit is a must have!!!!</li>
            <li>Those little exfoliating sponges are great!</li>
            <li>I am glad that I tried the Olay first and as a result will not invest $150.00 on the original version of this cleansing system, as I cannot imagine it does that much more than the Olay does.</li>
            <li>I bought this a little over a month ago and have been using it once a day (my nightly routine) and I have to say that I am highly impressed!</li>
            <li>This is the best little device I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>and after I am done it feels like I just had a facial, very pleased!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this little contraption.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, it feels like you&#x27;re getting a wonderful little face massage while using.</li>
            <li>Great way to deep clean your face and clean out those pores !  </li>
            <li>It cleanses my face so well, getting rid of most of my blemishes while not drying it out too much!!</li>
            <li>This little thing is excellent quality with two speed settings.</li>
            <li>This little machine is awesome.</li>
            <li>To be perfect it should spin a little faster.</li>
            <li>This little machine works great!</li>
            <li>I love this so much!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t willing to drop $200+ on a Clarisonic, so this was the next best option I could find, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it came so fast!!</li>
            <li>This little scrubber is wonderful!</li>
            <li>and though it seems like the motion is not doing much, I&#x27;m sure it did clean my face because I have had no painful breakouts.</li>
            <li>I suppose my expectations weren&#x27;t really high, so I was very pleased when I tried this out.  </li>
            <li>Use it carefully and you can expect to get very good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use it carefully and you can expect to get very good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also helps with shaving or waxing, because the fine hairs that don&#x27;t always grow completely out get released from the skin so your waxing or shaving is more effective.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong on the original battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little product, sold at like a tenth of the price of its competitor, does the job fantastically well, and it also an excellent companion to a light exfoliator like the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub.  </li>
            <li>After one use, I was able to tell that my skin looked cleaner... more vibrant!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see a good clean face with the enclosed wash unless you have a new born baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>After using it, I find that my face feels very clean and soft, even to the point that I&#x27;m not always sure if I have cleaned all my cleanser off!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 4 days in and see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and wash my face really comfortable and clean</li>
            <li>which is a HUGE plus because I have found that rechargeable ones just start losing their charging power.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a week now and have noticed a huge change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>As for the two speeds, I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the two.  </li>
            <li>It is a great buy and refills are available on the same page.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of exfoliating, from home made scrubs to luxurious products</li>
            <li>I will say that I have no complaints but not seeing a huge improvement from scrubbing with my fingers</li>
            <li>HUGE difference in my face after cleansing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and have noticed a HUGE difference in my pores and the texture of my face.</li>
            <li>and my pores went from huge to almost invisible.</li>
            <li>Almost immediately I noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I prefer the faster of the two, but the slower is nice for more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I can already see/feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I love this product use with my own natural cleaning products...</li>
            <li>and I have already seen a huge improvement in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>This has made a huge difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li>but I can tell a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and handle comfortable to hold and sealed well to keep water out so as not to damage batteries.  </li>
            <li>It has helped hugely with preventing breakouts.</li>
            <li>Great scrubber...soft, but cleans deep into your pores.</li>
            <li>This Olay Cleansing System is truly a great product, I use it several times a week!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome and you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve ended up being its primary user.  </li>
            <li>But as women do, we get sucked in by &#x27;the next great product guaranteeing the Fountain of Youth&#x27;  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will start by saying, I am not a woman, but I can see this thing being more useful to them with the make</li>
            <li>it leaves my face feeling so smooth</li>
            <li>but overall I think it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>Also, I have tendonitis and honestly, sometimes my hands hurt so much that I don&#x27;t wash my face because it hurts to make those motions with my hands or to hold a scrubby or towel.</li>
            <li>Feels comfortable in my hand</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be sucked in by a cheap price.  </li>
            <li>But overall great product.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough great things about this brush.</li>
            <li>I am gonna buy that woman a great Christmas present this year!</li>
            <li>Gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>After a month of using the Olay Pro-X twice a day, my skin looks and feels silky smooth and my pores are noticeably reduced.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Try it and you&#x27;ll think the price is cheap.</li>
            <li>I liked it for the year that it worked, though I didn&#x27;t really notice the difference on my face.</li>
            <li>my skin has not felt so smooth before in my life.</li>
            <li>Affordable and overall a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, but gentle - my skin has never been irritated by the brush.</li>
            <li>At 71, cleansing and moisturizing is important if you don&#x27;t want to look like a shrunken potato.</li>
            <li>my skin ends up so smooth.  </li>
            <li>My husband even noticed how smooth and radiant my face looked after using the brush with the exfoliation facewash.  </li>
            <li>My face becomes soft and bright.</li>
            <li>Having suffered from acne since I can remember and being on various prescription face medication, this is the first time I can honestly say that my skin is noticeably and remarkably clearer.</li>
            <li>If you are realistically never going to spend the money on the Clarisonic, then I guess this could be a great addition to your face cleansing routine to give you some extra exfoliation.</li>
            <li>The results are sooo over my expectations for the cheap price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and it is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>but the facial scrubber was great.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li>When I use my moisturizer on my face,my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, haven&#x27;t had break outs in a while.</li>
            <li>Literally after using this product one time, my skin felt incredibly smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I do have the line of products that came with it.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various cleansers and they all work great with this.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more powerful</li>
            <li>I will see what else is available to use with the brush.</li>
            <li>what kind of cleanser you use because either way the brush is what&#x27;s really doing the trick.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a must buy for great skin,</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something comparable but without the big price tag, this product is great.</li>
            <li>and it is such a great price.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product though for those on a budget</li>
            <li>I will say that when you are using it on your face it feels wonderful and even after you are done using it your face feels tingly for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Cleans well, gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth</li>
            <li>I had some pore issues and this lightly scrubs your skin, which cleared the problem for me.</li>
            <li>It is great for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>plus you get free shipping.</li>
            <li>Replacement brushes are also available for sell.</li>
            <li>For the difference in cost between the two, this is totally worth it, and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It also made my sides of my face smooth</li>
            <li>This product super-cleans my skin and leaves it so smooth that the rest of my skincare products glide on and</li>
            <li>This is great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t nearly as nice, and I don&#x27;t think the brush rotates as fast.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great brush for the money.</li>
            <li>and after I am done my face feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use and leave it in the shower, which makes me more apt to use it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>The Olay&#x27;s brush head is so much softer, but still really effective.</li>
            <li>I bought this product, because Im too cheap to buy a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product, especially with the price that Amazon charges.</li>
            <li>I had low expectations though I had read great reviews.  </li>
            <li>I did find that using it was a bit much for my skin - any kind of exfoliation, mechanical (like this) or chemical (retinoids,</li>
            <li>Compared to similar cleaning brushes out there the price is great.</li>
            <li>Overall, GREAT product and</li>
            <li>I enjoy my pro-x system.</li>
            <li>Her face feels smooth.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and is great!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth way more</li>
            <li>I had always wanted to have one of these advanced cleaning systems but didn&#x27;t think that they would be affordable.</li>
            <li>but overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li>What I really liked about this cleanser is that you really feel it working after one use</li>
            <li>Pulls the skin when used, even with a light hand.</li>
            <li>But overall for the price I paid, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely softer since I started using this once or twice a week and has a great glow.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made for the price,and I feel it is overpriced by about $10.</li>
            <li>My result, is a smoother complexion, if it is used with a great facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>The cleansing system really works effectively.  </li>
            <li>I use the low speed now &amp; find it does a great job cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li>but the brush works great; especially on Acne Prone skin.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 because I wish there was a softer brush available or a body brush.  </li>
            <li>Works great, smaller size, and two speeds.</li>
            <li>and my skin looked fabulous.</li>
            <li>it still proves to be able to handle being in the water</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this item and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different cleansing and exfoliating products and by far this is the best one.</li>
            <li>all white design looks great.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to grip in</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal and cheaper here than at my local Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li>My face was so smooth it almost felt like my girlfriends</li>
            <li>The brush head replacements are cheap too.</li>
            <li>My skin feel so smooth after using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great that this can be used with any of your preferred facial cleaning product (as the one it comes with does nothing for me).</li>
            <li>but I was too cheap.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Keep it light</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed my skin felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>Pros: cheap, works, can use whatever lotion&#x27;n&#x27;potion</li>
            <li>I got the Pro-X because I am too cheap to buy a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if bristles oscillated so I would not have to do so much work.</li>
            <li>the cheap design follows .......</li>
            <li>Great facial brush</li>
            <li>Its so smooth now</li>
            <li>Makes skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I now fully enjoy using this product nightly.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of use, my skin is looking and feeling fantastic.</li>
            <li>* not rechargeable and no base.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my legs, and I get a really smooth result.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I have taken 10 years of living off my face after using it, and then with the Bel Essence, my skin is even softer, line free, even toned and firmer.</li>
            <li>so foundation would not cause breakouts and I could break free from the catch</li>
            <li>Another product I enjoy from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have heard fabulous things about the clarisonic and knew I couldn&#x27;t justify spending over a hundred dollars on one, so I went looking...  </li>
            <li>I have been using my Olay Pro-X Advanced for about 3-4 months now and can tell a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a smaller brush size than the ProActive and can get in the corner of the nose area and feels like a great exfoliating massage.</li>
            <li>It exfoliated well, was comfortable on my skin, and has lasted a year now without any problems.</li>
            <li>product with make you baby smooth.</li>
            <li>My face feels so silky smooth</li>
            <li>The sponge didn&#x27;t really work for me, but the brush is amazing-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I feel like Olay was cheap about it.</li>
            <li>TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment -</li>
            <li>Feels heavenly with a nice gentle scrub.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This won&#x27;t change your life but it will give your face a nice, gentle scrub.  </li>
            <li>It is soo gentle yet soo effective.</li>
            <li>I found it for such a great price.  </li>
            <li>I bought for my wife and she is quiet happy with it.</li>
            <li>There is no way our own hands are capable of achieving what a machine can do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take time away, but it definitely leaves my skin feeling and looking great.</li>
            <li>I was using it as an exfoliator, and while it was cleaning and exfoliating my face, it wasn&#x27;t leaving my skin as smooth and blemish-free as I had imagined</li>
            <li>how smooth my make up goes on now.  </li>
            <li>Also, I wish there was a micro-dermabrasion head available for this appliance.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>It really exfoliates nicely.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to purchase the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.  </li>
            <li>My skin has improved so much and with the warm weather coming</li>
            <li>The red is attractive and I don&#x27;t store my Pro-X out on my bathroom counter</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it</li>
            <li>The cleanser you use is important too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean out the brush.</li>
            <li>I must say that I was happy with the price, which makes experimentation affordable, especially with Prime Shipping.  </li>
            <li>No need to use harsh exfoliators or masks anymore, the brush is just the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been such a great product that I can&#x27;t imagine what the Clarisonic must be like because this is all I need at a 10th of the price.</li>
            <li>and cheap.</li>
            <li>I have used this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and NutraSonic.</li>
            <li>This Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System works just as well as my NutraSonic did.</li>
            <li>How thoughtful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing too see how much dirt I still have on my skin after removing my makeup.</li>
            <li>I use this with my own cleanser, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li>It just kind of feels like a gentle kaleidoscope of butterflies fluttering on your skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction, ty seller.</li>
            <li>use to use a cheap electric tooth brush but all it did was just vibrate.  </li>
            <li>It was gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li>I enjoy washing my face with it.</li>
            <li>After one use, I can feel my skin refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>It massages the face and is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, but effective.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll trade an acne free face for a tan face any day.</li>
            <li>Overall great.</li>
            <li>Great product and especially at the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning the product (and keeping it clean) seems easy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use purity made simple and this product works great with it.</li>

            <li>We liked this cleanser so much</li>
            <li>I have very oily, acne prone skin and have found this to be amazing at exfoliating and cleaning out my pores each day.</li>

            <li>This product does precisely as advertised.</li>
            <li>My husband said my skin was looking fantastic.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll trade an acne free face for a tan face any day.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be more powerful, but at $20, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>but this  brush is great for around the eyes and nose as the brush is much smaller!</li>
            <li>Really enjoy shopping online.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt my skin so smooth.</li>

            <li>so they too can enjoy the benefits.</li>
            <li>However, I thought the device was too smooth for my skin type.  </li>
            <li>Over all, this product is totally worth the $$ :-)</li>
            <li>My face always feels smooth and stimulated (rosy) when I use it.</li>
            <li>but my skin feels smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great introductory cleansing system for my teen.</li>
            <li>Olay has created a solid product for a great price.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>fantastic-</li>
            <li>easy to keep clean and sterile</li>
            <li>They were very happy with the gifts and use them everyday.  </li>
            <li>its the most thing that changed my skin to a better smoother and more young skin ....</li>
            <li>It works great with Burt&#x27;s Bees scrub as well as facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, seems to apply the cleanser well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great, just wish that it came with extra heads.</li>
            <li>The good thing about an oilier complexion is my skin is younger looking than most of my contemporaries</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>So far so good,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nowhere near as good as my Clarisonic was.</li>
            <li>Smartly, Olay makes the head pop right off, so all was good once I figured out</li>
            <li>I love how super clean my face feels after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much more efficient or effective the brush system is over a hot wash towel and a good scrubbing and to be honest</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin, so it&#x27;s exciting to find something reasonably priced that does the job as well as department store potions.</li>
            <li>NO it won&#x27;t remove wrinkles or do magic on your skin, but what it does is make your skin super increadibly clean.  </li>
            <li>Even if this thing doesn&#x27;t clear up my acne, it feels so good... like a massage.</li>
            <li>so far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far pro-x is helping me good with</li>
            <li>It does a good job for at home cleansing but does not compare to professional cleansing.</li>
            <li>The disc is so soft you don&#x27;t get a good scrub.</li>
            <li>I have had a professional microdermabrasion procedure and this at home kit is just as good.</li>
            <li>+ year old skin has not looked this good in decades.  </li>
            <li>yet so it was a good present for her :)</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I love how the brush head feels on my face and feels super clean after.</li>
            <li>This brush is gentle for the facial skin and cleans perfectly.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It fascinated my young daughter who loved turning it on and watching it rotate, and she \\&quot;brushed\\&quot;</li>
            <li>After all these years, I was so surprised in a good way.</li>
            <li>After all these years, I was so surprised in a good way.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft (feels good on your face).  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and feels good on the skin, without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li>It makes my face so nice and soft and is way better than any micro-bead exfoliator.</li>
            <li>but it is good if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the super clean feel this product gives my face.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I recommend it to any man or woman who wants a fantastic face cleanser without emptying your wallet!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for me because my skin is pretty normal.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find the bristles are baby soft.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and invest in a good cleanser, a good exfoliate and give your face a steam bath every few days.</li>
            <li>I recalled watching \\&quot;The Drs\\&quot; show and they mentioned this brush being just as good as going to a professional clinic and getting the microdermabrasion</li>
            <li>I am confident that I will love the clarisonic just as much.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was a day late but the product was perfect! :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use Olay products though so I am using the brush with Shiseido which is really good for Asian skin. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>GOOD FOR DAILY CARE OF HEALTHY SKIN</li>
            <li>I love the Pro-X so much that I bought 3 more for my family members for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, does what it&#x27;s meant to do without irratating my skin.</li>
            <li>It sure does, wayyyy better than using a washcloth or scrubby pad while being gentle on the face.</li>
            <li>I use very light pressure and it still gets my skin very clean and smooth and ready for moisturizer and makeup.  </li>
            <li>The brushes were very soft, and i don&#x27;t feel like it was any better than using my own hand to clean my face.</li>
            <li>That rotating brush had just the right amount of softness, as the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System has 2 speeds which feels great on the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I love that I can keep it right in the shower...</li>
            <li>I ordered it and as soon as I got it, I was able to use it right away ...</li>
            <li>The two speed options are great: the gentle one is perfect for my face every other night (after removing my makeup, I use my own cleanser with the brush) and my face feels as clean and fresh as if I&#x27;ve just had a facial.  </li>
            <li>Both of them work fine and did a job to clean my face.</li>
            <li>It works fine to clean your face</li>
            <li>My skin looks remarkably clean after a couple of uses and there has been a reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really happy I bought this, and I&#x27;m excited to see continued improvement in my skin&#x27;s dryness and dullness.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin so smooth and clean and the moisturizer gets absorbed by skin so much better after cleaning.</li>
            <li>But I was more happy about the oxy pro cleaning system then any other gift I got (b-day).</li>
            <li>I use it once a day with my own gentle cleanser - worth the $!</li>
            <li>I bought this product and at first it didn&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li>everyone should try this first!!</li>
            <li>It works so well on the skin and is so gentle!!!</li>
            <li>THIS HAS HELPED MY Acne SOOOOO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li>A very useful machine.</li>
            <li>but it is very powerful</li>
            <li>It could be very useful to teens as well.</li>
            <li>Very effective and quiet.</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>Its a very good product in which at first was hesitant to try but was relieved that it was better than expected.</li>

            <li>My skin feels so smooth and clean and it helps self tanner go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Now if only there were a tool to lift the drooping ,clean, skin I would be completely happy.</li>
            <li>What a great clean feeling I&#x27;m left with once I&#x27;ve used this scrubber!</li>
            <li>I love the clean, fresh feeling it gives me</li>
            <li>Good value for the money, and my face has never felt this clean and soft.</li>
            <li>use it with my Clean N&#x27; Clear 3-in-1 Exfoliating Cleanser, and my skin feels so good</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s useful and my face more clean now.</li>
            <li>Awesome face brush, you can feel your clean firm and tighten up after just one washing.</li>
            <li>While it does what it does clean and exfoliate I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it because it does not do a better job than the multitude of exfoliating cleansers on the market.  </li>
            <li>It feels so good and leaves my face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this because it was so cheap.</li>

            <li>I see the difference soon after using first time., and my skin feels very smooth...</li>
            <li>is just as smooth and clean as it was when I used my Mia.</li>
            <li>When I use the device to clean my face, I also lightly go over my brow area to remove any makeup.  </li>

            <li>I have enjoyed this product very much, I wish I had purchased it sooner, it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a Clarisonic Mia and really liked it, but couldn&#x27;t justify the high price tag.</li>
            <li>product works well and is very reasonably priced, I was also able to use a coupon with it.</li>
            <li>After use your skin feels fresh &amp; clean &amp; renewed!</li>
            <li>but I think any facial cleansing product would work just fine and that any moisturizer would be more effective after cleansing with this device.</li>
            <li>Easy, quick and my combination skin is noticeably better (thanks to this tool and the Pro X Acne Protocol) !  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for one of these machines, so this was a great way to introduce myself to a whole new world.</li>
            <li>Starting a new job was the added boost I needed to look my best.</li>
            <li>perfect for her experience with acne problems, a new venture for her, only being 11 yrs.</li>
            <li>I plan to use with my own cleanser, so I can use something a little more designed for acne treatment, but the cleanser in the pack feels nice as well.</li>
            <li>As I get a little more proficient at working it, I think my results will be better, just as good as my spa treatment</li>
            <li>With less oil and a more smoother canvas it looks great.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer and cream are absorbed more quickly.</li>
            <li>This system came at a great price, much less then even at Wal-Mart and I love the results on my face.</li>
            <li>Just received the kit 2 days ago so far have notice my skin completely different much more clean and bright loving it♥</li>
            <li>Other than that, though, it makes for a great deep-down clean 3-4 times a week!</li>
            <li>I conducted a whole afternoon of research into a good skin treatment system, and bought the Olay system based on the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a different cleanser brand, but this brush is amazing!</li>
            <li>I just recently bought this product and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>After extensive reading of reviews and comparisons of products - this is amazing without breaking the bank!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the brush for several weeks, and my skin now looks amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this product the first time I used it my face was brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>Originally I bought Sirius Sonic Skin Care System, because I wanted blows and whistles at a cheaper than Clarisonic price.</li>
            <li>:)read this far! :)</li>
            <li>I tried the slower speed first to acclimate it to my face and was glad I did.</li>
            <li>However, that is a minor inconvenience compared to the great cleaning it does.  </li>
            <li>Worth what my son paid for it!</li>
            <li>Worth to recommend!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $30!  </li>
            <li>WORTH THE 27 BUCKS!</li>
            <li>Even if it&#x27;s \\&quot;not as good\\&quot; (which I think it is) as Clarisonic, it&#x27;s $30 versus $120, worth a shot for everyone!</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by this product and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>The original cleanser has some micro-abrasive particles</li>
            <li>The price was music to my ears because I originally wanted the Clarisonic is which $195 in comparison to this $30 product.</li>
            <li>Two months later I am able to get away with not using makeup on weekends and fell confident!</li>
            <li>I thought about trying it again to see if it would work for me now, and I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews on the Olay cleansing system first.  </li>
            <li>So glad I tried it out first.</li>
            <li>I have since bought these for myFriends and family because I am so excited to share this with them.</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel as it is small</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem like much at first, but after 1 week my face looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>The head came off while I was in the shower, though I&#x27;m pretty sure I had put it on correctly.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>I have all original correspondence(e-mails, letter, and coupon.)</li>
            <li>But its soooo worth it!</li>
            <li>I threw away the original package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are worth it!  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day, and use my own cleansers and exfoliators as I would normally.  </li>
            <li>I originally visited Amazon to price a Clarisonic system, but while here, I was diverted to the Olay ProX.  </li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>Worth it and would recommend!</li>
            <li>the clarisonic which was wayyy too rich for my blood</li>
            <li>the price I don&#x27;t think this product can be beat, although there are better options at higher price</li>
            <li>So I was excited to try out this cleansing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sorry I tried it, but I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>When my original broke, I purchased another.</li>
            <li>Many reviews compare this to the higher priced brands and I cannot speak to that</li>
            <li>Love this brush so much!</li>
            <li>It made my acne better the first time i used it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend $200+ on my first brush, since I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work for me</li>
            <li>Small yet perfect!</li>
            <li>Original review  (August 2015)   </li>
            <li>I get so excited to use this thing.</li>
            <li>My skin has been glowy al day, feels much smoother, and I was able to clean out my pres really easily after I used it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so excited about this stuff that I will be ordering some of the rest of the pro-x line</li>
            <li>Love this for the price compared to much higher price tag models.</li>
            <li>It was okay the first couple of times.  </li>
            <li>THANKS YOU FOR READING THIS! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so excited to wash my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is WELL worth your money, ,at any age!  </li>
            <li>My skin looks healthier and fresh and youthfull!</li>
            <li>The Olay cleansing system definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>This was well worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful facial cleaning and gets along well with my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>So far she is very pleased with the results she has seen using the Pro-X. Her skin</li>
            <li>Really worth it for the price!</li>
            <li>Perhaps one more speed higher that the 2 preset ones.</li>
            <li>and I can buy many of these before I reach the cost of the higher end competitors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use my original cleanser with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it was okay , but My face is much softer now!</li>
            <li>This was well worth the price!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the original bottle.</li>
            <li>Its great for when I come home after a long day.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for just over two weeks now and it is definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>i was so excited about it</li>
            <li>so when I saw this, I was excited.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!  </li>
            <li>I received it in the mail I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I first bought this item close to two years ago, and have bought three more of them since.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this olay brush before buying one of the higher priced brands...</li>
            <li>I use my favorite Mary Kay foaming cleanser with it - and it seems to make it go so much farther!  </li>
            <li>and it has been worth every penny! .</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t use it in the shower, great product.</li>
            <li>I can see the difference in my skin after the first use and it continues to get better after evey use.</li>
            <li>I can say that it&#x27;s been worth buying &amp; using!</li>
            <li>I would for sure recommend this product to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>But this is worth a try!</li>
            <li>Good price, great exfoliator and comparable to the more expensive like products.</li>
            <li>but so far very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the MIa 2 and $160</li>
            <li>For the amount I paid for, it is definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure she uses it every night.</li>
            <li>I love my brush so much!</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price, brush leaves skin feeling refreshed and included sample of the Olay cleanser is fragrance free and worked well.  </li>
            <li>I am prone to break-outs, but feel that they have been significantly decreasing since using this product with my routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brush about once a week for the last month, and I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li>:) IT CLEANS LIKE A DREAM AND HAS GOT RID OF SO MUCH BULID UP OF BLACKHEADS AND CLOGED PORES!</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to recieve this in the mail.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!! :)</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get my pro-x in the mail</li>
            <li>It made my skin look cleaner and more refreshed for the first week.</li>
            <li>After the first week, i got more pimples</li>
            <li>His face has cleared up pretty well, he still has breakouts and acne, but it looks a lot better.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and soft -good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It was originally recommended by my derm, but every skin process is not for everyone.</li>
            <li>So i was excited to receive it and try it.</li>
            <li>First thing, i&#x27;m glad it already came with the batteries</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying!</li>
            <li>does the job :) so glad i got it for a much better price than my local drug stores</li>
            <li>Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>She originally suggested the Clarisonic but for the price difference she said this would work as well.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a cheap 10 dollar one prior for her to try before I bought a better one to see if she actually liked it and would use it.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, this really does do a great job of removing all the dirt and makeup from my skin, and I notice a huge difference in how clean and soft my face feels afterward compared to just washing with my hands.  </li>
            <li>It certainly helps me enjoy the time I now wash my face more often, and am now more consistent with clearer skin and softer appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use the higher speed setting and it&#x27;s still very gentle and does an amazing job at removing all my face makeup and eye gunk.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I am very pleased with this product; acne or no acne if you want super clean fresh skin</li>
            <li>This is a little device with a rotating scrubbing disc that does a nice job of doing a very foamy face wash especially easy to use in the shower</li>
            <li>Great product for the money--just as good (if not better) than my $50 Mary Kay one!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a very clean, smooth, and acne free complexion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to decide what I will primarily use with the device, but I&#x27;m so excited to finally have something that feels really good.</li>
            <li>think this is going to be a great prodcut in the long run for my face!</li>
            <li>Your face looks so clean after you use it</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I wanted to have something that would help to clean my skin better-a deeper cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I will never use my hands to clean my face again.</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a skin care regimen that would make my face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean.</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li>It seemed much gentler than I expected, but that&#x27;s probably best on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Any time i&#x27;ve needed a deeper clean, this gets the job done.</li>
            <li>If you want a deap clean, this is for you.</li>
            <li>My skin did not feel clean at all.</li>
            <li>I was in search of something to help get my face clean without tearing it up or drying it out.  </li>
            <li>but I am also super duper cheap and would NEVER spend $200 on the competitor.</li>
            <li>Uses rotating motion rather than pulsing motion to clean face, which just cleans the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t clean the face and it never lathered up.</li>
            <li>since getting this item i clean my face with wipes</li>
            <li>Even so, I felt my face was not fully clean.  </li>
            <li>I use this at least twice a week and my skin feels smooth and great afterwards!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, batteries have lasted about two years and my face feels fresh every time.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this item and so far i&#x27;m very impressed with the item.</li>
            <li>I get dry, flaky spots that I need to exfoliate and this product works great.</li>
            <li>and you come away feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin super smooth and makes my moisturizer stay on longer.  </li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling as clean as it can get.</li>
            <li>I found it to be something that made for work for me to clean up than any benefit it was doing to my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so refreshed and clean after using this.</li>
            <li>This item gets my face squeaky clean without being too abrasive.  </li>
            <li>If you want a clean face, JUST BUY ONE.</li>
            <li>and it does seem to clean well.</li>
            <li>It seems I would get one area of my face and throat clean and still lack another.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft and smooth my skin feels after I use this!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to simply squeeze any favorite face wash as often as allowed for your skin type onto this and wash away</li>
            <li>and then I leave it alone for a while, easy to use and fun</li>
            <li>That really,really clean feeling?</li>
            <li>It seems to really clean your pores.</li>
            <li>Ergo, it&#x27;s always a battle to figure out how to really clean off makeup (and oil, dirt, etc.)</li>
            <li>2 speeds, use it in shower to clean face.  </li>
            <li>But it does get your skin clean and glowing and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I too had coveted the Clarisonic, but there was no way I could justify spending over $200 on something to clean my face.</li>
            <li>Combined with the cleanser/scrub, my face feels really clean</li>
            <li>i use it every morning and this brush cleans ma face to perfection, leaving it smooth, oil free and fresh feeling</li>
            <li>Cannot believe how clean &amp; glowing my skin is now.</li>
            <li>It is fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>it  can&#x27;t clean the pores。</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not it is just really clean.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even and my pores are much more clear</li>

            <li>I am totally in love with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System because it has really brought some balance to my complexion without adding any noticeable time to my morning or evening routine.</li>
            <li>It does keep my washcloth clean but instead of using that to remove my make-up, I use this.</li>
            <li>Underpowered, cannot clean thoroughly</li>
            <li>I love this because it&#x27;s all natural and it has a better result than the creams I was buying at Sephora at 100+ a jar.  </li>
            <li>my face feels smooth and super clean</li>
            <li>My face never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>I feel like it gets my skin really clean without causing irritation.  </li>

            <li>I dont have dry spots anymore, its great.</li>

            <li>When I finish, my face does feel a bit dry, so I use a lavender-infused vitamin E oil (lavender promotes cell renewal and smells great),</li>

            <li>I have only used this system once so far, so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best thing I have ever used, but after using it I can see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li>On it&#x27;s own it may be enough for most people but used as a duo with my Panasonic cleanser, for me, it&#x27;s looking like a winner.</li>

            <li>he bought something that I always wanted to have to clean my</li>
            <li>I used it to clean my face twice a day for about a week.</li>
            <li>I clean to brush once a week with dish soap and vinegar.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re someone who has to clean their face a lot for whatever reason (e.g. make up, acne, oily skin,</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, if you think you clean your makeup off</li>
            <li>So clean even with make up feels clean..</li>
            <li>the brush did not rotate, did not feel as clean.</li>
            <li>She says it get her face as clean as the over priced ones in the department stores.</li>

            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t clean my face sufficiently, and with often wearing make</li>
            <li>; clean.</li>
            <li>I feel a deeper clean using baking soda.</li>
            <li>so I know my face is getting clean.</li>
            <li>My face never felt fully clean.</li>
            <li>I use whatever cleanser I have at the time with this brush and it does create a deeper clean than without the brush.</li>
            <li>Execellent tool to clean any face.  </li>
            <li>The face cream they give you is good for a few days but for a sample its nice.</li>
            <li>I loved this cleansing system so much that I had to write a review to let others know that this really works.</li>
            <li>I can say that I received such a pleasant report from the person I gave it to that</li>
            <li>The cleanser it comes with is amazing and the brush is very soft.  </li>
            <li>But my face is looking older and I broke down and bought this WONDERFUL little gadget (with the cleaner) -- the two together work great!</li>
            <li>You do not get very much cleaner either, so be prepared to have to buy more quickly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this had so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>but then felt they got a bit more from the Pro-X. I&#x27;ve heard plently of people comparing this to the Clarisonic regarding quality and all reviews have been positive.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading some positive reviews and looking at the star rating despite so many reviews.</li>
            <li>But so far LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fraction of the price and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>too!I have noticed a nice change in my 51 year old skin!</li>
            <li>and if I can open this, I&#x27;m pretty sure anyone else can-- just get a good grip.</li>
            <li>Just got it in the mail today and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>My face is so soft and I love it!</li>
            <li>were right&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not greasy at all, thought I would smell like salad dressing but not at all, just made my face feel so soft &amp; smooth!!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping too!!!</li>
            <li>This is such a great product, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own the fancy Clarisonic thing that this imitates, but based on owning this, my advice would be do it right (and cough up the three-figure amount for the real deal) or don&#x27;t do it at all.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that because Clarisonic is so popular right now you may find their Customer Service really lacking if your unit stops working.</li>
            <li>Very, very good little brush.</li>
            <li>Until I&#x27;m ready to make the investment in a Clarisonic, this will work just fine!</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than others I have seen and works fine!</li>
            <li>I use the Olay face wash now and then, but mostly use my own foam wash as I have sensitive skin and the device exfoliates my skin enough on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I have fair, very sensitive skin too and it is not irritating in the slightest!</li>
            <li>It has a high/low speed and it&#x27;s easy to use right out the box.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Love this product, leave my skin very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It is so much more affordable than other powered cleansing brushes and does a good job exfoliating, even around my piercings.  </li>
            <li>I bought the extra two bushes; but I believe that the original bush will hold up for a good while.  </li>
            <li>I find it gentle on my skin, easy to use and easy to clean after using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products that have cost way more for the monthly membership and didn&#x27;t make my face look as good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less powerful than the category leader but at this price - a good and surprisingly effective tool.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t powerful enough for my skin type, but would be excellent for very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>sux specially if you have the clarisonic like i do.</li>
            <li>For me, the cleanser is nothing special--</li>
            <li>it is smelly and specially it was MADE IN CHINA.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so grateful for this special gift, gift yourself....</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I noticed anything special About it.</li>
            <li>You can buy it most large grocery stores and sometimes at WalMart.</li>
            <li>needed a special gift for someone who has everything.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this product.</li>
            <li>If I had more demanding skin needs, I would certainly spring for the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>This battery-operated, wasteful device doesn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>AND THE PRICE IS JUST RIGHT!</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I figured I would give this a try and the price was right!</li>
            <li>I gave the product a high review because it is probably very good on younger skin.</li>
            <li>cleanser sample is good but nothing special, so I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy the other version of this kit with the full size cleanser -</li>
            <li>I love it, and clean face very well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too strong, you don&#x27;t want to scrub your face like it&#x27;s the kitchen floor, so take a light touch and use this sparingly but remember that healthy young skin renews every 28 days so this will helps keep it fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>My face does feel clean, but no different than using a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>My face always feels so clean and refreshed, and the bristles on the head are nice and soft.   </li>
            <li>Definitely feels like you get a good clean compared to just using your hands.</li>
            <li>Love my pro-x, my skin is much smoother,face feels so clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to just clean the surface but not a deep cleanse.</li>
            <li>Your face feels completely smooth, clean, fresh just like you stepped out of a salon.</li>
            <li>It really helps clean my pores more on my chin and nose which is what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would much rather have the vibrate one to clean the skin off better</li>
            <li>Incredibly smooth and so vibrant &amp; healthy looking.</li>
            <li>but if really seems to make my face feel so much more clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean as well as sonic face cleaners, but it&#x27;s good enough for me, and I like that it can be used in a shower.</li>
            <li>The first time I try this, it made my face clean and glow!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this system, my skin felt unbelievably clean!</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>So happy with this purchase as it works simply, but very, very well.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know if it was a good idea, but it is a very affordable item and the shipping was very fast (considering the fact that it came from the US).&lt;br</li>
            <li>B0073GO01E Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel, 5 oz]] with it as well with very good results.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin super clean and soft....and the price is right!</li>
            <li>first week I used [[ASIN:B001I45ZFC Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Bar, 4.5-Ounce Bar (Pack of 6)]] with the brush, and my skin felt soft and very clean, but not stripped and no irritation, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I spent a great deal of time debating---</li>
            <li>Works great, as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for something to clear my skin up for over 15 years this brush is amazing and did just that.</li>
            <li>Amazing product and helped me clear my skin.</li>
            <li>Water seeped into my first unit and corroded the batteries, but I liked it so much I bought this replacement.</li>
            <li>I use this occasionally and its great, just wish the speed was higher</li>
            <li>after my wife got several facials and looked at this before in the stores at a much higher price - i got this for her at a great amazon price.  </li>
            <li>This thing is priced great and does the job the more expresnsive one  that i have bought in the past.</li>
            <li>I just bought this at target about a week ago, and honestly, my skin felt so much smoother and cleaner just after the first use.</li>
            <li>gentle but effective from the first use.</li>
            <li>The brush is softer than I expected, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the small investment and great results delivered as promised!</li>
            <li>Works great, and does what I expected it too.</li>
            <li>I decided to look at it first when I saw an aging segment on Good Morning America, about buying a cleansing system to moisturize your face to keep you looking young.</li>
            <li>But i always thought olay catered to more gentle youthful skin, so i came across the pro x and decided to five it a try........</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I love it so much I invested in the Clarisonic Pro</li>
            <li>just twice a week is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I have good skin and use a apricot scrub daily</li>
            <li>Cool device.</li>
            <li>But the true test will be the shaving aspect I mentioned.</li>
            <li>Neither women enjoyed the product much.</li>
            <li>Not wanting to spend that much money, I decided to try the Oil of Olay product as I use many of their products.  </li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s good product for the price.</li>
            <li>The battery compartment is definitely a bit troublesome, but otherwise, I think this product is really good for its price.</li>
            <li>My face really looks better.</li>
            <li>A travel tip - remove the batteries, take an extra set (AA size), toss everything into a ziplock bag and you&#x27;re good to go anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li>Your face feels nice after the cleaning, not dried out like as you used soap.  </li>
            <li>This gives a more gentle experience and seems to let the product do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>More abrasive and thorough cleansing have psychological appeal, but the ingredients in cleansers (salicylic acid etc) are more important.</li>
            <li>I noticed my face to be more cleaner after using it and within a week, my face really cleared up.</li>
            <li>Well...I really, REALLY wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>seems to hold good charge and runs only on AA battery.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this brush for many reasons.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old son has eczema and uses it on his own.</li>
            <li>and I still have more black/white heads than I would really like.  </li>
            <li>I think more than that would be too much for my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product so much.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it works out very well. :)</li>
            <li>It gets your skin super clean and with time leaves it with a glow.</li>
            <li>Somehow I think this rotation might work better for the flakiness issues, but I wouldn&#x27;t really know unless I tried them both.  </li>
            <li>This is actually a good thing, because it means I can use it daily without turning my face into hamburger.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much power and you&#x27;re better off using your hands with a micro-dermabrasion cream than this brush.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t blame Amazon at all, this product really needs a seriously better battery redesign.</li>
            <li>I actually scrub my face with a washcloth to get the whiteheads out ,which I know this couldn&#x27;t be good for my skin, but what&#x27;s a girl to do?</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>I feel as though I must get my makeup and dirt out of my pores better and the stimulation of the rotating brush head must be very beneficial.</li>
            <li>I read reviews prior and one of the reviews gave good instructions.</li>
            <li>Wish the unit was sealed better because if you bang it or drop it, the whole thing comes apart and you get water inside the battery chamber.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much I bought one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>but so far its nice</li>
            <li>It also really helps your skin get the most out of your moisturizer and skin care products.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to moisturize afterwards as it is very drying.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s well worth the money, can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap for a product that is so efficient and does what it says.&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin looks more even, is cleaner, and is so much softer.</li>
            <li>Really cleaning i love it</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the Clairsonic and gives fabulous results!</li>
            <li>After you wash your face with it you feel super clean.  </li>
            <li>Want nice soft face?  </li>
            <li>it appears to assist my moisturizer in absorbing more efficiently as well.</li>
            <li>and I think it was my bodies reaction to stay cool because of the heat that my body was always faced with.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>The product is waterproof, so it can be used over the sink or in the shower or even in the bathtub for something more intimate (~_^).</li>
            <li>Plus it has 2 power settings, which is nice if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the low price and good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think this brush cleans better than an exfoliating cleanser and a washcloth.</li>
            <li>30-1hour showers most the time the whole time</li>
            <li>One thing is I would suggest is you would probably not want to use any face scrubs that have exfoliating products already in them, as that would likely not be good for your skin.</li>
            <li>The ladies in my family think it is good present.</li>
            <li>It is a good present for woman.</li>
            <li>It really cleans all the dirt and/or makeup off your face more than your fingertips do.</li>
            <li>am going to buy my sister one because I want her to see how cool it is.</li>
            <li>I had been hearing so much about these cleansing systems, but wasn&#x27;t about to pay $100 or more for one</li>
            <li>Loved adding this to my nightly routine, only thing I wish is that it came within additional heads or the bristles</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth &amp; I rarely have any breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Buying one for my mom as a gift because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t see any real cleaning or refining after many uses.  </li>
            <li>the bristle seems more gentle</li>
            <li>brand, good quality.&lt;br /&gt;The same as the product announced on TV</li>
            <li>My face was so clear, bright and soft after, I wanted to be able to do this at home.  </li>
            <li>The Clarisonic is much more gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>The latest one I&#x27;ve used is St. Ives Gentle Apricot Scrub.</li>
            <li>and it really does make my skin look better after using it.</li>
            <li>Good price for something that is part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li>I loved this sulfur mask before I tried the cleansing system, but these two products totally belong together, and attention should be made to that point.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle, I can use it every day with my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>It worked okay, but it scrubs too gently for me</li>
            <li>My face feels super clean after using it every time.</li>
            <li>Make sure that your face is very moist when you apply it because that way it makes mores suds.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cost effective to change batteries so frequently on this product.</li>
            <li>started using the Pro-X and the cleanser, and was so surprised with how effective it was.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and love the results so much have reordered the cleaner twice.  </li>
            <li>Something simple like that can make a woman feel sooooo good.  </li>
            <li>#34;it looks so smooth, and fresh and healthy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>But if you want a good cleaning brush for an affordable price then definitely go with the Olay Pro-X.</li>
            <li>Ok i really like this.</li>
            <li>I think it does a much better, and much quicker job at getting the job dome.</li>
            <li>It is a bit more gentle</li>
            <li>/&gt;Naming issues aside, it DOES have an easy-to-grasp handle, feels good and solid in the hand.</li>
            <li>Good tool for facial cleaning.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really compare, but I&#x27;m really satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t had many skin problems.</li>
            <li>not use much, but it is ok</li>
            <li>and I like it just as much, and the value is better.</li>
            <li>The mia \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush works a lot better and is gentle  </li>
            <li>My wife and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Its really about that sophisticated.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it... that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Good quality overall.  </li>
            <li>Love this so much.</li>
            <li>I just received this item today, so I can&#x27;t give a full review yet, but I will update if there is anything I learn that hasn&#x27;t been posted elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Their competitor cost like $250, and here only cost $28.50, and the result can be done as good as treatment.</li>
            <li>It really is a good option for low- price skin care cleansing.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I am a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Glad I did not spend to much for this product.</li>
            <li>I do pair it with a gentle exfoliating scrub and absolutely love the way my skin feels and looks when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I prefer a simpler and more gentle cleaning gel.</li>
            <li>It would have to be 8 times better than the Olay version, because it costs eight times as much.  </li>
            <li>My makeup goes on better now, and I&#x27;ve also noticed that I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much as I use to.</li>
            <li>My face feels softer, I don&#x27;t break out nearly as much anymore, and I feel like my skin is so healthy now.</li>
            <li>overall good product</li>
            <li>It is more gentle than my hands when using my scrubby acne cleanser.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
            <li>I think this product is fabulous and well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product</li>
            <li>So I ran to the store and bought this one, seeing as it has such good reviews.</li>
            <li>And after much research, I have decided I can do more for my exfoliating needs with a simple face brush and a good exfoliating cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This product was cool--</li>
            <li>Not that cool...</li>
            <li>any more than that would have been way too much.</li>
            <li>Overall the quality of the product is really good.</li>
            <li>One of the most reasonably priced beauty items ever.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product so far.</li>
            <li>The true test was end of the day make-up removal.</li>
            <li>I love my Olay Pro-Advanced so much that I purchased one for my sister and mother!&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it really made any more difference than washing with a washrag.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the shower and give my face a good scrub with it almost daily.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Seems to work really well, better value compared to competition.  </li>
            <li>But it really didn&#x27;t do any better than a warm soft wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Helps very well with the cleansing of your face and keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li>Probably true,</li>
            <li>I need a bit more power for this tool, and the sample it came with I just threw out because it smelled very chemically.</li>
            <li>Good while it last.</li>
            <li>a full ninety days  </li>
            <li>box and the brush lasted a full month</li>
            <li>If nothing else, it feels really nice and soft on my skin and encourages me to take my time while cleansing.</li>
            <li>I was really optimistic about this product after hearing how my friends/family have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I think the Pro-X is cool.</li>
            <li>My acne is doing better and my skin is much softer.</li>
            <li>replacement heads are cheap and the unit itself was well worth the 30 days.</li>
            <li>you wont get the full size bottle of the exfoliater</li>
            <li>still loved the idea of using a brush, and although the motion was different- decided to take my chances with the Oil of Olay Pro-X cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li>I used it while in the bath each morning and its gentle brushing gives my face a lovely feel.  </li>
            <li>I use it with the Olay Sensitive Foaming Face Wash, which does a nice job.</li>
            <li>It works really good except that I wish the brushes are bit wider or bigger.</li>
            <li>Its good, you can see difference in your skin after  using this....but it should come with extra brush...</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of taking all of my makeup off and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave it red afterwards.</li>
            <li>and I was expecting a full size.</li>
            <li>that the dirt can finally get out after good cleansing/exfoliation.</li>
            <li>After several months of use, the bristles are still in good shape.  </li>
            <li>Then I went to the cubbard &amp; got out the extra virgin olive oil put a dab on my finger &amp; rubbed it all over my face, rubbed it in good &amp;#34;they</li>
            <li>it will leave your face smooth and fresh</li>
            <li>I ended up buying one for my husband too, and he uses it daily with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Welp, guess it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>This is must have for a good daily skin care routine, at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a mini-spa treatment on your face and truly leaves your face feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>hasn&#x27;t even been a full year</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and the spinning is effective.</li>
            <li>Price was good, and I feel like my skin gets that extra cleanse.</li>
            <li>Its so soft but so effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 55 and use it with grainy, exfoliant products and it really gives me smooth skin!</li>
            <li>My dermatologist told me not to use this kind of thing as in the long run it will do more damage than not.</li>
            <li>For $30, not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>The price is not bad i do change the brush once a month since it can develop bacteria.</li>
            <li>not bad in this price range.</li>
            <li>Not bad ,I thought it was a good price, but while I was at the store i found the same one with a cheaper price ,,,,,,</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so it is pretty good for me.</li>
            <li>The battery life lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s nice that you can just turn it on and cleanse, unlike with the NutraSonic, where you have to plug it in and make sure it&#x27;s charged up.</li>
            <li>It is not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad for money.  </li>
            <li>I would break out very easily, but now I can wake up without seeing a patch of new blemishes all over my face.</li>
            <li>It is good,  easy to operate and very handy when you clean your face everyday use your daily xleaning product!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>He told me it turns the follicle over very quickly which could be great for someone chronically broke out, but for someone who generally has clear skin it can cause break outs.</li>
            <li>I was so flummoxed by the positive reviews of this product that I had to call my old English professor to find the best word to use that would accurately describe the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just received this and after the first use I noticed a difference right away, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have used the real Clarisonic brush that costs nearly 10x as much as this one, as well as the Clarisonic knock-off called Pretika, and I can honestly say that the Olay brush is my favorite of the bunch!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this really does anything special, but my skin feels very clean when I use the cleaner</li>
            <li>It is amazing for on the skin, and your skin becomes super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and only takes about a minute two times per day to get amazing results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and only takes about a minute two times per day to get amazing results.  </li>
            <li>This simple yet effective face scrubber is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Takes of any makeup/dirt/oil, exfoliates super well, and leaves my face feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>As far as the size, I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s so compact and therefore easy to tote around for trips.</li>
            <li>I love this, after only the first use my face looked so much better!</li>
            <li>I was impressed and felt better about my purchase, especially after reading some other posts out there...</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful little system that has truly made a major change for the better in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd one since my kids took over my first one :)  LOVE this!</li>
            <li>Honestly I think stabilizing on the right pill had something to do with the clear up, but this brush has most definitely sped it up and has been making my skin feel so clean!!  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve paired it with the Olay Serum right after cleansing and it has made a HUGE difference in my skin in just a week.    </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t sound quite right to me.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li>Important to moisturize right after cleansing.</li>
            <li>I feel sure it will help clean my pores and exfoliate my skin more than cleaning alone or using facial masks.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty strong for a woman, but I couldn&#x27;t get it myself.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the scrub that was included because I prefer Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Daily Pore Scrub, which works incredibly well.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t clean any better than if you use a Wonder Puff and cleanse your face in circular motions for a few a minutes with a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>I use it twice daily, and have found that using it with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean, Anti-Breakout Facial Cleanser works best for me.  </li>
            <li>good product really work leave my skin looking clean and soft and youthful looking</li>
            <li>I would recommend using the exfoliater cleanser once a week because it is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and not uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li>You get a great deep clean and I feel like it really pulls out all of the dirt and oils from your pors.</li>
            <li>I use it once/day on my face with a regular face cleanser, and my skin feels soooo smooth and nice and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I keep fionding myself touching my skin because it is soooo smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>My wife likes it so much she wants to get more as gifts for others!</li>
            <li>I had read so many great reviews, but am too cheap to spend the money on the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>Most are high priced and I really wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like one.</li>
            <li>glow and fresh skin is right under our reach, easy</li>
            <li>She was amazed how clean and smooth her face was the first time she used it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cleans very well and leaves my skin feeling very clean with no residue.</li>
            <li>Very \\&quot;polished\\&quot; Very clean.</li>
            <li>this brush is gentle yet it leaves your skin very clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- wash face gently with sulfur soap (I think my face likes to be very clean, but</li>
            <li>Good brush to clean your face daily with the right cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure if my face is much clearer than before, I&#x27;ve always had mild to moderate acne, and it still is, maaaayybbeee more mild, but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure if my face is much clearer than before, I&#x27;ve always had mild to moderate acne, and it still is, maaaayybbeee more mild, but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great after, and if it continues to prevent breakouts, it&#x27;s more than worth the small price.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the price point (compared to the crazy price for the Clarisonic) and to find it is still of good quality and effective.</li>
            <li>And it would be great if it had a body brush as well, but if you use it for like 2min every other day your skin will look fine.​</li>
            <li>I use it with other brands of scrubbing skin cleansers, and find that it works great.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the time I use Bare Minerals cleansers and make up - love that stuff!</li>
            <li>a great price compared to other ones.</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and smoother, however, I don&#x27;t see any noticeable visible difference like some other users experienced.</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro-X Cleansing Brush is a great alternative and value to other high-end devices out there (aka Clairsonic).</li>
            <li>Great for the money spent!</li>
            <li>this is a great starter unit for those, like me, who wanted to see what the fuss is about but dont want to spend the 100&#x27;s on other units.</li>
            <li>Whenever I would use this in the shower, my face felt so soft and clean!!</li>
            <li>Now here&#x27;s a product I passed right over for a long time because I could not imagine scrubbing my sensitive skin with anything - until someone with skin like mine, and who looked wonderful, told me to try it.</li>
            <li>Week 4, huge reduction of breakouts, I&#x27;d say 75% more clear.</li>
            <li>face is now fresh, clean, and moist everytime</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and fresh after I use it.</li>
            <li>and I am seriously amazed at how beautiful my skin looks, i would recommend it to anybody!</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and fresh and looks brighter.  </li>
            <li>The only improvement I would suggest is making the head a bit more secure as it is easy to come off since it is replaceable  </li>
            <li>You skin feels so clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>and I just want my face to feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and my face feels much fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>My face feels so fresh and clean afterward.</li>
            <li>My face feels so fresh and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Can feel the results, my skin feels really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I just wanted to get a fresh and clean face and feel some brightness in my skintone.</li>
            <li>If you take a whole minute to clean your face you will get clean and if you are using a microdermabrasion cleanser you will get smooth.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin clean and fresh</li>
            <li>This has helped my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>THIS FACIAL BRUSH IS SUCH AN AWESOME DEAL!!!  </li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;m sure this product is meant to be used for microdermabrasion--anti aging stuff, but for me, this is FINALLY a solution to a life-long battle with clogged pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest that I am not 100% sure what I expected to get out of this product.  </li>
            <li>I think women who enjoy spending a lot of time with cleansers and/or makeup may enjoy the process and it seems reasonably priced for this type of item.  </li>
            <li>Beauty devices like the Olay Professional Pro-X Cleansing System are most accurately reviewed after an extended sampling by the reviewer.</li>
            <li>its okay kind of rough</li>
            <li>Some quick notes about the product:  1.</li>
            <li>The head is a nice compact size great for cleansing beneath the jawline, behind the ears and neck, and on the temples.  </li>
            <li>A quick note on cleansers:</li>
            <li>It is super inexpensive for what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li>Luckily I picked this up</li>
            <li>Skin does feel cleaner but will try the brush with a mild soap.  </li>
            <li>And, the best part is, this Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, cost much less than the product I saw advertised.  </li>
            <li>Now, I just tried the Olay cleansing machine and can say there is a noticeable difference between the two; however, if you are looking for an adequate machine that works</li>
            <li>This was after one use, I&#x27;m sure with more uses my white heads probably will not even be a problem.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product that rivals the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>The scrubber action is gentle, and the scrubber head is a good size for skimming on the edges of my nose and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i feel like it cleans better, and it is also much more quiet!</li>
            <li>But it did arrive quickly and was as advertised.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel so soft and smooth, and lets you daytime or nitetime moistures work all that much better well cleaned face.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this cleanser which feels great on my face--it gently scrubs and cleans.  </li>
            <li>I use it with olay&#x27;s Total Effects cleanser with blemish control, and I have to say, it works great, minimizes pores and helps your moisturizer really sink into your skin.  </li>
            <li>Also there&#x27;s a really really mild fragrance in it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen tremendous improvement in my skin tone since using the cleansing system.</li>
            <li>the combination of both has cleared my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li>Super happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure you are using professional skin products, not that cheap stuff at the box stores.</li>
            <li>but I have blackheads and have mild acne in concentrated areas.</li>
            <li>You can use ANY face wash with this product and it does a super job.  </li>
            <li>really does a great job of deep cleaning the face.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I wish I had started using it sooner.</li>
            <li>I got lucky and started using Olay in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used much more expensive brushes, and this one leaves my face feeling just as wonderful.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seven months pregnant</li>
            <li>and there, they go away quickly though.</li>
            <li>It runs smoothly and I can feel it clear the top of my skin from dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>AND I ALWAYS USE A MILD LOTION AFTERWARDS LIKE CERAVE....</li>
            <li>but I am going to be a loyal user</li>
            <li>after seen so many comments and reviews about this thing, i finally decided to get and try it see what&#x27;s so magical about this.</li>
            <li>My skin got softer using a mild scrubbing face wash and my hands.</li>
            <li>Need to order more cleanser, but I&#x27;m sure I could use my regular with it.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Olay cleanser and also with a Clinique scrub cream which is a mild exfoliator.</li>
            <li>This one did the job and was super affordable.</li>
            <li>For more high-end cleansers, I recommend Clinique face soap and Philosophy Purity Made Simple, because these cleansers alone, even with a wash cloth, did wonders for my skin, and would be even better combined with this</li>
            <li>It works perfect and really cleans all the dead cells and dirt also.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>I received it in the mail quickly and got to work using it.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of exfoliation, because I have found that exfoliation helps my acne-prone, sensitive skin the most.  </li>
            <li>Super price.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft so it is great for my pre-teens sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My face cleared up tremendously with the Retin-A, except for those darn spots.  </li>
            <li>It still deep cleans my skin, gently exfoliates, and does great things for the pores and blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>It still deep cleans my skin, gently exfoliates, and does great things for the pores and blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>the $12 one in my opinion is actually better, not only because it is the same value for a better price, but because it is a BETTER value for a BETTER price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Olay Pro-X advanced Cleansing System a few weeks ago because I&#x27;ve heard great things.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just a week of using the cleanser, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed how well my face has been clearing up; it&#x27;s so much smoother and just looks great.</li>
            <li>I have been using this ever since I got pregnant</li>
            <li>Luckily I purchased it during amazon deals or else</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would love having a facial exfoliator</li>
            <li>How many more times can I possibly say &#x27;name brand&#x27; in a review?!!</li>
            <li>I had never had a problem with acne until I got pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Quick way to thoroughly wash your face.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect facial cleansing brush for my teenage son.</li>
            <li>I rarely feel like I got a good buy when purchasing facial cleansing products.</li>
            <li>She was a satisfied user of the product and she actually recommended to many of her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely forever use this product ( also keep in mind that the brush needs to be replaced every three months for better results, just like a toothbrush :) ).</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to use the exfoliating cleaner every day, but the &#x27;abrasive&#x27; element is about the consistency of baking soda, so it&#x27;s extremely mild, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not yet had to change the brush out, but I bought the refills with the unit just because it seems they sell out quite quickly.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I dip it into squeezed lemon juice and just do a quick cleanse.</li>
            <li>the gentle facial massage is great in the morning.</li>
            <li>I already threw the packaging away because I was sure that I would love it and definitely not return it...</li>
            <li>You are able to use your favorite facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I then switched to the Simple gel cleanser, and the brush helps the gel turn into a light, frothy foam which feels really nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, on day 5 my skin looks and feels more vibrant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super water resistant.</li>
            <li>and I believe that it does a better job of cleaning than just myself using my hands, but my roommate has a different brand and the bristles move quicker probably because she paid more for it.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>I also think that some people are very pleased with this product because if they follow the directions they are washing their face for a whole minute which might be longer than they normally take to cleanse.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say my skin is more clear because of using Olay cleansing system but still enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>As an &#x27;old&#x27; guy who is getting those dang blackheads all old guys get in my sideburns, this works great to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer soaks into my skin quickly too.</li>
            <li>I have only used the Olay brand for several years, but since using ProX my skin feels its best!</li>
            <li>The dermatologist diagnosed it as mild Rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I think any mildly exfoliating cleanser would do the trick.</li>
            <li>I also purchased one for my mom and aunt, who also noticed that their skin has become more vibrant.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied--especially since this was offered for a great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>so luckily I did have others.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li>I used it with my own gentle Cetaphil as I have very sensitive skin and the results are smooth, glowing skin.</li>
            <li>What ended up working best was gently cleaning my skin with very gentle no-fragrance cleansers (Cetaphil is fabulous, the Aveeno I&#x27;m using is as well), and avoiding harsh products because they are not needed.  </li>
            <li>When you buy something special, as described, very practical, strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a skincare nut and shell out top dollars for high end cleansers but never felt the need for a cleansing brush - wrote it off as a lazy-man&#x27;s device...</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic vibrates at a high frequency which cleans better.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product along with your favorite skin cleanser.</li>
            <li>It has 2 speeds, but I prefer to use the high speed, it removes more dirt.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i was really pleased with this and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I love this face brush, and highly recommend</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my nose that fill up easily and this product works great to clear them and keep them clear.  </li>
            <li>Really helps to clean my pores and get rid of any existing acne!</li>
            <li>and my wife says it really does feel clean!</li>
            <li>Give a boy a power tool and suddenly he wants to clean!</li>
            <li>it does deep clean pretty good....</li>
            <li>Like many other systems, they try to sell the cleansing system cheap, and hope you buy more their fluid, looks like they are good at this.</li>
            <li>a good ol&#x27; plain washcloth does a better job for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin really looked more radiant in the morning and felt smoother right away.</li>
            <li>Seems to clean well, easy to use and clean, have used the original batteres so far</li>
            <li>This little thing did a great job my face felt smooth and fresh</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this battery operated little brush.  </li>
            <li>I use this every other day and LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>The trial sized tube of cleanser didn&#x27;t last me very long, but I was able to use it very sparingly and the results were wonderful.</li>
            <li>Very nice, it helps clean the hidden spot.</li>
            <li>I have been more than satisfied with my purchase, and like most Olay products, this one hasn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s great that you can use it in the shower; a little scrub with the exfoliant, rinse, and your skin feels to clean.</li>
            <li>to clean, the head pops right off.</li>
            <li>I wash my face and it feels really clean right after.  </li>
            <li>bristle is very fine and soft, and is very gentle on my acne filled</li>
            <li>I saw a huge difference after just the first try.</li>
            <li>After the first use I noticed a huge improvement on how this makeup applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin just within a couple weeks after trying it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Am very pleased with this product - have given several as gifts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 56 year young woman and dedicated anti-wrinkle warrior with sensitive skin, so I use the Pro-X Exfoliating Cleanser every 2-3 days to avoid irritation, but so far I&#x27;m happy with the results!</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with the product, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>But all in all, very pleased, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now, and it is still working great on the original batteries.</li>
            <li>I use this with other face washes too (St. Ives apricot, MyChelle scrub, Cetaphil), but the scrub that the cleansing system comes with is far and beyond the best.</li>
            <li>First time user of a powered brush exfoliater and I am sold on this one, it is portable, comfortable to hold, has 2 speeds</li>
            <li>This machine is barely doing a thing, except producing a nice foam.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very pleased with the product overall.</li>
            <li>Great transaction, but the product is not worth it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, but wish I had shopped more carefully and purchased the two in one brush available (like this but faster, with microdermabrasion pad)</li>
            <li>I used to sweat more often than normal when I returned</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li>My first one broke after about a year, so I contacted Olay and they sent me a certificate for a free replacement.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and will definitely be ordering the refill brushes.</li>
            <li>It looks like they are available in the higher price Cleansing system from Olay Pro-X.</li>
            <li>I have even been using other skin products that I own with the scrubber and am pleased with the results....</li>
            <li>Other than than, its a good cheap investment.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Great buy and relatively economical in comparison to other products.  </li>
            <li>Just as the detailed message another reviewer gave exactly.</li>
            <li>It is definitely better than manual washing...if you have normal skin and just want something to get your make up</li>
            <li>my skin became so soft and super CLEAN :]</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and does a great job of exfoliating my skin, especially the dryness around my eyebrows I tend to get in the winter.</li>
            <li>Probablly one of the more gentle home dermabrasion tools around, but like most, with prolonged use can  irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>pretty cheap- pricewise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how smooth my skin felt after using it the first time.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference from the very first use.  </li>
            <li>This product could be greatly improved with a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; type cleaning action and a slightly more abrasive brush head option akin to a pink buf-puf texture.  </li>
            <li>Some times I wash my face too long because it feel so good that my face hurts when I put toner on.</li>
            <li>This might be good for someone with oily and flaky skin that was not sensitive for high-level exfoliation.</li>
            <li>probably would not want to use it too long (even if it does feel good) because I can imagine that it could be abrasive if over-used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more gentle than I expected, which is actually a good thing.  </li>
            <li>It felt so good after a long day of work.</li>
            <li>The skin detaches very easily with a cotton ball, but I wanted to more easily rinse the dead skin away.</li>
            <li>The bristles were Ok, not soft not hard, I think it depends on your skin type if they are good for you or not.</li>
            <li>My pores are so clean, my skin so soft - LOVE this.</li>
            <li>You can use the included sample tube of cleanser/ exfoliator immediately to get a deep clean or just your own face wash.</li>
            <li>it makes your face feel rejuvenated stimulated so soft and clean love</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling and how soft the skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>Love how soft and clean it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love the soothing massaging action of this on my face and my skin is incredibly clean after using this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly,the cleansing brush is very smooth,but sometimes it&#x27;s too smooth to clean my skin.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and so far, the batteries are still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I do not use Olay&#x27;s cleansing products on my face, rather those from my dermatologist, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the brush is great to use with other face cleansing products!</li>
            <li>Once I got it and used the specially included \\&quot;goo\\&quot; right away.  </li>
            <li>This works just fine and keeps my facial skin clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very fine and soft.</li>
            <li>Your face feels super clean after use and it is has very gentle bristles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not paying $200+ for the high end, so this is good for my 12 yr old.</li>
            <li>Obviously to each is own; however, honestly, you really don&#x27;t have to spend the $200 for the Clarisonic to get a product that works really well.</li>
            <li>As a female in her early 30s, I&#x27;ve tried so many products that have rarely made good on their claims.</li>
            <li>I agree with many other reviewers here that this is just as good a device as the Clarisonic and comes with a MUCH cheaper price tag.</li>
            <li>Maybe the &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; rumors really are true!</li>
            <li>The only thing I have noticed is that it is kind of a pain in the butt to keep my hair away from it, but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I can live without it.</li>
            <li>or a new hair product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I tried a friend&#x27;s Clarisonic (with a new brush head, of course), so I&#x27;m able to make the comparison.</li>
            <li>(its awesome!),I also ordered the day time moisturizer+night time cream which closes the pores in your faces and sooths the skin as new and doesnt let any bacteria into the pores :).</li>
            <li>So while I&#x27;ll probably never use it on my face again, it has found a new life. :)</li>
            <li>Im not going to stay something new, but i have to say i love it.</li>
            <li>I wish I could love this product based on all the positive reviews, but this did nothing positive for my face.</li>
            <li>I think it is a great produt, after clean my face I use the Cleaning brush, it is soft and does some deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>Great price and exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>less breakouts and smoother skin  Great for removing makeup</li>
            <li>My skin feels great after I use it, and it lets me use less moisturizer at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Face feels super fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>This works just as good if not better than the calrisonic that&#x27;s is sold for a lot more money.</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet strong.  </li>
            <li>Mild cleansers, along with this brush, yield a fresh looking complexion.</li>
            <li>it feels good on my face, don&#x27;t like where batterey is located but for the price it seemed too work pretty well only used one time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really waterproof and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works under the shower, nice and quite operation, long battery life, smooth on face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed the brush, and the cleanser is very refreshing without being too harsh.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really easy to carry around and it works really well.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this and used it daily.  </li>
            <li>First I purchased a NutraSonic from Amazon years ago, and I loved the way it deep cleaned my skin and my enlarged pores and blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>This product has been a tremendous success.</li>
            <li>I have been very impressed with this product, and I hope that it will last me for a long time.</li>
            <li>I love how my moisturizer now really sinks in after cleaning with an exfoliant in the morning, and I love the totally clean feeling my skin has at night after getting rid of all the day&#x27;s make-up, oil, ect.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Cleans my face very well, will strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Other cleansing systems are very pricy, this one is good and gets the job done for about a quarter of the price!</li>
            <li>I have been blessed with pretty good skin, so when I recently discovered that I had un unused Amazon gift card and the Olay products were on sale, it was a given -</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was quite a godsend: I could remove makeup / dirt / grime easily without putting my skin through too much trauma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a pretty good facial brush.  </li>
            <li>and it really makes cleaning your face easy and thorough.</li>
            <li>the price was reasonable and the cleanser is easy to replace.  </li>
            <li>After I use normal face wash at the end of the day, and feel pretty clean after, I can still get more foundation off with this thing.</li>
            <li>It was easy to put together and works very well.</li>
            <li>Even though the brush heads are very soft, you can over scrub if used for more than a minute or so.</li>
            <li>Made my skin very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure product would work for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel clean and fresh!  </li>
            <li>This is such a cool product, it kind of buffs ur face, so that I guess if u dont have super sensitive skin, it leaves it what some people refer to as radiant:)</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System had a lot of reviews and the majority of them were positive.</li>
            <li>Oh well, the positive is I enjoy using it and</li>
            <li>This facial brush has two speeds, not too harsh on your skin, and great to give a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It did cause a breakout on my chin the 2nd week of use (haven&#x27;t had a pimple in many years! )</li>
            <li>After the first use I could tell this product does a great job of removing makeup and dirt, but is gentle enough to use twice a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how good I am going to be about buying refill heads versus just exfoliating with my hands, but we&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li>the bottom is the exact size of the brush head!  </li>
            <li>Ok..at the risk of sounding like a commercial for this item...I Love my PRO X system!  </li>
            <li>In buying Olay&#x27;s machine, I was really really hoping that it would be the solution to my blackhead conundrum!!</li>
            <li>I wish I had chosen the Olay brush in the first place!</li>
            <li>If my skin freaks out, I will definitely update this review because I thinkit&#x27;s an important factor!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>noticed a difference after the first use!</li>
            <li>I am not a big chemical product user, so I use it with my homemade washes and scrubs and love how glowing my skin is!</li>
            <li>In buying Olay&#x27;s machine, I was really really hoping that it would be the solution to my blackhead conundrum!!</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and was glowing after the first use!</li>
            <li>Now, weeks later, my skine looks and feels better than ever!</li>
            <li>I was amazed by the amount of dirt this picked up the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>saved so much buying this online!!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time in the shower and there&#x27;s no comparing this to a washcloth and soap!  </li>
            <li>First try and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li>Your thoughts and opinions are very much appreciated to help me out with this!!</li>
            <li>Cleans and really cleans!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Just be aware that over-exfoliation leads to premature aging!</li>
            <li>Started using this religiously after the Holidays and my skin looks better than ever!  </li>
            <li>but I think it is pretty straightforward.  </li>
            <li>I saw results the first time I used this!  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m also only 19), but my skin is 10x smoother and it just looks better!</li>
            <li>Actually spins as where most of the others just vibrate and cant see why to even buy them!  </li>
            <li>Mildly impressed, spin seems weak.  </li>
            <li>Gentle scrubbing of the skin!!</li>
            <li>I have at one time or antoher even gotten out of bed in the middle of the night to make sure i get that face wash in!  </li>
            <li>From the first time I used it my face felt cleaner than it had ever been!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 days now, and WOW!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well to get the job done!</li>
            <li>I have used this and really like it!!</li>
            <li>I noticed improvement on my skin immediately after the first use!</li>
            <li>I use it daily and have purchased 2 more as Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li>And it stimulates the cells in your skin to produce new skin cells, so it is always flawless and firm.  </li>
            <li>skin has never looked more fresh, and I feel confident taking selfies even though my face is not splattered on with foundation and other harmful ingredients!!! :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and makes skin look fresh and bright.</li>
            <li>love the soft brush and the mild exfoliating wash.  </li>
            <li>I get stress breakouts fairly easily but this helped to clear my skin up and kept my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>like that the replacement brushes are easy to find, but obviously the clarisonic has more types of brush heads to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t want to spend big money on a clarisonic definitely buy this nifty gadget to clean face instead of hands that don&#x27;t do as good of a job!</li>
            <li>I have pretty OK skin that withstands Olay&#x27;s rotating brush and scrub, so I had a good result with Olay, but if you have a sensitive skin and extra $100 to spend, get Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;About</li>
            <li>Its very important that for those with sensitive skin this might break you out.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and leaves my skin very soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>With this, my lotion is completely absorbed and the skin feels so healthy and soft!  </li>
            <li>After the first use my skin feels clean.  </li>
            <li>Not only did the brush feel great on my skin while I was using it, but after moisturizing my skin was so soft and glowing!</li>
            <li>But the first step is having really clean skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely keep expecting super soft skin and great moisturizer absorption.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used this, I can tell how clean my face was.</li>
            <li>I only use it 3-4x a week and still get great results, can&#x27;t believe how soft my face is!</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother, softer and fine wrinkle lines have reduce.  </li>
            <li>The only con about this product is that it might not have the high pressures and DEEP cleaning that Clarisonic has, but for $20, you save a lot more on something that is almost as good!</li>
            <li>If it works like this when snapped on properly (and I expect it does, it could just come off more easily), then I would say it doesn&#x27;t do any more than a soft face brush that you could use manually.</li>
            <li>Requires little time for great results.  </li>
            <li>Great little investment.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a great little machine.  </li>
            <li>It works great, I just wish the bristles were a little stronger.</li>
            <li>This is a great little device, my wife and I keep it in our shower and use it 1-2x per week.  </li>
            <li>Great little tool.</li>
            <li>would be a great little gift for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for offering the Amazon &#x27;deal&#x27;</li>
            <li>I like to exfoliate my face, and this little gadget is great for that.  </li>
            <li>Great little brush.  </li>
            <li>I wish the bristles were a little shorter, but I found this to be great for once a week exfoliation.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sitting here typing this right now with a bunch of new acne all across my chin, with a few of those wonderful, beneath</li>
            <li>However that being said, I have also noticed that the appearance of blackheads has really deminished quite drastically and the texture of my skin (normally very dry) has improved a great deal.</li>
            <li>: Mix the exfoliating gel that comes with the brush with a little of your own facewash product to get more coverage.</li>
            <li>I would have liked a little more power in the spin of the brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that when I consistently use this right before I sleep my acne will be significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something a little bit more rough, but besides that it is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>I am always trying new skincare products so the idea of having a \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; seemed exciting!!</li>
            <li>A great price compared to the other retailers!!</li>
            <li>When I use it, my skin feels so smooth and my pores look much tighter.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and much cleaner than washing by hand.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated without causing much irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in the size of my pores since I started using it and my face is so much softer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoother (your face really feels amazingly smooth after using it), brighter, and</li>
            <li>I use it with various products and my skin feels amazing</li>
            <li>But I ordered the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, and since I started using it two weeks ago, everyone is commenting on how much brighter my face looks.  </li>
            <li>I found the idea of an electric powered face cleansing gadget intriguing.  </li>
            <li>It has really made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy Olay&#x27;s products and will probably always, but this not so much.</li>
            <li>I have only had this for 2 days and the difference is amazing</li>
            <li>Great for removing dead skin off of your face and also removes some impurities that I have.</li>
            <li>I got this Olay Pro-X Advanced cleansing System she loves it , its works very well and the Olay soup</li>
            <li>skin and your make up really glides on smoothly after you use it.</li>
            <li>I really the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li>after a few weeks I&#x27;ve seen great improvement on my skin....</li>
            <li>Skin is definitely rejuvenated, shiny from the cleaning, and amazingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having never owned a Clarisonic, I can&#x27;t really compare the two, although I based my decision to buy on another fantastic, in depth review given by a woman who owns both.</li>
            <li>Using it everyday and it works great.</li>
            <li>Really cheap and work just as much as the 100 bucks one.</li>
            <li>The wife has used it a few times already and is happy as a lark.</li>
            <li>After just two uses, my skin feels amazing and actually has a glow.  </li>
            <li>Great for washing your face and removing heavy make up.</li>
            <li>It really gets makeup off and makes your face smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>I think it does a great job cleansing my face, clearing out my pores and removing dead cells.</li>
            <li>My face started clearing up and it really makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what a difference this makes versus just regular face scrub.</li>
            <li>He has been using it for several months now and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>I bought the generic Olay skin cleansing cream at Target and the Olay toner and have noticed an amazing difference in my skin within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>amazing by the second week</li>
            <li>My skin has also never been so soft and smooth and now my skin just has this amazing natural glow to it.  </li>
            <li>The facial cleanser that comes with it works amazing</li>
            <li>But this product cleanses you face really well and makes the face feels smooth and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>For the price it was worth a try, maybe it will work for you.</li>
            <li>This product was definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>Good price for a name-brand facial brush that is gentle on the face and cleans well.</li>
            <li>I bought this one instead; it does only one function - cleanses, and it does it nicely, rotating at 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>It urged me to add my success story to the growing list.  </li>
            <li>it does cost 5x the the Olay Cleaning system, but it&#x27;s well worth the price...</li>
            <li>They are worth it and stay charged a lot longer.</li>
            <li>So far, I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is a surprisingly effective device for facial cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I think it is fun to use it</li>
            <li>will say, it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tingly fresh like a lot of face scrubing lotions do, but</li>
            <li>Also, it seems to help my light facial moisturizer penetrate better.</li>
            <li>Clarisonic is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Afterwards makes your face tingling and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li>I use this about once a week as kind of big exfoliation</li>
            <li>Investing in this was worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>So far, after three or four scrubbings, I really love it.  </li>
            <li>Makes cleansing fun at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The product worked quite well but to me it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li>If it could just make the chin acne go completely away, I&#x27;d be over the moon, but that&#x27;s more than what this product is made to do.</li>
            <li>Not a crazy lopsided wobbling but for $26</li>
            <li>I think that in the end the clarisonic is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I figured for $30 it was worth a shot to try it before buying the Clarasonic.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth it</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels really fresh when I use it</li>
            <li>I believe I can safely recomend it to young boys going thru puberty.   </li>
            <li>I am so amazed by the simple, yet effective nature of this device.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $30.00 I paid for it.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer went on and absorbed well instead of feeling like it was sitting on the surface.  </li>
            <li>This is far better than the puff kinds of exfolient pads we&#x27;ve all tried.  </li>
            <li>Clarisonic does have additional options for different brushes, but I don&#x27;t honestly see the need for that.</li>
            <li>I use the Olay cleanser in the shower, and it really makes my face feel super clean.  </li>
            <li>That being said, the Pro-X has far exceeded my expectations in most areas.   </li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I recently bought this product after watching a segment on &#x27;The Doctors&#x27; about effective cleansing.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy and</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Plus you can use your own facial cleansers or scrubs.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as some of the others on the market.</li>
            <li>The two advantages I feel the  Olay sytem  has over the Conair facial brush is that its shape and size do feel more comfortable in the hand and the push button off/on switch is easier to use than the sliding switch on the Conair.  </li>
            <li>However, the Conair switch also offers the option to reverse the direction of the bristles, which also gives it a feeling that it may be doing a bit more thorough cleansing job.  </li>
            <li>I rarely recommend things but</li>
            <li>You can use your own cleaner, results are the same.  </li>
            <li>Although I rarely return anything I returned this.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough to buy one for my mother.</li>
            <li>Now that I have used it, I can say that I would be willing to pay full price for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The entire package is a product of China, and more importantly, the cleanser cream is as well made from China.</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro-X is so gentle and even has a slower, more gentle speed.</li>
            <li>my skin looks so fresh and youthful.</li>
            <li>However I love the fact that it has two speed and the fact that  when I use it my face feels extremely soft.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it ever has in my adult life</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the product itself</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>The sample bottle of cleanser is probably a tablespoon worth.</li>
            <li>3x week, but it makes my face look more alive.  </li>
            <li>So worth it.  </li>
            <li>this is worth trying out.</li>
            <li>It is perfect to hold, the brush comes off for washing, it has two speeds and the lower one does a nice overall job, the upper good for difficult places.  </li>
            <li>For 25 or 30 bucks it&#x27;s definatley worth it.</li>
            <li>Inexpense, gentle, and once again leaves you with that super clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>The Clarisonic is by far much better then this Olay brush.</li>
            <li>Clarisonic is worth the splurge .</li>
            <li>I love how soft it is on my skin</li>
            <li>I have never purchased the Olay cleansing product that came with this facial brush, I use my own cleanser.</li>
            <li>Exfoliates well and worth the money</li>
            <li>(I got $5 coupon clip during the purchase), this is the worth a try.</li>
            <li>and it was worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the slower speed to start with, again because of my sensitive skin, and it leaves my face feeling really smooth!</li>
            <li>It seems to be a far more thorough cleansing routine then a makeup remover and cleanser alone.</li>
            <li>Also, I use my own facial cleanser with this instead of the tube of cleanser</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using an old favorite soap and lotion of mine: Purpose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Skin, surface now smooth and one layer opposed to many layers of various flakiness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it an extra star because it really does feel good on your face.</li>
            <li>The brush is worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>polished &amp; fresh look..</li>
            <li>Most days I use it with Cetaphil for sensitive skin, and some days I use it with my exfoliant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is Ivory body wash nice big bottle of it for about 6 bucks and on amazon you can get a pack of 6 for about 25</li>
            <li>Quality is worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I like the 2 speed settings, but the &amp;#34;on / off and speed level buttons&amp;#34; could be marked better.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>I found that if you put the cleanser directly on your face it works better than if placing it on the scrub.</li>
            <li>It has also made my skin look and feel more alive, so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this product so far.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it and it makes cleaning her face fun.  </li>
            <li>but my skin does feel cleaner and fresh.</li>
            <li>For the price I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>, it hasn&#x27;t erased those of course, but it has made my skin so soft and it feels healthy now.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the rotating head to provide more powerful scrub action.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels afterward.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, which was not a lot.</li>
            <li>More on the soft side than anything else.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much fun to use that you&#x27;ll be tempted to use it every time you wash your face (assuming you wash your face in the morning and night).</li>
            <li>(fun bonus</li>
            <li>I rarely regret buying stuff bcz</li>
            <li>but it was too many bristles on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Use it everyday and sure takes all the make up off nicely.  </li>
            <li>This product does worth its price.</li>
            <li>I am more sensitive</li>
            <li>I have okay luck with using nutregena body clear with it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>I feel it is worth every cent I paid</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really worth a try.</li>
            <li>I was giving a spa treatment as a gift, and I had a professional use a \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; cleanser on my face.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads constantly fall off, no matter what kind you get.</li>
            <li>The brush feels rough on my face, but it does a good job cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Worth the monty.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a nice complement to my nightly facial care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure, makes my skin feel soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li>My face always feels good and clean after using it and I have less problems with acne if I use it every day.</li>
            <li>I only used the brush with my own cleanser, not the one that comes with this item, so can&#x27;t comment on the cleanser</li>
            <li>this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that using a bit of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like getting a nice invigorating facial message.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>and for around $20 this is so worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely use a wash cloth or scrubs.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost here on Amazon</li>
            <li>but my own facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>and I think it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend got this for me after hearing me talk about it for months, wondering if it was worth the hype, and noticed I hadn&#x27;t bought one.</li>
            <li>I think this is very much worth a $45 investment.</li>
            <li>Also, while the Pro-x brush rotates it doesn&#x27;t have the outer vibrating bristles that the Mia has, which I don&#x27;t think makes a difference except it makes the Mia brush head a bit bigger than the Pro-x, but to make my Pro-x really effective</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>Wow, I am so glad I returned the Clarisonic and bought the Olay Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>The Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System (spin brush) is a jewel!  </li>
            <li>I use it 2-3 times per week at night and rarely 2 days in a row.   </li>
            <li>I decided to try this cleansing system after years of not being able to achieve clear skin.</li>
            <li>WELL worth the money.  </li>
            <li>certainly  worth for recommendation.</li>
            <li>I am going to continue using it though, because it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>and I have probably the most sensitive skin in the world.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>, andI still find that they are worth it.</li>
            <li>but worked nicely all the same.</li>
            <li>Batteries run out often increasing the overall cost to own it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price compared to the pricey alternatives.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s worth it -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the end all answer, but it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>For a while, I would just cover it up with make up, BUT NOW I am not afraid to go out with out</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use their cleanser with the product because I like more natural cleaners</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s from my natural cleanser</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this so far...</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling so fresh.</li>
            <li>Soft but does a good job so far.</li>
            <li>This was indeed worth the prize.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I expected more for something costing almost 30 dollars, it&#x27;s worth more like $11.99</li>
            <li>It really smoothes and exfoliates very well and the medicated moisturizer works so much better.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Compared to the Neutrogena pad cleanser, the Olay offers better value for money.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed this product and it actually is better than i expected</li>
            <li>I personally just kind of think that these contraptions strip my skin.</li>
            <li>The pro-x has been the only thing I use every morning and night with my own cleanser to wash my face</li>
            <li>and it cleans so much better than your hands and makes your face really soft by exfoliation.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt so soft :)</li>
            <li>Worth the &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I especially like that I can use it in the shower and with my own face wash.</li>
            <li>An unexpected upside has been better management of those unsightly stray hairs that pop up on my chin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have since stopped using it because just rinsing my face every morning is better at keeping my face clear of any acne.</li>
            <li>I did not see it being worth it.</li>
            <li>If it lasts for even 6 months I&#x27;ll have gotten my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li>It is worth your money.</li>
            <li>On and off button with 2 speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the product (I use my own face wash on a daily basis and use the Olay&#x27;s micro abrasion stuff once a week)</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>she is pleased, says it is exactly what she needed, small compact so good for traveling and storage</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but for the price I paid for it - it was worth it.</li>
            <li>For a fraction of the cost in comparison to some of the spendier version this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that my skin will continue to clear and my acne will eventually be more under control.  </li>
            <li>Know what works FAR better?  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I got the Olay Pro X because I had heard good things about Clarisonic&#x27;s Mia from my sister (who has similar skin) but wasn&#x27;t ready to commit to buying a clarisonic yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li>However, this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and it is totally worth the $$$</li>
            <li>The Advanced Cleansing System cleans 6 times better than basic cleansing with a cloth or your hands.  </li>
            <li>Nice deep cleansing system.</li>
            <li>a daily really cleans my face good</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had some complexion problems and needed to try some way to maintain healthy clear</li>
            <li>Definitly worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I can already notice 3 distinct improvements in my skin&lt;</li>
            <li>Not that exciting a product.</li>
            <li>A very tiny sample of cleansing gel came with this, but you can use any kind you like.</li>
            <li>I have a nice glow after using, however I use the cleanser I&#x27;ve always used for my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I use it every night and my skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li>For an inexpensive cleansing system...its worth the money.  </li>
            <li>For the price it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li>So worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>I use my own exfoliating facial scrub (neutrogena, I think).</li>
            <li>Now I can actually have my own spa at home.</li>
            <li>The brush head is much smaller than the Clarisonic, but it Works nicely though.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Use your own facial cleanser if you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>This brush is 100% worth the results</li>
            <li>This brush is 100% worth the results</li>
            <li>for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I guess for only $20 its okay, but think next time I would spend a bit more to get a better quality.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a cleaning brush that is effective, yet inexpensive, Olay Prox is definitely it!</li>
            <li>My skin has never been THIS SOFT and THIS SMOOTH!  </li>
            <li>That way, it creates more shifting action like the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>It is worth to buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been in use for about a month and seems sturdy and useful.</li>
            <li>Thought it would be more professional.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I using it everyday, loving it and my skin now look better then ever</li>
            <li>and it has helped my complexion stay clear and pimple free!</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never before been able to use anything because of my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>(LOL-I can laugh and joke about this now, but up til</li>
            <li>It was worth the price and it delivered beyond expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product is so worth it.</li>
            <li>I bought this about 2 months ago, and the product proves to be great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;CLEANSING - Clarisonic \\&quot; has 300 movements per second to gently, yet thoroughly remove 6X more makeup and 2X more dirt and oil than cleansing with your hands</li>
            <li>The Mia is by far a better product.</li>
            <li>A gift to my wife and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles really felt nice.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as nice as the one that comes with the facial cleansing product on TV.</li>
            <li>The oil of olay brush is also considerably smaller, lighter and feels way more comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>My blackheads have cleared, I rarely have break outs, my skin is softer, and my acne scars have started to fade.</li>
            <li>my skin is smoother and more clear already.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my husband and for my own use as a replacement because I kept dropping the Clarisonic until it stopped functioning after the last drop.  </li>
            <li>Since it didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s fallen out of my rotation because frankly if it doesn&#x27;t do anything exciting, I don&#x27;t have time for it.</li>
            <li>and I am not crazy</li>
            <li>this product is so worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I started out using it twice a day (morning and evening) with my own facial cleanser</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, inexpensive, does the job nicely, not to harsh.</li>
            <li>I do think it works better then just washing your face with a soft wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fun to use to</li>
            <li>I love the feel of how soft my skin is after using the product.</li>
            <li>I own a SonicCare toothbrush, and I  thought the technology would be similar, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it.</li>
            <li>Still, I dont think it was worth it.</li>
            <li>The bristles seem a bit too soft &amp; could use a bit more power</li>
            <li>This made me smile.</li>
            <li>Have enjoyed this product so far.  </li>
            <li>So far my skin looks better in a bit brighter since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>, it makes it fun to wash your face while simultaneously drawing attention to areas of your complexion</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Honestly If i could I would return it and get my money back.</li>
            <li>, well worth it.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive so even going over the breakouts is okay.</li>
            <li>but it is definately worth it.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, but not too soft, and the exfoliating sample is a good quality.  </li>
            <li>, I actually look forward to cleaning my face and applying my moisturizer because I can&#x27;t wait to see how nice my skin look and feels in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I actually look forward to cleaning my face and applying my moisturizer because I can&#x27;t wait to see how nice my skin look and feels in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I ran out of the cleanser that came with the Pro-X, I started using my own face wash (a deep cleansing wash from Target).</li>
            <li>I returned to using the old fashioned Buff Puff, which works better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Amazingly soft and supple skin with ProX by Olay Advanced!</li>
            <li>It is useful.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>but this is a GOOD and inexpensive way to get a deep facial cleansing and for most of us</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>This has helped my skin to be more clear.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft but effective and the two speeds come in handy for control in sensitive are near the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Another thing I liked about it is it took any foundation I had left on my face.</li>
            <li>This product is not bad, just did not have the amazing clean as the other reviewers.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin very smooth, soft, bright and clean after few week of using it.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin feeling very dry, rather than very clean and as a result I need moisturizer now more than ever.</li>
            <li>I am a 50 year old man, but I have oily facial skin, so I decided to try it, and I am very pleased with how it cleans and makes cleaning easy and fun.</li>
            <li>but luckily I watched a how to video before purchasing product, very gentle on skin</li>
            <li>Easy to operate, small but perfect for facial care.  </li>
            <li>The Olay Advanced Cleaning System cleans very well and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to have a stronger or more stiff brush head.  </li>
            <li>The speed of the rotating bristles is just right so that it removes dirt but is still smooth and gentle to your face.</li>
            <li>The brush head rotates, and the bristles are of the perfect density, not too stiff, not too soft.</li>
            <li>It is small so can be packed easily, even slipped in your handbag, if your carry a good sized one like me.</li>
            <li>Its super quick, easy and not very messy</li>
            <li>I had been trying to decide between buying the more expensive Clarsonic and ended up purchasing this instead since it got great reviews and was significantly cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love it for cleaning my face and getting all the dirt out, It is good for other things as well, I like it as it is soft on your skin as well as it gets into places</li>
            <li>I looked into getting the more expensive versions, but glad that I bought this instead as it&#x27;s much more budget friendly!</li>
            <li>Since the very day I started to use this product my face has felt more alive and fresh!  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this tool is less or equally effective as using a nonelectric skin brush and less effective as using the Aveda Shammy Cloth.</li>
            <li>it comes with (more of a cleanser with tiny gentle exfoliating beads) which made my skin feel so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Just received this and am very pleased, especially since reviews seem to be overwhelmingly positive.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy since it was very inexpensive compared to other products, but works great</li>
            <li>I like the polisher, it&#x27;s relatively affordable, and gives me a great deep clean.</li>
            <li>The brush rotates just fine, and cleans very well, better than I can do with my bare hands.</li>
            <li>Its awesome, cheaper and does that same thing the other brand does that is like 150.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it works for so many other people, though--</li>
            <li>Thought I was cleansing well, but this is super &amp; gentle!</li>
            <li>After using the scrub and the pro x consistently with my morning shower, I can see a tremendous improvement.</li>
            <li>Great little cleansing b rush and very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>So this is by far named the second best, it&#x27;s water proof which is amazing because you can wash your face in the shower which I find cleans better because your pores are open due to the steam from the hot water.</li>
            <li>My mother, a natural redhead with bright green eyes, was sitting next to me and told me how beautiful the pores on the side of my face looked, and immediately demanded I buy her a brush.  </li>
            <li>This little machine works gently but very effectively, my face feels extremely clean but not \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; after use.  </li>
            <li>Especially good for older delicate skin.</li>
            <li>Read a few reviews and it seems a good price and way to clean</li>
            <li>I can feel my skin clean and clear smooth and reduce scar and whitehead and blackhead.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the jewelry will be in the way and you won&#x27;t be able to clean that area properly.</li>
            <li>Have been using for over a month and it truly does open and clean my pores better than hands alone.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item in hopes of getting better results removing make-up and deep clean pores.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft against your skin and leaves your face feeling clean, smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>So I was pleasantly surprised to see how well this product worked to keep my face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>After using the olay pro x with my neatrageana oil free face wash my skin feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>clean skin very efficiently, it does a peeling and is also useful to remove make up using  face cleaning.</li>
            <li>This thing was more than clean - it was totally sterile!</li>
            <li>My face always feels so clean, soft and smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It gets my skin clean and makes it smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for a week and really enjoy how clean and soft my skin is already.</li>
            <li>I can say that my face definitely feels more clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use it dry just to buff away some dry skin on my nose - and it works beautifully!  </li>
            <li>really like the fact that it leaves my skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>seems to help clean the dead skin off face feels good after use</li>
            <li>and I thought it stopped working, but I think it was mostly because I did not wash the brush clean enough.</li>
            <li>I have never owned a facial cleansing system so this particular model is a good value for money, for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean after each use and it has been clear even since I started using it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very clean and so soft.  </li>
            <li>I often get compliments on my skin, and I know that the Olay Pro-X Cleansing System is the major part of my skin staying clear and having good texture.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and fits in a nice, small organizer.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut my skin like other brands, and my skin feels soooooo good.</li>
            <li>Price was good compared to the other systems that cost hundreds.</li>
            <li>This is a fair price compared to the other products.</li>
            <li>The brushes are pretty soft and good for a pre-teen with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I tried this product based off of other good reviews.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t like the fact that it does not come with instructions but other then that it is a good</li>
            <li>but other then that good product</li>
            <li>We use it with other soaps and cleaners and have had good results.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s still a good product and not a bad facial product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also, is it really making our skin look better or is it the fact that we tend to wash our faces more frequently when we have a new product?  </li>
            <li>Thank You so very much for making it available and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The high speed is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>The brush is gentle enough not to feel like you are &amp;#34;over-scrubbing&amp;#34; your skin but strong enough to make you feel you are getting a truly thorough cleaning (a great balance).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and highly recommend others to buy it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Oil free and sensitive skin lotions, exfoliating face washes, special toners, etc.  </li>
            <li>Right before I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right before I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying it as the price is right</li>
            <li>Not liking the condition my skin is in right now...</li>
            <li>and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>I exfoliate right before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>That is why I wrote this out and why I endorse the product, not because I have to or because I feel obligated but because it means a lot to me to feel right</li>
            <li>But, for 150 bucks, I am going to pass for right now.  </li>
            <li>but for my needs it is just right.  </li>
            <li>so it fits right in your shower holder</li>
            <li>The machine is compact so it fits right in your shower holder</li>
            <li>It felt like the right amount of rotation when combined with the cleaner.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>and it pops right off.</li>
            <li>so I must be doing something right.  </li>
            <li>She said it broke her our a couple places, but I think its just the impurities right under the skin get exposed.</li>
            <li>the motor&#x27;s speed is just right.</li>
            <li>just right?    </li>
            <li>Moisturizers and skin care products just melt right into your skin like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  </li>
            <li>and I never seem to find the right cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I started using it right away</li>
            <li>They started out on the right side of my face, then went to my forehead, then went to my chin area.</li>
            <li>So i decided to stop using it for right now.</li>
            <li>I found the Olay system, and the price seemed right.</li>
            <li>The price was right so it will work for me for the time being.</li>
            <li>It is priced just right and does what I want it to do.</li>
            <li>The size is right, too.</li>
            <li>It pulls right out, and you can put the batteries in.</li>
            <li>So after doing research, I went to Ulta (I didn&#x27;t want to wait for shipping), and bought it, took it home and used it right away.</li>
            <li>I used it right away, with the product it came with.</li>
            <li>Still when I compare, the price is right</li>
            <li>It works well and has just the right amount of pressure.</li>
            <li>and it comes right off.</li>
            <li>and you can notice the results right away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my eye on the Clarsonic for a while, but it was something I just couldnt afford right now.</li>
            <li>and  my makeup just glides right on.  </li>
            <li>and it gets the job done right.</li>
            <li>The brush head that is included is just the right firmness...</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I would keep it in my shower caddy or right beside the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>reviewers are right.</li>
            <li>I used the product and right away could feel a difference.</li>
            <li>I feel the difference right away, my skin improved after I used it.</li>
            <li>The instructions are printed right on the box</li>
            <li>I know these brushes are all the rage right now, maybe  I don&#x27;t have the right skin for this(?)</li>
            <li>The size is just right for use in the shower, it is water proof and it has two speeds.</li>
            <li>uh right, whatever.  </li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>Jury is still out on whether or not the Clairsonic is right for me or if this will just suffice as I&#x27;m still on the fence in spending the money on a Clairsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin stared shining right after I have stared using it.</li>
            <li>I say go get this right now and give it a try.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>i wonder if you can send me a softer comb or something softer since i think i have the right...</li>
            <li>Right now I use twice a week.</li>
            <li>face if he&#x27;s within arms reach of me when I&#x27;m using it because ..hey guys need to exfoliate too right?</li>
            <li>I started using it right away and can already tell a differency in my skin.</li>
            <li>Its good for a regular facial clean but if you really need some deep cleaning...probably do better to get a more powerful brush and unit.</li>
            <li>I do not use any other cleaning product on my face now; it&#x27;s gentle and feels very nice.  </li>
            <li>If you have more acne, you will probably go through a longer process of new breakouts caused by this brush, but in a lot of cases, it is a necessary step to getting better</li>
            <li>First use, sloughed off dead skin, felt great.</li>
            <li>but with a huge bottle of that cleanser for a decent price.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with how gentle and quiet it is.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the Olay Cleanser that was enclosed, so I have been using it with a drop of anti-aging body wash or even Noxema for a gentle massage and clean.  </li>
            <li>surprised to see how small the cleaning soap was but was very happy with brush.</li>
            <li>It really gets your face clean.</li>
            <li>Small, comfortable in hands, waterproof and the sample Olay cleansing cream is good too.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle and clean my face well.</li>
            <li>It really works to clean your face and I will use it always.  </li>
            <li>It really makes your face feel clean and brightens your complexion.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem to deeply clean</li>
            <li>It provides a much deeper clean than you can get with just using a cleanser and wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>When I first received the System and used it, the next day I had a friend comment on how nice my face looked.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I love how small it is, it fits nicely in your hand and travels well.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t wash my face without a product like this ever again, it definitely is a much deeper clean than using just a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>The device delivers the expectation which clean my skin very well.</li>
            <li>The low speed is strong enough to make my skin feel like it&#x27;s gotten a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Really gets my pores squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I use it with Proactive &amp; it really gets my pores clean.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants clean skin.  </li>
            <li>(I normally use biore foaming facial cleaner which is good but has nothing on this)</li>
            <li>It was vibrant and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>but I at least can be happy I got the full refund</li>
            <li>And it is MUCH easier to clean.</li>
            <li>The Olay is very inexpensive compared to Clarisonic and it does the job and encourages the girls to really clean their skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to exfoliate their skin to help look clean and keep acne at bay.  </li>
            <li>Really liked the way it made my face feel so decided to buy a second one from Walmart since I got a coupon from the purchase of first one.  </li>
            <li>This system does exactly what I hoped it would - it cleans my face better than anything I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fortunate to have decent skin to begin with, but I was looking for something that would help scrub off the excess oil and grime that would build up throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It works remarkably well, especially at it&#x27;s price point for delivering a result of soft, well cleansed skin.</li>
            <li>I believe this system helps me clean my face really well every day.</li>
            <li>Clean the face very well</li>
            <li>The applicator is extremely easy to use, light weight, and only takes 2 AAA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Olay Pro-X along with a cleansing cream that I purchased along with the applicator, my skin felt fresh.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally awesome - your skin just comes off in your hands and your face is unbelievable soft after.  </li>
            <li>This make my face feel clean and much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from cystic acne and this really helps me to clean my face the way it needs to be cleaned.</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants clean skin will benefit, men and women both.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would really get into my pores and clean the oil out while reducing the size of my pores.  </li>
            <li>Really getts skin clean without irritation.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped to brighten and clean my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did--the brush is exactly like my old one.</li>
            <li>Thus, it doesn&#x27;t really get the face clean</li>
            <li>It really gets out all the dirt and makeup and thus keeps my complexion clean.</li>
            <li>I combine it with Cetaphil for a gentle, but thorough clean.</li>
            <li>Great little machine!</li>
            <li>, I am so happy with this little gadget!</li>
            <li>Great little cleanser!</li>
            <li>The brush is soft which I like because I have sensitive skin, and having 2 speeds is perfect so you can either lightly go over your face for morning cleansing, or do a little deeper cleaning at night when you take your makeup off.</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail price for this.</li>
            <li>for the product review:&lt;br /&gt;I think it does a very good job of removing dead skin cells and promoting new skin growth.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it&#x27;s very easy to get the battery cover off - as the instructions suggest, rock it back and forth while pulling it away from the unit.</li>
            <li>It tiny and isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is very easy to use, I use it daily.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive too and easily irritated.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about, because my box had very clear and easy to follow directions.  </li>
            <li>Well, I have to say, it does a wonderful job of getting deep down into the pores-</li>
            <li>The one with a cosmetic brand name... sold at the department store, too, and offered online for MUCH MORE if you are not careful!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too soon to see any major results, but I have noticed that my skin feels SO smooth after using it!  </li>
            <li>this is comparable to the more expensive system, I am glad I didn&#x27;t spend more money!</li>
            <li>but since the results from this product have been so positive and so quick</li>
            <li>but since the results from this product have been so positive and so quick</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this system for a smooth and softer face.</li>
            <li>Daughter loves how soft and clean her face is now!  </li>
            <li>My face is soft and clean after using it!</li>
            <li>I wish it had a stand or holder though, to stand it to dry after use  UPDATE: I still love it!</li>
            <li>My face is so soft and clean!</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and clean!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need a special body brush, I use this all over.</li>
            <li>You will really see a difference in your skin right away!  </li>
            <li>I thought well is it really doing anything special?  </li>
            <li>Great value for the money compared to other high end units that cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful little soft brush that really cleanses your face.  </li>
            <li>I believe that the magic is really more the brush and less the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I had been on the fence about whether this was worth all of the hype I had been reading, but then decided if it works half as well for my skin, then it would be a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Ok anyways I got over it quick when I saw the price, I was watching tv last night and saw a comerciall for this product and googled it.  </li>
            <li>and I always tell people that it&#x27;s thanks to the Pro-X. I also want to point out that the cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but still does a good job of removing my makeup.</li>
            <li>It works about as well as Anew&#x27;s mild glycolic retexturizing peel to keep my skin looking younger and smoother, but unlike most of the masks I&#x27;ve tried there&#x27;s no drying effect.</li>
            <li>It makes exfoliation a quick and enjoyable part of one&#x27;s daily routine and this alone makes it a valuable tool.</li>
            <li>I went to a lot of trouble to find it again to replace the first one I had because I like it very much and think it is a great price.  </li>
            <li>If you, however, have very sensitive, fragile skin it might be a good alternative for you.</li>
            <li>Hmm, I would say it&#x27;s pretty useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But overall, I really like the cleansing system and would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay too much to get a good face cleansing system.</li>
            <li>It gives you a thorough cleaning and clears out pores that you may not have been able to get to before with your bare fingers.  </li>
            <li>I am sure the Clarisonic is worth every penny as the reviews imply, however I was excited to try something similar for a much lower price.</li>
            <li>This gives just enough exfoliation to make your skin look and feel great, but it it gentle, too and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If different size brush heads were available, this would probably be a good treatment for chest and back acne.</li>
            <li>Better than washing with your bare hands or paying almost $200 for cleansing device.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this system that I&#x27;m not sure whether</li>
            <li>in all, this a great product if you&#x27;re looking for something to boost the efficacy of your usual face wash.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product for small price that it costs.</li>
            <li>I used it lightly, on the lower setting, for a normal amount of time.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I went ahead and bought the full size one because it&#x27;s the only thing that helps clear up my acne!</li>
            <li>It gets my face really clean and leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>They are using them religiously and I am so please they have embraced good skin care habits at this young age!  </li>
            <li>While there are more high end models charging you high end prices, this one here gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is such a deep clean that I can now go throughout my day feeling more confident in my appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product for someone her age with acne, since she is not quite old enough to always want to clean her skin thoroughly, even though she desperately wants the acne to be gone.</li>
            <li>It is really good if you just want an extra deep cleaning and my face feels so clean and fresh after.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I ordered 4 brush refills and a large bottle of cleanser just to make sure I&#x27;d have it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>lol - but by the end of my first week&#x27;s use I was starting to get the pesky little whiteheads which is a sure sign of over-exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I just use a cheap generic brand of exfoliant scrub and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine, but honestly it doesn&#x27;t compare to the Clarisonic for a few reasons.</li>
            <li>The brush is really gentle, but clean my skin really well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and easy to use and helps exfoliates her skin making it look brighter!</li>
            <li>The product works fine and left my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It is tiny and easy to use it during shower!</li>
            <li>I do wish it was more advanced..or a little more power..</li>
            <li>My skin feels fantastic after using it, and it feels like a nice little face massage while using it.</li>
            <li>Somehow it is way easier to brush longer when it feels good and soothing, is effortless, maybe even a little fun, and you see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- (just 1 more thing to love about this little beauty)</li>
            <li>When the exceptional deal price popped up the other day, i grabbed it.</li>
            <li>When I use it consistently with a mild face wash or the exfoliating gel that comes with it, my face stays clear and free of blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for several weeks and the batteries are still going strong too!</li>
            <li>I use my own facial cleanser to wash my face first, then I go in with a bit more cleanser and the Olay brush to do the deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>its fine it did give some changes on my face so good product :) but the wash cleanser bottle is like half way empty</li>
            <li>perfectly.this little mild gentle scrubber, used daily, will do that perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found it for a much cheaper price than many other brands.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very smooth, but without being overly tight after I use it, and the best part: my pores are significantly smaller in size, something I never thought would be possible.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of all the positive reviews and substantial marketing materials that made it sound like a very new and upgraded way to wash your face.</li>
            <li>Only good / positive remarks that I can add to that is - That the proof is in the product &amp; little handy dandy durable machine (lol).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I saw and felt results right away.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a large bottle of the pro-x face cleanser!</li>
            <li>Even my first time using the product, I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>That is EXACTLY what happened right after using this product.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it I saw the difference right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;you can notice the difference right after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li>The cleansing liquid is soft and not irritating, and my skin feels clean and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up in only a week thanks to this handy tool.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist said it is too rough to use and really isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li>so cleaned it up using a Q-tip and used a blow dryer to kind of dry this residue i even changed the battery just in case</li>
            <li>Plus with the rotating motion of the brush, I feel you&#x27;re getting a good CLEANSING action (maybe not enough exfoliating...</li>
            <li>Am happy to report my pores are smaller, skin is smoother than ever, and skin is definitely back in the \\&quot;you&#x27;re glowing\\&quot; category.</li>
            <li>The brush action more gentle than anticipated</li>
            <li>I am so happy I chose Olay instead of the more expensive version from Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>Having naturally oily skin, I noticed a significant difference the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Also, the Sirius Sonic which is very comparable to the pricy Clarisonic is amazing and only $50.</li>
            <li>I was actually contemplating purchasing the Clarisonic cleanser after reading such great reviews from the beauty blogging community, but was hesitant because of the price.  </li>
            <li>I had been saving up to buy a Clarisonic cleansing brush after it was strongly recommended to me during a professional makeup consultation.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how soft the brush head was for it to be as effective as it is.</li>
            <li>Mine is a year old now and still going strong.</li>
            <li>I use a different cleanser, but the spin brush exfoliates great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It is a bit different but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad someone recommended this affordable face scrubber machine rather than spend so much on the professional $200 machine that will also scrub your body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once, and it&#x27;s nice and gentle.  </li>
            <li>In my humble opinion, they have great products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>Post facial products are being absorbed better than before.</li>
            <li>So... why is gentle better than a literally-sonic scrub action?</li>
            <li>I went back and forth between the two, reading reviews and so on, and it was when I finally saw a report by a dermatologist who said that the Clarisonic works great in cleaning the skin but that it&#x27;s not an exfoliator and doesn&#x27;t stop wrinkles.</li>
            <li>They really should PROVIDE TWO BRUSHES, one for sensitive skin and one for more friction.</li>
            <li>:) If I remember, I will write an update after a few more weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the many reviews raving about it and the few that were not as pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Similar concept and useful for a deeper scrub as the pads are rougher and more exfoliating.</li>
            <li>love this &amp; use it every few days in the shower, love that uts waterproof</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend Cetaphil&lt;br /&gt;or baby shampoo for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m using it every morning in the shower, just a quick two times over my whole face.  </li>
            <li>Just like most I was looking for something more affordable than a few hundred dollars.</li>
            <li>only thing that didn&#x27;t make me so happy is that I paid the same ampunt for the item and the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I thought about buying the more expensive items but this was a great buy and it works.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much money you spend on a facial cleanser it won&#x27;t work effectively unless you have a cleansing system and for 1/3 the price of a clearosonic</li>
            <li>but my face has a natural nice glow to it where my skin is clear.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to the clarisonic system that&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
            <li>When I watch the demos on QVC, the Clarisonic (Mia) seems to work super fast on waterproof makeup.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle, and my face feels adequately exfoliated.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready to shell out big bucks for another system, but I knew that my skin, blackheads, and pores needed something effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price, when compared to the more expensive options.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This costs less than the others and does just as good a job.</li>
            <li>Of course I still had a couple of blackheads, but that&#x27;s much easier to clear than the many I had days before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After about a week and a half of using this, I began to notice a good improvement in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>is good but with poor power, is better is you use your hands, the batery ends inmediatly, I don´t like it</li>
            <li>This item I received super fast</li>
            <li>The skin on my face feels so nice with the gentle daily exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I plan to stick with this one as opposed to the more expensive versions because the results are great.  </li>
            <li>The brush always helps remove dry skin effectively.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and effective - especially for those with combination skin.  </li>
            <li>This is an easy way to thoroughly clean your skin while exfoliating at the same time.  </li>
            <li>: Keeps skin soft, cleans out blackheads, easy to find replacement brush heads</li>
            <li>It really leaves my face soft with a healthy polished glow.</li>
            <li>Feels GREAT on the face and definitely beats washing your face with your hands, I just wish the exfoliating clenser in the box a bigger quantity and not just a sample size</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and super clean.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are easy to change, and I&#x27;ve replaced it once so far.</li>
            <li>Love this cleansing system, soft brush and makes your face feel so clean and soft</li>
            <li>After use, it appears to make my skin super clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have no reason to buy a more expensive brand because this works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 25-year-old female with fair, oily, acne-prone and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I feel that the bristles really get into my facial skin and clean the makeup off better than a washcloth or just using my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All facial brushes do the same thing, it was a great buy.</li>
            <li>I passed the Olay Cleansing System several times in stores but figured there must be something not so great about it if it&#x27;s only $20-30 dollars.</li>
            <li>recently read a review that stated if you compare the two products they are very similar and get the job done equally as great.</li>
            <li>I have been using my regular Cetaphil cleanser with the brush twice daily, and the Olay scrub once a week with great results.  </li>
            <li>Whatever it takes to get good habits inbedded as early as possibly, huh?</li>
            <li>This is super gentle...too much so for me.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic is definitely more powerful and has a bigger brush head the olays.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel super soft, minimizes pores and leaves you with a really clean feeling face.</li>
            <li>delivery was super fast,</li>
            <li>The Pro-X does a nice cleansing job at a good speed you don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>It feels high quality, it&#x27;s very simple to use and works great so far.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and smooth and not irritated.</li>
            <li>This cleansing tool is fabulous and always makes my skin feel so very soft afterward.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and comfortable on my face</li>
            <li>face is baby soft, I keep on feeling it and am amazed--my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft or looked this good since high school</li>
            <li>Blemishes are clearing quickly now that I actually get my face CLEAN!</li>
            <li>The brush isn&#x27;t super rough or too easy, it&#x27;s just right and leaves your face feeling clean &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the wash they sent but my face feels so smooth and buttery soft when I use this thing!  </li>
            <li>Being an avid couponer, I was so happy to see that when I bought this system the second time, there was a digital coupon for $2 off this product!</li>
            <li>Being an avid couponer, I was so happy to see that when I bought this system the second time, there was a digital coupon for $2 off this product!</li>
            <li>I have a light complexion and sensitive skin and this works for me!</li>
            <li>Also, the exfoliator that comes with this kit is pretty rough, there are better ones available in stores.</li>
            <li>so I cannot compare,  the only thing is I would of liked the brush bristles to be a bit softer as I believe that the face skin is very delicate, but once you use a light hand your good to go.</li>
            <li>2A&#x27;s    Conair - Cover slipped right off  Olay - I tried and haven&#x27;t been able to open the battery compartment yet.  </li>
            <li>great product, very cheap and is the same exact thing as the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft so most people will probably be fine with daily use of the brush.  </li>
            <li>Running the brush over my face is quite relaxing and pleasant, not harsh at all as long as I pay attention.  </li>
            <li>The brush applied the cleanser easily with no mess.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a very reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very very much.</li>
            <li>The unit is very gentle to your skin</li>
            <li>Also, is very much under powered.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>The CS vibrates very fast....</li>
            <li>but this is very gently and</li>
            <li>It was very gentle with no fragrances.</li>
            <li>The brush is very gentle</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have very much power.</li>
            <li>, I need to be very gentle to my skin when cleansing.</li>
            <li>I find it very gentle</li>
            <li>The brush is very gentle</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>This product is a very gentle yet thorough cleansing system.  </li>
            <li>it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I like this system very much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much like the buffer I was using from Susan Lucci.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliating cleanser is very gentle</li>
            <li>She likes it very much.</li>
            <li>, I need to be very gentle to my skin when cleansing.</li>
            <li>I like it very much but find they have a shorter life span than I would expect.  </li>
            <li>Bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Its very gentle on my face and gets th e job done.</li>
            <li>very gentle brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The giftee was very very happty to receive it.</li>
            <li>The sheets are just what I wanted,like very much.</li>
            <li>I am very gentle with using it</li>
            <li>This made my skin look so polished from day 1 and very gentle.</li>
            <li>I used the battery operated brush on my face and it was very gentle, but it did polish my face and exfoliate it.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>The scrub that comes with this runs out very fast.  </li>
            <li>very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, dont like being made to give a revew</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t have very much power, probably because it is battery operated.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have very much power.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle to the feel on the face</li>
            <li>and I use it with very gentle face soap -</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and I couldn&#x27;t tell that it was doing anything while using it</li>
            <li>The nice thing about this package is that the batteries are included in the package, but not physically in the handheld device, so you know that the batteries are new and fresh, not sitting in the device just dying.</li>
            <li>It works very well on your face and it feels very clean and soft afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally used to just clean my face with wipes and then wash my face with face wash</li>
            <li>works fine so far.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and using this is just fine.</li>
            <li>brush has two speeds and both are just fine by my sensitive, mid-30 skin.</li>
            <li>I have a really oily face with a lot of black spots, using it on a daily basis has help reduce both problems, very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, it uses batteries, can get wet, and leaves your skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>But so far it works fine.</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviews, I haven&#x27;t noticed a great difference yet, but it&#x27;s clearly a quality product.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it is fantastic and I am glad I bought it and would buy another one.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel real soft and clean,  </li>
            <li>i really, REALLY try to stay away from exfoliators but decided an electronic cleanser would be ok with my mild daily face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this new tool in my new regime.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that can&#x27;t handle most exfoliation products, yet occasional exfoliation is integral to smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles, i did notice it kept my face clear, easy to use and to clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with how soft the bristles actually are because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>positive reviews are right.</li>
            <li>This little beauty does a good job though.</li>
            <li>I loved the little sample that came with it.</li>
            <li>Good, because it gets into the little spaces on your face that the Clarisonic does not.</li>
            <li>Shipper got it to me fast, and I&#x27;m ready to purchase replacement heads!!</li>
            <li>Considering the price of other products similar to this one, this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System is an effective and well built bargain!</li>
            <li>I wish it came with a little bag, but a plastic baggie works just as good if you are traveling.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product but losing $32 wasn&#x27;t funny at all!</li>
            <li>My breakouts are rare and my skin always feels soft and clean after using the brush.</li>
            <li>It felt so clean, fresh, and soft.</li>
            <li>I brought this product mainly because everyone talked about the big name brand competitor and how amazing it was.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that will deep clean my makeup off and leave my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>My only suggestion otherwise is that you should not use it more then once a day because you can easily over stimulate your skin (especially if you have sensitive skin) which can cause more oil producation and breakage of your skin which can cause redness/swelling.</li>
            <li>the fact has 2 different speeds &amp; so economical..received item quickly &amp; had it 4 months now &amp; still working strong....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, smooth, tight, and just feels so good.  </li>
            <li>Such a wonderful little product!</li>
            <li>My skin is on the dryer side of normal and feels smoother, but not raw, and looks more even after using the spinning brush head with an oil-based cleanser (not part of the system).  </li>
            <li>I am looking for something more natural with the same fine exfoliating texture.  </li>
            <li>I also travel a bit, so I prefer the battery operated Olay product because it&#x27;s easier to pack and use on the go (a little tricky when you first change the batteries, but after that, you&#x27;re good to go).  </li>
            <li>But, I think for most people this would not clean good enough.  </li>
            <li>The movement isn&#x27;t as great as the clarisonic and maybe the brush is not as hard has the clarisonic</li>
            <li>Not as high powered as my last one, but it works nicely.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery, no extra charges, safely packaged.</li>
            <li>Wish more speeds were available but overall it saves on having to wash face towels constantly and provides a clean feeling when done.</li>
            <li>The brush is as powerful as the more expensive ones and gives a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>so I use one without the little exfoliation beads, I feel like this tool does a good enough job without adding more abrasiveness.</li>
            <li>Face cleansing was never high on my priority list, but this gadget makes it so easy that I actually enjoy the process.</li>
            <li>I have huge pores, oily skin, and frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is a well designed product that I like so much I am thinking of getting one for my daughter and another for her mother-in-law!</li>
            <li>Love this facial brush!</li>
            <li>Even I&#x27;d you don&#x27;t use the microderm cleanser and just use your every day facewash it makes washing your face so much easier!</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference after first use.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed todo, but at 75% the purchase price.  </li>
            <li>Really!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I buy it.</li>
            <li>Is not expensive, waterproof so you can leave it</li>
            <li>And persevere through the first time.</li>
            <li>In short, I&#x27;m really glad I bought this cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>I debated about purchasing this because I&#x27;m pretty disciplined with my established skin care regime, but using the cleansing system is like a trip to the spa (without the expense).</li>
            <li>Although I use mine at the sink, it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s not going to burn out because it got wet.</li>
            <li>They really should have included instructions for this!</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li>This facial brush cleans better and my skin is smoother when I apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I rub the cleanser into my skin with my hands first and then go over it with the brush.  </li>
            <li>It really cleans out my skin and makes my face look fresh.</li>
            <li>AND it had more a couple extra brushes with it.</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin is evidently softer and smoother after each use.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the Clarisonic because the head is a lot smaller which allows you to get into every nook in your face without having soap splash everywhere.</li>
            <li>Broke after first use.</li>
            <li>I can only attribute that to the fact that it is in fact cleaning my skin better than just the cleanser alone.  </li>
            <li>First let me say I do exfoliate often.</li>
            <li>Maybe it does some more exfoliation, but I don&#x27;t fee the different yet.</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li>it was more oily and my pores seemed larger after each use.</li>
            <li>I also love that it comes with a sample of the PRO-x exfoliation facial scrub.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought an extra head for the hand held device</li>
            <li>For $25 more the Sirius Sonic will actually last.</li>
            <li>and my hands first, then use an AHA wash afterwards with this brush, and you can see how much more make-up this product removes, that the actual cleanser missed</li>
            <li>Long story short, get it, I think you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
            <li>After the first couple of days of use, I noticed there were \\&quot;flakes\\&quot; in my brows-</li>
            <li>do I spend $150.00 for the real deal, or get the Olay spin-off!?</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter especially like it because it cleans skin well and exfoliates, cleans much better than just soap and water alone.</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li>I just used my pro-x for the first time</li>
            <li>Thoroughly cleaned my face, leaving it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System     </li>
            <li>I typed in oil control in amazon and this was the first one which grabbed my attention.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this, I instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li>and when I went back to buy another one they were all gone, went to 5 more stores and everyone was sold out</li>
            <li>It works pretty well -</li>
            <li>Actually this will work even better for travel</li>
            <li>is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a gadget like this</li>
            <li>so at first I thought it should feel stronger.  </li>
            <li>But then I bought the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and began using them together.</li>
            <li>I have been using it consistently for a week.</li>
            <li>you need to cleanse first and then use the exfolliant.</li>
            <li>But it delivers what the higher priced products do.</li>
            <li>Have only used it for a month or so, but am hoping it works on oily skin better than a sponge/washcloth.</li>
            <li>The first week or two, my skin was all over the place, but I stuck with it because another reviewer says that will fade away.</li>
            <li>, make sure you put it on low speed and not pressure on your skin.</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t exactly work for me....</li>
            <li>Overall though, I&#x27;m glad I got this instead of spending that $130 on a Clairisonic.</li>
            <li>My current favorite am</li>
            <li>so much so that you don&#x27;t want to stop!    </li>
            <li>(that might be the first time I ever said that word) to my face.</li>
            <li>Also the battery compartment was filled with clear goo?</li>
            <li>I personally think you fare better using the cleansing bath gloves on your face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that tube of cleanser worth that much of money.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research first on the clarisonic system</li>
            <li>I can see my pores were more deeply cleaned after just one to two uses.</li>
            <li>This product is so gentle and leaves my skin exfoliated and cleans my pores!</li>
            <li>I wanted my skin all pretty like the picture said.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s gentle!</li>
            <li>I think you can get better exfoliation using a basic washcloth.  </li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li>I was at Saphora looking at the more expensive version of this and thought to use the Amazon app to check the online price (which is great with the barcode scanner by the way) and Olay Pro-X came up as a related/suggested product and it was really affordable.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft and cleaner than ever before.</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li>Also, for those of you that are looking at the Clerisonic...you might want to try this one first before spending $200.</li>
            <li>I have even used it on two of my family member&#x27;s faces and we both saw/felt results from the first use.</li>

            <li>*fits hand perfect but yet small enough to travel with.    </li>
            <li>I get regular facial peels and it seems as though I benefit more from the peels now because of my better nightly regime including this device.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased four of these Olay Cleansing Systems and gifted three of them to my two daughters and 15-year-old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>The first lasted five years in the shower.</li>
            <li>but then found olay cleaner and toner at TJ Maxx and it works really well!</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>

            <li>;)</li>
            <li>At this point I know I love the facial scrubbers</li>
            <li>If there were a way to achieve the same results without batteries, that would be a better option.  </li>
            <li>, I was always aware of it being there.</li>
            <li>I use the brush with my proactive cream and it worked fast!</li>
            <li>My skin immediately felt smoother and free of dead cell debris and my moisturizer absorbed a lot faster and better upon application.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve tried this I can say that i would only try a clairsonic if it was gifted to me or somehow i got an 85% off deal.</li>
            <li>I love that it has 2 speeds and the waterproof qualities already gives it 2 advantages above the clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Not only did my skin look and feel better from</li>
            <li>All that being said, it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>My wife has used this product pretty consistently since we received it over a month ago.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, Olay came out with one $170 cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I like how this makes the makeup looks so much better the next day</li>
            <li>I like the multiple speeds and being able to take it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I was going to purchase the Clarisonic device first but read the reviews about the Olay product and decided to try it first because it was so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>(the switch was the first thing to go...)</li>
            <li>This is my first review...ever.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I wet my face and applied my own creamy (non-exfoliating) cleanser, then turned on the Olay device.</li>
            <li>So: it cleans well enough to wash away pore-gunk that I was failing at removing before, while seeming to create a much more welcoming environment for my anti-acne moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This brush cleansing tool softened the texture of my face after the first use.</li>
            <li>made my skin more red.</li>
            <li>Pores are smaller and makeup goes on better.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to exfoliate but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on a big one.</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily for more than 4 months without any issues/complaints.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>It looks pretty, but it won&#x27;t make YOU look any prettier.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a clarisonic to compare this to, but I really like this product!</li>
            <li>This is the first review I ever wrote for a product, for a reason!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>always have it on the higher setting, but I would suggest to use the first setting in the beginning just to test out the waters.</li>
            <li>THE BRUSH HAD A FUNNY SMELL, LIKE IT WAS SITTING AROUND SOMEWHERE WHICH WAS A TURN OFF.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really not to much else to say, just simply is worth investing in.</li>
            <li>Make sure you order the 2 count box of extra brushes.</li>
            <li>at first.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting to read in the various reviews how some people think it&#x27;s too wimpy while others think it&#x27;s too strong/scratchy.  </li>
            <li>The first one I at Walmart whilst on vacation</li>
            <li>I can compare it to the clarisonic which I used first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a week, but I can say my skin looks noticeably better.</li>
            <li>-- it literally has made my skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>When you use this system, you will wonder why you never used it in the first place.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s not to big!</li>
            <li>So for the price and freedom to decide, I picked the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing</li>
            <li>I have no feedback for that product because I have not noticed any outstanding feature of it after several uses.</li>
            <li>I have wanted a Clarisonic since they first came out.  </li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>I bought one for my sister and she really likes it as well!</li>
            <li>The first week I did get 3 pimples but they have gone away.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It works better when I use it with st Ives facial scrub</li>
            <li>It had been about 36 hours since I started using it twice a day, when I broke out for the first time in over a decade.  </li>
            <li>and I dip the brush under hot water as I am using it to continue foam.</li>
            <li>Let me be the first to say that as a Guy</li>
            <li>After getting a start, i was able to open it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money if you dont want to spend so much on the clarasonic.</li>
            <li>when I saw the tv commercials for this, I thought I&#x27;d try it first.  </li>
            <li>I think maybe the smaller grit of the scrub that comes with this brush is better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still interested in trying the clarisonic</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t buy anything now without first shopping Amazon first.  </li>
            <li>I like to use it with my favorite facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>In fact, I could see improvement within the first week.</li>
            <li>One month later after using almost 1-2 times a day (gently) with my own cleanser and taking a day off if getting too much drying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin brushing!you are using professional skin products, not that cheap stuff at the box stores.</li>
            <li>but, after reading reviews (and price tags) I decided to give the Olay one a try first.  </li>
            <li>I saw an ad for a really pretty Clarisonic Mia2 and thought well maybe I need a pretty one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was only $20.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for those that want to feel what a completely makeup free face feels like.</li>
            <li>so I could pack more souvenirs in, but looking back</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m hoping that this one will last more than a year.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed a difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>For the price it really  doesn&#x27;t seem  worth it.  </li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My skin tingles after I use it, and it is SO gentle, but it does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li>More than ten years ago I purchased one that Susan Lucci (All My Children) was promoting on TV.  </li>
            <li>After first use..makes a difference of your skin..</li>
            <li>The Olay is smaller and more compact, which makes it easier for travel.</li>
            <li>I like the product, but I don&#x27;t believe it competes with the higher brand ones.</li>
            <li>test it on your hand or something first...</li>
            <li>glowing.i only wish it had more cleaning product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item locally (not from Amazon) and enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>Almost better than after a facial.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable too!</li>
            <li>love it and have recommended it to several people.</li>
            <li>I was loathe to spend a lot on something without trying it out first.</li>
            <li>item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Really like this cleansing system!</li>
            <li>The soft rubberized exterior feels durable and is comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first day i got this and used it, my face had a reduce size in bumps.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, light, but I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s actually doing anything or noticed that it took off my make up that well on its own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews about many different facial brushes, I decided to buy this from Target.</li>
            <li>I was pretty stoked about that.</li>
            <li>I have to say first off that I&#x27;ve never tried the Clairsonic, however.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m assuming that it is cleaning out my pores pretty well.</li>
            <li>So I will be getting some moisturizer for my face, for the first time.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the coupon Amazon!</li>
            <li>First let me say that I am a DEVOTED Pro-X user.</li>
            <li>This Olay Pro-X works just as well if not better than the Clarisonic products, and at such a better price point!!!!  </li>
            <li>I feel like it does the same magic for 1/8th of the price.</li>
            <li>It delivers way more strokes than washing with your hands possibly can.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know what to expect and first time I used it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended item for all women!!</li>
            <li>and I feel it does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to perform miracles the first night.</li>
            <li>I use Proactiv Plus and it works pretty well</li>
            <li>I wish it had a stand to put in the shower or at the sink but other than that, love it!  </li>
            <li>made my face smoother from the first time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to get this one.</li>
            <li>Also, I stopped using the provided scrub because I personally think a heavier duty scrub works better.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week, but when I first received it I used it every day.  </li>
            <li>I had the same problem as many reviews...</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you see.</li>
            <li>Most people think I&#x27;m 10 years younger than I am.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should have washed my face first and then used this after for skin refining?  </li>
            <li>Without feeling like it took off my first layer of skin.</li>
            <li>Works well, just didn&#x27;t use it too much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and is still working!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love this item very much, i only use at night,  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>Never thought something so simple and cheap would work so well on my face!</li>
            <li>not that it was that much but well worth what I paid</li>
            <li>Was thinking about the Clarisonic, but a friend who has used both suggested I try this first.</li>
            <li>Sure it doesn&#x27;t time the scrubbing for you and might not get quite as deep, but for the price</li>
            <li>It does not have the same power nor does it feel any better after than washing with your hands.</li>
            <li>I love it , it removes all the dirt and left over make up on my face  </li>
            <li>My only suggestion is make more than 2 variable speed types.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give 5 stars is b/c I would like a bit more power in the spin brush-</li>
            <li>Would recommend for first time users.  </li>
            <li>Just goes to show that the more expensive product isn&#x27;t necessarily the best.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who is interested in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>The cleansing agent really gets in to the pores and cleans well!</li>
            <li>I actually think the Pro works better.</li>
            <li>I planned to buy a cleansing foam at first.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I have already ordered a second one, plus replacement brush heads, to make sure I can continue using this proven version for years to come.</li>
            <li>wash hands, Turn water on HOT.</li>
            <li>So I recommend anything fragrance free and natural.</li>
            <li>Clarisonic is definitely sturdier and much more</li>
            <li>This is such an inexpensive, fantastic beauty find!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase the Clarisonic for $150 b/c this product does exactly what you need it to do.</li>
            <li>I change the brush every 3-4 months and the replacement brush heads are not expensive.</li>
            <li>At first I felt like I was buffing my car, except I&#x27;m exfoliating, and its my face not my car.</li>
            <li>loveee that the bristles &amp; the motion of the cleaner is so gentle!</li>
            <li>Comparable to higher priced items, but without the expense.</li>
            <li>it really did kept my skin from breaking out!</li>
            <li>First of all I wish this was softer and this pulls on your face in circles.</li>
            <li>Exactly 1 year after purchase the power button won&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the higher prices systems that people talk about</li>
            <li>My skin immediately felt smoother and free of dead cell debris and my moisturizer absorbed a lot faster and better upon application.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Actually think this brush is better to use on my body than my face because its pretty abrasive compared to my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Love the ease and feel of this simple machine.  </li>
            <li>So at first when I bought this I was skectipcal.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on so smoothly and my face has completely cleared up</li>
            <li>I love this facial  cleanser system..</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to a friend or a stranger ;-)</li>
            <li>You can literally feel the difference after the first try.</li>
            <li>In fact, I could see improvement within the first week.</li>
            <li>On the first use I found my skin to be 10x softer and smoother than before.</li>
            <li>My facial cleaning routine has been lax for many years.</li>
            <li>Works better than just a standard brush.  </li>
            <li>Prior to use I also started developing the type of deep-seeded blackhead that looks like dirt (versus the more whitehead type), but that seems to have come to a halt since I&#x27;ve been using the Pro-X.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>THEN I get this out and used the scrub it came with, and I can&#x27;t believe how much makeup was on the brush!</li>
            <li>First, I thought the batteries ran out, so I changed them.</li>
            <li>Although I had wanted the Pro-X for sometime I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the drug store price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>It also arrived very swiftly!</li>
            <li>Better than my facial wipes or my washcloth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally bought this.  </li>
            <li>and I am still using Cetaphil (which is not expensive).  </li>
            <li>Olay is one of my favorite facial products.  </li>
            <li>I saw the same package at Costco for $10 more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been able to achieve the same results with this though.  </li>
            <li>When I was going between the $150 Clarisonic and this I decided to try this first</li>
            <li>and I think about first world problems.</li>
            <li>This review is for the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>I did break out at first</li>
            <li>It is the first one I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>It really does wonders for my face!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna buy more for my sisters and friends as gifts when I see them next year in summer!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The brush also does not have a splatter guard as the Clairsonic does - this means that the higher speed splatters water a bit.</li>
            <li>On the first night, I opened the thing up, put the batteries in and turned it on.</li>
            <li>Overall, the pro-x is just ok, but if you can splurge on the clarisonic</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the way this product works, i have seen a drastic change in my complection after using it for only a month.</li>
            <li>Then it will probably turn into my first choice face brush.</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased after my NutraSonic died served me well.</li>
            <li>First being the Boscia Konjac Cleansing Sponge with Bamboo Charcoal.</li>
            <li>So now I have my NutraSonic back, and I have this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System!</li>
            <li>So now I have my NutraSonic back, and I have this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, especially for the $13 I paid for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend removing eye makeup first before using it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I hadn&#x27;t removed my mascara</li>
            <li>So this works pretty well</li>
            <li>At first I thought it&#x27;s the cleanser</li>
            <li>and this was the first time a product irritated and broke out my skin</li>
            <li>The bristles were smooth and did not hurt my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I figured that I would try this one first</li>
            <li>I emailed the seller and got a refund minutes later which I was glad to get.</li>
            <li>I really like it and feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I tried it in the first place</li>
            <li>That was my first choice</li>
            <li>Not as thrilling</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed I began breaking out more, with deep, beneath-the-skin lumps.</li>
            <li>I figured this was the initial purging stage, and eventually things would get better, but it got to the point that I had to stop using it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this first because I didn&#x27;t want to pay the price for Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>and I would higher recommend it</li>
            <li>This works very well for the price!</li>
            <li>She has look in many different retail outlets and none compares to this price.</li>
            <li>Why spend up to $200 on a facial cleansing brush, when this was under $20, and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>she loves it - and it will probably save her some money on facials as this exfoliates really well!</li>
            <li>and this really seems to keep my face fresh.</li>
            <li>I know if I could CONSISTENTLY keep up any routine, I would achieve the results I want without needing all the bells and whistles to do so.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>the product is pretty much as advertised!  </li>
            <li>Possibly, it&#x27;s lightening the appearance of my rosacea - can&#x27;t tell for sure yet.  </li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>I have gone to the dermatologist and have tried so many topical creams and oral medications.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li>is soft and smooth</li>
            <li>When the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System arrived, I opened the box to examine it thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Just at first glance, I had formed an opinion without using it.  </li>
            <li>I reccommend this facial scrubber over the vibrating ones as it seems it does a better scrubbing job.</li>
            <li>The only wish is to have more gel sent with the device.</li>
            <li>The only comment I would make on this product is that the brush for it I wish it had either more bristles or stronger ones.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and have been using it for about 2 weeks now.  </li>
            <li>My flaking has cleared up so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different creams, prescription medications and pore strips.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what is described.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face both soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend!! :)</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I had it on the higher spin setting and used it for about one minute.</li>
            <li>It was smoother and softer after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of the Olay cleanser, I decided to see how things went using my current favorite cleanser, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Now that these things are being advertised as the #1 way to keep your skin looking younger, I&#x27;m glad i bought one.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliation usually causes one of 2 things for me more oil or more pimples.</li>
            <li>I ultimately decided to give the Olay Pro-X a test run, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>im sure you would get the same results.</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>Bought first one from Amazon &amp; it lasted about 8 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I found that most of the reviewers who had both actually preferred the Clarisonic, but they also said that for the money, this worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the most essential part for me that is \\&quot;blackheads\\&quot; .</li>
            <li>comfortable  not harsh.</li>
            <li>My face is soooo smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause overdrying, irritation, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s tearing at your skin but leaves it smooth, soft, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I use it religiously now.</li>
            <li>I use the cleansing system first time this morning</li>
            <li>Love it &amp; will definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li>This thing really cleans your face well!</li>
            <li>It has worked well for me since the first use.  </li>
            <li>Lov this thing so much!</li>
            <li>I use a goat&#x27;s milk soap now, and I actually like the way that makes my skin feel better.</li>
            <li>I had been interested in buying a face cleanser for quite some time.</li>
            <li>The first one lost the seal around the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li>My face was noticeable brighter, smooth and soft after one use.  </li>
            <li>My wife told me she does like Olay for her face and love Olay for a christmas present from me and told me to buy olay for Christmas this year.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a product like this, but wasn&#x27;t willing to spend</li>
            <li>It could be possible that the two products work better when used together.</li>
            <li>Actually, you could do more with hand washing with a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>Love it, I was unable to buy the $100 version of this product, so I heard about this one and opted out for it, so glad I made that decision, I Love it.</li>
            <li>Although still get occasional acne and clogged pores I have noticed a difference and love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Overall I have been quite pleased by&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how it cleans deep to get the make-up and dirt out of my pores!</li>
            <li>My ski thanks me for buying this product!</li>
            <li>and I wanted this so much!</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t use the face wash that comes in the box, and I only use it twice a week at most.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get the clarisonic at first but after reading the reviews I decided to try this first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m debating on whether or not it would be worth it to return the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t be able to take it into the shower, but it took me a while to figure out how to open it up.  </li>
            <li>I have had 2 of these in so many years and both did the same thing.</li>
            <li>It definitely cleans so much better than just a wash clothe alone</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>First, let me say I have the hide of a rhino</li>
            <li>This cleansing system is the first I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>The first week I started to use it</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Get yourself some Eneloop Rechargeable batteries and you&#x27;ll be ready to go!</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve had this for awhile, I&#x27;ve learned the exact formula for my skin.</li>
            <li>At first I was using it every night along with a 10% benzoyl peroxide cream, spot treatment, and then moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in Amazon after seeing some youtube videos on the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massager as such is not so refreshing as I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles in the brush got out of shape in just 2 massages.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>For this price, this product really does the trick!</li>
            <li>I never realized that this would help my face so much!</li>
            <li>I tried many different kinds of batteries and still not working.</li>
            <li>I am aware that a lot of people compare this to the MIA2, I&#x27;ve never used or owned a Mia2</li>
            <li>At first, I couldn&#x27;t notice a difference, but now, when I don&#x27;t use it, I can tell.  </li>
            <li>The trick is consistent use.</li>
            <li>Feels like it&#x27;s getting my face cleaned pretty well</li>
            <li>I should not have been using the Pro-X in the shower in the first place, but thats where I prefer to use it.</li>
            <li>Got this item today and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>So glad I ordered it and plan to use it daily.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and soft after using this.</li>
            <li>My skin is sooo much smoother and brighter after using this!  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to try it first.</li>
            <li>When I first got it</li>
            <li>this product is exactly as what it describes.</li>
            <li>I use an exfoliating scrub on the lower speed, and when I use the higher speed, I use a cream cleanser.</li>
            <li>really affordable!</li>
            <li>Why would you pay more for another brush that does the same thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries.</li>
            <li>their performance &amp; facial lines are more pronounced.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a MUST for removing all my make-up at the end of the day and cleansing oily skin first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The first benefit: if you are one of those people who tend to fall asleep without washing your face...this will put a stop to that.  </li>
            <li>Works very well!  </li>
            <li>I use this about 3 times a week &amp; it really cleanses my face!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s others priced much higher.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>*).</li>
            <li>Be sure, however, to buy replacement brushes as well, if you plan to use this with a scrub-like facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>My pores are visibly cleaner and I have only used this twice and most of my blackheads are already gone.</li>
            <li>and I used it for the first time ..</li>
            <li>On the first run out I used my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and I think the face wash should come in a bigger size and should be more of a scrub.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>and the Pro-X cleansing system has made a remarkable difference in tone and color, also I am starting to see a change in my facial wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>My skin was brighter the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Overall my face feels and looks better.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>SEEN MUCH DIFFERENCE, YET!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It sounds like more work than it actually is.</li>
            <li>I feel I am taking much better care of my aging skin now that I use it regularly.</li>
            <li>Within the first use, you can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li>I have never been interested in taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li>However, I reckon if I did use it twice daily, I might get better results.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I tried Olay Prox yesterday for the first time.</li>
            <li>You can tell the difference in your skin after the first use whatever age.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered two more as gifts from a different website and got a unbeatable deal for the Olay Professionals Holiday set.</li>
            <li>The first time I ever bought a product of this nature.</li>
            <li>but after I got it in the mail and tried it out the first day...</li>
            <li>I just recently bought this product and already love it.</li>
            <li>At first it did nothing</li>
            <li>No issue with seller or shipping ;-)</li>
            <li>I thought, at first, that I needed to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li>So it works well enough on the face, but it could definitely be better.</li>
            <li>The brush makes my skin feel so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going pretty well.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE HOW THE EXTRA SOAP SAYS IN MY SKIN</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>My skin has just been so much better since starting to use this and the olay cleanser with it.</li>
            <li>I say “probably” and “might” here because it is possible that Olay uses substantially better parts in its devices; but I doubt that.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen my skin look this healthy in years after using this brush for only a week.</li>
            <li>thanks...will be willing to write a better review if you can send me a softer one because that is the only problem...!</li>
            <li>This is the exact product i saw advertised in a magazine</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had acne and flaking skin, so I was willing to try this Olay brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, don&#x27;t assume the magic is in the 50ml tube of the facial cleanser that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have given a higher rating if my product wasn&#x27;t defective.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I got it and especially at this price point.</li>
            <li>Love this thing, and my skin is definitely a lot softer since using it.</li>
            <li>Cleanses my face gently!</li>
            <li>my friends and family tell me I look 5-years younger since using ProX :)  </li>
            <li>and it was the exact</li>
            <li>It really polishes my skin and makes me glow!</li>
            <li>The Pro-X cleans pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have tried many facial cleansers and moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>This cleans really well!</li>
            <li>no CON&#x27;S here, just PRO&#x27;S ;)</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t beat the price ;)</li>
            <li>I works better for me than simply using face wash.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>She proclaimed that her face felt was extra smooth feeling after using it!</li>
            <li>Performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The first week I used it, my face broke out.</li>
            <li>(pretty sure it&#x27;s the same reason) ..</li>
            <li>: for all those people giving this a low rating just because they like their clarisonic more, PLEASE, don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>I use it first then enter the shower.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on my upper arms to help exfoliate more in the shower.</li>
            <li>And it has totally changed his skin for the better.</li>
            <li>so I decided to start with a lower priced item first.  </li>
            <li>if it helps my skin since I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month, but my skin FEELS better to the touch.</li>
            <li>It makes my face clear and smooth, it even helps wake me up in the morning.</li>
            <li>My very temperamental skin now looks rejuvenated and fresh.</li>
            <li>My first day using it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, for the price especially compared to the Clarasonic, I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and during the winter months I didnt use it everyday .</li>
            <li>I purchased this items a few weeks ago because the reviews were good</li>
            <li>I purchased this items a few months ago because the comments were good</li>
            <li>I got this a week ago and have been using it everyday, and it seems like a really good concept, but I&#x27;m still on the fence about it.</li>
            <li>This is a good brush I use it in the shower everyday while it&#x27;s not water proof</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using everyday, and it is really good.</li>
            <li>and the good think this thing its not available in TURKEY</li>
            <li>I was prepared to buy it again if mine was dead for good.</li>
            <li>dead isn&#x27;t good quality.</li>
            <li>She use it everyday and is seeing good results ever time</li>
            <li>-- my face feels very soft and clean after I use.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>It really gets down in the pores and cleans good.</li>
            <li>Recommending for daily use to have a deep clean and healthy skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ability to sloth of dead shin cells helps any face cream you may use to be absorbed by the skin much better while help generating the new skin cells to grow making you skin look more youthful and glow.</li>
            <li>The other cleaning tools clean in a more vibrating, sonic way.</li>
            <li>My grandkids love to use it to clean other parts of the body during play</li>
            <li>but somehow my skin feels way more clean and polished than it did the other.</li>
            <li>I started out originally using it just once a day at night to clean off the makeup and daily grind.  </li>
            <li>gives me a clean feeling that is better than I can get with other methods.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t break out excessively before, but I can say that I very rarely have any kind of blemish now.</li>
            <li>, it leaves my skin super super clean as if I just had a facial, I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush, love the two speeds, the slow is good for the nose and the fast works for the forehead.  </li>
            <li>My face has never felt so clean and soft!  </li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and soft that even my husband notices the difference!</li>
            <li>Look good for less!</li>
            <li>The Olay brush works great so far but is not on the level of the higher priced Sonic brushes and has less power.</li>
            <li>, whats the point of shedding the old skin off and cleaning the pores if your not going to take care of the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works better than the neutrogena sonic wave cleaners</li>
            <li>The Olay brush I feel isn&#x27;t strong enough to adequately exfoliate my skin, it really felt just like a very VERY gentle rotating scrubbing which didn&#x27;t make a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have not used it for a very long time but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleansing brush, it cleanses very thoroughly and leaves skin very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft and gentle, easy to detach and wash, and scrubber has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>But the way I figure it - in spending  $20 vs. $200, if the $20 item is half as good as the $200 one, for a 1/10th of the price - I&#x27;m that much ahead.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 39 &amp; have been lucky to have nice skin, except for a few blackheads around nose &amp; some stress acne.</li>
            <li>, I have noticed my skin seems brighter, more evenly toned, amazingly smooth, and less oily.</li>
            <li>I guess I will sometime, but I&#x27;m kind of partial to my own soap, homemade with my choice of oils and other ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve issued other top rated brushes and this one by far my favorite for the price.</li>
            <li>Even more excited when I tried it out, and it left my face beautifully soft.</li>
            <li>It keeps me honest in the fact that I believe that this brush allows me to get my money&#x27;s worth out of the other products that I use, by really getting to and exposing the skin&#x27;s surface.  </li>
            <li>This Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System is very compact and the brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>The scrubber is very soft and the soap sample that comes with it is nice enough.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and any kind of facial exfoliant</li>
            <li>I really love this little tool and would highly recommend over the more costly brand names.</li>
            <li>I love this little machine, and these refills are just fine.</li>
            <li>/use it in the shower, and is ready to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really tell you to run out and get one right now.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re not talking about anything revolutionary here!ike it and will continue using it, but I can&#x27;t really tell you to run out and get one right now.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on your skin and you will feel the difference right away.  </li>
            <li>I found that I had to gently move the Pro-X in a counterclockwise motion or it would walk right off my face.</li>
            <li>Right from the start, I felt my skin getting much softer.  </li>
            <li>The system doesn&#x27;t rotate as fast as I expected and the brush is quite soft, but it really does clean wonderfully and even after a long day you can still feel a clean, soft skin.</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure at first, but when I used it for the first time it really scrubbed my face and felt good.</li>
            <li>I bought the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System because I wanted to try out one of these types of products, didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune (in case it didn&#x27;t help), and the reviews on this site and others have been really positive.</li>
            <li>great product for a lot less than the other brands, maybe lacks the power others have, but I don&#x27;t have a face made of marble to clean!</li>
            <li>I really like the way it cleanses your skin, leaving it soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>i did not see any dramatic change in my skin, but my face felt much cleaner and it was fast which was wonderful.</li>
            <li>Overall it does a decent job at cleansing and my skin felt smoother and fresher and absorbed skin care products better.</li>
            <li>My skin is getting more clear and clean, especially the \\&quot;T\\&quot; area.</li>
            <li>It is really easy to use - the detachable brush can be washed and fixed back easily.  </li>
            <li>Its worth the  money I use it everyday love it!</li>
            <li>This completely cleanses it deeply, and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy too use (thanks to earlier reviews on how to put the batteries in as i would have thought I was breaking it!!)</li>
            <li>Due to the more even texture of my skin, I got nice smooth coverage with less make up.</li>
            <li>The tube of exfoliating cleanser that&#x27;s included is pretty pitiful in size, but I&#x27;m finding that I like using the Pro X with my normal face wash better anyway, so I&#x27;m glad I went with this one for half the price instead of the one that you can get with the large bottle of cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Also, they could very easily and cheaply come out with accessories such as a simple stand and a brush cap to protect the bristles for travel/storage.</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle even on the higher speed (just be careful around your eyelids!), very compact, and does a near-perfect job of cleansing and polishing your skin (really should be used twice daily for the absolute best results).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found its really important to moisturize right after using the system or my skin tends to dry out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel really smooth and clean after I use it in the evening - I alternate a gentle cleanser with an exfoliating cleanser every other day, and my skin has never felt this nice.</li>
            <li>I would easily purchase this again if ever needed before purchasing those HIGH PRICED similar items that don&#x27;t clean your skin and cleaner than this on does.</li>
            <li>I had a similar one several years ago...but am more satisfied with item...works very well..</li>
            <li>Based on what I have seen, I am sure it will work great on facial skin where more care is needed but it does not provide a deep enough scrub for other parts of the body.</li>
            <li>This cleansing system exfoliates your skin in the most gentle way possible and gives you a super supple, clear and glowing face, it feels so fresh after usage.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is my first cleansing system and I have to say I feel the clean.  </li>
            <li>The first night I used it, my skin felt so soft and clean,  cleaner than it had ever felt.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean and soft, has cleared up my blackheads pretty well on my nose and in the corners of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The pores on my nose are very clean now-an extraction at a facial resulted in -</li>
            <li>Needless to say this brush is gonna be gifted to a ton of my friends and family this xmas!!!</li>
            <li>Though the overall process is much more comfortable and enjoyable and the massage factor seems to bring color to my face which is always a plus when you&#x27;re as pale as</li>
            <li>My pores have become so small, my face feels clean, my black heads are literally almost gone and my skin is even and so bright!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this little Machine it makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product but was hoping the brush would be a little harder .  </li>
            <li>Since it is much cheaper than other similar products, it is really a good deal!</li>
            <li>Long story short, I like my skin more and more everytime</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came as advertised with all necessary tools for the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;&amp; I loved it instantly.</li>
            <li>I use it once a day, every other day with my own face soap.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say its perfect.</li>
            <li>I had extremely flaky skin, no matter what kind of soap i used, nothing helped.</li>
            <li>I have fairly good skin (no acne, for example), but the Pro-X has made my complexion much brighter and my pores have gotten a little bit</li>
            <li>Just hold the device with your non-dominant hand at the top of the device (the top part near where the brush head is attached,) and put your dominant hand on the bottom part where you see the separation is, and just pull down.</li>
            <li>I love that this cleaning brush is softer and not stiff, as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I only use this a couple of times a week, but I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in how smooth my skin is, particularly on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Works good if you feel you need get an extra clean for your face using either your own exfoliate wash or the one provided in the package, just be careful you might get a little extra drying on your face, so just make sure you have lotion for your face.</li>
            <li>It makes blemishes heal and disappear quickly, and does prevent new ones from coming.</li>
            <li>This definitely beats a washcloth and it clears you up right quick!</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle on your face; it feels like feathers on your skin, especially gentle on the sensitive skin around your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Its not too rough and easy to clean....</li>
            <li>Kept my skin clear and clean while I was deployed to the sandbox.</li>
            <li>Previously, I wouldn&#x27;t even thoroughly clean my face every day(gross, I know), so I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a factor when considering the efficacy of the Olay cleansing system.</li>
            <li>It worked great; I am currently in Afghanistan with the military and used this every day.</li>
            <li>bought for my 12years old daughter and she loves it, she uses it everyday and it works and is great quality</li>
            <li>if your looking for something to clean your face with this is not it you can find a better cleaning system for less on amazon</li>
            <li>my skn is clean and clear.</li>
            <li>My face is clean and clear.</li>
            <li>Angling the device allows the bristles to clean more and damage less on the skin, or drying out sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it with a cream cleanser like clean and clear or neutrogena.</li>
            <li>It really makes my face soft and enjoy washing my face every night.</li>
            <li>I then used the pro-x machine with my own cleanser, which produced better results, but not great.</li>
            <li>For the cheap price this product really does the work of something nearly 10 times the cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how this simple gadget helped clear up my face.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try it with my clean and clear and</li>
            <li>I have used tons of exfoliates before and have owned the neutrogena brush and clean and clear ones</li>
            <li>It really helps clear up black head and feels your skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>It gets my face so clean and so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin was super soft and the next day my acne was noticeably better.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean after each use.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how clean it gets my face.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so clean and soft</li>

            <li>I feel so clean and soft after washing my face with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a beauty expert but this does not seem to clean my face as well as a soft washcloth.  </li>
            <li>My face it soft and clean as ever.</li>
            <li>My face feels and looks so soft and clean when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>She now uses it and is also pleased with how soft her 54 year old skin feels.  </li>
            <li>Quiet motor and a nice soft brush.</li>
            <li>It really cleans my skin and makes it look better overall.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t try the sonic one, but the performance of this is good enough for your daily cleaning.</li>
            <li>For the price and what it does, I think it&#x27;s a good product, but I haven&#x27;t compared it to the more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to another reviewer (whose directions I printed out), I would have never been able to open battery compartment.  </li>
            <li>It definitely gets all my makeup off and has my skin feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>The person I gave this as a gift to absolutely loved it and told me how much smoother her skin was after using it a few times.</li>
            <li>Too much abrasion irritates the skin and actually incites more blemishes.</li>
            <li>it is a tiny tube only good for about 2 weeks use depending on how often you use it.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m still loving this facial brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does any more exfoliating than a regular washcloth, or a face scrub (without the brush) really.</li>
            <li>The ingredients and preservatives in the cheap products can irritate skin more or get trapped in your pores.</li>
            <li>The ingredients and preservatives in the cheap products can irritate skin more or get trapped in your pores.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that the Olay brush was really doing a lot, until I put it away for several weeks.  </li>
            <li>Really takes off makeup better than regular washing.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt and looked so good after only one use that I didn&#x27;t even wear makeup the next day!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 months straight without skipping a day (ok, maybe once or twice, but it&#x27;s now become part of my daily shower routine).</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t completely knock it because maybe some people just have better results, but it doesn&#x27;t nearly compare to the Clarisonic whatsoever in my opinion if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>Feel like it really gets deep into your pores and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love the Pro-X cleansing system because it really gets into my pores, I only use the cream that comes with it a couple times.</li>
            <li>is pretty fair still, not sure.</li>
            <li>I tried the expensive one from a friend and loved it better</li>
            <li>and I like it so much that I went back and bought some more.</li>
            <li>It was smaller, lighter and more gentle than the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I had expected the motor to be more powerful - it isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>, my opinion of this product is that it is a good alternative to the more expensive Clarisonic brand.  </li>
            <li>After almost 4 months of use I can honestly say my blackheads that reoccur in the same parts of my face since I was oh around 15 yrs old, (I&#x27;m 36 now), are diminished.  </li>
            <li>Really good alternative to more expensive products.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it really gets deep into my pores and make my skin glow.</li>
            <li>It takes all of my makeup off, it exfoliates my skin gently, and cleanses deeply enough that my skin has a lovely glow and no blemishes.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and firm after and I am enjoying the product.  </li>
            <li>It really cleans your face better than just using a facial scrub.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It came in a set, with a small trial size bottle of the cleaner as well which was nice, because the full bottle is a bit pricey</li>
            <li>I would recommend using the faster speed only a couple days a week and use the lower speed mostly because I imagine it could really irritate your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really DIDN&#x27;T have to pay $100 or more for this type of facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>She still occasionally tells me how much she has enjoyed having it.</li>
            <li>Its fast enough for most peoples faces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works really well , gives a deep cleaning I love the way my face feels when I use it</li>
            <li>She told me, that the reason she wanted one was because she tried one of the more expensive ones from a department store that a friend of hers had purchased, and she loved how her face felt after using it.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d use one of these facial cleaning systems and didn&#x27;t really think I needed one, but I&#x27;m really glad I took a chance on this one.  </li>
            <li>After growing up with seemingly spontaneous acne and oily skin, I finally decided to invest in my face health as an adult.</li>
            <li>this so far is really nice and way cheaper than at the local store.</li>
            <li>I bought it because the reviews were as good as the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li>I had to have my husband do that because it requires a certain force (probably just for the first time).  </li>
            <li>The head doesn&#x27;t spin exactly centered so as you move the brush around your face, you have to do it in a certain direction.</li>
            <li>Great price, almost 15.00 less than major chain store.</li>
            <li>After looking at what purpose it serves and all the positive reviews that came along with it, I figured it may be a good exfoliator to try with my regular daily wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; 1.remove makeup with makeup removing cleanser dry face 2. add exfoliant to the brush dampen brush with warm water run along face on high setting 3.</li>
            <li>At first glance this scrubber doesn&#x27;t seem to spin so fast or seem so powerful, but it turns out it&#x27;s fast enough and a fairly strong, reliable motor.  </li>
            <li>This is very gentle on your face and cleans it very well.</li>
            <li>It works really well and very gently.  </li>
            <li>Less is More!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a deeper clean!</li>
            <li>So I definitely recommend this every night for a truly clean face!</li>
            <li>like deep clean!  </li>
            <li>I have tried a large range of facial cleansing brushes (low end to high end) and the Olay Pro-X is definitely the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>so it makes me enjoy the whole process a little better.</li>
            <li>wish it would spin a little more aggressively but most people would like it esp if they have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also don’t feel like I am getting a deep down clean as I thought I would, but it does give a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I was taken in by all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try...</li>
            <li>I read some of the positive reviews for this product</li>
            <li>I feel like I was snowed by all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I ended up finding the Olay Pro-X Cleansing system and all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, on the positive.</li>
            <li>and I hope to do a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I saw immediate positive results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive that this helps get circulation going in the face as you will see the flush you get after it&#x27;s use, also known as the glow.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After seeing all the positive reviews here on Amazon, I thought I would try the Olay.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews about the Olay and got a positive recommendation from my daughter-in-law</li>
            <li>and  I just don&#x27;t see any positive difference</li>
            <li>I am in my mid-twenties though, and I didn&#x27;t notice any positive change.</li>
            <li>but I look at this positively;</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t see much of an improvement in my skin more than my typical use of an exfoliating wash alone, and while I don&#x27;t yet have anything to which I can compare it, it seems to be low quality.  </li>
            <li>I did have my face break out a little bit more, but it felt so clean.</li>
            <li>Your fingers and hands are not going to be able to clean inside little indentations inside your skin, which is wear oil, dirt, and makeup</li>
            <li>I wish it could have been a little more abrasive to clean my skin and clean it a little bit better.</li>
            <li>While I am unfamiliar with the exact features of the other more expensive brands, this is perfect for what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>My acne scars are becoming lighter and smaller.</li>
            <li>At 56, zits and clogged pores that just dodn&#x27;t want to go away are pretty much on the mend.  </li>
            <li>The first use proved how much residue is removed with the cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than other clear-a-sonic type products and just as effective</li>
            <li>It would be nice if Olay included at least one refill brush in the original package.</li>
            <li>My skin is much cleaner and the pores are finer even after the first couple of times.</li>
            <li>This was a pretty reasonable purchase for those that do not want to pay for the prestige version of this product.  </li>
            <li>I am finding it pretty gentle, not too abrasive for my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have problematic skin, but I am interested in taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m combining this with other Olay ProX and Regenerist products, and I&#x27;m really happy with the entire package.</li>
            <li>.........the end piece is very slippery and at first this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Really leaves your skin very refreshed!</li>
            <li>My only real complaints about this are finding replacement heads at a reasonable cost and that they don&#x27;t give you more of the face wash.</li>
            <li>My breakouts are pretty much non existent now and my skin tone has evened out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and my face felt so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t ready to sink the cash into that without trying a face brush first.</li>
            <li>I love this product and look forward to long use.</li>
            <li>I had a beard and was having a hard time getting things nice and clean through the hair.</li>
            <li>I have also used it using other facial cleansers with great results too.  </li>
            <li>I used it 3-4 times a day for the first week, just because it was very calming and relaxing.</li>
            <li>, this is the first review I&#x27;ve been absolutely compelled to write.  </li>
            <li>I use it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li>What I like most is that it&#x27;s really useful in opening up your pores, cleaning deep, and ultimately providing the best prep for any facial product that your may want to reach deep into your pores such as acne medication, moisturizer, or wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time and I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was worried first that it would be too much but not at all.</li>
            <li>Really cleans, on my first use -</li>
            <li>Great product especially for its value compared to other costly products in the market.</li>
            <li>great for price, I can not believe some of the other ones they are selling for double or triple the price with no refills with it!  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just the first time that can be a real pain.  </li>
            <li>My goal is to maintain a healthy glow as long as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I had a couple of breakouts but it depends on how much pressure I put on it.</li>
            <li>Really made a difference in my skin the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much waterproof so I can bring it into the shower with me during my morning routine.</li>
            <li>bought this a bit ago and I pretty much use all Olay products on my face.</li>
            <li>in fact my face didn&#x27;t feel like it was my face, my face has improved so much since I first started using it...</li>
            <li>I was very hesitate to buy this product at first.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I have ever bought and really like it.</li>
            <li>The way Olay describes the product you&#x27;d think a lab full of rocket scientists developed</li>
            <li>I have good clear skin, but at 62 I have had endless problems with flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty small and did not last long nor does it smell good or taste good if you get it in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I usually had good skin</li>
            <li>Throughout the past year I have LOVED this brush.</li>
            <li>Well, I am not sure what it is suppose to do, so I can&#x27;t give it anything but good.</li>
            <li>The tube sample you get in the box is extremely small, so it&#x27;s good that you can use it with any product you want.  </li>
            <li>the way, the tube of exfoliating stuff they give you is tiny, it looks bigger on the picture on the box than it really is, so don&#x27;t be fooled like I was expecting a good sized tube.</li>
            <li>I am really not sure how a good a job this does</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned both and this one is just as good, but at a small fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>Can b use to remove makeup, good for lazy ppl like me</li>
            <li>The jell inside is too small but the machine is good.</li>
            <li>Not sure if they have improved the product, or if it was just good luck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been keeping my eye on these types of products for the past year, waiting for a good chance (or rather, price) to try out one.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend the book for anyone who wants a little more info on easy, inventive natural beauty alternatives that will work wonders!</li>
            <li>this product can start winging some high velocity rogue droplets right into your eyeball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You face really felts soft and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>The Pro-X makes my skin super smooth and not only that, but I feel it deeply cleanses my skin, which is great, because dead skin is another contributor to pimples.</li>
            <li>I used the brush for a few weeks and did not feel like it gave me a better clean than using my hands.  </li>
            <li>so I grabbed an exfoliater from Clean and Clear that has worked really well with this!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this daily at night and it makes my face feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother with a bit less number of blackheads - but not so much less that I am impressed.</li>
            <li>Olay&#x27;s brush is an amazing deal and allows me to get my face clean without the negative vibrating annoyance.</li>
            <li>it is soft and clean my face gentle.</li>
            <li>it felt so fresh &amp; clean got all my daily makeup off.</li>
            <li>It really gets the skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer, more vibrant and the only change has been to add this to my regimen.</li>
            <li>Super happy with this purchase, it has two speeds, the brush rotates fast and cleans well but still gentle enough with the skin, I think this is something you can use everyday as part of your cleansing routine</li>
            <li>Be sure to also check for buildup of soap in the brush if you want the brush to last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the more expensive brands, but for the cheap price this is very worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of cringing at the idea of gradually tearing my face up with the abrasive cleanser and the brush.. not a pretty picture!</li>
            <li>The brush didn&#x27;t seem to lock in place very securely but it didn&#x27;t wobble or come loose with use.  </li>
            <li>Putting the brush onto the unit did not give a confident click or lock, so I repeated the action several times just to make sure it was actually in right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>low and medium-low  its gently and soft, batteries have been good so far</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to how well it will take care of my adult onset acne, but I don&#x27;t see that it will do any harm since it does such a great job of deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>It feels great, isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (and I have used it with several different cleansers so it doesn&#x27;t just work with the one it comes with), and my breakouts have reduced for sure.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing Brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Neither is the amount of scrubbing too much for my very sensitive skin and in fact, it really does not scrub so much as just gently clean.  </li>
            <li>Quite light and small, quite soft bush head, and I can feel my skin is more smoothy after using it~!</li>
            <li>had I spent more on the other type that is popular.  </li>
            <li>Works great and is very comparable to more expensive versions!</li>
            <li>Forked out just a little over 20 bucks &amp; LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Other brushes are too big, but this is a perfect smaller size!</li>
            <li>This item does scrub my face and give me the new fresh skin that I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult (mid-30s) with very acne-prone skin, so my experience might not be relevant for people with different skin issues who want or need a more aggressive scrubbing action.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this more than once a day because it tends to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft after each time I use it.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a much higher quality product in look and feel, is available in different colors and patterns, and there are no replaceable batteries.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft after using this.</li>
            <li>If you are not using it for make-up removal, the head would probably last longer and will definitely stay more clean.  </li>
            <li>In trying to stop the irritation, redness, dry patches and flaking, I was using too many products, and my skin was reacting to all these things.  </li>
            <li>The battery compartment is easy to work also the instructions are on the box and way simple it says wiggle and pull</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like (and this is easily remedied) is their included cleanser.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like (and this is easily remedied) is their included cleanser.</li>
            <li>The brush is super soft</li>
            <li>I find that I&#x27;m able to use the product once a day, and my skin doesn&#x27;t really dry out (although I always apply a moisturizer anyway).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to take apart and put back together.</li>
            <li>I had bought one for myself previously and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I have to say its been 2 weeks and my nose and chin ae clearing up fit the first time in my entire life!</li>
            <li>Exfoliating cleaners seem to just dry my skin even more.  </li>
            <li>Seriously one of the best facial cleansing system I have ever purchased, and I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to buy the clarasonic one now</li>
            <li>My face simply does not feel clean enough without it now :)  </li>
            <li>Had some problems with dry skin, much better now.</li>
            <li>Refreshing, my skin was dry and after use I could feel the difference.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat dry skin and needed a bit firmer cleansing brush to do a better job of exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not a fan of super duper scrubbing action</li>
            <li>However, if you need really, super soft bristles, this isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li>Kind of disappointed b/c everyone has been hooting and hollering about what a great buy this is.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on this head are super soft.</li>
            <li>I bought Prosonic from groupon for $60 previously and liked it.  </li>
            <li>But, the spinning brush comes off entirely too easily.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel super soft and gets almost all the pores.</li>
            <li>It is totally bang for the buck; easy to use, cleans and declogs the skin, so my skin feels fresher, brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and cleavage and my skin is all soft and absorb moisturizer quick.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a Clarisonic, but honestly, this was so much less money.</li>
            <li>has helped my face clear up greatly, plus no more peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;hope</li>
            <li>but my skin feels super soft.</li>
            <li>and my skin is super soft with no break outs at all.</li>
            <li>nothing fantastic and its pretty big.</li>
            <li>I got this thinking it would help with the occasional breakouts and to clean the pores a bit...but did not notice any difference after using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;Spend some extra money on something better.</li>
            <li>Here lately more dry than oily.</li>
            <li>Seems to deep clean better than a washcloth or a standard complexion brush.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel super soft.</li>
            <li>But when I used it with this for the first time, I really was amazed how much smoother it made my skin.</li>
            <li>This product has made me realize that washing your face with your hands is not good enough this product cleans away the excess dirt, pores and in my case (makeup) around my face and hairline i&#x27;ve noticed a great change in the way my face looks with and without makeup since using this..best investment!</li>
            <li>After the first use, my skin was SO smooth and shiny, it looked 10 years younger!  </li>
            <li>Make sure to wash the brush clean enough or it will make the opposite effect!</li>
            <li>/&gt;25 years old, prone to clogged pores and mild acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gradually clearing up again though and my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li>and I strongly recommend this product to everyone (especially teenagers struggling with acne).</li>
            <li>Using a washcloth alone doesn&#x27;t help especially since I use strong drying out products.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it that often just because its strong enough that I dont want to make my skin sore.</li>
            <li>I like that the battery seems to last and stays consistently strong.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I am a very disorganized person and wont be able to log my opinions for that long.</li>
            <li>I do strongly suggest that after washing and drying your face that you always use a moisturizer, even if it just a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s at least a good first step</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pretty bummed, and I thought my NutraSonic was still dead, so I had to look for another cheaper but still effective replacement.</li>
            <li>I do strongly recommend that prior to each use the brush be sterilized to avoid transmitting bacteria to your face and pores.</li>
            <li>This seems like it is built well, but it isn&#x27;t strong enough for my face to feel like it&#x27;s getting cleaned or exfoliated.</li>
            <li>The motor seems not that strong, however, it is very simple to use.</li>
            <li>bvut such a great price in comparison to the other brands!</li>
            <li>With such a great price I was worried it would work as well as the other&#x27;s out their!  </li>
            <li>The thing I don&#x27;t like is that I went to a certain store,</li>
            <li>Certainly you want to thoroughly remove your makeup, and a brush like this may help, but you have to remember that you&#x27;re going to reuse that brush.</li>
            <li>I have been cursed with large pores.</li>
            <li>I have large pores.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the system, but my pores have remained large.  </li>
            <li>My pores were so large that I began using a brush and foundation to fill them in.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores &amp; along with using pore minimizing products my face is feeling firmer &amp; the results are already noticable to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 and still suffer from acne and large pores.</li>
            <li>Well, it certainly did that.</li>
            <li>I also get flaky skin in certain areas.  </li>
            <li>I have the T-zone problem with large pores</li>
            <li>but it certainly can&#x27;t hurt to use it.</li>
            <li>I have large pores</li>
            <li>My budget doesn&#x27;t allow for an expense quite as large as that product</li>
            <li>large tube is about .1oz.</li>
            <li>At $20 for this product, I certainly cannot complain.</li>
            <li>And certainly could not complain about the price.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth and clean, does wonders on blackheads and other debris.</li>
            <li>product works as advertised but be careful not to over use, can easily cause dry skin problems, would be great if Olay included some type of instructions as to Novato properly use.</li>
            <li>Because the Clairsonic was just very powerful, you felt like your face was getting a better cleaning, but battery went dead just out of warranty and it was pricey!</li>
            <li>and brand new in the box!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s new regimen!!</li>
            <li>She reports that is gentle on her skin (a plus due to her age) and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I sorta braced myself to use it for the first time, but it actually feels like a wonderful little facial massage.      </li>
            <li>My skin is softer and more clear after 2 weeks of using it pretty regularly.</li>
            <li>I use the low setting on my cheeks and they are the most sensitive and the higher setting on my forehead, nose and chin.</li>
            <li>I suggest buying the two pack of extra brushes as I did because my daughter and family use and love my new Pro-X.</li>
            <li>dead skin cells feed the good bacteria that NEEDS to live on your face.&lt;br /&gt;if</li>
            <li>It does leave your face a bit dry afterward, but if you use your moisturizer immediately after, it really sinks into your skin well and feels great.</li>
            <li>If your skin is super-sensitive, this might overdo it, so go easy and maybe use a different exfoliating product or just a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>Had problems with ingrown hairs for years---this really helped clear up my face and quickly.</li>
            <li>It does a great job rejuvenating my skin and making my dull skin look alive!</li>
            <li>Not only is it lightweight, portable and easy to store, the results from use is absolutely what a girl needs.  </li>
            <li>so far so good, within a week i have notice my skin looks healthier and i&#x27;m  also wearing less makeup.</li>
            <li>Easy to use - clear face - soft face- work with AA battery-</li>
            <li>product cleans much better than I thought it would, the brush is very soft but there are 2 speed settings so it depends on how deep you want to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(see my review) , which is, in my opinion, a better product, but not for the very young just learning how to properly care for their face as it would be too abrasive.</li>
            <li>Super smooth, not too rough, I really like the way it scrubs my skin.</li>
            <li>My Complexion is even and I&#x27;m starting to see the fine line DISAPPEAR.</li>
            <li>I have not used the much more expensive versions of this device but cannot imagaine how they could work any better!  </li>
            <li>After using this product, I saw results in my skin within the first week, especially after the second week; my skin was more radiant, clear, and free from pimples.</li>
            <li>I only used the cleanser that came w/ it once, it was fine.</li>
            <li>I put it back together and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t turn out fine then I&#x27;de just save up for the Clarisonic Mia for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off, I originally purchased a Pro-X at my local Walmart but then returned it after seeing the price of this one on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I think it worked fine, and I did end up looking better because of it, but there are other brushes on amazon, one of which I tried that is about $12 by Pixnor, that does the same exact thing, and</li>
            <li>After my very first use, my skin was incredibly soft and felt so much cleaner than it did just using a washcloth.</li>
            <li>not sure if it&#x27;s water proof, but so far it is! :o)</li>
            <li>What had been some peeling/flaking turned into what I imagined to be a fine web of damaged looking skin that peeled and flaked constantly.</li>
            <li>It will work fine for you if you are just looking for a simple face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>My pours are smaller and my skin has such a better clarity!  </li>
            <li>I considered botox, since I have fine wrinkles on my forehead that people occasionally point out: &amp;#34;Stop wrinkling your forehead!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have to say that was my first time with that particular machine.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty decent skin to begin with...</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think the brush and power are strong enough to do much to my skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, feels nice, although messy to use, thus I use it only in the shower.</li>
            <li>All in all, I think this is a pretty decent affordable version of the Clarisonic-type electronic cleansers.  </li>
            <li>but they are hesitant to buy because they think it&#x27;s for older women!</li>
            <li>I think for $21 it does a pretty decent job.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>This is a very high quality product.</li>
            <li>I have very oily, outbreak-prone skin and struggle with large pores and blackheads.</li>
            <li>I really do miss the large pad for exfoliating the body and the scalp attachment.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li>However, I noticed that I had really stubborn clogged pores in certain areas of my face that just would NOT go away no matter what I did.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin with large pores.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li>This little gadget is amazing.</li>
            <li>This little cleanser system is amazing, nothing I was doing was getting rid of the blackheads, and mini pimples on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size: a little shorter than my hand and just a bit wider than the width of two fingers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the $18 unit that isnt quite as nice, but has a little firmer brush head to do what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>The cleanser that comes with it is nice as well with little microbeads.</li>
            <li>Nothing really serious, after a couple days without use, my skin returned to its normal dysfunction, lol.</li>
            <li>Even on the first day I could feel the deep clean happening.</li>
            <li>I like it for the small, portable size (which you can take with you easily for travel purposes) and easy to hold in hand in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my pores, my skin looked smoother cleaner and just plain better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products where I was able to use less of the product and get more exfoliation because this one contains less \\&quot;grit\\&quot; but again my skin can handle more grit whereas others who are more sensitive to abrasion will find this cleanser to be just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are interested in this type of product, I&#x27;d highly recommend saving up and buying the Clarisonic...</li>
            <li>Perhaps my expectations were too high for this product(especially at this price), but now I&#x27;ll be saving up to buy the real thing!</li>
            <li>This is a better system than the larger and more high powered cleansers, because you really don&#x27;t need to scrub so hard to gt the face clean.</li>
            <li>I like that this is more like microdermabrasion, as opposed to the exfoliators with large rough grains.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and the brush head lasted as expected for normal use.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more powerful.</li>
            <li>and I wish it was a little more powerful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I lived so long without using this tool to clean my face!</li>
            <li>For me, I would prefer something a little more powerful.  </li>
            <li>would have given it 5 stars, but I had to pull back one, just for the sake of drawing a little attention to the review and to explain people that it is a great product, but might not be for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does it&#x27;s job to clean more thoroughly than the past routine.</li>
            <li>The design is good and the bristles aren&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li>Feels good without being hard on the wallet.</li>
            <li>Loved this so much I ordered a second for my son.his skin very dry and this has helped his complexion.</li>
            <li>OKAY, I DID FIND IT A LITTLE ROUGH, BUT TO BE HONEST</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft and gentle, even with a little pressure, it just feels good.</li>
            <li>All the little flakes get brushed away and its nice to have a scale free surface to apply my makeup to.</li>
            <li>I love this little brush and am so glad I finally bought it.</li>
            <li>It was super cheap compared to the other one everyone raves about, I&#x27;m not about to spend $100 on a face brush when this one is working quite well for me.</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s super cheap compared to other ones out there like this.</li>
            <li>There is a fair amount of heft to it and, in my opinion, the device is well-built and perfectly capable of surviving a tumble onto a hard shower floor.</li>
            <li>It was a very good price to deliver a similar effect that the expensive one does, and the reviews on Amazon pointing out the pros and cons are quite accurate.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I might consider spending the $$ for the big competitor at some point in the future, and the main reason for that is this product rotates, so it&#x27;s basically pulling your skin (don&#x27;t use it in eye area!).</li>
            <li>I ordered this product based on the overwhelming positive reviews from other customers.</li>
            <li>I was really torn between this and the Clarisonic, given the Clarisonic appears to be very sturdy and waterproof (this is water resistant), but this is just SOOO much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It was mentioned as being a good, cheap alternative to expensive salon treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well, has 2 different speeds and makes your feel so smooth when adding an exfoliator scrub to the brush.</li>
            <li>I also think the rotating action is not so great around the delicate skin areas.  </li>
            <li>It does work to scrub your face, but not enough to make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>My short hair gets caught in the spinning brush - HUGE concern for longer hair.</li>
            <li>I replaced the broken model with this one by Olay because it was reasonably priced and received great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Well, I definitely see a huge progress.</li>
            <li>I actually use this everyday and it leaves my skin looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li>I nice and affordable option to the more expensive alternatives.  </li>
            <li>This being only $20, and having amazing reviews (especially being compared to Clarisonics)</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels great after only using it a few days.</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels great after only using it a few days.</li>
            <li>Used it for a week and did not notice much of a difference between the brush and just using my hands and an exfoliant.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the expensive brushes but this this thing is incredible.  </li>
            <li>I would say to anyone who wants to try one of these cleansing system without spending alot of money on clearsonic, go ahead and try the Pro X</li>
            <li>really cleans your pores well</li>
            <li>The brush is gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>I will say, my face has started breaking out more, but my dermatologist said that is to be expected as my akin adjusts.</li>
            <li>your skin will feel much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The price is much lower than supermarkets.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>Skip the high price cleansing units and go Olay!</li>
            <li>now I know I really overdid it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li>I really like the cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li>However the brush works very well with any cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really really do like this product.</li>
            <li>that said, BE GENTLE and use it on Low.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely a steal.</li>
            <li>and I cannot get over how much my skin has improved just from using it for one week.</li>
            <li>Overall I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Believe me, I read all the pointers about \\&quot;gently rocking it from side to side\\&quot; and even watched videos of how to install batteries in this thing...</li>
            <li>Thanks so much, Olay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using the system for about three weeks and really like it.  </li>
            <li>They were very helpful</li>
            <li>It really opened my pores allowing my acne cream to really work.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a chick you might really like this thing.</li>
            <li>Olay is spinning and really cleans your face.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the clearsonic, but couldnt rationalize paying that much $ on something that cleans your face.</li>
            <li>but I really, really like this.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very foamy</li>
            <li>This time of year though my skin is very tempermental anyway</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product...</li>
            <li>I was debating on getting a Clarisonic but was hesitant to spend that much money</li>
            <li>I like it because it really does help exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I really like Olay&#x27;s Pro-X cleanser.</li>
            <li>gently vibrates and its brush is softer and finer.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>My skin&#x27;s texture is much smoother</li>
            <li>Very plastic.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t really know about any long-term info yet.</li>
            <li>I can use it in the shower and that it is fairly gentle.</li>
            <li>It cleans my face very well.</li>
            <li>I didnt care much for the cleaner it comes with.</li>
            <li>This also feels very abrasive.</li>
            <li>would recommend to anyone who wants the clarisonic but doesn&#x27;t want to splurge.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin which I try to control with blotting paper and powders.  </li>
            <li>I really like using it in the AM -</li>
            <li>It has 2 speeds, but I honestly can&#x27;t really tell a difference with it.</li>
            <li>very coarse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this Olay \\&quot;scrubber\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and it has helped with my scarring so much.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;cleansing system\\&quot; did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very leery, though.</li>
            <li>This REALLY WORKED for me</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and it is working for us.  </li>
            <li>I do have to say though, the hand-held cleansing brush seems cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really missed it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cleansing device.  </li>
            <li>Since using the clarisonic my face is much clearer.  </li>
            <li>My aestichian has said that since the clarisonic uses sonic motion it is gentle on the skin while cleansing</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t beleive it&#x27;d help with wrinkles</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t conpare to the clairsonic, but it works really well.  </li>
            <li>My face seemed shiny and polished, but it was also irritated despite the seemingly gentle rotation of the brush.</li>
            <li>My skin is much cleaner looking, much smoother</li>
            <li>All this at a much lower price than much of the competition.</li>
            <li>I was ready to return this thing.    </li>
            <li>Save up for the real thing and get a Clarisonic - I wish I had.</li>
            <li>It makes shaving much easier, and the results of my face: much smoother.  </li>
            <li>Have replaced brush twice which I think is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Not a microdermabrasion, but that would be expecting too much from a 26 dollar thing.</li>
            <li>I really like Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Pore Scrub (but it doesn&#x27;t get sudsy either).</li>
            <li>Whereas with the Clarisonic, I really notice a difference in my skin after using it.  </li>
            <li>, you can really tell the difference in the way it cleans your face.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m 66, and after one wash with the Olay system, my skin was very chapped - even after using a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Just tear off the papery K-cup top, pull out the filter and wet coffee grounds and wash the plastic cup out.  </li>
            <li>Very disapointed in the cleansing cream</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than getting it in store, used a couple of times per week for about two weeks, face is now peeling all over thus stopped using for now.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist where i go to work wearing so much makeup.</li>
            <li>So using the Pro-X once a day is not too much when used with a gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>no need to spend that much money since I&#x27;m getting the results I want from the Olay.    </li>
            <li>I have only use it sporadically at this point and every time I do, my skin is smooth and not flaky or irritated for days.</li>
            <li>Extremely gentle</li>
            <li>but it really did.  </li>
            <li>and it cleans really well.</li>
            <li>and I think it doesn&#x27;t matter so much</li>
            <li>I tried force, I tried gentle tension.</li>
            <li>because I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>but I do it on purpose since I really want to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>and I just wasnt ready to invest that much money into it</li>
            <li>that works and doesn&#x27;t cost much, and replacement brush head is not expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to wash my face.  </li>
            <li>Had a Clarisonic that died after a year (and I didn&#x27;t really use that much).</li>
            <li>Face feels much cleaner after using this one than the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>It really shakes up the dirt.</li>
            <li>so haha</li>
            <li>This product really works on getting the dirt off my face.</li>
            <li>I could really feel the Clarisonic working well.  </li>
            <li>I may not be using this correctly because it really made my face break out...</li>
            <li>and since there isn&#x27;t much chance of that, the Pro-X is just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Olay Pro-X, I really do.</li>
            <li>I was so glad when the Olay Professional came out with such a reasonable price that I bought it immediatly.</li>
            <li>IT ALSO FEELS MUCH SOFTER.  </li>
            <li>Just buy it, it&#x27;s cheap enough and your going to like it.</li>
            <li>My sister really wanted it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I think that the power is not that much</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, too.</li>
            <li>I think that the power is not all that much</li>
            <li>and also not as much blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice that when you use a foam cleanser it dosnt work as much - just a tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and just feel that it makes my skin feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really explain it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really does do what they say</li>
            <li>and I feel like it has really made a difference in the texture and cleanliness of my skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It seemed to take forever to cover my whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I have had combination skin my whole life.  </li>
            <li>But after a month or so, I really notice a difference in the brightness and tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li>then I REALLY dont recommend getting this product.</li>
            <li>and now i have about 5 scratches on my face and its burning intensely.</li>
            <li>Just save your money over time and get the real deal.    </li>
            <li>30 bucks for refills, haha</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really convenient to use in the shower while I let my conditioner set.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t imagine the $100 or $200</li>
            <li>I have not noticed much of an improvement in my wife&#x27;s skin, but she enjoys the product and that is what this rating is based upon.</li>
            <li>I bought is thanks to ksprite&#x27;s review on here.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it is really getting cleaned.  </li>
            <li>As I have not used the Sonic, I can&#x27;t compare, but the Pro-X brush and cleanser work very well for me.</li>
            <li>, that works very well at either of the two speeds and replacement heads are sold separately and under $10 for 2.  </li>
            <li>No gimmicks here,It has improved the texture of my skin and really cleans it, shipping was fast as well(:</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to,</li>
            <li>Really like this product, I use it once a day in the shower (completely waterproof) and my skin has a noticeably better texture with smaller pores!</li>
            <li>It exfoliates very well and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you really want to try it out, I say go for it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t start out expecting much from the Olay device.</li>
            <li>This product has a gentle spinning brush.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely incredible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is a real pain to find a product that will exfoliate without causing irritation.</li>
            <li>Really see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t figure out what they are doing with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle on your face and</li>
            <li>The Pretika brush is MUCH rougher on your face.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a couple of weeks and have not noticed much difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It really just speeds up the process.</li>
            <li>And what I thought was a hopeless case is now a glowing, supple, clear and fresh face.</li>
            <li>Just pop the brush in, install the included batteries, and it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect it would clear up my skin but after suffering for more than 15 years with recurrent acne, I finally seem to have it under control.  </li>
            <li>makeup goes on looking so much nicer.</li>
            <li>In just one week of using it, I can see an absolute difference in my skin clarity.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to save some $$ and get all the benefits of a thorough cleansing system.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li>I really think the brush helps.</li>
            <li>The scrubbing soap tends to be to much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I encourage anyone who wants a cleansing brush to try this product.  </li>
            <li>It really gets in there and cleanses pores.</li>
            <li>Really helps exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li>I came across this item and along with the $3 coupon the purchase was reasonable.</li>
            <li>and my face feels so much cleaner &amp; smoother.</li>
            <li>This has worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a very versatile way to cleanse your skin.  </li>
            <li>I only used it lightly and for 60 seconds at a time.  </li>
            <li>Amazon really cares about their customers.  </li>
            <li>Thanks and hopes this helps.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t really need it for wrinkles</li>
            <li>both she and my son say their face feels much cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if this will last, but it seems to be working great since December on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know that I would pay THAT much for it.</li>
            <li>and it seemed like a fast spinning brush would hurt.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin much smoother</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>Wash clothes are too rough and cause even more damage and irritation.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks much cleaner, softer, radiant.</li>
            <li>This really cleans my face well</li>
            <li>and I have much fewer breakouts on my chin.  </li>
            <li>I find it very soothing.</li>
            <li>The brush is really soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That went away fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve saved so much</li>
            <li>I think my husband wants one now.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>--Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>But this Olay brush has made my skin much smoother and gets all the remaining makeup off my skin (after i use a makeup remover towelette).</li>
            <li>The exfoliating cleanser included in the package works very well</li>
            <li>This thingy really does a god job at cleaning out pores.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this over spending the money on the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>thank u so much</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy!&lt;br /&gt;(sorry</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and it has not broken yet regardless or the amount of water running.</li>
            <li>I figured I needed a spin brush to really get in there</li>
            <li>My girlfriend has been wanting a cleansing system like this but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on it, so if your sentiments are like hers, then this product is for</li>
            <li>but what I can tell you is that my wife absolutely loves this face cleaning gizmo and the cleanser that goes with it.</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the packaging protects the item purchased .</li>
            <li>Works very well in getting make up off and cleaning face.  </li>
            <li>Get one, and they&#x27;ll send you some the gentle abrasive cleanser to use with it.</li>
            <li>It really helps your face to feel revitalized.  </li>
            <li>Makes your face seem so much cleaner than just washing.</li>
            <li>It really works and removed all my makeup gently.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>This definitely does the job but in no way leaves the smooth and silky feeling like the Clarisonic does.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>Have use it for 3 days and it cleans my skin very well.</li>
            <li>It cleans face very well...</li>
            <li>I like it and highly recommend his product!</li>
            <li>Nothing really happened, but I could somehow feel my skin was at the verge of a breakout.  </li>
            <li>and I really did not use it.</li>
            <li>I recommend highly!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>My face has become much softer and fairer after using pro-x.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this to everyone because you have no idea how much gunk is in your skin unless you wash it out and pro-x helps you with that.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It evens my skin tone, my skin feels much softer and cleaner.</li>
            <li>My face felt so much smoother and cleaner</li>
            <li>, I cannot believe that I was just using my hands my whole life.</li>
            <li>I cannot speak to how the clarisonic operates, as I have never used one, but this is a much cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li>However the cleansing cream it comes with smells really funky to me</li>
            <li>Not that much of a problem</li>
            <li>And it cleans my face very well.</li>
            <li>this product can really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>your budget can afford a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; tool, you may want to consider going for that instead because you can get much \\&quot;deeper\\</li>
            <li>your budget can afford a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; tool, you may want to consider going for that instead because you can get much \\&quot;deeper\\&quot; cleaning.</li>
            <li>I find that it exfoliates really well and leaves my skin feeling, and looking, radiant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks, olay</li>
            <li>I have taken mine in the shower and its very waterproof.</li>
            <li>Really cleans your face and helps whatever cleanser, moisturizer, or</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to spend too much time on your face with it.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleaning system --</li>
            <li>I have been using the sample of the Olay cleanser and really like that too.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It does take away make up without to much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like this.</li>
            <li>I expected a lot more from this product.</li>
            <li>Opening it was a bit of a trial, but thanks to youtube, is easily accomplished without breaking it.</li>
            <li>Really helps exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li>This is a well built brush and it works very well</li>
            <li>Also product slips in between bristles &amp; doesn&#x27;t scrub your face as much.</li>
            <li>has really kept my breakouts in check since I started using it.</li>
            <li>It really makes you feel freshened up after you wash</li>
            <li>and like it really washed your face.</li>
            <li>it is the ONLY thing that keeps my skin acne free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much happier with the results with that versus with the provided scrub.</li>
            <li>It really exfoliates the skin.</li>
            <li>Really cleans the pores of your skin.  </li>
            <li>After using this for over a year, I have noticed a difference in my skin - it is much softer.</li>
            <li>, really makes my skin feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>I have wanted to give one of these gadgets a try for some time, but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give it a go but didn&#x27;t think it would really do much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It got so much makeup off my skin that I didn&#x27;t even know was on there</li>
            <li>It exfoliates gently and evenly.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>I looked and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay 5 times as much for a vibrating face brush.</li>
            <li>brush has helped me soooooo much with controlling my blackheads.</li>
            <li>AND THIS COMBINATION REALLY</li>
            <li>This is so much better than expected.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do much to my skin but to my boyfriends.</li>
            <li>I really like this Olay Cleansing Brush ...</li>
            <li>It really leaves my skin feeling smoother after using.</li>
            <li>It really does scrub off all the gunk on your face and the cleanser that comes with</li>
            <li>The rotating brush was so gentle that I felt like I was massaging dirt and makeup into my face instead of scrubbing it off.  </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of really trying to like it, I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li>Within 1 week my face really started clearing up.</li>
            <li>My face is so much softer, way softer, and the hormonal break outs disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about the products I use, so</li>
            <li>I feel like it makes my face so much brighter &amp; smoother.</li>
            <li>FACE IS MUCH CLEARER SINCE I STARTED USING THIS.</li>
            <li>NOTHING MUCH ELSE TO SAY EXCEPT</li>
            <li>I really see no reason to buy the $100+ one.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I really feel like it does the job</li>
            <li>Really seems to keep my skin much cleaner and clearer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating this 4 stars and not 5 as it didn&#x27;t come with any instructions stating how much application should be applied to the brush or face, setup, etc.</li>
            <li>then this is worth wild</li>
            <li>and my skin is much clearer now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt my face and is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>the product is very fragile.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also works very wellon your body too.  </li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>This pro really cleans my skin and exfoliates it really well too.  </li>
            <li>but that was too much for my skin to handle</li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena oil free acne wash daily with the brush and once or twice a week, I&#x27;ll use the face cleanser that came with the brush.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;it can wash my face really clean!!now</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro-X cleanser has some exfoliating beads, but not too much since the system does some exfoliating as well.</li>
            <li>I cant tell much difference between the two speeds</li>
            <li>Plus you can do it in the shower making it very convenient.</li>
            <li>This really makes a difference to the smoothness of you</li>
            <li>As this product has been available for &amp;#62;3 years, it is only a question of when, not if, it will disappear from the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been BB cream and makeup free for a week  now since it finally cleared.</li>
            <li>but I wanted share my rave review all because I got results so fast</li>
            <li>have always been very strict with my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>If that is what your expectation is, then just spend the money in the real deal.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>once I&#x27;m done, and I followed the reviewers suggestion of not apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Despite others saying that it doesn&#x27;t really do anything, the point of it is to keep at it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this item.</li>
            <li>Very durable product.</li>
            <li>My face is much smoother.</li>
            <li>I like the brush for gentle non-abrasive cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Olay Pro-x  cleaning system for about 5 months now and really like it.  </li>
            <li>very quickly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>ProX is very efficient in cleaning up whatever my face wipes didn&#x27;t get off and</li>
            <li>Not as gentle as clarsonic but for the price</li>
            <li>She has oily skin and find this brush gets her face much cleaner than just washing it.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t seem like it would really do anything.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on the face and does the job well without irritation.</li>
            <li>I wanted a bit more deeper cleansing &amp; if you press harder it stops.</li>
            <li>Thanks Olay.</li>
            <li>I use an appropriately gentle touch to the skin so that I&#x27;m getting the tips buy not bending the bristles.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get any real skin problems anymore.</li>
            <li>Wearing makeup can feel really caked on and</li>
            <li>WORKS REALLY WELL</li>
            <li>Cleans so gentle.</li>
            <li>I still have three spare heads for it and it cleans very well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very convenient tool.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>It provides a much cleaner feeling that using hands alone.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, has two speed settings.</li>
            <li>I never tried a clarasonic, so I can&#x27;t compare the two, but I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel like it has really made a difference in the texture and cleanliness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having a much easier time extracting my blackheads with a blackhead extractor thanks to Olay&#x27;s cleansing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would really recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>thanks olay for another affordable product</li>
            <li>One recommendation, batteries die fast</li>
            <li>The exfoliating cleanser included in the package works very well</li>
            <li>Gently rock the battery compartment side to side while pulling to release the battery cover.</li>
            <li>my face would feel much smoother than it does.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my Pro-X about 3 weeks ago from Costco (about $36 with the full-size cleanser), and it has really worked wonders on my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just really like using this cleaner.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend you buy this system!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but this brush removes it well.  </li>
            <li>In between, I use it with Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I can tell that it really cleans my face after use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and I have seen an improvement .</li>
            <li>My wife loves, works very well.</li>
            <li>Their customer service was really lacking.</li>
            <li>I grew to really like using the Pro-X during the 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Refill brushes are much cheaper too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My face feels cleaner and softer and I really appreciated the face wash that was included in the package.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very grateful, it&#x27;s cleaning my face very well.</li>
            <li>Olay has two settings, a slower setting and a fast setting, but not so fast that you can&#x27;t detect movement of the bristles (like the Clarisonic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need to buy the whole Olay skin system</li>
            <li>Why is moving my hand with a washcloth so much effort when I exercise for an hour a day?</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think there was as much pulling.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>It makes my face look so much brighter and feels so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>It is much softer and gentler than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle</li>
            <li>It is compact and battery operated; very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Fiddling with my skin isn&#x27;t really my thing; a drug-store cleanser and moisturizer</li>
            <li>It runs on two AA batteries and getting that organized was a challenge: you have to guess where the batteries go, and the directions say \\&quot;Gently rock the battery compartment side to side while pulling to release battery cover ...\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I decided to order this product because I heard so much about it from my co-workers and on blogs.  </li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really mind it</li>
            <li>not so much the cream you use.</li>
            <li>The whole box contained everything including the batteries.  </li>
            <li>I use it 4-5 times a week with a gentle face wash</li>
            <li>Got this for my g/f for christmas because she had a lot of cheapy face cleaner things to try and really exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>useful cleansing brush with soft bristles.</li>
            <li>My face became much cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li>think about those cheap simple machine (kids toy or mini fan) you can buy from street vendors or hardware store.</li>
            <li>It gets kind of oily in the summer and kind of dry in the winter but nothing serious.</li>
            <li>The brush has two speeds and does a very thorough job.</li>
            <li>This machine really delivered what it promises.</li>
            <li>I really do like the cleanser that it came with.</li>
            <li>Looking at it, I thought, \\&quot;Well, this isn&#x27;t going to be much, is it?\\&quot;   </li>
            <li>I LIKE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES GET YOUR FACE AND PORES CLEANS FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE OF THE CLARISONIC.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both reasonable speeds and get the job done.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item to everyone I know!</li>
            <li>Friends recommended Clarisonic, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money.  </li>
            <li>This seemed to be a reasonable alternative.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This can&#x27;t really be compared to the Pretika because this one spins instead of vibrates.</li>
            <li>I doubt that it exfoliates much, if at all.</li>
            <li>I considered getting another Clarisonic, but really who wants to pay $200 for something to wash your face?  </li>
            <li>this system seems to really deliver.  </li>
            <li>The NutraSonic plugs into a regular outlet to charge up, not a battery powered brush like the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>have actually gone through two of these Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing Systems now</li>
            <li>which consisted of her turning on the brush and brushing my face with it gently (just the brush, no water or cleanser.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, back to Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>So, back to Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>Much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It is very well made.  </li>
            <li>but the humidity was too much for the inside of the machine.</li>
            <li>I do really, really like this system.</li>
            <li>Because my skin likes to medicate separately from my cleansers, I prefer Cetaphil or gentle, salicylic acid-free soaps.</li>
            <li>but he really likes it.</li>
            <li>My face has cleared up so fast and my blemishes have gone away.</li>
            <li>I really like the Olay brush.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not producting as much oil.  </li>
            <li>He really likes it and has helped a LOT with his skin.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li>a sponge or washcloth might not be able to, the con&#x27;s might be if it gets too wet</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter as an option instead of the Clarisonic, which she really was wanting.</li>
            <li>She was really wanting to use the foam scrub heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is much nicer to the skin, if anything it just feels like a gentle message.</li>
            <li>really cleans the face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was doing much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I also really did not like the cleanser it came with.</li>
            <li>These products are so much cheaper from amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with batteries but butteries run out fast.</li>
            <li>My wife really loves the price on this item.</li>
            <li>the price in here is so much cheaper than in store price, not to mention their competitor.</li>
            <li>I found that it was too much for my skin every day</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t really ever have issues, period.</li>
            <li>No idea how much longer I have with them, but still.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- wipe face gently with cotton ball</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>, once it doesn&#x27;t deliver the sonic component what are you really getting... a rotating brush.</li>
            <li>and i really like it.  </li>
            <li>This cleansing brush is invigorating but gentle.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Another things is since I have really greasy skin</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>This cleansing system has given me back my smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I never been one for having much acne at all.</li>
            <li>The Pro-x works very well at cleasing my face.  </li>
            <li>It is very resonably priced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, and while it definitely is working I&#x27;m still not in the land of silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and didn&#x27;t have my hopes up very high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it matters as much what you use with the Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get acne very often</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much smoother and firmer after I use it</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to go without it.</li>
            <li>and this is gentle but invigorating</li>
            <li>But for my budget, and until I can spring for the pricier name-brand model, this absolutely satisfies me</li>
            <li>how well this works for how much it costs.</li>
            <li>It washed face gently and made my face smoother.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Neutrogena Oil Free Cleanser twice daily</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend the Olay Pro-X brush!</li>
            <li>Since everyone seems to be comparing it to the Clarsonic model that costs five times as much, I&#x27;ll weigh in.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for over a month..and dont see much difference in how my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I have been using mine for three weeks now and really do see and feel a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Delivery through Amazon was fast...</li>
            <li>This should not be a problem if you gently press it against your skin and keep it moving around your face</li>
            <li>It looks much brighter and healthier too.</li>
            <li>That may have something to do with how much pressure I apply when using the system.  </li>
            <li>Around my chin not so much.</li>
            <li>Plus I wanted to use it in the shower without it feeling bulky and taking up too much space.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>have normal skin except for my t-zone, where it&#x27;s pretty oily.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper the Mio</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The scrubbing didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>Was very surprise of the result .</li>
            <li>It  really works.</li>
            <li>I really expected so much more based on all the 4 and 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li>I was using the neutrogena grapefruit scrub and it did absolutely nothing for me</li>
            <li>I also periodically use the pro-x cleansing system with a gentle exfoliating lotion to eliminate flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>, you feel like you are really exfoliating with it.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels much cleaner and smoother than before when I was just hand-washing.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect because he can run it over his face and it does the dirty work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100 dollars, and I really didn&#x27;t want to shell out that much if it probably wouldn&#x27;t work for me anyway.</li>
            <li>I feel that this product can over expose your skin if you use it to much.  </li>
            <li>So, I really do like that.  </li>
            <li>I just am very prone to breakouts and it seems to not help that.</li>
            <li>I really, really was looking forward to getting this.  </li>
            <li>Press it too much on your skin and it will stop spinning.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY do not waste your money on those brushes that cost over $100.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Couple of Tips: I used up the tube of cleaner that it came with really fast.</li>
            <li>The brush works better when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive, and depending on how often you use it, it can do your skin wonders.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>, I was hesitant because its SO much cheaper than the clairsonic.  </li>
            <li>It is better than i expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Instead of a rotating brush, the brush vibrates sending sonic waves (much like a sonicare) into your skin as you rotated it around your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to do with it now because who wants to use a used face-cleanser..</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was ready to head to Ulta to buy the Clarisonic for a lot of money when I came across this.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really seem to work.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend these for those looking to exfoliate and keeping their skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I would imagine it help keep skin looking youthful because it really exfoliates well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;cheers and thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Also, my makeup looks much smoother on my skin.  </li>
            <li>My daughter wants one.</li>
            <li>I wash with gentle products (Cetaphil type cleanser and Philosophy moisturizer).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this item.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune and it works really well.</li>
            <li>This is way too gentle.</li>
            <li>As a guy, that is probably an unusual thing to say.  </li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>It is gentle and helps with her taking care of her skin.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use as much</li>
            <li>I had a Clarisonic for years and was hoping this would be comparable at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I like that it smooths my skin and gets it ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product arrived as scheduled, packaging was really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I broke out so much.</li>
            <li>The Pro-X seemed like a lot of hoop-la for very merger cleansing experience.  </li>
            <li>bristles are much softer..</li>
            <li>it took off my makeup very well.</li>
            <li>It feels much cleaner than using a washcloth.</li>
            <li>and i really do see a difference.</li>
            <li>when I rolling on my face, it feels very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li>The massage feel is gentle but nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the gentle brush and the cleanser seemed to work well too.</li>
            <li>She really likes hers</li>
            <li>, I really like mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it so much.</li>
            <li>addition, the shipment has respected the time and it was fast,</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has really reduced any breakouts drastically.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>it really helps get all the make up off, even after soap and cleansers.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t going to pay that much.</li>
            <li>compared to some of the cleaning systems out there - this one is extremely reasonable.  </li>
            <li>You will be much happier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brush for a couple of days now and my skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li>but that didn&#x27;t help much, and I had to resort to looking up a demonstration on YouTube before I had some idea how to get it done.  </li>
            <li>B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid</li>
            <li>combined with a gentle cleansing wash and used 3-4 times per week, I saw reduction of past acne scars within the first couple uses, and my skin has looked amazing ever since.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I suggest getting a gentle cleanser and a toner for added benefit.</li>
            <li>and i know its cleaning my skin really well</li>
            <li>but that was too much for my skin.</li>
            <li>but have been using this once daily, and already my face is smooth, glowing.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this every day and is convinced it has really improved her skin.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle</li>
            <li>I chose this product over the more expensive Clarisonic because I wasn&#x27;t sure that that one was worth the almost $200 price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to find gentle ways to remove the peeling skin.</li>
            <li>My skin loves the gentle but thorough exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the whole \\&quot;cleaning with</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very lightweight product and as the product description says, there are 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>The free facial cleaner that came with the brush, does not impress me either.  </li>
            <li>I think it works really well.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and then every Sunday I exfoliate my skin with my 3 minute peel from Real Chemistry.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and no harm your face.</li>
            <li>and i could really tell my face was 100x cleaner and softer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely swear by this thing now.</li>
            <li>Between the brush, replacements, and my cleanser, toner, and benzoyl peroxide over the counter medicine, I&#x27;m STILL not paying as much as I did for just one month of the prescriptions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wish I had taken before pictures.</li>
            <li>so people don&#x27;t notice the imperfections as much.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s all thanks to this.sh, just</li>
            <li>I really wish I had taken before pictures.</li>
            <li>so people don&#x27;t notice the imperfections as much.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s all thanks to this.</li>
            <li>I think it would work on any type of skin if a person appreciates a gentle squeaking face and / or neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li>You can really use this with any cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a whole week that I&#x27;ve gone without wearing foundation, and I owe it all to this</li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>All in all, it was cheap enough that I don&#x27;t mind having bought it.</li>
            <li>I will keep using this and don&#x27;t see much reason to spend so much money on the clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I bought two for my daughters because I like mine so much.</li>
            <li>exfoliates and REALLY cleanses.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic Mia for some reason was very abrasive to my skin (and no I did not use an exfoliator with the brush, I used a gel).</li>
            <li>It cleans without having so much power that it hurts your skin.</li>
            <li>I just really wanted to brush.  </li>
            <li>Depends on you skin really</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the Pro X REALLY cleans my face...</li>
            <li>Still works very well.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin is much smoother now.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is gentle on the face as well as cleanses.</li>
            <li>It works very well and I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser test</li>
            <li>I purchased the Olay cleansing system and was using it at night with a very sparing amount of cleanser.</li>
            <li>use it about once a week, really cleans out your pours.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I think the cleanser really works and works well with brush</li>
            <li>but I wish it didnt cost so much.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t see an immediate difference, but over time I can see that my skin is smoother, and it always feels much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I  really like that this has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>It cleans gently, but thoroughly.</li>
            <li>This does not have a lot of power and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really doing anything beneficial to my face.</li>
            <li>It is just what I expected better price that the one in store</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for gentle cleansing, this is for you.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could try the Clarisonic to see if this really is a comparable product or not.  </li>
            <li>The brush is gentle and seems to gently exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>it is gentle and thorough.  </li>
            <li>It really claim what it does.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but I have difficulty keeping it in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position --</li>
            <li>afterward soaked in very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Although it has taken some getting used to, I find that I really like this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely ruined my skin</li>
            <li>A must have for sure--without having spend way too much money and</li>
            <li>And it really does what it promises.</li>
            <li>Also, the brush heads are 2 for $8 on Amazon, which is much cheaper than the $20 for 1 they charge at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>Save your money, or really save your money for the cost of care.</li>
            <li>This produce is working very well.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I wasn&#x27;t ready to fully invest $200 in the clarisonic.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>much.</li>
            <li>And she feels like her skin is much cleaner than just using her hands to wash her face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing some long-term results with this product.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a differance in my pores and my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I also really like that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>At first,I think it will not work well because the cleaning system is very simple.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>anyways it is so much cheaper than the clearsonic($100</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]] to open this machine so I can put the batteries in it!</li>
            <li>what it is, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Priced very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like Olay&#x27;s face wash.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like doing reviews but decided to do so because I now read reviews BEFORE I order an item and have found it very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The discs that work with this product are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>My face is absolutely glowing when I use it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>You really do get what you pay for</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t seem to be helping him that much, and costing us a lot of $$$.</li>
            <li>I tried again with a gentle creamy cleanser, no luck.</li>
            <li>I wanted a gentle cleansing system that would still do the job.</li>
            <li>and I can really FEEL the difference in my face</li>
            <li>It really had no effect whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t use much battery at all.</li>
            <li>The only thing is the surface area of the brush is smaller then the Claisonic, but it definitely cleans my face very well, and I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>check the quality and it is working very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have much power.  </li>
            <li>Really cleans your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product twice from Amazon because I like it so much.  </li>
            <li>We all know Olay is a fantastic company, so save yourself a ton by purchasing it here instead of at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have much of an exfoliating power to it and it didn&#x27;t suds up that well.</li>
            <li>Also, I really don&#x27;t notice a difference between the 2 settings, maybe mine was defective?</li>
            <li>I really like this system..</li>
            <li>I really wanted the clarisonic</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>I was in awe with how much makeup and impurities were off of my face after having used it for about 3 minutes (1 minute on each side of my face).</li>
            <li>Really helping her skin.</li>
            <li>For me, it really depends on what your skin type is and what you prefer.</li>
            <li>What I really wanted was a Clarisonic, but can&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li>This brush has helped so much.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the face and not abrasive.</li>
            <li>My mom even bought one and loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of my acne and it hasn&#x27;t helped too much with that in the month that I have had it</li>
            <li>The brush is gentle and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I was undecided between this product and the clarasonic but chose this one for the price and thought if I use it a lot or really like it</li>
            <li>, I look forward to using it and think I really notice a brighter, smoother complexion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite gentle as I use it on my face.  </li>
            <li>I tried to continue using it because I thought that the &amp;#34;toxins&amp;#34; under my skin might finally be breaking free, but I couldn&#x27;t continue using it because it never improved my complexion.</li>
            <li>The price is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>She loves makeup and reports that her primer and foundation go on much smoother after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for two weeks, seems it really works.</li>
            <li>I like it alot and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s my fault haha</li>
            <li>Really made a difference and cleared up my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brush for a couple of days now and my skin is much softer.</li>
            <li>and she really likes it also.</li>
            <li>It really works for me and makes my skin softer than before.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>, however my pores still look like they are filled with dirt, especially on my nose.  </li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for this product.  </li>
            <li>I cannot really conduct a scientific experiment here.  </li>
            <li>But, where I use it, my skin subjectively feels much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use as much moisturizer or foundation</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much, much gentler than using a washcloth on my face every day.</li>
            <li>It was a really reasonable price and fast shipping here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This really helped with blackheads</li>
            <li>my skin feels much smoother after I use this.</li>
            <li>This system removes so much dirt and oil, while massaging my skin.</li>
            <li>and I can really feel it cleaning.</li>
            <li>it can do whole body.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this cleans my face.</li>
            <li>Was a gift and really well received.</li>
            <li>well...check again and use the brush to really get into your pores</li>
            <li>WHILE I REALIZED THAT THE CLEARSONIC WAS REALLY</li>
            <li>The clarisonic used a sonic pulse much like the sonicare toothbrush .  </li>
            <li>I am 53, by the way, and need to work harder now on making my sun-damaged skin look better.</li>
            <li>She kept looking at the ones that cost over $100 at Dillard&#x27;s, and I just couldn&#x27;t afford to pay that much.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used Clarisonic, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I do really like this</li>
            <li>I really cant believe anyone would compare the two.</li>
            <li>Otherwise save your money and get a gentle face scrubber and do it by hand.</li>
            <li>This cleans so well and yet the bristles are so gentle.  </li>
            <li>My face looks healthier and skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It really has made a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>The brush on this really doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t even use much foundation.</li>
            <li>But there&#x27;s really not that many ways to get that gunk out of your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think, my face just looks much cleaner when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Really gets in there and cleans my face.</li>
            <li>Really like this,</li>
            <li>especially because, let&#x27;s face it, the price is cheap for this type of face</li>
            <li>I was not prepared to invest much money in another brush</li>
            <li>My face is much cleaner.</li>
            <li>i really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this faithfully twice per day since I received it (almost one month) and am overjoyed with how much my skin has improved.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped his face after he shaves.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in wrinkles and I still break out just as much.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be more</li>
            <li>It is thorough but gentle for my face.</li>
            <li>; Haha.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid for it, I really can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Then when i felt how gentle it was, I thought &amp;#34;this can&#x27;t be doing anything&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li>The delivery was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I used it, my skin felt much cleaner than when I use my hands to wash my face.</li>
            <li>This product works really well for what it is.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel much cleaner and softer.</li>
            <li>Will recommend this product to friends and family, thank u so much.</li>
            <li>Gets make-up off, and moisturizers really seem to penetrate.</li>
            <li>the brush still spins just as fast as it did on day 1.</li>
            <li>Always leaves my face really</li>
            <li>The key to clear and healthy skin?</li>
            <li>Personally, just rubbing the soft brush with the power off across your face did a better job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in the hand, it has 2 speeds, and the brush feels just right-not too rough or too soft.</li>
            <li>The super soft rotating brush is way too wimpy to effectively remove dead skin cells or clean facial pores.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Olay Professional Pro-x Advanced cleasing system on Amazon.com after looking in retail stores and it was by far the cheepest.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but the rotating motion does a much better job of cleaning than just soap and a washcloth.</li>
            <li>I liked the CP because it came with a body brush, but then it occurred to me that I could just have an extra brush with the Pro-X that would serve basically the same purpose,</li>
            <li>It is not as nice as the Clarisonic but definitely does the job of deep cleaning her face.</li>
            <li>Good, but not for delicate skin.</li>
            <li>Regardless, just taking a regular washcloth and scrubbing my face with any old cleanser works better than this for cleaning AND exfoliating in one step.  </li>
            <li>Ok let me start by saying I am a 28 year old male and when this arrived at my doorstep</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 year old grand daughter to use because she has acne on her back and shoulders.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but either the brushes are too delicate that I don&#x27;t feel a thorough cleansing.</li>
            <li>This is NOT recommended if you actually want clear, problem free faces!</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft enough for all but perhaps the most sensitve.</li>
            <li>I am a 48 year old female; I take good care of my combination skin, exfoliate several times a week, use retinol products.</li>
            <li>Feels like I&#x27;m at least doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li>It may be that I&#x27;m in my &amp;#34;baby making&amp;#34; prime or the result of recently discovered food allergies, but either way I seemingly never had been able to maintain a clear complexion.</li>
            <li>last about a month each with daily use, and I just use my own St.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t use mine as often, I&#x27;m going on roughly six months on the same brush, and it&#x27;s still in good condition.</li>
            <li>My skin can absorb the products I use better, and the soft feeling I could only get twice a week</li>
            <li>Functional and effective in removing dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any of the more expensive brushes but honestly I find no need to.  </li>
            <li>Following up with my Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel Toner and Yes to Grapefruit Daily Scrub, my skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend using your own face wash because everyone has different skin types.</li>
            <li>I purchased this a few years ago before it became wildly popular</li>
            <li>It feels good, though I have not honestly seen a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use my own cleanser for everyday use and their cleanser twice a week.  </li>
            <li>I tried many and so far Olay products have been the only product that is showing me results.  </li>
            <li>Never tried any of the more expensive kinds but it exfoliates my face and gives it a nice massage.</li>
            <li>I would go as far as saying this works as good as the more expensive alternatives.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good product to try if you don&#x27;t want to spend near $100 on more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>If you are hoping this scrubber is as good as the professional ones then don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this for a week maybe a little more gentle but as it stands right now</li>
            <li>I think this could be good for those with dry skin as well, as the dead skin and gunk can be thoroughly cleansed away thereby creating no barrier to your moisturizer application, letting your skin drink it right up!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was looking for a brush that would clean without irritating and decided to try the Olay Prox and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>With more time, I will see if this acne-prevention is just pure coincidence or actually due to using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After using it just once, my skin feels tight, smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>I guess if you have super sensitive skin, this might work for you, but most people just have average skin.</li>
            <li>The Olay brush was just as effective, and less than a quarter of the price!</li>
            <li>Just because I rotate three toners, three cleansers, one exfoliator, three moisturizers and a night serum and use eye cream twice a day does NOT mean I have a problem!</li>
            <li>And it is SO SOFT!!!</li>
            <li>Makes your face soft!!!</li>
            <li>My pores are nice and clean now and have decreased in size by a large %.</li>
            <li>Its a very useful implement for getting deep into skin pores.</li>
            <li>I like that it is small and portable, makes it easy for travel and to fit into the bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li>I went through the sample of exfoliator pretty quickly and use a Clinique facial cleanser with it and follow up with Clinique moisturizer</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use in the shower and at the sink, doesn&#x27;t make a mess</li>
            <li>I only use it two-three times a week due to my sensitive skin and it has made a great improvement on my complexion.</li>
            <li>I think it cleans just as well, but Clarisonic is really on to something with the other kind of brush action.</li>
            <li>, what this comes down to is, to me, is that it&#x27;s all just a trendy new beauty product.  </li>
            <li>This little thing makes my skin feel so smooth &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>It helped my face clear right up.</li>
            <li>but right now it&#x27;s as clear as it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>Cannot see the improvement clearly, even right after using.</li>
            <li>I also think it&#x27;s just the right amount of cleansing/exfoliating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin &amp; are not used to exfoliating, than this might be the right product for you.</li>
            <li>The brush&#x27; rotating action massages and cleans the face, right to its pores.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not very expensive to use.</li>
            <li>Burts Bees also makes great natural lotions that work well on sensitive, raw skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone, and seems gentle enough for the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the look of my skin when using the Pro-X, but it definitely gave me that deep clean feeling when I used it.</li>
            <li>Plus it takes too long and the head pops off easily.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much given how inexpensive it was, but I feel like it is doing what I want, which is to deep clean my face.</li>
            <li>The higher speed is gentle and not excessive for the task.</li>
            <li>I would say that the Pro-X is a good first step or alternative to more expensive facial cleansers since it worked well and in reasonably priced (believe me I did a tons of review research on cleansing systems before I purchased this one</li>
            <li>because it really does help when a product has the backing of so many other people.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice clear feeling even using other soaps..</li>
            <li>This is just as good as one of those more expensive products!</li>
            <li>Definitely a good value for your money compared with other similar systems (ie. Clarisonic),</li>
            <li>It works really well at cleaning my skin, much better than other scrubbers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>If you are wanting powerful and stiffer brush this is not for you HOWEVER for the money, it works fine for every few days of scrubbing your face.&lt;br /&gt;2 speeds, I just use the higher one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I looked at all the $200 facial brushes, and they were all too large for me to hold comfortably though I have a normal size 7 hand.  </li>
            <li>and although I can&#x27;t say how much of a difference I see (I&#x27;ve only used 2 times so far), what I can say is how soft and smooth my face is and the brush is super gentle.</li>
            <li>The only thing I was disappointed in was the strength/speed of the motor, but to be fair, I was hoping for something more like a sandblaster, where the Pro-X is more like a polisher.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t willing to give up my love of the occasional junk food and soft drinks in favour of veggies and water to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>It is very effective for cleaning behind my ears, and they have never been cleaner.</li>
            <li>It is very effective for cleaning behind my ears, and they have never been cleaner.</li>
            <li>I use my own facial cleanser, but the brush leaves my skin feeling remarkably soft, especially after the first usage.</li>
            <li>I also tried it with a gentle cleanser with no exfoliant and that too gave a deep clean.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted one of these thingy that claims to clean your skin very well and finally got this one from walmart.</li>
            <li>Really helps clean deep pores.</li>
            <li>It really seems like you get a deep clean after you&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>Have had for a long time and still working fine and really helps complexion.  </li>
            <li>What I can say is this product works well, left my face super soft, less visible pores, and my face looks youthful &amp; clean. :)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a decrease in the size of the pores on my nose, but it does help to keep them clean, and it has helped to restore the soft skin I had on my face 10 years ago when I was in my early 20s.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to replace with a new pad every single time I use it.</li>
            <li>It does make my face feel super clean and smooth, but I guess the creme is no good for someone like me.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $200 on the other brand when I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny because the bristles are quite soft and the speed it spins isn&#x27;t really that fast.  </li>
            <li>Love this, use it every other night</li>
            <li>Love this product - now looking at other Olay products.</li>
            <li>I have used it both with the original Olay pro X cleanser (included) and with my regular face washer</li>
            <li>I saw one in Sephora the other day and was able to turn it on.  </li>
            <li>I think I will be able to use this every other day with moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>The other Amazon reviews led me to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>That means is was getting to the skin under the surface layers better due to the Olay machine.  </li>
            <li>I originally tried the DDF Revolve 400X MicroPolishing System &amp; found my skin looking &amp; feeling the same before &amp; after.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried so many other products...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still using the original batteries with regular use.</li>
            <li>I think this would work better for other skin types.</li>
            <li>This is an ok product that will give out in due time...</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of money, you will have more in your purse if you purchase this cleaner to buy other things.  </li>
            <li>I also feel like my acne creams and moisturizers soak in so much better, like other reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft &amp; smooth, and it did have a \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, which can somewhat be attributed to the small sample of exfoliating scrub :)  </li>
            <li>Better thAn other brushes and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my face, mostly in the shower when the face has gotten a little steamed first, so</li>
            <li>Even anyone who has normal skin!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was amazed by how soft my skin was!</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and love it.</li>
            <li>The difference was significant enough for the touch of my fingers to notice.</li>
            <li>the price definitely makes it worth it!</li>
            <li>By the second use that evening I noticed a significant reduction in my pores.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any other benefits that others mention (like smoother make-up application or better skin absorbance of lotion), but I do believe that the others did experience those benefits.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t spend a hundred bucks on other brush cleanser devices.</li>
            <li>I do feel like my moisturizers work better due to the cleaning from the pro.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d read other reviews and many people said they had a problem with the batteries.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a product worth purchasing!</li>
            <li>Well Fog-free Shower Mirror - #1 Best-seller in the Shower Mirror Category on Amazon - 33% Larger Than the Original Shave Well Mirror]]</li>
            <li>I cannot imagine Clairsonic or any other cleansing systems doing a better job of cleaning than this.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much more affordable than some other systems.  </li>
            <li>a look at the many reviews posted by other users.</li>
            <li>After two uses (Morning and night) I woke up the next day with a significant reduction in blackheads.</li>
            <li>I love washing my face now, it has never felt cleaner using any other cleansing method.</li>
            <li>at 57 I&#x27;ll take those compliments with a big smile!</li>
            <li>This product works a lot better than I expected!</li>
            <li>In fact I&#x27;d submit that most other cleansers are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I like one better than the other.  </li>
            <li>This may be due to pressing more while using it or using it rigorously</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as magical as other said.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle for the skin, it really exfoliates nicely without irritating.</li>
            <li>This cheaply made &amp; does not spin very quickly &amp; the brush is to soft to really make any impact on removing dead cells.</li>
            <li>Its great; just try to keep it out of as much water as possible, when you&#x27;re done, dry it off, will last longer.</li>
            <li>Olay has put out a terrific product here and it&#x27;s worth every penny of the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews that said this left their skin a little dry, but mine is just perfect.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed a significant decrease in dry skin and have noticed some of my dryness-caused redness disappearing.</li>
            <li>When I learned about this little gizmo, I thought I would give it a try as it was garnering such great reviews from the press and from actual users of a similar more costly product.</li>
            <li>Buy it when it&#x27;s cheap, not like it&#x27;s already cheap compared to other brands like the Clarisonic that is over $100!!!</li>
            <li>you really need it if you want to get your facial cleaning on the right way.&lt;br /&gt;it is not expensive as well.</li>
            <li>It works fine with me but compared to the mia2 it looks like the mia2 would put in so much more work just from the look of the brushes, but as far as the speed they look like they go about the same or if so not much of a dramtic difference.</li>
            <li>I NEVER felt a deep clean with it.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>I was using it a lot at first to see if it would clear my face but didnt seem to help much in that department.</li>
            <li>It did not, however, leave it feeling parched or overly dry--just extra clean.</li>
            <li>I thought I was cleaning it well, but after using this brush, I&#x27;m convinced  that I had to clean it in a different way.</li>
            <li>cleans well never had one of the more expensive brands but for the price its good and gives you some extra cleaning.also replacement heads available at local dept stores in town.</li>
            <li>feel it helps get dry skin cells off easy.</li>
            <li>It makes my moisturizer work even better and harder than it would normally.  </li>
            <li>I break out less, my pores are visibly smaller, and I even find that makeup goes on more smoothly.</li>
            <li>First of all I bought Olay Professional Pro-X just to see how to really use the brush.</li>
            <li>Works well to clean skin deeply.</li>
            <li>For an extra treat once a week I use about 3 drops of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Peppermint Liquid Soap on the brush head and clean my face with it.</li>
            <li>I am still using the same products I was using before the olay pro-x, but apparently my skin is cleaner and the products seem to do their job better.  </li>
            <li>I simply soak the brush in vinegar and water solution for a squeaky clean disinfectant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the device to clean my face, neck and upper chest.  </li>
            <li>All my teenage children are using it to clean their skin, and reduce pimples.  </li>
            <li>brush is too soft, and the two speeds are pretty much</li>
            <li>The first few days you might break out more than you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li>This device is small, great for facial scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t shrink my pores, it does clean my face which is what I needed it for, since I workout a lot and hang around outside</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll keep using it for a deep clean.</li>
            <li>My pores are getting smaller by the day and my skin feels really clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember last time my face felt so clean.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and my skin is left with a clean shine.</li>
            <li>I had been using apricot srubs to get my face clean, but they started hurting my facial skin</li>
            <li>Seems to help deep clean the face</li>
            <li>(neutrogena deep clean face wash) It may be the face product and not the cleansing system that bothered me.</li>
            <li>and I can definitely tell a difference on how clean my skin is.  </li>
            <li>we really too lazy to scrub your own face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is small but really works for a nice face cleaning.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so clean, and it makes such a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li>It makes a big difference with how you clean your face</li>
            <li>My face feels clean - like that deep clean you feel after a facial.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t clean as deep with just your hands.</li>
            <li>With this product I am able to get soft and clean skin without having to drag a washcloth or bare hands across my face.</li>
            <li>Makes my pores smaller and my skin feel clean.  </li>
            <li>The rotating brush just doens&#x27;t seem to deep clean.  </li>
            <li>It does what its supposed to do which is clean out the pores and reduces acne, facial oil etc.</li>
            <li>Definitely gets a deeper clean than just washing with hands &amp; soap.</li>
            <li>A lot of people say that if you&#x27;re not going to go Clarisonic, don&#x27;t go at all, but I respectfully disagree--this product definitely improves the skin condition compared to my bare hands, and based on that alone</li>
            <li>For years I thought I was getting my face clean by just using my facial cleanser and my hands or a cloth</li>
            <li>and I needed something to clean deep into my pores.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first couple of weeks, my skin still looked calm and break-outs were somewhat reduced, but not totally eliminated.</li>
            <li>- this definitely works to get the skin clean.</li>
            <li>but I work outside and keeping my face clean stops breakouts of acne and pimples</li>
            <li>I will say I had a few more brake outs for the first week</li>
            <li>but there always seems to be make up on the brush (which just shows you how clean and deep</li>
            <li>) clean his face properly twice a day, and b) apply acne cream every night before bed.</li>
            <li>n clean with only one use, got rid of oil n dirt so well</li>
            <li>I spoke to an expert who said that I have &amp;#34;congested&amp;#34; pores and that I should use a facial brush to clean my face.</li>
            <li>i use it every 3 nights and it does feel deep clean after that.</li>
            <li>I use this once a day at night to help clean my skin from the daily impurities and my dermatologist approved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is the same principle, and as I mentioned as an exfoliator, all methods work as long as you are diligent, and know your skin type and how to exfoliate effectively without doing any damage.</li>
            <li>It does a good job for an average facial electronic cleaner</li>
            <li>A little instruction about how often to change the brush head would be nice, but I can live without it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using a good moisturizer after you cleanse your face, because my face got a little dry when I didn&#x27;t moisturize right after using it.      </li>
            <li>its still a nice product--just wish it was a little rougher!</li>
            <li>done for a FRACTION of the cost of the other higher end brands!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut down my getting ready for work by 12 minted from being nit picky, making sure makeup is evenly spread etc.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve found that if you have a place that&#x27;s more acne/blackhead prone, if you hold it still in that spot, it really gets down in the pores and cleans all of that out.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve found that if you have a place that&#x27;s more acne/blackhead prone, if you hold it still in that spot, it really gets down in the pores and cleans all of that out.</li>
            <li>The brush has two speeds which is nice because at first you will want to use the low speed until your skin gets used to the brush then in time you can go to the other speed if you wish.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t exfoliate every single day, I get blackheads on my nose very quickly.</li>
            <li>leaves your skin fresh clean and regenerated you can use it also with ever other face soap cleanser</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are wanting a gentle electrical brush for your face.  </li>
            <li>I use the high speed, which isn&#x27;t all that fast and works well.</li>
            <li>As described, fast shipping, high quality.</li>
            <li>I really like it and highly recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Still too early to tell if it works, but is very gentle and as I said, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I have never used the Clairsonic and really debated buying it, but the price tag was just too high</li>
            <li>well honestly I think I prefer my hand-held facial brush to this because this brush is just too soft and doesn&#x27;t seem to really make a difference in my exfoliating routine.</li>
            <li>I wash my face, usually with Morning Burst from Clean and Clear, or if I feel like splurging, Bliss fave wash is my favorite.</li>
            <li>So I am very particular with the skincare products I use and thankfully it pays off, I have clear smooth skin - aside from that week of the month, just working on ridding myself of some scars from my younger days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but literally after the first use, my skin looked healthier, more vibrant/less dull, and my fine lines on my forehead were definitely minimized.  </li>
            <li>this product really works---i live in the caribbean and get too much sun</li>
            <li>only bought the product because there was a special deal at the time and it was a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always a little leery to try new face products, but I&#x27;ve had good luck with Olay in the past (their regenerist moisturizer is awesome - and for those wondering, I use the products at acne-dot-org usually.</li>
            <li>Like so many other people I have been toying with the idea of buying a Clarisonic, but was turned off by the high price tag.</li>
            <li>I just wish the brush bristles was a little harder and more of the cleaning soultion :-)</li>
            <li>If you want more foam on your face just wet the brush head a little more.</li>
            <li>Requires very little cleanser to be effective.  </li>
            <li>This little powerful, handy brush has totally changed the skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>Then, I used the brush quickly across my whole face to get the cleaner all over, then went back over each part of my face and took some time to let the brush scrub on each area.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find that Amazon offered it for several dollars less.</li>
            <li>Acne products over dry my skin and are only minimally effective on my blackheads and pimples.  </li>
            <li>This is nice for those looking to shed some dry skin (gross, I know) and polish up their face.</li>
            <li>This product may only be half as good( for all</li>
            <li>but when my skin starts to dry and peel, it completely gets rid of it, and it cleans my face much better than by hands alone.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my skin has changed a LOT over the past 4 years (since becoming pregnant with my son).</li>
            <li>My dermatologist had told me that with my aging, my pores do tend to get bigger, but since the bristles being so soft and with the soft circular motion of the product, it will clean the pores much better and they can get smaller as well</li>
            <li>I mean, it cleaned my skin ok, and it was pretty cool since it was a natural sponge, but I needed something with oomph that provided results.</li>
            <li>My skin has been very smooth and fewer black spots on the nose now.</li>
            <li>My pores are much smaller, my skin is very soft and my make up goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>price goes down a little more and more people will love.&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof function is very simple to use and a comfortable shower.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a week, and I can already see positive changes in my skin that make this cleansing system worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got \\&quot;sucked into\\&quot; by a company&#x27;s  large marketing budget and the product doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>the device is good and the price is amazing, however watch out for some rash that may occur if used wrong or roughly.</li>
            <li>I coupled it with a benzoyl peroxide treatment, and for the first time in 15 years I have clear skin without the need for Accutane.</li>
            <li>Because my friend, it is exactly as pictured and I have also noticed my face getting clear.</li>
            <li>Beauty Alternatives You Need to Know]], which gave me extensive knowledge and insight as to why its so so important for your skin and body to be treated with gentle, all natural products.</li>
            <li>This product is small, lightweight, and fits nicely in your hand to operate.</li>
            <li>It does leave my face feeling soft and smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s too much abrasian for my facial skin.  </li>
            <li>$36 for the device, a full 6 oz. tube of the Olay Pro-X exfoliating cleanser, an extra brush head, and 2 batteries.</li>
            <li>The battery compartment was much easier to open than most reviewers reported, but that&#x27;s probably because I read all the way to the last paragraph of K. Sprite&#x27;s review, where she tells you how to do it.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to those who have sensitive skin and first time users.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I did my research and listened to about 20 reviews on youtube about this product and the clairsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that is normally very oily and prone to breakouts!  </li>
            <li>First, don&#x27;t use it every day if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but it came with extra brush heads and a full size cleansing gel.</li>
            <li>I was concerned at the reviews saying Clarisonic was better and this one was not worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is not the sort of product I would normally buy, but she is very into anti-aging, skin protection, night masks, etc.</li>
            <li>I had a really cheap Pretika brush that I bought at Rite Aid for only about $12 a few years ago, and even that one was better than this Olay brush.  </li>
            <li>It OK but not worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I am 24 years old, Caucasian, and have always had pretty acne-free skin.</li>
            <li>Its small so it doesnt take up space, yet it does its job nicely.</li>
            <li>ive been using other cleansing products, and they hurt my skin, but this works great~ would recommend this for people with thin and sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li>only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars is the two modes it has.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin do not use the cream on your face first..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure because of this product or my own skin care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other facial cleansing brushes out there that work just as well or maybe better, but this is the only one I have tried and for $20 who can complain.</li>
            <li>Spend five minutes clearing everything, Rinse brush with hot water every 1-2 minutes till complete.  </li>
            <li>2- Rinse brush thoroughly directly with hot water while on, takes 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>cleanser is okay, but not worth buying on</li>
            <li>But for me, I threw it away after it irritated my sensitive acne prone skin too much!</li>
            <li>I can use my Clarisonic brush on a daily basis, but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using this one more than a few times a week if I was using it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure if the Clarisonic cleansbetter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and portable which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I plan to buy it in full size when the generous \\&quot;trial size\\&quot; runs low.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I have it and am not disappointed enough to try to return it, but am definitely eagerly waiting until Olay comes out with different brush heads.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see my skin texture show visible improvement after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>Just wishing it was slightly bigger so that I know if I want to buy the full size or not.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This system is truely the only one to have!</li>
            <li>Working full time, nursing school full time and having twin toddler Grandbabies living in our home , a simple product pampers me daily!  </li>
            <li>I fill up my skin with hot water, rinse my face, dunk the brush, and apply the soap/cleanser directly to the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will get better results from an average wash cloth.</li>
            <li>okay but not exactly powerful.</li>
            <li>At the moment, I&#x27;m a 24 year old male who&#x27;s looking to clear my face up the most affordable way I can.</li>
            <li>6 weeks later my sample cleanser ran out and I ordered the full sized bottle.  </li>
            <li>so much better than just the average face cloth.</li>
            <li>Will probably be buying them their own facial brushes in the near future.</li>
            <li>I usually use my own scrub or face wash though.  </li>
            <li>It just does it no better than using an exfoliating cleanser on its own.</li>
            <li>This was no more effective than using a Buff Puff on my face.  </li>
            <li>For a low price, not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough on my face to use once a day at the end of the day and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I do not have major skin problems, I could see my results right away, but not everyonemight.</li>
            <li>i love olay products, and was hoping this one wouldn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li>so pressing down on it as you go over your face will not do any more for your skin.  </li>
            <li>But I love this thing and would buy another if it broker down.</li>
            <li>seems to make my skin feel softer and more radiant and also is helping me keep down any problems I may have with acne</li>
            <li>and I can only assume they mean 6X better than just splashing water on your face because I&#x27;ve gotten much better exfoliation with a washcloth or nylon sponge than this weakling can provide.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it cleaned it better than any other product ive used!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something that would have a little more kick to it, like other reviewers said this has more of a massaging effect as opposed to sort of a scrubbing effect like i hoped for</li>
            <li>Did a good job, price was right for the product advance cleaning system really works but is expensive combined with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li>The unsightly skin pigment problems on both my right and left cheeks (they are huge) are actually getting lighter.</li>
            <li>My previous exfoliating scrub did not get stellar reviews from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep skincare safety database and I have been trying to find replacement cosmetics/products that are safer but still effective.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased the Pro-X as I really like this little cleaning tool.</li>
            <li>I am in my 20&#x27;s and have dry, fair, sensitive skin with a minor case of rosacea.</li>
            <li>I am a little dissapointed with the brushes because they are kind of soft.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean the face well, but if you move the brush around too quickly, it hurts a little.</li>
            <li>I wish it spun a little quicker and more intensely, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>Just wish it had a little more power and didn&#x27;t go through batteries as fast as it seems to.</li>
            <li>Nice little face scrubber, except the sponges are really soft.  </li>
            <li>I let them know yesterday at around 10am, and by 12pm they had shipped me a new one!</li>
            <li>New fav face product!</li>
            <li>My face felt new!</li>
            <li>My new Must have product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a new page in my skin Bible!</li>
            <li>The Olay Cleansing System brought new meaning to cleansing!</li>
            <li>New world!</li>
            <li>Also, a great exfoliating scrub with good lotions (Arbonne again, folks) would prevent the need for a big old machine that goes into the shower to sand the skin as this product is being compared to--yikes that sounds like a lot of work and maybe even dangerous!</li>
            <li>just in the last month or so, even during hot, hot, hot AZ days, my skin hasn&#x27;t been nearly as oily as it had been before I started using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a soft, flat brush that rotates at two speeds, and it&#x27;s easy to turn on and off.  </li>
            <li>the bottom line for me is that I think it&#x27;s hard to beat a good old fashioned washcloth.</li>
            <li>I do not like it well enough to imagine that I would ever want to spend more on a better replacement down the road; but if I continue to like it, I&#x27;d probably purchase another Pro X when this one has spun its last spin.  </li>
            <li>I started using this on a every other day basis because sometimes my skin can get over-dry if I use a more powerful face wash, especially in the colder months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I did not spend more on the expensive \\&quot;other brand\\&quot; as I suspect I would see no difference with that one either.</li>
            <li>Works great, I also use it with my other facial routine and it works terrific.</li>
            <li>This brush takes care of the daily dead skin buildup and actually feels good as it does it!</li>
            <li>The whole point of exfoliating is to irritate the skin to turn over new cells and produce collagen.</li>
            <li>I really like my new Olay Cleansing System for it</li>
            <li>So, if your new to the whole brush thing.. I&#x27;d give this one a try before you overspend.</li>
            <li>I had been searching for a cleansing system and had researched many from the high priced on down.</li>
            <li>In less than a week I noticed a huge difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>Moisturizing products help my dry patches but make my pores look huge and, of course, increase my acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews (good &amp; bad) I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews (good &amp; bad) I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Cheap copy of the real Olay, minimal uses, plan on returning this item .</li>
            <li>My traumatic experiences involve one huge pimple on the chin or around the nose every now and then, but overall my skin is clear of acne.  </li>
            <li>In combination with the microdermabrasion kit I have seen reduction in fine lines and brown spots as well although I think most of that is due to the microdermabrasion kit not the Pro-X. I have seen other people mention concerns about the battery compartment, but I did not have issues with the batteries to get started (have not had to change them yet).</li>
            <li>I would recommend more or less holding the product still and letting it do the work as you move it over your face (versus also moving your hand around, which I have an inclination to do).</li>
            <li>but it is easy to do so be careful while using because the brush spins and is abrasive.</li>
            <li>I found that less is more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had less breakouts, a brighter complexion, and better cleansing with this</li>
            <li>I tried difference pressures, and less is more.  </li>
            <li>I figure I&#x27;ll spend less time once my skin gets better.</li>
            <li>worked ok for less than 7 months.  </li>
            <li>Work your way up; less is more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use less makeup now because I don&#x27;t have to worry about covering up blemishes.</li>
            <li>I love the way it works, but I use it in the shower (never fully submerged in water) and I have to replace it every year to a year and a half.</li>
            <li>I bought this product more in hopes of keeping my face cleaner and in hopes of getting rid of black heads.</li>
            <li>and I use Clean and Clear&#x27;s Truly Gentle Facial Wash in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In other words, you need this machine to clean your skin!</li>
            <li>Less is more with manual exfoliation.</li>
            <li>It cleans my face better, so I am less oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and I love the slight flush it leaves on my skin</li>
            <li>Great for using once or twice a week, be careful not to over-exfoliate as it will exacerbate any trouble spots.</li>
            <li>Maybe it doesn&#x27;t have the power needed to make a difference in my particular case.</li>
            <li>I had considered buying a more expensive model, but glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li>I also use it with a mild facial soap.  </li>
            <li>Getting older is hell...</li>
            <li>I am a male a manly male and I always make sure to hide this thing in my shower when I have company over</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s main advantage over Clarisonic</li>
            <li>My skin is ultra smooth and soft, I am already seeing a difference after only one week of use.</li>
            <li>its been only a week, but i love it, my blackheads are gone, my pores are smaller</li>
            <li>The Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System product does not achieve any deep cleansing.  </li>
            <li>My skin was decent and had no acne, until I started using this cleansing system.</li>
            <li>Improvement in skin, particularly around areas without a bony palette underneath, like my cheeks.</li>
            <li>However, now that I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>Not as goot as the main brand</li>
            <li>It removes all dead, flakey skin and leaves my skin looking fresh and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I made this purchase mainly for the brush.</li>
            <li>(I will also update my review if I see a decent improvement.)</li>
            <li>Its a nice soft brush that sloughs off any dead skin.</li>
            <li>This is a decent quality spinner-scrubber.</li>
            <li>I mainly want my skin to look healthier rather than oily-flaky in places.  </li>
            <li>Love it and saw a big difference in my skin shortly after I started using it.  </li>
            <li>The S. Lucci had a larger buffer and cleansing wheel, but this smaller one is better.  </li>
            <li>The main differences are: this system takes batteries (not rechargeable), does not include a case, brush head spins in a circle as opposed to back-and-forth.</li>
            <li>Okay, I just had a facial last week where they used the Clarisonic on my face.  </li>
            <li>While I have no comparison with the two, this for me, was a decent choice.</li>
            <li>I initially researched a Clarisonic, but saw this and figured it was better to spend $20 and possibly not like it, than take the risk of spending $150 on a Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any real facial problems but those aforementioned are making my skin look better</li>
            <li>After I did every part of my face, I rinsed my face and the brush, and then turned the brush on the low setting and went back over my face one more time and rinsed.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt smoother or cleaner, and I have tried so many different facial cleansers in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, when using be sure to get all the extra water out if you rinse before putting it back on your face.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer mentioned that the Olay device doesn&#x27;t do \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; (jittery) cleansing, but only spins (btw, be sure to pin your hair back or it can get caught in the spin!).</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has begun to have breakouts and flaky skin.  </li>
            <li>and it would take a lot more deep cleaning for them to appear smaller).</li>
            <li>I decided mainly because of the cost to go with Olay.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has begun to have breakouts and flaky skin.</li>
            <li>I tried it with a harsher exfoliant and it had a similar result, but made my face a lot more red temporarily.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, although I would caution you to have realistic expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a useful product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this thing and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I finally just started using my own cream with crushed apricot seeds in it.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m only a Italian girl :-) )</li>
            <li>but the unit quickly lost power and then would only work sporadically.</li>
            <li>they actually became so much more smaller!</li>
            <li>I have been keeping it in the shower for 3 weeks now and it has quickly become part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li>but I suppose it&#x27;s decent for its price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also older.  </li>
            <li>and it worked well with him even though it was made for use for targeted older people for aging.</li>
            <li>Does a decent job.</li>
            <li>I use the sensitive Olay cleanser and success so far.  </li>
            <li>However, I bought myself just the regular CVS brand facial brush, and there are more speeds on it than this one.</li>
            <li>I think of these face brushes as giant sonic toothbrushes with softer bristles: You use the sonic toothbrushes because it cleans the plague off your teeth better than regular brushes!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the more expensive versions, but I can&#x27;t imagine they would work much better than this.</li>
            <li>This device is decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned the more expensive type to compare it to, but I love it.</li>
            <li>and if all else fails i will be more confident in the clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I am a 32 year old woman with 3 kids who really has never had much of a regimen.</li>
            <li>I use the softer setting on my face and particularly the nose area, while the faster setting i use on my neck area.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Not much doesn&#x27;t affect it without having some kind of red sploshes coming up.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews before purchasing this product and decided to try it instead of purchasing the more expensive brand, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and also find that the makeup (I only put makeup on occasionally) actually stay on better.</li>
            <li>In the several weeks that I have been using this product, at least 5 or 6 people have commented on how great my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>but actually it does a good job at teasing awat dead skin and ingrained dirt.</li>
            <li>My main moisturizer is coconot oil.</li>
            <li>I love this face brush, I&#x27;m amazed I&#x27;ve had the same one for possibly five years.</li>
            <li>Glad I settled for this instead of a more expensive brand.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m going back to a Clarisonic - costs way too much, but at this point it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, it does do a decent job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels so soft and smooth after using this so overall</li>
            <li>My skin is getting older and this seems to keep it fresher looking.</li>
            <li>I wonder how much better the expensive versions can be (even though I love it, could never bring myself to spend $199 on &#x27;those&#x27;).</li>
            <li>I have never used the more expensive product, but why spend $100 when this product for $30 is getting the job done :)</li>
            <li>I think this is because the exfoliation allows my moisturizer to sink more deeply into my skin, so it&#x27;s overall moisture level has</li>
            <li>I love using it, but have now cut it back to using it only in the evenings when washing away my make-</li>
            <li>I got this brush because I figured as I was getting older</li>
            <li>: price, decent quality, waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>This product is a decent one for the price I paid, however I had some issues...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine getting any better results with the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>I thought this might be to harsh on my skin, but it seems more gentle than a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>give this review as a warning to others that it may not be what your particular skin</li>
            <li>and it was great, tingly almost irritatingly ticklish, but for the price this Pro-X is the clear winner.</li>
            <li>I am an older woman</li>
            <li>I mainly use the Olay Pro X to remove any makeup my makeup remover towelettes didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>Experiment with the amount your particular skin texture needs.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a month now and really like the soft brush to exfoliate gently.  </li>
            <li>I use both in the shower daily and it is such a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>it is useful to clear your old skin.</li>
            <li>This device is better than the Clarisonic for several reasons (1) it&#x27;s smaller (2)</li>
            <li>For the cost, this seems to be a decent cleansing system.  </li>
            <li>uses this SUPER ULTRA BIG Box.</li>
            <li>The most effect I&#x27;ve seen is in my décollete, which definitely looks brighter and clearer than when I was using a basic shower pouf to cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i happen to be one of the litlle older gals around</li>
            <li>SO glad I didn&#x27;t fork over money for the more expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I figured I could replicate the same discipline by making sure my son did 2 simple things: a</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, I heard the much more expensive Clairsonic is a much better product.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after using this but do find that if I use it daily (as recommended) that I break out with big under the skin pimples in places that I never used to get them.</li>
            <li>Like that it is smaller than most chargeable facial brushes.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>It is so affordable and works better than the more expensive cleansing systems that are advertised.</li>
            <li>If one can get a knock-off, such as that sold at CVS/pharmacy, for a meaningfully different price, then that knock-off might be the better buy.  </li>
            <li>main reason for a 5-star review is that I paid $28 on Amazon, then saw it in Rite-Aid for $59.99.</li>
            <li>I did my research before purchasing and the main downsides to this product seem to be that it takes batteries instead of recharging-</li>
            <li>decent pricing.</li>
            <li>With the discount and coupon, I opted for this one recently - and I&#x27;m so glad I finally gave in!</li>
            <li>This particular product was recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation effect relies mainly on the grainy particles in the cleanser rather than an aggressive rotation of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came without cleanser,  which wouldn&#x27;t have been a super big deal, but the power of cleaning and flimsy brush head made me return it.</li>
            <li>But for $20 compared to $200 for the expensive product this is a good one, and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I use a variety of different cleansers, some are foamy, some exfoliating (spelled?), and some are super moisturized.</li>
            <li>Considering the outstanding results and the cost, I would recommend this to ANY female for daily use.</li>
            <li>Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and the spinning is very light on your skin, I was looking for something a little rougher to really exfoliate</li>
            <li>I bought this thing because I have a major issue with white gunk accumulating in the pores of my nose, which over the years have increased in size and are easily clogged.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and gently on the skin.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and gently on the skin.</li>
            <li>As I said before the Clarisonic is very different and definitely feels like a high end luxury product, but I couldn&#x27;t stop wondering if it was really a better product than the Pro-X.</li>
            <li>I wish you could reverse the spin, and have a more customizable speed setting, the low and high is has just isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>Cleaning my face very softly, like it so much.</li>
            <li>Ten days of using this and there has been zero redness or irritation from its use, and my skin is smooth as silk and best of all,  no more flakes or dry rough patches.  </li>
            <li>Immediate positive results after two days (smoother skin), but took 2-3 weeks for the residual acne to clear up.</li>
            <li>I would recommend rinsing thoroughly after every use, don&#x27;t use it for too many minutes because it&#x27;ll make your face raw, and don&#x27;t use it more times daily than your skin can handle because that will also make your skin raw and when it gets raw it produces more oil which causes more acne.</li>
            <li>This is really helping clear up my face and it hasn&#x27;t even been a week of using it yet!</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin pretty smooth, and flake-free (especially since I use the microderm and chemical peels at home), and I do think it has helped (along with the AHA products I&#x27;ve recently started using) with excess oil -</li>
            <li>The other product has more &#x27;stuff&#x27;, like a delicate brush for sensitive skin, which might be nice to have, but I&#x27;ve found that if you&#x27;re gentle with it</li>
            <li>Works great, wish the bristles were a little bit harsher but definitely helped my skin a ton and left it very exfoliated.</li>
            <li>I love this little brush - the little motor could be more powerful so that there is no drag on it when you apply it to your face.  </li>
            <li>I do wish the brush was a little wider, and had a timer for each area of the face like the other one I tried, but it&#x27;s a great option for the price.</li>
            <li>Overall very glad I purchased this instead of a much more expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>used the Clarsonic when it was first popular, a few years back.</li>
            <li>Motor has 2 speeds; not very fast, but gentle enough to use more frequently than the higher speed models.</li>
            <li>Just ordered a new one because the old one was getting pretty yucky with mold and it wasn&#x27;t cleaning up as it used to.</li>
            <li>Just gently rock the bottom part left and right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive enough that it tends to turn red and irritated with most scrubbing products, but using super gentle products (such as Cetaphil) doesn&#x27;t touch the oil.</li>
            <li>Such a gentle exfoliator that lifts that dirt right off of the skin.</li>
            <li>At 38 years old my skin obviously doesn&#x27;t look as fresh or bright as it one did, so I wanted this brush to help with my dull complexion.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd one, I really like it, I purchased the 3rd one for our home overseas since I was not able to find one like this there, its just perfect, not to harsh, its nice and soft  but its enough to brighten your skin every day in the shower.</li>
            <li>Not only do the bristles clean the face, but they help in removing dead skin cells and promoting circulation and the growth of healthy new cells.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I bought it about a year or so ago and used it on high and it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for this line.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>high recommend if you don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on a product like this.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m getting older, I discovered that I needed to do a little more to reduce signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>use it about 2 to 3 times a week, mainly because it takes a little more time in the shower when i use this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to give something 5 stars unless I absolute love it and it has changed my life in a million positive ways.</li>
            <li>Product is as effective as the other high price systems would definitely recommend to a friend</li>
            <li>I still have to go in and manually clean them out but not nearly as often as I did before the brush.</li>
            <li>The Olay cleanser has a strange smell and does not get my skin that clean.</li>
            <li>And I love that there&#x27;s literally no clean up.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this because it works great and was way less expensive.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers have said, do not use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to pack for travel and really cleans my face without making it dry or tight.</li>
            <li>The high speed is what I keep it on, but it seems it could be a little better.</li>
            <li>Sure there are a few things you will get with a more expensive brand, but if you are looking for an inexpensive facial cleansing brush that does a great job-look no further.</li>
            <li>I do believe that the brush coupled with my cleanser and exfoliator really penetrate deep to allow for the most clean, blank canvas, enabling the other products to do their thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly, in my experience, almost all the products I love and rely on get discontinued, or reappear as some new, improved version - at twice the price and half the capability.  </li>
            <li>I love this little machine.</li>
            <li>We both love this little cleaner.</li>
            <li>so I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews that said that it can cause more acne because it can irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li>The clogged pores are maybe a little better off, though it&#x27;s nothing</li>
            <li>As stated, I think this allows for a better skin cleansing than the little manually operated brushes.</li>
            <li>I love this little gadget.  </li>
            <li>I tried it immediately with the sample cleanser provided, and felt that it was a little better than washing with your fingers.</li>
            <li>This is nothing more than a little spinning brush head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest making the bristles a little more sturdy and the brush needs to rotate in both directions.</li>
            <li>It gets rid of all the little imperfections and my skin has never looked brighter or as healthy.  </li>
            <li>I think the product needs to have a little more speed to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 and a buff puff is much more exfoliating than this little gizmo.  </li>
            <li>Now on my fourth week of daily use, I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li>The little manual brush does a better job.  </li>
            <li>I love this little brush.</li>
            <li>so i may be a little more picky,</li>
            <li>was expecting little more from O&#x27;lay.</li>
            <li>BUT, I can say that I love his little thing, and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need a clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I wanted a little more power.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling so soft afterwards!!</li>
            <li>This is the first battery powered facial brush I&#x27;ve owned, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other types,but I&#x27;m pleased with the way it cleans my face.  </li>
            <li>(A little history, my skin although not terrible is prone to cystic type pimples sometimes)  </li>
            <li>I have had this product for a little more than a month</li>
            <li>He needed something a little more for his acne.  </li>
            <li>But I love this little brush.  </li>
            <li>While I wish it was a little more abrasive, this allows for using it day and night.</li>
            <li>this little cleanser does and outstanding job at both cleansing and exfoliating.</li>
            <li>and WOW .. it&#x27;s like I never washed my face before !!</li>
            <li>A LITTLE MORE FRISKY - THE BRISTLES, THAT IS.  </li>
            <li>But all in all I love this little device.</li>
            <li>Thought it would have a little more power</li>
            <li>My face feels very clean after using, but sometimes a little dry, so I will apply a light moisturizer afterwards as needed.  </li>
            <li>I bought the cleansing system to help get my skin CLEAR and get that deep clean it suggests it does.  </li>
            <li>Those of you who want to actually scrub or clean your face should not waste your money.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and soft, I did not want to invest $200 on a facial brush and this one does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have ever had my facial skin so clean and so radiant and looking so young.  </li>
            <li>To me, that is ridiculous to spend that much on a cleansing brush, when you can get a nice one or $21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus the back of the sponge tore and opened up where I held it to clean my face (no mechanism to hold it, since it&#x27;s a natural sponge.)</li>
            <li>360 Clean, Deep Exfoliating Scrub, Natural Apricot Beads.  </li>
            <li>but I love the clean feeling the brush leaves behind.</li>
            <li>I use it with different facial cleansers and it leaves my skin very clean and soft but hasn&#x27;t helped with acne too much yet.</li>
            <li>When I first got this, the bristles seemed totally weak and like they wouldn&#x27;t do much to deep clean at all, I&#x27;m so used to scrubbing my face with abrasive stuff, but it really cleans and exfoliates deeply and effectively while being really gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>I like how this has a normal and high speed button</li>
            <li>Very affordable compared to many other brands and work as good as expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to dry it</li>
            <li>My pores are visibly smaller, my skin is much clearer and the fine wrinkles that just recently started to develop on my lower cheeks have all but dissappeared.  </li>
            <li>The batteries are easy to get to and change despite other postings.</li>
            <li>The combs that vome with it is kind of hard</li>
            <li>so I used it a couple more times, but I am still highly dissatisfied and feel like I wasted my money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your face really does feel cleaner (I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;6 times&amp;#34; cleaner) and that makes me think that my other products just work better if they&#x27;re actually getting down more in my pores.  </li>
            <li>Nice to see that it really works, but gross to see how little is removed by using a cleanser and no brush.</li>
            <li>(at night) becoz i do find using it twice is a little too much for my own skin, but i guess everyone is different.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain, is gentle yet tough on makeup and cleans pores like nothing else.</li>
            <li>Since I am only using it half the time, I am really glad I did not pay a lot for it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for both young and old!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 65; and this has cleaned my skin, left the live skin soft and clean enoughh to moisturize, and now beginning</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft which is probably good for me because I have a tendency to scrub my face very hard and causing dryness and what not.</li>
            <li>It refreshed my face, getting rid of old skin and made moisturizing much easier.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m almost 30) and so far my skin seems so much clearer.  </li>
            <li>these are great and not too expensive.</li>
            <li>It works very well, is quite soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin.  </li>
            <li>There is just something nice/luxurious about gently working the soft brush around your skin</li>
            <li>The cleanser is also gentle on my sensitiive, mature (47 yr.old)</li>
            <li>I felt the head lasted longer when kept clean and dry between use.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using the brush, I have noticed that my skin is considerably softer and much cleaner than before...</li>
            <li>This really made my skin soft.</li>
            <li>What I did not like was that the brush head was so extremely soft that I found it wasnt doing much exfoliation, even after a week of every day use.</li>
            <li>Your skin will hateyou for scrubbing it like a metal pot, rather than gently exfoliating it with a soft bristle brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are soft and not irritating to my skin</li>
            <li>I did not find it to be very helpful for my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I just need to be careful not to put pressure, just lightly buff the skin like scrub.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I was very worried about trying it out because I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro X cleaning device offers a soft-bristle brush that rotates at two speeds offering gentle cleansing and exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are soft and is really gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not as intense as the Mia, my skin is every bit as soft and radiant with the ProX.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I still have to use an exfoliation pad occasionally to remove old rough skin, but this does an amazing job at deep-cleaning.  </li>
            <li>so my once soft skin is so much drier and flakier than it used to be</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and gentle also and does the motion for you.  </li>
            <li>The sample they sent cruds up the brush and doesn&#x27;t work very well to clear pores.</li>
            <li>works really well so far...</li>
            <li>4- Pat face dry (preferably on fairly clean towel)  </li>
            <li>pat face dry with clean cloth</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s too much for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product so far</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but the Clarisonic feels very aggressive.</li>
            <li>and I think the replacement brushes are not that cheap either - they go for roughly $5 a brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how much I like</li>
            <li>It has really helped clear up my acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Brush is so soft on the face..and it really cleans.  </li>
            <li>It removes everything but is still gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This brush rotates at two speed settings and the bristles are soft and gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy an expensive model, this one works great and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised at how much cleaner</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin is much smoother and brighter since I started using this brush.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that I don&#x27;t need to wear as much foundation because my skin is so clear and even.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and have frequent crusty patches on my face . . .</li>
            <li>There are two speeds, I don&#x27;t use the lower speed much because I feel it&#x27;s too soft for my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear, and my pores are so much unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear, and my pores are so much unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>I own the more expensive Clarisonic facial brush and swear by it.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I wish that it had a more powerful setting but that is probably not good for your skin.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin feel really clean and moisterized(considering that i have really dry skin).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wont go like wow fast its powered by 2 AA batteries</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it more than a few months and the spinning brush will not stay on the handle for more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li>I had a Nutrasonic (very similar to Clarisonic and cheaper at $89) that worked great before it quit a short few months after I bought it.</li>
            <li>It does feel really nice on the face and the brush is soft, I have never tried a Clarasonic so not sure how it stands up.</li>
            <li>i use it before going to bed and noticed my skin looking a lot better in just a few days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, it&#x27;s been almost a month, and long story short, I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin and have been using this Pro-X cleansing system for about a week.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my skin could handle something more harsh.  </li>
            <li>Even though I still own both, because the Conair&#x27;s brush is too rough, I  only use the Olay until I find one that has the Conair&#x27;s mechanics and a brush that&#x27;s NOT as soft as the Olay&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>For Normal to Oily Skin,</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s a big difference and worth the splurge.</li>
            <li>like I had narrowly escaped a hurricane &amp; was finally safe in my underground shelter.</li>
            <li>Probably better than my harsh rubbing of my face.</li>
            <li>I recently determined part of the problem is my skin just doesn&#x27;t slough off well enough, or quickly enough on its own.</li>
            <li>I tried the brush for about 2 months, at first it was doing good, but in the end it only enflammed my acne more and caused me to have painful breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have been using it twice a day (in the mornings with my normal cleanser)</li>
            <li>My face is looking better then ever and after just a few times using this product, I can tell the difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Normal or oily maybe 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with the Olay Pro X though.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>one-third the size of the Clarisonic and not even powerful enough to use as a shoe polisher.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few months now, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>In the end, I will use it a few more times to see if the results are improving my texture or not.  </li>
            <li>deposit themselves after a normal day.</li>
            <li>Then I use the brush and a soap that contains sulfur to penetrate deep into my pores and kill the bacteria that cause acne, then lastly I use Olay&#x27;s pH balanced Pro-X cleanser which leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated and.... balanced :).</li>
            <li>What she has been doing is using the battery operated brush to apply her normal skin care regimen</li>
            <li>for a few $$$ more, but when I saw it featured here, I had to have it.  </li>
            <li>It brings  the blood to your skin for a healthy glow and exfoliates dead skin, all the while rejuvenating your skin.  </li>
            <li>I used my normal cleanser, not the Olay cleanser</li>
            <li>so worth it, everyone in my family with their different skin uses it and loves it.&lt;br /&gt;GET</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s normal or an exception.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I actually feel that the Olay does just as good a job if not a better job on my skin than the the Clarsonic did.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, not bad, suggested to purchase the brush head replacement together, this old version only comes with one brush head.</li>
            <li>Directly after, the first time that I used the PROx (Olay Professional)</li>
            <li>the brush died a few days ago and I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to re-start.</li>
            <li>Using this system leaves your skin glowing and fresh from daily exfoliation.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic is a bit bulkier and more heavy duty.</li>
            <li>I like using it with my normal skin care products as well as the Olay wash</li>
            <li>I really love the device and use it everyday with another cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Wash first with a gentle non-foaming facial cleanser (without the brush).</li>
            <li>My skin has always had these bumps that were not pimples or allergies that were basically a normal thing for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it just for the normal cleaning</li>
            <li>I am near 40, have pretty clear skin, and have tried both the Clairsonic and the Olay product.  </li>
            <li>I use MAC Pro Longwear foundation, and it does not come off with normal makeup remover.</li>
            <li>and I like this product, cleans my face and removes flaky dead skin cells better than hand washing.</li>
            <li>There are two speeds, the low speed isn&#x27;t even worth using.</li>
            <li>This cleansing system is gentler than a wash cloth, but powerful like a facial.</li>
            <li>the sample provided a few times a week and my skin is looking much better.</li>
            <li>so I am using the product I normally use and it works just as well.  </li>
            <li>so my face looks fresh &amp; I only use this at night to take off my makeup</li>
            <li>As soon as you use it - especially the first time - you can really feel the blood circulating in your face.  </li>
            <li>If you have normal skin, I think you will like this product.</li>
            <li>I feel like it is also making my skin more firm.</li>
            <li>I would say it has only two speeds and neither are powerful.</li>
            <li>I used my normal cleanser, not the Olay cleanser</li>
            <li>the brush is soooo soft and the equipment so small and handy.</li>
            <li>I have used it a few times, and I see it more as a novelty than a must have tool.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel any smoother with this than my normal routine.</li>
            <li>For several months I weighed buying a Clarisonic system; however, I was concerned about the costs and whether it was worth the splurge.  </li>
            <li>I have never tried the far more expensive Clarins brush, but I cannot imagine any better results.  </li>
            <li>and if you have normal skin, like myself, I don&#x27;t need to use the cleansing brush every night.</li>
            <li>I switch between using my normal face wash with it and using the olay exfoliator that came with it to prevent &amp;#34;overdoing it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>not as many breakouts i think it&#x27;s because i&#x27;m not touching my face as much to wash it.</li>
            <li>I got this because I wasn&#x27;t getting all of the makeup off of my face with just the normal face cloth and soap.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find that to be worth all that extra money.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it everyday before bed.</li>
            <li>It good to help with daily cleaning, I am not sure the durability of the brush.</li>
            <li>, I get one or two normal pimples when I use products that don&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
            <li>I found the Olay cleaning system to be a lot more harsh on the skin than the clairsonic.  </li>
            <li>The Clarisonic was so harsh that it seemed to irritate my skin more.</li>
            <li>but she has normal skin that is not prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I get more  dead skin with my finger tips than this brush ,  </li>
            <li>Normally use it once a day for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>She uses it everyday and her complextion is getting much better.</li>
            <li>The faster speed may be two harsh on the face but is ok on the body.</li>
            <li>I washed my face like I normally do</li>
            <li>over your normal skin</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the Clarisonic one, but having normal skin</li>
            <li>My pores look so tiny, and I rarely have breakouts.</li>
            <li>My daughter has a more expensive brand that does scrub harder, but this unit does a good job and is affordable.</li>
            <li>They have quite a few interesting cleansers that I&#x27;m experimenting with.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally get a lot of pimples...</li>
            <li>and you can use it with your normal face wash.</li>
            <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t waste $200+ on it.</li>
            <li>And the motor is nice and slow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally good at stuff like this (think lots of kid toys with batteries), but it took my about 15 frustrating minutes to get them in, plus using a kitchen knife!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 25, I have had pretty good skin my whole life, the last couple years it&#x27;s been getting progressively worse), so I got this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the exfoliator that it comes with</li>
            <li>If you have young, oily, blackhead-prone skin or need major exfoliation, this probably isn&#x27;t strong enough for you.  </li>
            <li>I had been driving several hours in hot Texas with the top down on my convertible and, of course, came home to a peeling forehead.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to hold and comes with a sample size of Olay exfoliant, which is very gentle and has small beads.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t as great as I expected, I mean it cleans my face, but I honestly don&#x27;t really feel the difference?</li>
            <li>Prior to using the Pro-X, I&#x27;ve vacillated between using my fingertips with a pricey cleaner (never seemed to really clean that deeply) and a washcloth with a cheaper facial cleaner (cheaper stuff because the washcloth soaks up a lot of cleaner), which feels like a deeper clean.    </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ll give it a 9/10, if only because it&#x27;s super scrubby, far too much for my sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li>I now have nice soft skin that helps slow down the aging process &amp; all at a reasonable cost!!!!</li>
            <li>I also use the system on my arms because at 60 yrs old, I now have &amp;#34;crepe&amp;#34; skin - my arms are the only place that really shows my age right now.  </li>
            <li>With dead cells removed regularly and better utilization of the skin products, it should be right for my routine.  </li>
            <li>Any other cleanser is perfectly fine, as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li>In addition, my skin looks brighter due to the fine exfoliation it provides.   </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and at times the first speed is a bit rough.</li>
            <li>Hardly no spin at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s not hard to find and follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this with the cleanser it comes with and my other one (clearasil) and both works fine with the device.</li>
            <li>the brush is not hard at all.</li>
            <li>(seriously, not remotely hard at all, was like changing batteries in anything else)  </li>
            <li>I like the brush a lot, and it&#x27;s not hard on the skin at all.</li>
            <li>I had a huge cluster of really small, microscopic pustule-like texture right under my lower lip that also seems to be disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin with large pores, and as I get older my pores are getting bigger.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to not irritate my sensitive skin but it really seems to deep clean quite well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s better for me to use it longer on the T-zone and only superficial on the rest of my face; otherwise my face tends to get dry.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the best part: I&#x27;ve broken out less.</li>
            <li>It was easy to understand how to properly use and the batteries seem to last.</li>
            <li>I had gone to a dermatologist and all they ever recommend is Retin-A, a mild wash,  and to come in regularly to have them professionally removed which is by no means</li>
            <li>The entire Pro X line is hypoallergenic and I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>only made the dry skin stand out even more.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first because of the low price, but after reading so many great reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Some of the other more powerful units out there are just to rough on skin that is</li>
            <li>Nice and soft bristles unlike other similar systems.</li>
            <li>I mean it&#x27;s still a nice product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and gentle on sensitive skin, but does a thorough job of cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Yes definitely as the price is right.</li>
            <li>I am trying two different products right now.</li>
            <li>The head is just about the right toughness, it&#x27;s simple to use.</li>
            <li>I will say that I purchased this several months ago and right off the bat</li>
            <li>To a certain degree it does feel a little on the cheaply constructed side.</li>
            <li>SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]]</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t rely on other reviews to choose products but when I was looking to buy something I had never used before, I read many reviews before deciding to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see a big difference in the texture of my skin the very first day.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine how my skin will look in a few more weeks!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it&#x27;s going to last like my old one did, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The Olay Professional Pro-X is just as good-if not better-than the high priced and highly recommended Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I will say that I have normal to combination skin and don&#x27;t know how well this would work for someone with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive normal skin</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference between the low and high settings.</li>
            <li>My sister has a much more expensive one but this one works just as good as her more expensive one.  </li>
            <li>Tonight, before taking off ANY of my make up off, I used the pro x for the first time with my alpha hydrox foaming face wash (also used for the first time)and boy, my face was glowing after I patted it dry!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a need to but a more expensive one this is just fine.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t moved to the more expensive ones because this one works just fine for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and the rotation of the spinning is just right, enough to give basically a massage with some exfoliation without overdoing</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use the Olay cleaner that came with this cleaning system ( I have sensitive acne prone skin), but I absolutely love the brush, its small, so its easier to clean near the nose, and the bristles are very soft, and the speed isn&#x27;t too massively high like with the Clarisonic, so I don&#x27;t feel its too abrasive for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying the cleaning product, but I will definitely be buying the brush replacements, I do wish they did sell the brush by itself, I am planning on buying this for Christmas for some people,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I did see a difference in my skin, probably due to the light exfoliating effect and the thorough cleansing.</li>
            <li>Really the only downside I find to this brush is that it would be nice to have a cover or case to keep the brush head protected, but since it is so small, I can use a makeup case.</li>
            <li>.. just wish it would fit other heads like the microderm one...</li>
            <li>If you are willing to make an investment and think a brush for your face is something worth springing for, go for the more expensive brand.p it just for that.  </li>
            <li>If you are willing to make an investment and think a brush for your face is something worth springing for, go for the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>But other than the sound, it works well.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap little brush by Olay that is very overpriced.  </li>
            <li>I recently was the recipient of a very generous gift - a full blown spa facial.</li>
            <li>My face has been break-out free in the couple months since I&#x27;ve started using this (every other day).</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is cheap than other shop.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a fantastic product</li>
            <li>I first bought this in January 2011, not long after they were released.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice little wake-up to scrub your face a bit with it (the same reason I sometimes like to use body scrub in the AM) and get the blood flowing.</li>
            <li>I liked this when I first bought it, but got lazy and didn&#x27;t use it for a long time.</li>
            <li>I use it with a Neutrogena pore refining cream, to get something a little bit more natural.</li>
            <li>I thought the bottle of soap that came with it would be a little bigger, but I used my own soap anyways.</li>
            <li>and my pores are smaller and more clear than they&#x27;ve been in a long time.</li>
            <li>This cleansing system is great--the brush is soft, not abrasive, &amp; makes your skin feel slightly tingly &amp; very clean.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how this has so many high reviews.</li>
            <li>wear a full set of makeup (foundation, concealer, loose powder &amp; etc.)</li>
            <li>and the brush still looks new.</li>
            <li>I might just get a new one when the batteries die.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll purchase the new Clinique one and try that one out.  </li>
            <li>Instead of running out to buy a new Clarisonic I saw this at Walgreens and picked it up.</li>
            <li>Order on Amazon if you don&#x27;t live close to Walmart.</li>
            <li>My skin is peeling a bit from a new retinol product</li>
            <li>so I might get a new one.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay another 100+ for a new one, so I decided to buy Olay.</li>
            <li>Also, I know new things can irritate the skin</li>
            <li>You can live without it, BUT it does make your life easier.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>In the meantime I still haven&#x27;t purchased a new brush and I&#x27;m waiting on the check.</li>
            <li>I live in Italy and...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new products.  </li>
            <li>A new must-have for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a forty-something with relatively new issues with acne, which was resistant to run-of-the-mill cleansers.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe the batteries had died, but new batteries didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Brand new batteries.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather spend $200 on some new shoes or clothes.  </li>
            <li>im new to this</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this cleansing system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it about a year though, and I need a new one</li>
            <li>replaced the two AA batteries with new ones.</li>
            <li>i cant live without it now..</li>
            <li>it prevented new acne from occurring and it helped cleaned my face in maximum of 2 days (using this product 3 times a day)1.Morning, 2.Evening, 3.before sleeping.</li>
            <li>Then with the new batteries it wouldn&#x27;t spin unless I spun it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to purchase any new cleansing cream yet, but I think I can use my Mary Kay cleanser since</li>
            <li>So while I&#x27;ll probably never use it on my face again, it has found a new life.</li>
            <li>After calling Olay, they said that it was not supposed to be there and sent me a voucher to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I also wear an SPF product under my moisturizer during the day to prevent sun damage to the new layer of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>new batteries did not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am just going to rush to the store and buy me a new one.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and it gets windy here</li>
            <li>(4 uses and it needed 2 new batts)</li>
            <li>I tried brand new batteries</li>
            <li>So now that is my new regiment...</li>
            <li>I can probably live without it and just stick to my exfoliator cleansers but for the price why not use it.</li>
            <li>got a get a new one soon.</li>
            <li>I tried new batteries but with no luck.</li>
            <li>(cost wise, with shipping, I&#x27;ll receive hardly anything back, but I would just throw it away otherwise).  </li>
            <li>Maybe I need to use it more, but like I said, with no directions, it&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s too much or too</li>
            <li>Other then that I like how soft the brush is, how easy it is to use, does not tear up my skin, and it has softened my forehead wrinkles</li>
            <li>4 months n going strong), my old acne scars are quickly going away and it really does get out all the grime &amp; make up that normal face washing leaves behind.  </li>
            <li>The clarisonic is much more gentle and doesn&#x27;t rotate, it vibrates which cleans deep down without upsetting your skin.  </li>
            <li>comes with batteries, just as good as the super expensive ones!</li>
            <li>This is like sandpaper but much rougher which I know because I actually use sandpaper (a very fine grain) to buff dead skin and unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first skincare product where I&#x27;ve actually noticed a physical difference right away.</li>
            <li>have since ordered more than 30 sets of the same product due to highly demand by her friends.</li>
            <li>but it has helped clear my skin up at least 90% which is amazing.</li>
            <li>Seriously, just buy it, it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>Black head all removed easily and my T zone not as oily as before.</li>
            <li>In a short week I have seen such a huge difference in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it for one week 2 times daily I noticed a huge difference in the size of my pores and the overall texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>My huge pores on my nose have definitely gotten smaller using this.</li>
            <li>Of course, I don&#x27;t wet the unit and I turn away from the spray of the shower to clean my face.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I don&#x27;t wet the unit and I turn away from the spray of the shower to clean my face.  </li>
            <li>The customer service number on the web site wasn&#x27;t at all interested in being of service and suggested I call back during normal working hours...</li>
            <li>Love that I can leave this in the shower and not worry about it possibly getting wet or having any place where I need to plug it in.</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t as good as the Clarisonic, because the head rotates rather than pulses, thus not cleaning as deep, but for less than $30, it does the job well enough.  </li>
            <li>I am a 28 year old guy with a very oily skin, I just wanted to buy something to get rid of that excess oil and old acne scars.</li>
            <li>For a middle aged woman it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mainly for my 12 year old daughter, but I have also used it.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and the product does a nice job if you use it for at least one minute.</li>
            <li>and I like it , gentle on my skin , but cleans very well, and seems like my pores are smaller  and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pro: waterproof, two modes to choose, light weight, bargain price&lt;br /&gt;Con: difficult in opening battery lid, an okay cleaning result to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it everyday with my own facial cleaner.  </li>
            <li>It does make my face feel cleaner and get rid of all the dirt and oil and reduce my blackheads after a while, but at the same time it makes my skin feel kind of dry at the same time.</li>
            <li>This brush makes my face look vibrant and leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice that your make up goes on much smoother, that you don&#x27;t have to dab the excess oil off your face in the middle of the day, and your skin will feel so much lighter.</li>
            <li>The brush is a lil soft &amp; I want to be able to slough off some dead skin on my face....</li>
            <li>being the standard item but was the Clarisonic really that much better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have problems with adult achy and this produce has help clear up my face very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but finding rotating pads that fit well is difficult.</li>
            <li>Now, I use it everyday, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far</li>
            <li>As a person with excema, it&#x27;s super important to get all the dirt out of my pores at the end of the day and this really does the trick without drying or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer and it feels so much cleaner than just using a regular face wash.</li>
            <li>Skin was not left as smooth, has only 1 cleaning head, uses batteries with no charger, and has no case.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is of great quality, but the bristles are just too soft for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use Simple facial cleanser and moisturizer and it does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>It has made putting on my makeup in the morning so much easier too as I have gotten rid of the dead skin the evening before and just lightly wash off the nights build up before applying my foundation.</li>
            <li>I really feel like this cleansing brush helps clean off all makeup residue and it exfoliates in half the time it used to take me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to turn it off, and have been extra careful ever since.</li>
            <li>I was worried when I turned it on and noticed the bristles were soft and there wasn&#x27;t much of a scrubbing action against my hand</li>
            <li>In morning only short time and lightly with just a dab or Pro X cleanser, and at night I use makeup remover and then give my skin a thorough scrub with the Pro X cleanser.  </li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, my face is super clean, the black heads on my nose are clearing up</li>
            <li>I was using the same products before - the only change to my skin care regimen is using the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System twice per</li>
            <li>too slow and soft-wishing for a more intense scrub</li>
            <li>The fast speed does exfoliate noticeably, but it sure is slow.</li>
            <li>I just love this little gadget!</li>
            <li>I love this little brush!</li>
            <li>I love this little brush!  </li>
            <li>I love this little thing!</li>
            <li>She started using it the same day and after the second use her skin was very soft, shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating formula that comes with it helps it clean and doesn&#x27;t feel rough at all--and I even have very sensitive</li>
            <li>Well I went to that large bulk selling club and found the SAME thing for just a little bit more</li>
            <li>Also, you can only use microderm every other day so on the off days I was just using a wash cloth and my skin didn&#x27;t feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>Also while I understand that results may vary from person to person, I havn&#x27;t really noticed a major difference just yet...</li>
            <li>It cleans well and makes my skin look very clear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes me feel my skin very clear and my face</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t irritate me at all.</li>
            <li>I have never used one before and have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The brush head was VERY soft and provided NO exfoliation what so ever.</li>
            <li>The scrubby brush is VERY soft and not scratchy at all.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find that after I skipped using it for a day or two</li>
            <li>It has a very soft bristle head that snaps on a shaft attached to the motorized body and comes with a tube of exfoliating cleaner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin, I had used clearsonic once, but my skin breakout day before the use.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is prone to over drying and whatever is in that cleanser</li>

            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li>-- it makes your skin feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>The brush head is very soft, not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Though the brush seems very soft, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues since beginning use.</li>
            <li>is very soft and also it take 2 AA battery&#x27;s and even with them in</li>

            <li>This is very gentle and works well; looks simple and neat.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this product and my skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on your face and it makes me feel refreshed by deep cleansing my face each night before bed...</li>
            <li>My skin can be very sensitive</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft</li>
            <li>and then skin is very soft to the touch afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and would prefer a deeper scrub.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to clear up their skin once and for all.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my doctor because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used it with the sample cleanser that was provided and was very surprised with my skin after one use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have very, very oily skin - especially if I am lax in my Retin-A use.</li>
            <li>tre brush hairs are very soft and they&lt;br</li>
            <li>THE HAIR BROSSE IS VERY SOFT.</li>
            <li>My face is very soft and still moist after using the Pro-x.  </li>
            <li>The brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>the bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Maybe it could be to often to use it every day if the skin- type is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft but still does the job.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mechanical cleanser for anyone who is on a budget and needs a at home professional system for skin care.  </li>
            <li>There are machines which cost a couple of hundred dollars, but for the very modest price, this system gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>very soft leaves my face.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>The spinning brush is very very soft . .</li>
            <li>the bristles are very soft</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin that reacts to almost anything with anti-aging ingredients in it, so I didn&#x27;t care for the sample Olay cleanser that this came with.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>My first reaction after taking it out of the box was that it doesn&#x27;t seem cheap at all (compared to the way more expensive Clarisonic)--it seems really solid.</li>
            <li>love that it uses plain old AA batteries and has no fancy chargers.</li>
            <li>After you cleanse your face, they also said you could use items right in your kitchen to keep your skin soft &amp; moist, such as olive oil, coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wake up the next day having amazing skin but the subtle improvements in the texture of my skin was enough for me to say that buying this product was well worth it!</li>
            <li>I wanted the Clairsonic, but I have super sensitive skin, compounded with new issues as I&#x27;m now over 40, and hated the idea of spending that kind of money and then not being able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this device for a little over 2 weeks, I think it is as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I just use a little mild facial soap with it if I just want to clean.</li>
            <li>This little one does a good job of keeping my face baby smooth without irritating it or making me red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Olay Pro-X is a really lightweight, small brush, making it easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Works probably just as good as any other professional system while also saving a lot less.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t scrub hard enough to really do much.</li>
            <li>After the first use this worked wonders and left my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft and looks immediately brighter after each use, and I think the deep exfoliating is helping clear up my old acne scars.  </li>
            <li>The rotation of the brush is not very powerful and I just don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s getting my skin truly, deeply clean.  </li>
            <li>I use this twice a day and my pores are clear and SHRINKING!</li>
            <li>My pores were completely clear every time I used it!</li>
            <li>My face is now 95% clear!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son and it helped clear up his acne!</li>
            <li>it still has the clear gel in the compartment!</li>
            <li>After a couple of days, my nose looked so clear!</li>
            <li>and my skin is clear!  </li>
            <li>After I use it I can see my pores are clear!</li>
            <li>Or anyone with problem skin for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your time, if you&#x27;ve read this far!</li>
            <li>will try and update this review in a few weeks/months to let you know how I&#x27;m doing when not overdoing it! :-)</li>
            <li>Try it - you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>but when you&#x27;re done, your face feels markedly smoother!  </li>
            <li>I normally wash my face in the shower by wetting a washcloth, rubbing some Dove sensitive bar soap on it, then adding a tablespoon or so of baking soda.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>It was my first ever exfoliating facial brush and is just a cheaper alternative I wanted to try out before saving up to buy myself a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>First, the brush head is TINY.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is much more like it used to be - some surface shine, but nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are soft, so your skin won&#x27;t look like you have been attacked by Brillo pads!</li>
            <li>I only use the higher speed.</li>
            <li>I used the exfoliating creme in the box first but then used some burts bees peach and willowbark deep pore scrub.</li>
            <li>a really cool young woman named Valerie has put up a great instructional video on youtube that includes a battery how-to:  [...]    </li>
            <li>I considered getting a more expensive facial scrubber but am glad I got this.</li>
            <li>Buying cheap is never worth it in the long-run.</li>
            <li>They look exactly the same before and after exfoliating.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought since the first one I bought a couple of years ago stopped working (not because of battery replacement).</li>
            <li>I wish the brush head had a higher speed, and that there were multiple brush heads, but it still does the job.</li>
            <li>But really, the difference in the two speeds is barely detectable if at all.  </li>
            <li>so the facial cleaner was something I was interested in.  </li>
            <li>Soft brush, makes skin tingle!</li>
            <li>A cotton ball took off more dead skin!</li>
            <li>Gets deep, I just wish it had another higher speed.</li>
            <li>When I turned it on I actually wondered if this was going to work well, because the two rotations are so gentle and the bristles on the brush head are so gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>and I used it last night for the first time.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for months now and only used it for the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>wow what a difference it makes!</li>
            <li>Also, when I am not lazy and use it in the morning and before bed, I have no blemishes and no break</li>
            <li>So glad I opted for this affordable model over more expensive ones that do the same thing.</li>
            <li>It has gotten rid of my acne, and I rarely have minor zits.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>When I first starting looking into cleansing systems, I was going to go with the Clarisonic Mia</li>
            <li>Definitely comparable to the Clarisonic and so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>i usually do not use Olay products.</li>
            <li>Skin gets veeeerrrry soft and it stimulates blood circulation!</li>
            <li>I think it does an OK job as a small travel cleaning option, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Not a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; system like higher priced products such as ClariSonic&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It is my first facial brush.</li>
            <li>So far I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and oily skin all at once, but this rotating brush doesnt irritate my skin at all!</li>
            <li>I put it on my face and was surprised immediately by the foul odor (all over my face!).  </li>
            <li>I would still be using it if I weren&#x27;t to lazy to buy more of the brushes.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft after washing!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I definitely saw a difference.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks of using this every other day I have noticed my pores are smaller, blackheads are fewer, and a healthy glow on my face (not shiny).</li>
            <li>In the past, I tried many products that claimed to dissolve blackheads but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I never knew what it was like for a product to actually \\&quot;make my pores look smaller\\&quot; but that is exactly what this has done.  </li>
            <li>I can not compare this to the Clarisonic as far as cleaning but the price is 1/10th!  </li>
            <li>the biggest thing I&#x27;ve noticed is the blackheads I can never seem to conquer on my nose have almost completely disappeared!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I forgot that I was about to, so I had already done my regular face washing routine and washed my face.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but don&#x27;t normally have problems with breakouts.  </li>
            <li>My reaction when using the Pro-X for the first time was how different it is from the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day on my skin and the heaviness of makeup and oil completely disappears!</li>
            <li>The first time I used the Olay Pro-X cleansing system I must have overdone it a bit because I had some irritation the next day.</li>
            <li>The combination of the cleanser + the brush makes my skin insanely soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it on a trans-Atlantic flight recently, just removing the head first.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product; but, after using it my face is left red and irritated.  </li>
            <li>so I would suggest buying this but be aware you may have to replace it sooner than later.</li>
            <li>It provides the same ease of use and results that I had found the first time around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alive!</li>
            <li>It provides the same ease of use and results that I had found the first time around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alive!</li>
            <li>So lesson learned and removed mascara and eyeshadow first the next day.</li>
            <li>well worth it and lasts long.</li>
            <li>It has worked wonders on my skin so far!</li>
            <li>first began using this shortly after purchasing it in November.</li>
            <li>I like it so far!</li>
            <li>I had wanted this (or a similar, more expensive version of this) for many months before I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I consulted with my dermatologist and she nearly freaked out that I had used this!  </li>
            <li>I can only imagine how the Clarisonic would feel after the first use.  </li>
            <li>First off, Amazon was definitely the cheapest place I could find this, and they allowed me to use a coupon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love how it&#x27;s small, can have it in your shower just like I do ...</li>
            <li>my skin went into a fit, pimples everywhere, blackheads everywhere,and dark marks from those blackheads.</li>
            <li>The brush is tiny and it feels funny when it rotates.</li>
            <li>the price as a first time owner/user of a facial exfoliating system</li>
            <li>criticism is that the brush is TOO SOFT!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well for the price I just wish it came with an extra refill brush to use.</li>
            <li>However, men have to do skincare to maintain a studly, youthful appearance and this is a basic beginning regimen all men can benefit from just as much as women!</li>
            <li>It is much better than more the expensive (department store) brand!</li>
            <li>I was so surprised to see this product which had no results at all!..</li>
            <li>had my first facial and the lady discussed with me taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft after using this!</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive and oily skin like me, DO NOT USE THIS!</li>
            <li>Was gifted a &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; facial cleaning system and this works the same without the ENORMOUS price</li>
            <li>I love this brush and would definitely recommend this to anyone, male or female!</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter loves the way it makes her skin feel afterwards and if it gets her to wash her face - I&#x27;m all for it!</li>
            <li>Although I must admit I was skeptical after lathering on much more expensive products with excellent reviews from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Just tried my Olay Pro - X for the first time last night and wow!</li>
            <li>Comparing the two they are pretty darn close to the same.  </li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with my Cetaphil daily cleanser and after a week on consistent use</li>
            <li>I actually bought another one when I accidentally left the original during a stay at a hotel.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and never have a problem!</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much daily now.  </li>
            <li>I am using a facial brush for the first time in my 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old and don&#x27;t have very problem skin, however I feel it is difficult to do a good job taking my makeup off at night.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>On tip: Use Facial wipes first to get off any excess make up you may still have on your skin.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this i noticed a big difference.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin after only the first use and have kept it up.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smoother after the first day, and visibly looks smoother on the third day.</li>
            <li>first, which deep cleanses my pores and followed it with the Olay Pro-X system.  </li>
            <li>Small price for a grand result.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This is the first battery powered facial cleanser I have used.</li>
            <li>The first time using it, with low speed, it already made wonder.</li>
            <li>The first one broke after the fourth time I dropped it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>My skin has been so soft since I started using it!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>this brush come with 2 spinning speech; with the spinning it will help you to form a lot more bubble than usual which will save you on the usage of the cleansing form.  </li>
            <li>I love that this works the same as a device that is hundreds of dollars more expensive.</li>
            <li>(WOW)!</li>
            <li>Like I said I tried it the night I got it in the mail and after using it for the first time I could definitely notice the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!</li>
            <li>I actually feel that the speed is weak--even on the higher setting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first lasted over two years with daily use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it over my lips in the shower too, which was accidental, but worked out well - almost as well as my usual lip scrub. :)</li>
            <li>Better than some of the much more expensive ones!</li>
            <li>This is a personal favorite and an essential part of my daily skin cleansing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It deserves a five out of five because it definitely does exactly what it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a facial brush without trying it first.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have had a soft and a firm bristle brush to interchange with according to ones personal needs.</li>
            <li>this is just another gimmick and the real secret to beautiful skin</li>
            <li>This brush is water-resistant, not water-proof, but I got a new shower rack and the new one will stay clear of the shower spray.  </li>
            <li>They strike a fine balance between being too gentle to do any effective cleaning and too harsh or irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>I normally have visible dry flaky skin but this seemed to buff it right off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably kill the little motor very quickly doing this, but that skin feels smoother, too, so I will continue.  </li>
            <li>Not too soft and absolutely not to hard...</li>
            <li>Main thing is that it really cleans my face and the reason I&#x27;ve been getting breakouts is because my face wasn&#x27;t cleaned enough.</li>
            <li>That is why I liekd this because it moved with greatness and yet did not feel rough, it went deep but left a face behind, and it is easy to use andyet great when it comes to results.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical if this product could clean my face better than just using your hands.    </li>
            <li>My face does feel less dry and it is a nice experience</li>
            <li>I also find that when I use it after washing off my makeup with my regular cleanser, I find that I still get make up on the brush, so I know this is a really deep clean.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and even though I&#x27;m an older woman I was suffering from constant breakouts of acne.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and also have mild rosacea.</li>
            <li>It definitely gives a deep clean and exfoliation.</li>
            <li>and i thought the Pro-X would really help get my face clean and buff away some of the dead skin.</li>
            <li>My oily skin needs extra work certain times of year and this boosted my normal cleanser to the point of noticing a difference.</li>
            <li>After just the very first use all the dry skin on my nose was gone!</li>
            <li>I preferred the stiffer bristles of the other model and felt like my face was squeaky clean and glowing after using it.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, this is a product that each person should buy if they want clean skin.</li>
            <li>I think my skin looks improved, which is important as my job requires daily makeup, the extra boost for deep cleaning without drying out is really helpful.</li>
            <li>Night: After I&#x27;m doing most of my eating and stuff  for the day( only reason is food particles get caught on your face even if you wipe and clean anything just from eating neatly etc, also because of dry skin, sweat, dead skin, pollutants in the air we can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li>It takes just a few seconds more in the shower to go over your face, a few extra more to go over your neck.</li>
            <li>The Olay brush is gentle on my face whether I use it on regular or high speed.  </li>
            <li>I did notice right away that my skin was extremely soft and just felt deep down clean.</li>
            <li>I used regular facial cleansing products, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>For that much, I expected it to work better than other methods, but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve not used any other, I have  really liked using this Cleansing System for the last month, especially using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I get more breakouts along my jawline and near my ears and since using this daily to every other day</li>
            <li>When you exfoliate the old skin, you need to take care of the new skin coming up.  </li>
            <li>Do not mix old and new batteries as unit may be damaged.</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft and gentle on my skin; I actually wish it had a little more substance to it because it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing much cleaning - my skin feels cleaner when I use a rough wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>Now after using the brush and Origins for a month and a half I see a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I now use a light BBcream to cover up the minor blemishes left.  </li>
            <li>It may sound like an odd gift.</li>
            <li>I started using this again and remembered exactly why it&#x27;s worth the few minutes of time it takes to use each day.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth afterward, and I have less breakouts.</li>
            <li>The first, slightly slower speed might be better when using the exfoliating cleanser, and the faster one for just regular daily cleansers.</li>
            <li>This brush helps to exfoliate the upper dead layer of your skin leaving your skin fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>However, the Bristles are not firm enough for a deep clean.</li>
            <li>:) I just put facial cleanser or body wash on the pad and clean behind the ears.</li>
            <li>:) I just put facial cleanser or body wash on the pad and clean behind the ears.</li>
            <li>Size is small and handy even for people with big hands.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin (including rosacea spots on a fairly regular basis.</li>
            <li>I now think that may be true of all such facial cleansing system devices.  </li>
            <li>On the up side of this product, I found that given it&#x27;s small size, it is perfect for cleaning behind your ears.</li>
            <li>On the up side of this product, I found that given it&#x27;s small size, it is perfect for cleaning behind your ears.</li>
            <li>I initially washed my face with my tried and true face cleansing regimine, which left peeling skin on my face and on my toner.</li>
            <li>be careful around hair as it will grab it and tangle it quickly---</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spin as quickly as I had expected.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time today and it left my face feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff that came with it so much, I bought a big bottle and think it&#x27;ll last a couple of years (really) since the little tube is over 4 months old</li>
            <li>I want to explain that even as a teenager, I have never had major acne, and I only rarely get one or two pimples as an adult, but I have a lot of blackheads on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li>I do use it daily, it does not tear up my skin as one reviewer mentioned, it has two speeds, is easy to work, does not need the recharger which cuts down on it&#x27;s size, can be left in the shower caddy, and was totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for a young person, or someone with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I cant imagine the more expensive ones doing much of a difference other than making more profit...</li>
            <li>There are always better things out there but don&#x27;t rate down just because you can afford the latter.</li>
            <li>but I certainly didn&#x27;t expect so much of flaking with single use.   </li>
            <li>It gets your skin soft clear and glowing will recommend to everyone I know!</li>
            <li>, I have pretty clear skin, and it is sensitive to boot (Asian skin).  </li>
            <li>I consider myself pretty low maintenance, but thought I&#x27;d try this cleaner to see if it could help shrink size of pores and clean out some black heads.</li>
            <li>My 45 year old skin is so soft now!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expected to work from the very first use.</li>
            <li>I do not know what took me so long to finally purchase one of these facial cleansing brushes, but I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Its way to abrasive for sensitive or somewhat sensitive skin, and using with the cleanser sample it comes with, forget about it!</li>
            <li>My skin has not felt so soft since I was a young girl!  </li>
            <li>It is a kind of weak</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not getting red from irritation but from blood-flow to my skin, which really helps kick-start new cells growing.    </li>
            <li>if your new to the whole facial exfoliating thing like I&#x27;am.</li>
            <li>You think the brush will be too soft and the little battery operated machine won&#x27;t be powerful enough to clean your face well, but after using it I was amazed at how smooth my skin felt and how much dead skin it removed.</li>
            <li>My pores are less prominent and appear smaller.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with my purchase and the fact the Amazon price is significantly less than the shelf price at the local, national pharmacy chain store.  </li>
            <li>The best part it is less expensive</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and not too harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re fine with mediocre, then this is probably just fine.</li>
            <li>is a super simple brush however brings a deep cleansing of the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 23-year-old woman with mild to moderate acne, and every pimple I get leaves a hyperpigmented mark that can last for upwards of 2 years!</li>
            <li>I use this daily with a mild facial cleanser</li>
            <li>I suppose it has to be a tight fit</li>
            <li>Second, if you have very sensitive skin, use a gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>guess if you have VERY sensitive skin and are looking for an affordable way to GENTLY massage your face OUTSIDE of the shower, this may be acceptable, but I saw ZERO results either visibly or in how my skin felt.</li>
            <li>The cleanser was gentle and it left my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>is much more effective, much less expensive, and doesn&#x27;t require batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am going to be 41 next month and although my skin looks much younger than my age, I was starting to notice larger pores, sun spots, and very fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Probably not worth what I paid for it, but it does clean.</li>
            <li>And once it was open, the second and third time I tried opening and closing it, it opened up really easily with no problem at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s about the same, with one slight edge: the Pro-X is like a daily massage for your face and it does feel quite nice and relaxing as opposed to the scrubbing with the scratchy exfoliating pads.</li>
            <li>She feels this is a gadget she would not normally purchase and that she often does not want to take the time to achieve the results it is capable of providing if one wants to spend the time and money.</li>
            <li>It is pretty much like any of those other micro-bead scrubber fash washes.  </li>
            <li>Is working fine after a few months.</li>
            <li>Left my skin red and even more dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cleanser that comes with the Pro-X is pretty much on-par with other microdermabrasive cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush head are super soft and gentle but you do need to replace them every few weeks.</li>
            <li>After two failed attempts at trying to find a good, cheaper alternative to the results I desire, I finally broke down and came back to Amazon for this amazing system.</li>
            <li>After two failed attempts at trying to find a good, cheaper alternative to the results I desire, I finally broke down and came back to Amazon for this amazing system.</li>
            <li>I suffer with moderate chin acne, large pores and oily T zone area.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and purchased a large bottle of the same cleanser that comes with the brush.</li>
            <li>Since I began using this brush I&#x27;ve notice my skin is smoother and my pores (which have always been large, no matter what I do) are smaller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the box in which I bought the brush showed what seemed a much large bottle of exfoliating cleanser than actually came in the package.  </li>
            <li>I have large deep pores.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this little treat.  </li>
            <li>The majority of the people reviewing this item are correct, it&#x27;s a fantastic little skin exfoliator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made a little cheap</li>
            <li>Even after a few months, I&#x27;m still using the original batteries and brushes, so it&#x27;s pretty low maintenance.</li>
            <li>I expected a lot more, this weakly powered brush did nothing to improve my skin, I get better results using a Buf-Puf facial sponge.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve just been using the exfoliating scrub it comes with, which has large granules; however, I plan using it with the Neutrogena facial scrubs.</li>
            <li>My face was clean, my pores were tight and my skin was so soft!</li>
            <li>I just love this little facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Many of us often overlook the simple step of washing our face, when little do we know it can make all the difference.</li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars because although I love the pro-x, I wish the speed of it were a little faster.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it&#x27;s made my regular cleanser work a little better.</li>
            <li>Seems to work better when not pressed hard.  </li>
            <li>product itself works fine, but I&#x27;ve never expected that it would break down so soon.</li>
            <li>it is a nice gadget, especially for the price - but two things to think about, and I guess this goes for any beauty product: (1) Is it really that great, or would you get the same results from using anything other than your fingers to wash your face?  </li>
            <li>I love this little gadget!!</li>
            <li>For the normal price, I&#x27;d rate it lower just because it is overpriced generally for a little spinning bristle device that must be incredibly cheap to manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>I use my Pro-x in the shower, but am a little more careful not to leave it under the water stream as much as I would with the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep it dry after every time your using it ,or it will stop working due to the circuit shortage from humidity.</li>
            <li>It really gets down deep into my pores to clean out all makeup, etc.</li>
            <li>clear up deep cystic acne but does seem to help surface acne &amp; black heads, and it creates a very clean palette for applying whatever else you put on</li>
            <li>I had a full face of makeup on and simply splashed my face with water, rubbed the exfoliating cleanser onto my skin and used the brush on low speed about 1 minute and then high speed for the second minute.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this product was just fine, but it was very harsh, so I could only use it twice a week.</li>
            <li>The battery compartment door can be a source of considerable frustration if, like many, you have a hard time prying it open, however I found that by using a wiggling motion and gripping with the heel of my hand, it comes off without too much trouble.    </li>
            <li>My skin wasn&#x27;t bad to start with but is really looking great.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely compelled to share the great results after a bad day under the sun.  </li>
            <li>I did skip a few days and could tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give an accurate review now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few months.</li>
            <li>It removes the makeup from my face clearly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always washed my skin carefully, but it has never felt this smooth and silky, I see a definite difference from using this.  </li>
            <li>MY FACE LOOKS SO HEALTHLY AND CLEAR.  </li>
            <li>and her face is finally clear</li>
            <li>Its such a great value that you almost can&#x27;t go wrong by trying it.</li>
            <li>but my old one had a much bigger brush and spun much faster</li>
            <li>can make u face really clean, but has no effect on black nose!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have clear skin.</li>
            <li>you can clearly feel the before and after difference......</li>
            <li>If you have extremely sensitive or perhaps acne prone skin, then this tool is gentle enough for you.  </li>
            <li>After a month, my face is softer and my skin is clear.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but still firm to scrub your face and my face is really smooth after it.</li>
            <li>You can clearly tell a difference in results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to say my skin got any clearer from acne since I&#x27;ve already had rather clear skin.</li>
            <li>AND THE BRUSH REALLY CLEANS DEEP TO RID MY SKIN OF DIRT, OIL, AND OLD MAKEUP.</li>
            <li>My skin has clearly improved since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m all clear again.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen my skin this clear since I was a kid.</li>
            <li>It does the job, though it isn&#x27;t as powerful as some of the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>I have a problem with my t-zone being too dry or oily and finding products to scrub my face till I actually feel clean.</li>
            <li>just Yes to Cucumber Daily Gentle Cleanser because my face is sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic is clearly the luxury item with the Pro-X</li>
            <li>I feel my face gets clear using a wash</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t hurt just made it really red.</li>
            <li>The directions are clear.</li>
            <li>Got this for my teen aged son who has some keratosis pilaris on his face and he was hoping it would help that and smooth it a bit.  </li>
            <li>Let me be clear, this product hasn&#x27;t given me any issues.</li>
            <li>Figured I&#x27;d give this a try to get a deeper clear.</li>
            <li>but my face wouldn&#x27;t clear up.</li>
            <li>Whoa... This thing is tiny, and the bristles are too soft and the whole thing is like a toy...</li>
            <li>None of them have done anything to help clear up my face.</li>
            <li>This does the job and is gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin is clear than ever</li>
            <li>But, since I haven&#x27;t used Clarisonic yet, I&#x27;m not sure if this Olay one is generally on par with Clarisonic or just more</li>
            <li>It is soft and gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>It has helped clear up some acne and reduced my pores.</li>
            <li>Far less acne, my skin was smoother and clearer and felt truly clean and not irritated!&lt;br /&gt;I use this product once a day.....</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t say that I have completely clear skin, its not a miracle worker</li>
            <li>I am 65 and had a few lumps and bumps on my face but since using this cleansing system my face is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have notice both of my daughters skin had clear up.</li>
            <li>i moved on to using the AMBI EVEN &amp; CLEAR Foaming Cleanse, with the brush.</li>
            <li>and it took 3 weeks for my skin to clear after I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li>Just give your skin time to clear.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth giving a try as an alternative to the more expensive brushes on the market.</li>
            <li>I use both the cleansing exfoliation cream that was included with the brush system as well as the Olay Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol cleansing cream and acne cream.</li>
            <li>this product would make it slightly easier to clean your face if you didn&#x27;t have say, a wash cloth around, or failing that, a paper towel with some</li>
            <li>I find the combination of the rotary brush and the gritty cleanser to be a bit much for my sensitive skin, so I use Cetaphil face wash on it.  </li>
            <li>My skin has always had breakouts my whole entire adult life</li>
            <li>There is nothing wrong with the function and the actual piece of equipment is great.</li>
            <li>The brush is gentle enough for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product that compares equally with the expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I used the Olay exfoliator that came with it once and then stopped as I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has two speeds and the brushes are surprisingly soft.  </li>
            <li>I researched this product before buying it, even to the point of watching several videos on you tube comparing it to the much pricier Clarisonic Mia 2.</li>
            <li>I ended up out of town unexpectedly, without my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>This really does make your pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>The cleansing brush for this is so soft.</li>
            <li>WOULD definitely recommend for anyone who wants cleaner skin.</li>
            <li>Both are young adults.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t even have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to a $200 one, but I have seen a complete difference in my complexion...</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I wash my face with Olay&#x27;s Sensitive skin foaming face wash to take off all my make-up and rinse everything off.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>When I put my make-up I feel like my face has a natural glow instead of the cakey face that I had before I started using the cleansing</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30s with oily skin.</li>
            <li>tried the brush with the sample cleanser provided and you really feel you&#x27;re getting a face massage or facial.</li>
            <li>Just when I was almost in tears and ready to give up, boom, it comes open.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve only owned this for two month and my skin already looks much healthier then before.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>On the bottom of the instrument, below the gray off and on buttons and the line, are words Olay Professional.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s really changed anything about my overall skin tone or texture</li>
            <li>Olay-Olay&#x27;s is twice as soft as the SOFT toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li>This product has a brush head that spins and cleans so much quicker than a standard brush.</li>
            <li>I am a 31-year old woman who has some adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I dab an exfoliator and cleanser on my face because I found that if I put them directly on the pad and then turned it on, the stuff immediately flew off all over the place.   </li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling completely cleansed and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted something to wash my face differently.</li>
            <li>, just let the circular soft brush do</li>
            <li>So, just a warning ti keep it out of direct water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face felt so soft, but I feel like the luster is wearing out.</li>
            <li>I rinsed my face expecting to feel baby soft skin after the ordeal</li>
            <li>I wanted similar brush but didn&#x27;t want to spend as much money.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is completely wretched.</li>
            <li>The instructions on the box say to gently rock the battery compartment cover from side to side while pulling with the same hand.  </li>
            <li>Then it died unexpectedly.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face feel the way it soft as a baby&#x27;s bum .</li>
            <li>I am mid 20s and have very congested but dry/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re only supposed to use it for 60 seconds, I think, but that goes by quite fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also since learned that skin problems -- at least of the oil/blackhead/zit variety -- have more to do with what&#x27;s going on in your skin than on your skin.</li>
            <li>The brushes for this thing are as soft as the brushes they sell for babies hair.</li>
            <li>I use Cetaphil (it&#x27;s for sensitive skin))</li>
            <li>and I immediately notice how soft my skin is after use.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to try one of the Clarisonic systems, but I felt nervous about spending so much money on such a product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 19 years old and still wondering why I have acne.</li>
            <li>It clearly works, as far as cleansing goes -</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>but i wish the whole industry (not only Olay, but Neutrogena and Clarisonic too) would stop pushing this &amp;#34;daily cleansing&amp;#34; crap...&lt;br /&gt;your</li>
            <li>Deep cleansing with a gentle massage.  </li>
            <li>I thought maybe the batteries were just old and decided to replace them.  </li>
            <li>The brush head did not irritate my sensitive skin  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft and the unit is durable.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it 5-6 times so far.</li>
            <li>do not waste your $.  </li>
            <li>The brush is amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li>The break out I had on my chin is completely cleared.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I started using the Pro-X system that I actually realized how much of my make-up and oils remained on my skin after my nightly cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>and I wish I had bought that with my initial order to be ready.</li>
            <li>It deep cleans, exfoliates, shrinks my pores and makes my skin creams go in much nicer.</li>
            <li>It has completely changed my skin, I had milia on my cheeks for yearsss and nothing could get rid of them.</li>
            <li>and I did not put it near my face out of fear of what it is.</li>
            <li>so I googled instructions which said \\&quot;gently rock\\&quot; the battery compartment and pull at the same time.</li>
            <li>The brushes are incredibly soft, by the way.  </li>
            <li>If they seem to go too fast, I may get the rechargeables recommended in an earlier review.    </li>
            <li>much cheaper than the similar product</li>
            <li>I have been using this Olay pro-x cleansing brush for about two months now and everything seems to work so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, so was surprised.  </li>
            <li>For me they are too soft.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was really surprised by how well this Olay Cleansing System works.</li>
            <li>So whoever said they needed a kitchen knife is probably an old fart with arthritis or something.  </li>
            <li>Scrubs away all the dirt, old skin, everything...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy (yes guy) and I am in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m way too old for pimples at this stage of my life.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft brush</li>
            <li>I would say the results are very close with my traditional way of cleansing, and with my clogged pores I can literally see the difference after I&#x27;ve finished.</li>
            <li>No messy device that gets gunked up.</li>
            <li>Next I tried this and found it really works.</li>
            <li>I paid 28 bucks for mine and even then I cringed at the thought of paying that much on something like this, but I have to say that after regularly using it myself...</li>
            <li>it gently cleans deep into your pores.</li>
            <li>My cheeks, forehead, chin and nose are so soft, I can&#x27;t get over it.</li>
            <li>Brushes too soft.  </li>
            <li>Olay offers a guarantee so use it</li>
            <li>It has made our skin so soft and cleared up our blemishes.  </li>
            <li>My skin is acne prone and sensitive, but this keeps my skin clear and glowing.</li>
            <li>That proved to be too much for me and my skin got quite red.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after waiting for the price to drop as I thought they were asking too much for it initially.</li>
            <li>The brush head is fairly soft so it doesn&#x27;t make my skin act up</li>
            <li>I have priced others similar to this for as much as 3 times the cost.</li>
            <li>My skin is baby soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin that is naturally oily, but of course dries out with acne product usage.  </li>
            <li>the old fashion way but</li>
            <li>That was partly why my expectations were low, but I discovered I didn&#x27;t feel much qualitative difference</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product has, by far, exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it not a few months</li>
            <li>It leaves my 50-year-old skin feeling soft and brightens the complexion.  </li>
            <li>well the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li>I read in a magazine that gently exfoliating your face regularly would help this problem.</li>
            <li>After hearing Dr. Oz&#x27;s recommendation I began researching the Olay Professional Pro-X Cleansing System.  </li>
            <li>but I find that a few times a week keeps my face blackhead free.  </li>
            <li>Even &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; type moisturizing products will cause me to have breakouts and blisters on my face.  </li>
            <li>I find using it in the shower is very convenient because the casing is totally waterproof.  </li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>WOW WOW.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and this has helped my skin clear up like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li>After hearing Dr. Oz&#x27;s recommendation I began researching the Olay Professional Pro-X Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>Olay Professional Pro-X Anti-Aging Starter Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>:B001JQLNNW Olay Professional Pro-X Anti-Aging Starter Kit]]</li>
            <li>This had soft brushes to replaced every 3 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done microderm before and this scrubber is very comparable if used regularly.  </li>
            <li>I use Clarisil cleanser for sensitive skin and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I decided to use this brush for daily cleansing because of the soft, but powerful brush that provides a deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>My face is so soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>, it is a bit too intense for daily use.  </li>
            <li>my skin was baby soft as it was years ago.  </li>
            <li>I walked out of the bathroom, and my husband asked if I had used the PROx, because he had noticed how refreshed and soft my skin was looking.  </li>
            <li>I get a natural glow that I having searching for&#x27; Got it on sale</li>
            <li>This purchase not only provided that but also a gentle electronic tool to deliver the cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am presently surprised.</li>
            <li>This just doesn&#x27;t do near what the Clarisonic does.</li>
            <li>buying $200 Clarisonics for their adult children.</li>
            <li>I went to bed, woke up this morning and WOW.  </li>
            <li>Id see how the $30 \\&quot;version\\&quot; worked for my sensitive, acne-prone, multi-textured skin.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s enough difference that for the fast setting I have to move the product around faster</li>
            <li>Pores are appearing smaller and much smoother.</li>
            <li>My skin is combination and not known to be sensitive at all.</li>
            <li>The brush seemed soft at the beginning</li>
            <li>Not a firm brush</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally know much about this</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and use this a couple times a week with no problem.  </li>
            <li>My skin is combination, leaning towards sensitive, and it doesn&#x27;t like being scrubbed with this twice a day</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft, so it doesn&#x27;t feel scratchy on your face at all, but it still feels like it&#x27;s exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It came with several attachments which over the years could be replaced for a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>With this purchase I did not pay as much attention as I should have when reviewing different makes.  </li>
            <li>I do not remember the brand name of the old one and so do not know if it is still made.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be too abrasive, but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I store the unit in the shower so that it&#x27;s always ready to use, and the constant exposure to moisture hasn&#x27;t affected it in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me start out saying that I&#x27;m 57 years old.</li>
            <li>There is no reason to pay this much when it has the same effect as just hand exfoliating with baking soda or another type of scrub.</li>
            <li>Soft and relaxing</li>
            <li>Completely recommend.</li>
            <li>This unit uses an electric motor to spin a soft brush wheel in one direction.</li>
            <li>When used properly, it provides a gentle cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews complained of peeling and drying out.</li>
            <li>The next day, she told me her whole face started redness after using this product.</li>
            <li>MY SKIN FEELS BABY SOFT</li>

            <li>old)</li>
            <li>like the soft bristle</li>
            <li>sister bought the Clairsonic and it doesn&#x27;t do anything much for her, but in all fairness, she hasn&#x27;t been using it daily</li>
            <li>, I have moderately sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have slightly sensitive skin, comes w/ age</li>
            <li>Olay offers a money-back guarantee.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had an adult onset of acne that is driving me nuts, and being in my 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money on a Clarisonic system.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the bristles are soft</li>
            <li>However im using it with a Natural face wash and it works great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after a while my skin became so sensitive to UV.</li>
            <li>A bit of an adjustment and takes longer to feel you have covered your whole face properly.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only two settings, fast and medium/slow.  </li>
            <li>There are no cons about this item as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>but I do like the product and have had no issues with function so far.</li>
            <li>I use it daily for gentle exfoliation</li>
            <li>It softly massages your face as it cleans.  </li>
            <li>whatever cleanser I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s holding up, works well and no complaints</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, I have noticed such a difference in my skin, it is so much clearer</li>
            <li>It makes my face so soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>The brush head feels so soft and works well on my face.</li>
            <li>I use this in my face regime, of late I have been using it more often</li>
            <li>This product is doing it&#x27;s job so far.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but deceiving in that they do the job.</li>
            <li>wanted a gentle scrubbing deep cleaning appliance</li>
            <li>I could use frequently</li>
            <li>offers 2 speeds  </li>
            <li>This is a bit too soft.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and takes care of any dryness without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having a feeble-handed 3 year old child, suffering from muscle atrophy, aimlessly scrubbing your face with a soft toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle and feel as if they are massaging my face.&lt;br /&gt;Since I often do facial peels, the brush helps me to exfoliate all the remaining peeling skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After only using this for a week, my skin began to really improve.  </li>
            <li>I still break out because my acne is stress related, but the brush helps get rid of my breakouts so much faster.</li>
            <li>The cleanser, however, must have been old or in some way tainted.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough for every day use and still leaves skin feeling cleaned and refreshed!</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li>Overall, I much preferred the Clarisonic</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised by its efficiency</li>
            <li>Did not have any problems with batteries so far.</li>
            <li>The soft brushes cleaned my face softly, but thoroughly.</li>
            <li>The cleanser that is included is also an exfoliating cream, and if that is too much exfoliation, just use a regular facewash.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use twice a day!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect to see such a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>Think this soft-</li>
            <li>then of course the teens years settle in, insecurity, stress and sensitive skin became my nightmare.</li>
            <li>Also, if you know for a face that your skin is extremely sensitive to exfoliating, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>Also, if you know for a face that your skin is extremely sensitive to exfoliating, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>the bristles moved fast enough and were the texture to where it did remove all my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Brush head is soft and not overly abrasive.  </li>
            <li>I developed acne in my forehead.  </li>
            <li>It does leave my skin soft...</li>
            <li>I can actually feel the difference in my skin, my face feels so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>(use Albolene at night only because it is really greasy).</li>
            <li>Soft relaxing bristles.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily, I have sensitive areas and some rosacea.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works wonders on my skin so much so that even my esthetician made a comment about my skin quality when she was doing my facial.</li>
            <li>really makes a difference in the overall texture of your skin.</li>
            <li>thousands of great reviews but ill add my own because im bored.</li>
            <li>This brush gets deep in the pores of my skin and really cleans.</li>
            <li>Skin feels much softer and smoother with regular use</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to a Clairsonic as I have never used one, but if you&#x27;re looking to start somewhere at a reasonable price, I would definitely choose this!</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I do not use the product that came with it.  </li>
            <li>scrubber heads are gentle enough but get the job done.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels as I am cleaning my face and have noticed a difference in my breakouts after only using it a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>I am a college student in my really early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I wanted to begin my preventative care early on, 2.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I could also see that much of the gunk that has been clogged deep in my pores of  are also surfacing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 21 year old college student with combination skin</li>
            <li>It truley works my face is so soft and my complextion is even.</li>
            <li>I started using this device a few weeks ago, and it has already become an indispensable part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>Its a soft scrub - not irrating to the skin.</li>
            <li>I like this cleansing brush, it leaves my face feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>makes me feel like i really cleaned out my oily facial pores.</li>
            <li>and it really helps exfoliate and deep cleanse.  </li>
            <li>I have not had it a month, and the battery compartment is completely rusted.  </li>
            <li>My old one has a buffer as well as a face massager.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating lotion will leave your skin soft and youthful.</li>
            <li>I have oily, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this 4 days ago along with the OZ Natural Vitamin C Serum and have used it approx.</li>
            <li>In fact, I use the sensitive brushes on my Clarisonic and they still feel somewhat abrasive.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old keeps &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34</li>
            <li>My skin felt so smooth the few times I washed them.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 12 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints, and it works, but I wonder what the Clarisonic is like because supposedly with the Clarisonic, the bristles move so fast that you can&#x27;t see them move with the human eye.  </li>
            <li>The makeup is completely gone within a matter of seconds.  </li>
            <li>and this makes my skin feel SO soft.</li>
            <li>The pads are too soft, too.  </li>
            <li>I am what you would call a naturally pizza faced programmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not someone who really does any of that exfoiliating stuff -- when I was under the power of the red bumps I used to try everything to no avail</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t use this near your eyes, but</li>
            <li>I am a 44 year old woman with sensitive skin with a touch of Roseacea.</li>
            <li>It is so soft, dewey and glowing.</li>
            <li>One thing that really attracted me to this product--other than the low cost--was the fact that you can use it with any cleanser you like.</li>
            <li>old daughter.</li>
            <li>A lot of the damage caused from using Proactive is completely disappearing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough to not tug the skin, but powerful enough to do its job.  </li>
            <li>It was completely undamaged.  </li>
            <li>The brush head lasts a pretty long time, i replaced it after about 100 uses (2-3 months).  </li>
            <li>The low speed is useless to me, but I would use it if I was able to use the pumice stone attachment from the TEI Spa brush set (doesn&#x27;t fit....</li>
            <li>really needs to step up to the competition and offer different textures of brush heads.</li>
            <li>Completely exfoliates.  </li>
            <li>For me the Olay Professional brush is a downgrade so to speak.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, all you sensitive skin people out there, use caution.</li>
            <li>They get the job done well of deep cleaning (skin, pores, and blackheads,) and gently exfoliating the skin.  </li>
            <li>My parents are visiting, andI plugged in my old NutraSonic for my dad to take apart and see if it&#x27;s something he could fix for me.</li>
            <li>My parents are visiting, and I plugged in my old NutraSonic for my dad to take apartand</li>
            <li>Because your eye skin is so sensitive, I don&#x27;t use it around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Skin doesn&#x27;t really feel that different.</li>
            <li>And if you have delicate skin, I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the quality and pleasantly surprised with all it could do.</li>
            <li>Now I do not have a sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li>Build up between the bristles early on...</li>
            <li>But this get the job done if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have used my mother&#x27;s Clarisonic before and it would irritate my sensitive sinuses.</li>
            <li>My face is so much smoother in this short time.</li>
            <li>I am a busy person</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin at all, but I do notice all day</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin, this probably won&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>The brush is too soft, had I known prier to purchasing, I would have not bought it.</li>
            <li>I had an old brush (not from Olay) that would pulsate</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who finds the rotary action distracting -</li>
            <li>I no longer have any adult acne breakouts</li>
            <li>Olay offers refunds and (2)</li>
            <li>Does not actually have much strength.</li>
            <li>I figured this would be a reasonable stand in on a short term basis.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spin fast enough and the brush head is all wobbly.</li>
            <li>So far I&lt;br /&gt;am</li>
            <li>Cleans thoroughly but not harshly.  </li>
            <li>Using this 2x weekly for the last couple of months has really improved the look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>The breakouts have disappeared and my skin is soft and clear.</li>
            <li>Selo recminedo a cualuier persona que este interesado en tener una piel limpa y natural.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how soft this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I had a TIME of it setting the battery compartment free and was so scared I would destroy the device with all the pulling</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Twin granddaughters just turned 11 years old.  </li>
            <li>I really like this facial cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product with the hope of discovering cleaner feeling skin and along with this came unexpected smoothness and a healthier look to my skin.</li>
            <li>Not enough power in it to really do much.</li>
            <li>Do not use skin sensitive people.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li>That cleanser has charcoal (a natural exfoliant), so I figured that it would work well with the Pro-X.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and glowy.</li>
            <li>However i was pleasantly surprised by the pro x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>started off using the Olay Pro-X brush morning and evening and after 2 days I had phenomenal results, to the point that I received several compliments on the third day from both male and female colleagues on my &#x60;glowing skin&#x27; at work!</li>
            <li>The bristles are way too soft for my skin though.</li>
            <li>I really like the way these work so going to look for a different brand.</li>
            <li>May be it also depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had acne, and while I have had a few more breakouts lately, this brush also seems to help smooth the places over.  </li>
            <li>I still prefer a washcloth for the complete cleansing process</li>
            <li>soft bristles and water proof.</li>
            <li>Although, I did purchase the extra brush heads, so I&#x27;ll be ready when the time comes.</li>
            <li>and i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend this to every one who has sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>This was not even close to being anywhere near comparable.</li>
            <li>and I find the brush to be soft and non-irritating</li>
            <li>I still use cleansers for sensitive skin with it because I need it but the scrub brush doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin as an adult and</li>
            <li>have sensitive, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>FYI, I have sensitive part-Asian skin and found no irritation from this system nor the cleanser.</li>
            <li>I already knew to be weary of installing the batteries as most people complained about in their reviews but got them installed with no problem at all.</li>
            <li>but I was surprised there were no instructions included with it.  </li>
            <li>It is an extremely soft brush  that will NOT hurt your face.  </li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all..</li>
            <li>but it hasn&#x27;t wow&#x27;d me or helped improve my skin dramatically</li>
            <li>This makes my face feel so soft after using it.</li>
            <li>this product completely clogged my pores, and caused a breakout in the likes I have never had before.</li>
            <li>Once again, I have sensitive skin, however I have never had a face cleanser cause acne</li>
            <li>They are bigger so you can use them for your whole body, but consequently not as packable.</li>
            <li>I am amazed how well it worked for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do not have particularly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>She absolutely adores this brush and uses it daily.</li>
            <li>The bristle are soft and the cleaning is thorough.</li>
            <li>I would next time just buy the real thing.</li>
            <li>B0012J135O Olay Complete Night</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>This product has completely fixed my acne.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and no longer breaks out.</li>
            <li>cause I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>but it is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t like it because his skin is too sensitive and it makes him break out.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to folks who have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and there is no such thing as too much exfoliation for my skin.</li>
            <li>( I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>Just wish it had different brushes to add, but hey, that&#x27;s why u buy the high priced Clarisonic!  </li>
            <li>and it completely stop working.</li>
            <li>and my face is so soft.  </li>
            <li>It is soft, but yet, cleans away the dirt and oils not wanted on your skin.</li>
            <li>However, I DO NOT use the exfoliating cleanser as I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used my every day acne cleanser, Boscia clear complexion cleanser, which i would recommend to anyone with sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost completely gone with no use of scar reduction formula, just the brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost completely gone with no use of scar reduction formula, just the brush.</li>
            <li>The olay system is no where near as soft on your skin and as I have very sensative skin it made it really red and irritable.  </li>
            <li>it helps make my skin so soft</li>
            <li>But, it works, does the job (as far as I can tell), &amp; is super-affordable.</li>
            <li>Esp for the price, using it daily really helps to tighten and decrease the size of pores as well as making my complexion smoother and healthier</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was the battery compartment.</li>
            <li>only real criticism is that it requires batteries instead of being rechargeable.</li>
            <li>So far I do not have any complaints.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this one works just as well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use on mature skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily, yet sensitive in areas.</li>
            <li>or whatever ( sensitive , combination )</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>i do wish the cleanser had mroe natural ingridents.</li>
            <li>This facial scrubber gently cleans your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, it&#x27;s clear, it glows,</li>
            <li>i am a mother of a 26 year old and a 21 year old....</li>
            <li>I found that I really like Burts Bees Radiance Facial Cleanser, except that it is not an exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>This creates blood circulation like you get from a professional face massage.  </li>
            <li>Yet, would recommend for price sensitive buyers.</li>
            <li>My face is soooo soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>The speed is not efficient, it goes through batteries fast and the brush is tiny.</li>
            <li>Cleans off all dead tissue, and leaves your face smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I had to search utube to put in the batteries, but no problems once this was complete.</li>
            <li>Seems to be very sturdy and replacement heads can be found at our local drug stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young adult with combination skin.</li>
            <li>i thought i would try this one, and i was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>my face feel so much cleaner then using a facial clothes.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for self conscious teenagers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to have that Professional cleaning and this product brings that to budget conscious people like me.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive and it seemed like I always had a problem with black-heads on my nose and chin</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin and this does not bother it at all.  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin baby soft</li>
            <li>I personally wouldn&#x27;t use it that much if you tend to have</li>
            <li>My sister does facials professionally</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53 years old with no wrinkles showing yet, thank God...</li>
            <li>I bought one for my 12 year old daughter too.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t meant to be used by people with sensitive skin, it should clearly have stated that.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle on both speeds, but cleans deep enough to really exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I use together with Cerave facial wash to avoid too much abrasive on my skins.</li>
            <li>But overall really like this product.</li>
            <li>But the brush was not as soft as I thought.</li>
            <li>I wanted the Clarisonic, but didn&#x27;t really have the cash to fork over for such a luxury.</li>
            <li>As a side note, my 3 year old daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter still loves it though...</li>
            <li>...better than a washcloth by far.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s done both.</li>
            <li>The results are comparable to professional skin treatments that I have paid $120 for.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my young daughter to use</li>
            <li>Only spins one direction, and it uses the battery really fast.</li>
            <li>I had no idea it was going to be so professional.</li>
            <li>And its completely waterproof</li>
            <li>am elderly and it helps my skin to stay clear and soft.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and started to notice dryness in my skin around 28 years old.</li>
            <li>old....</li>
            <li>And its makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>It came with an exfoliating cleanser that so far has not bothered my skin.  </li>
            <li>For sensitive skin just use it on the lower speed.</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks of using this -- my complexion was much smoother and my pores smaller.</li>
            <li>The Olay ProX makes my skin feel so much cleaner and smoother than regular washing.  </li>
            <li>It developed a glow I hadn&#x27;t seen in years.</li>
            <li>Too soft for my taste .</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>My face definitely feels cleaner when I use this, and I don&#x27;t really have complaints.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft on my face</li>
            <li>It far surpassed my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I could not get used to the rotating action of the Pro-X</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wayyyy too soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30-years old and</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My old one died on my</li>
            <li>I hope this one will last much longer.  </li>
            <li>just like it used to do when I was in my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I have used mine in the shower twice per day for about a month and have no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>plan to buy one for my 23 year old daughter and my sister-in-law</li>
            <li>I have used mine in the shower twice per day for about a month and have no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>plan to buy one for my 23 year old daughter and my sister-in-law</li>
            <li>the brushing head on the scrubber feel so so soft</li>
            <li>even in my adult years it&#x27;s never gone away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Throughout highschool and parts of my early adulthood</li>
            <li>suffer from Rosecea and my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>because while my skin is definitely softer and feels cleaner, it hasn&#x27;t really seemed to help with breakouts or blackheads.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and not harmful to face.</li>
            <li>But later doesn&#x27;t change my skin that much.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it nearly every night since I got it.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old son even gave it a go in the tub and said it was &amp;#34;cool, I guess, for something that just cleans you&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>So far it is working well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old and have combination skin.</li>
            <li>It buffs away dead skin and leaves my face SILKY smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin smooth and exfoliates the dead skin  and brings glow to your face.</li>
            <li>and it made my face so soft.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money - I&#x27;ve gone back to apricot scrubs and get a much better result for pore cleansing.</li>
            <li>I actually thought it would be more gentle on my skin since the exfoliating beads are so tiny, but it felt harsh, so I choose not to use it.</li>
            <li>I find it only takes an extra minute of my time to get cleaner fresh results when washing my face &amp; using this product.</li>
            <li>The only time it is useful is if I use an actual salt scrub with it (not the wimpy scrub it comes with).  </li>
            <li>this facial cleanser states that it is safe for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only wish they would give three brush heads and charge us a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>She still uses it and has tried a few different Olay cleansers but hopes it would be better.  </li>
            <li>The exfolating beads are not too harsh and when my skin is properly exfoliated, my skin is much more receptive to any product that I use afterwards.</li>
            <li>It definitely cleans better than with just face wash alone and the brush is not abrasive or harsh.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny I spent on it.</li>
            <li>I decided to start off with this cleansing system to determine whether the more expensive product was worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting the job done and was well worth the money spent on it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li>I ONLY use the brush twice a week to prevent any harsh side effects on my skin, but I love it.</li>
            <li>I personally feel my skin looking and feeling better with the brush exfoliating my skin everyday and probably helps absorbs the face wash and face creams.  </li>
            <li>battery does provide enough power, didn&#x27;t care for it&#x27;s cleaning; know you don&#x27;t want anything that is too powerful or that would hurt your skin, but still didn&#x27;t feel it cleaned properly</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to help keep the dead skin removed, to exfoliate, to stimulate circulation for a better complexion, but in fact, it worked the opposite.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt work as good but it wasnt as expensive.</li>
            <li>I use the more vigorous speed at night while removing make-up and then use the gentle slow speed briefly in the morning before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It was working good but not perfect.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m out the money for this and now ill have to shell out the 100 for the good one.</li>
            <li>Works as good as the expensive items.</li>
            <li>This is just as good as the expensive pro cleaning systems.  </li>
            <li>So needless to say, she loved the brush.</li>
            <li>slow spin... wanted something more.</li>
            <li>She loved it, but unfortunately after dropping it a number of times it stopped working.</li>
            <li>Good product but not awesome</li>
            <li>/&gt;While in the shower getting ready for work, OK I exfoliated/ used the Olay Pro-X for approximately 2 minutes give or take.  </li>
            <li>I would have preferred stiffer bristles - I don&#x27;t get that lovely deep down clean feeling that I&#x27;ve had with other similar products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted, I have very dry, sensitive skin, so maybe this works better for other skin types.</li>
            <li>cleaning tool is a very soft brush that spins on two settings, either high or low.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, quiet, easy to use and it cleans my face really well.  </li>
            <li>I had a problem with constantly getting a blemish right around my eyebrow area (likely from using waxy eyebrow pencils to define my brows).  </li>
            <li>February 2013: I actually received a Clarisonic as a gift last year and didn&#x27;t feel right leaving this review as it was.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering this in the future, but for right now I think I&#x27;ll stick to physical stores.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it compared to other higher priced cleansing brushes.</li>
            <li>This brush is small, soft , and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the shower too and it stays perfectly clean and is water tight.</li>
            <li>Some words of advice, make sure you place the scrubbing brush firmly against your skin BEFORE you turn the Pro-X on, or you will sling stuff everywhere!!</li>
            <li>I dont think i will ever go back to just normal face wash anymore this product worked wonders!</li>
            <li>so soft - Thought what the hell is this little head going to clean that I cant get out of my washcloth.</li>
            <li>I have been looking at the clarisonic mia but did not really want to spend that amount of money right now so decided to try this.</li>
            <li>Not very powerful, even with fresh batteries.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if its cleaning deep down in my pores either, but I guess for the price its pretty decent.</li>
            <li>The portability and small size make it easy to pack and travel.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and remove dead skin!</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling and looking clean and exfoliated, but it wasn&#x27;t any more difficult.  </li>
            <li>, I know that my face has to be the extreme end of the spectrum and many people won&#x27;t have the rough and beat up skin as I had</li>
            <li>The product mentioned that the brush is tiny enough to clean pores, I don&#x27;t agree (I have big pores).</li>
            <li>It definitely cleans better than my bare hands, but not as I expected or I maybe expected too much as I wished it could rotate both ways.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life my skin was extremely dry and flaking everywhere.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t know you could get rid of small blackheads easily like this one would do.</li>
            <li>I love theirs Pro-X face cream, but this cleansing system is particularly a failure.</li>
            <li>This Olay cleaner works great and is priced more reasonably than that other common, expensive, major branded one.</li>
            <li>This is an ok product, as long as you use something hydrating after it to make up for the tight feeling</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked and felt so clean after using this little guy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more gentle, more inherently ergonomic, and the brush head is small enough to easily clean awkward spots like the very back of your jawline or the edges of your nostrils.</li>
            <li>I have long since run out of the little sample of Olay Regenerist Cleanser, but this brush is divine - super soft but efficient, my skin really noticed a difference when I visited my sister for a weekend and forgot it!</li>
            <li>I still break out a little, but now the acne goes away so quickly and without too many extra harsh chemicals used afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Olay Pro-x advanced cleaning system after seeing the facial scrubber that pro active offered.  </li>
            <li>This gentle cleansing brush gets my face clean without damaging my delicate skin.  </li>
            <li>I use this every day and have seen decent results with keeping the pores on my nose clear of this unsightly white gunk.</li>
            <li>Since my skin is sensitive, I use it only once every two days and then particularly in the nose region.</li>
            <li>Great thing about this is that its portable, not as expensive as the rest of them out there!</li>
            <li>I love the sample cleanser in the box, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>+ Clarisonic, especially if you are only bridging a minor gap to fabulous skin.  </li>
            <li>Just after my first use, the mechanical cleanser with it&#x27;s soft, gentle rotating brush cleaned out my pores, removed dead skins cells on the surface, and provided a relaxing massage to my face.  </li>
            <li>my nightly regimen,  I first wash as much makeup off as I can with my hands using an organic tea tree oil bar soap, then I use the Cure Natural Aqua Gel to remove dead skin followed by another run through cleanse using the Olay Cleansing system, I put on my moisturizer and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get a very small sample of the cleanser which I love and have been using.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it scrubbed off a broken blood vessel that never came back.  </li>
            <li>but I can imagine that I am getting my money worth, vs. spending over $100 for some other product.</li>
            <li>Even this is so much cheaper, I generally do not recommend this.</li>
            <li>After cleansing I sometimes put a few drops of vitamin E oil and a touch of rich moisturizer and swirl that around my face for a minute.</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness this is worth every penny I spent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the original batteries after a few months.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>Basically the bristles are so fine they do nothing except push everything you are trying to wash off your face even further down into your pores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product comes with one soft-bristle brush, strong enough to remove that built up skin, soft enough to leave you with skin-intact and minimal redness unless you are the aggressive type.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic is a bit more harsh (which may work for some people) but for me personally, it would dry my skin a bit too much.</li>
            <li>As one ages, exfoliation helps improve skin appearance and this little mild gentle scrubber, used daily, will do that</li>
            <li>All I can say is that after years of trying to fight off black heads with every exfoliating soap out there, this is the only product so far where the black heads have actually gone away, I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li>First of all, getting the cover off to put the batteries in this thing was ridiculously hard, but it was worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>This removes most of make up but provides very little exfoliation and leaves my face red.</li>
            <li>and I feel a little bit special each time I use it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soooo clean and soft right now its ridiculous!</li>
            <li>it gets soft when wet and does the job good with some facial cleanser or with plain old water in case you forgot to purchase the cleanser for the last two months.</li>
            <li>It does make my face feel extra-clean and soft, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my clogged pores or minor breakouts.</li>
            <li>I also have used a simple 99 cent hand brush from a pharmacy and the Conair facial brush and both of those options feel like they do a better job and cost less.  </li>
            <li>Also, for those of you on the edge about this brush because of some reviews bashing the brush quality, please believe me when I say you seriously don&#x27;t want anything more abrasive than this.</li>
            <li>I got a few pimples during the two week period and felt like my face wasn&#x27;t as clean during the trip.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s done anything dramatic for my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t harmed it that I can see, and it&#x27;s a nice bedtime ritual that makes me feel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how often I&#x27;m supposed to replace the brush head, but after using it for 2 months mine still seems to be holding up just fine.  </li>
            <li>No more foundation pooling in pores or caking in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day - morning and night - for about half of the recommended 60 seconds on the low setting (I&#x27;ve heard that it can be too abrasive if you use it daily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have been paying a lot more attention to my skin regime in the past year.  </li>
            <li>and I washed my face and neck for a lot longer than usual as it&#x27;s so soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it did anything above what I can do with a washcloth and a decent exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li>and they said they liked the main product, which was a facial scrubber, but the Olay cleansing cream that came with the facial scrubber was not a good product.</li>
            <li>I now only use this after a night out when I&#x27;m wearing more makeup than usual that needs to be scrubbed off.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not actually sure if it&#x27;s any better than just a regular face wash without a scrubber.</li>
            <li>First off, it doesn&#x27;t provide nearly enough power for any actual results.</li>
            <li>I am aware that the box does not come with instructions for how often to use it or how to open the thing to replace batteries, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately they cost more money than I am willing to pay.  </li>
            <li>Was thinking of ordering the much more expensive version of it, but figured I should give this a shot first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a facial cleansing brush before, and I must say even after my first use my skin was instantly softer after my shower.</li>
            <li>If used with a decent scrub it does the job, but with just regular soap, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to have absolutely flawless skin, now it just looks tired, dry, oily, and just uneven.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of dead skin as much as I had hoped (and why I purchased it in the first place).</li>
            <li>The handheld device is on the smaller size, smaller than my NutraSonic brush, and it&#x27;s pretty lightweight, even with the two AA batteries in it.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can use it in the shower, and it&#x27;s small enough to tote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it worked very well the first few weeks, but my skin may also be a result of my diet, etc.  </li>
            <li>The cream that comes with the system is just okay, and the tube is so small it is really only a sample.</li>
            <li>Try it first before spending the extra money on a similar product, I don&#x27;t think you will regret it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s any better than using a regular washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I only just changed the batteries for the first time last week.</li>
            <li>I am a 37 year old woman with occassional break outs and pretty rough textured skin and clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it has two different speeds to choose from and also comes with a small tube of the Olay face wash.</li>
            <li>I figured the main problem was that those products weren&#x27;t penetrating my pores, so I thought I can justify spending $20-30 to try this out (but I wasn&#x27;t about to spend $200 on a similar</li>
            <li>I first found something very similar on Sephora website, the price there for a similar product was around $200.</li>
            <li>I notice smaller pores, smoother skin, and less visible fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty gross, but the white bristles allow you to SEE the dirt that&#x27;s being cleaned away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed large patches of really dry skin under my noise that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and wearing foundation to cover the redness</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok &amp; only $20 , but it&#x27;s very soft &amp; slow.</li>
            <li>burning sensation when used for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;However, exfoliation is a certain effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush has a low and high setting, but I generally stick with the low and let the brush gently spin on my skin.</li>
            <li>I find this is a tad rough on my skin if I use it too long, but for short periods of time it works well, leaving my face very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to order based on other reviews that the product was too weak to really work but after using it I love it!</li>
            <li>great little personal device and not as expensive as other ones, love the job it does</li>
            <li>with other physical exfoliators i have used in the past, I have found that it&#x27;s a good idea to wash (not just rinse)</li>
            <li>Not a bad brush, a little softer  than the ones I had before.  </li>
            <li>You can get plenty of other decent exfoliant scrubs for $3-8 that work much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it feels so mild like it&#x27;s hardly doing much.</li>
            <li>I was pretty exited about this, super cheap and 2,000 reviews, but unfortunalty it only comes in one size brush, no body brush no pumice brush no nothing the brush is really small not to mention the product is small as well.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and noticed an improvement in/on my face right away.</li>
            <li>The smaller sized head fits comfortably around my nose and is gentle enough to be used everyday.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a high and low speed.</li>
            <li>My skin felt less congested, less oily, my pores seemed less noticeable, and my makeup went on more smoothly.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this item if you are thinking of getting..best present ever!!</li>
            <li>and this product definitely deserves it&#x27;s high rating and ranking on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Has two settings, low and high.</li>
            <li>I have had blackheads on my nose for the last 8 years since high school that I have tried everything with.</li>
            <li>Everyone raves about their Clarisonics, but I just couldn&#x27;t justify the high price tag for essentially what is just a motorized brush.</li>
            <li>There is something about the high speed that helps create suds to carry the cleaning product around your entire face.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for a face scrubber like this one.</li>
            <li>I read reviews for both high end moderately priced products.  </li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a replacement until I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the purchase especially</li>
            <li>It has a high &amp; low speed, came with batteries &amp; face wash!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
            <li>I suggest highly for middle age acne/oily skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product for daily use.</li>
            <li>A few blemishes that popped up prior to using it are shrinking away, the redness went away after a good nights sleep, and my nose barely has a dark speck in any of the pores.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for digging deep into your pores and for cleaning your skin, but after using it your face feels really raw, and not refreshing.</li>
            <li>only because my face is so sensitive, that if I use anything new on it I will break out.</li>
            <li>Right size for travel but feel it may not last long.  </li>
            <li>I use it every other day usually with my own acne cleanser (it comes with a small tube of Olay cleanser which was fine too).</li>
            <li>My huge pores appear much smaller now and the oil is much less.</li>
            <li>The next day my skin had huge cystic acne all over the lower half of my face.</li>
            <li>I would not wanted to have spent more however, as it the spinning feature is not very strong and does not come with a variety of heads.</li>
            <li>I could maybe see this working really well for someone with oily skin or skin that is prone to breakouts, however, those of you with dry skin, steer far away from this one.</li>
            <li>My Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System arrived about a week/week and a half ago, and just from the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li>The product came in a few days ago, although I thought it would be a lot bigger than it actually is, it is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It came super fast and the Amazon price is at least $10 cheaper than buying in store.</li>
            <li>I saw some people saying that the brush is too harsh for their face, but I felt it was super soft...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to cleanse well but not so harsh that you feel as though you are ripping your face off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I like the product and it is not very messy to use (I use it in the shower and at the sink at night).</li>
            <li>The brush has very soft bristles for my sensitive skin and it has two speeds which i could alternate.</li>
            <li>I rarely break out and when I do, its right there and usually causes no major problems.</li>
            <li>I was debating about Clarisonic but couldn&#x27;t get past the huge price tag.  </li>
            <li>It is an ok buy,just i was expecting a bigger brush ,my bad ,part ok for the price and functionally travel size</li>
            <li>It is small and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>So I primarily now use it at night when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face</li>
            <li>I enjoy the small size.</li>
            <li>I have tried the more expensive clairsonic product, but opted to buy the olay system, as I really like all the olay Pro X Clear products.  </li>
            <li>The included sample isn&#x27;t much but what you get lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li>the brush feels gentle and it works well with Cetaphil cleanser, which I have been using for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She has wanted a cleansing system for a long time but the price of some of these can be a bit much.  </li>
            <li>skin is lighter, smooth, no more acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expected higher speed.</li>
            <li>Also, my pores haven&#x27;t gotten smaller and my face doesn&#x27;t feel any cleaner after using this product than it does normally.</li>
            <li>If you are not used to using exfoliators like this, the brush head may seem a bit rough at first</li>
            <li>Now, The Clarisonic will have a few extras, such as more speeds and additional attachments for the body, but if all you need is a high-quality brush for the face, why spend all the extra cash?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>When it was working it was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I use the scrubber with my normal face wash and can see and feel a big difference.  </li>
            <li>I get it pretty wet too and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it yet.</li>
            <li>I chose this to try out a electric face brush, as the data published says that using such a device increases cleaning efficiency by 6 times over normal washing by hand.</li>
            <li>I have discontinued the Pro-x for about 2 weeks now and things are going back to normal.</li>
            <li>Once I stopped using it, my skin recovered and went back to normal.</li>
            <li>When I stopped, my face went back to normal.</li>
            <li>It is a little aggravating after using this thing and still seeing little blackheads everywhere, but for the makeup removal and price, I think it is deserving of 3 1/2 stars...</li>
            <li>arrived in mail on time just as advertised would buy again as this is exactly what I expected based on description</li>
            <li>the brush isn&#x27;t too rough even on the higher speed.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin with the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li>It comes with a small face cleanser, which is nice as well (although extremely chemically in my opinion).</li>
            <li>But after using this device with the olay cleanser or back to my regular cleanser, the cotton ball barely have any brown color on it meaning my face has been really cleaned well!</li>
            <li>It literally takes a full week for the machine to work through the layers and layers of dead skin, dirt, and grime that you never knew you had.</li>
            <li>Something about the cleanser and my skin created a terrible reaction, which is now gone thanks to the healing love of my own products and a lot of water.</li>
            <li>You wet your face and the brush, use a bit of the cleanser that&#x27;s included (or, of course, your own), turn the brush on and \\&quot;gently move it around the face for approximately 60 seconds.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the full sized one - this can be used with any cleanser or soap.</li>
            <li>My skin type is all over the place, dry and flaky in certain areas, oily in others.</li>
            <li>And unlike with  my last facial brush, I don&#x27;t have to clean the whole countertop after I use it-no messy \\&quot;spraying\\&quot; of cleanser everywhere.</li>
            <li>The little motor inside turns plenty quickly to scrub my face and afterwords</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, my face has quit breaking out, my pores are smaller, and my fine lines are reduced.</li>
            <li>It was super-lightweight, very easy to hold and maneuver, and because of its smaller size and gentler action allowed me to use it in places I&#x27;d never successfully cleaned with the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s expected when first using a new facial cleanser or acne tx.</li>
            <li>After a certain amount of (unsuccessful) discussion, she said she could mail me a coupon within the next 2-3 weeks to buy another one locally.</li>
            <li>Costco has this same product for about the same price, but a large bottle of the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of a big daily face routine so this certainly helps out.</li>
            <li>The washing part took slightly longer because of the small brush head, but the time was more than made up by the much quicker rinse time.  </li>
            <li>This little brush is gentle yet cleanses very well.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this little machine and facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I am using the sample sized exfoliating face wash that came in the box, and find better results when I wet the brush, apply face wash on the brush, and then use it on my face, since the face wash is not easy to spread on the face directly.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what you expected to do; however, I have had powerful motor in my previous one.</li>
            <li>It takes a little more force than expected.  </li>
            <li>I love this little gadget, money well spent.  </li>
            <li>I do wish it had more power and would scrub a little harder</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite nice, but for my skin type,a little harsh.</li>
            <li>I truly believe or gives you that deep down clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Combination skin, break out prone.</li>
            <li>I did not get the deep  down clean that I strive for when cleansing my skin.    </li>
            <li>I occasionally use the included cleaner when I want something gentler, but usually I just use a tiny pea-sized amount of my Alba Acnedote scrub (which is all natural and my all-time favorite scrub) for about a minute before going to bed every day.  </li>
            <li>I love it, but it&#x27;s a little harsh for my older skin, so I use it maybe once every 2 or 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Extremely helpful in keeping dry parts of my face smooth and not flaky.  </li>
            <li>Although this is much cheaper than the $200 other brand, I have not seen any real improvement for the last week that I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking forward to what long term use of this brush will do for my skin!</li>
            <li>Definitely cheap enough to take a chance on, especially considering my wife just purchased the \\&quot;other one.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the little rotating brush did wonders on the very first use--I noticed a difference immediately.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin looks so clear and smoother than any other products, so I loved it until it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li>Although the cleanser works well, I might use my regular cleanser instead of buying a new bottle of the Olay.</li>
            <li>I saw instant results, which is always a plus when you&#x27;re trying something new</li>
            <li>and she has put a new head on it only once as well.  </li>
            <li>The next morning, I didn&#x27;t have any new zits, which hadn&#x27;t happened for me in over a year.  </li>
            <li>but I simply needed new batteries.</li>
            <li>a facial exfoliator is a \\&quot;can&#x27;t live</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now, I&#x27;m battling some new pimples that came up recently</li>
            <li>The batteries are inside the handle, which lacks a &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s hard to pull off without using your teeth (ouch!), but I love the feel of my skin after use.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable in comparison to other items or treatments on the market.  </li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable in comparison to other items or treatments on the market.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t until I added in this on a daily basis that it really became smoother and rough spots that would come on cold/dry days where I live are completely gone.</li>
            <li>I actually think the only reason it died was because I changed bathrooms and it was in near direct water in the new shower.  </li>
            <li>Love this little thing!!!</li>
            <li>I tend to have really oily skin on my cheeks and dry skin on my forehead.</li>
            <li>, my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out, and I use it on my neck too and it feels so much nicer.    </li>
            <li>I use it with Cetaphil and it works very well for my skin, which tends to be dry and</li>
            <li>I use it once a day before bed, on my face and neck, twice a day would dry my skin too much.</li>
            <li>It exfoliated gently with just water and seemed to contribute to her healing by removing the build up of dry skin.</li>
            <li>It probably does clean your skin to an extent, but If I had the chance, I would just save up and buy one of the sturdier ones that will last a long long time.</li>
            <li>so I have dry patches while some areas are very oily.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Olay Professional Advanced Cleansing System in order to help with exfoliating dry skin and getting rid of black heads.</li>
            <li>I had used a headband to hold back as much of my hair as possible at my hairline after reading in the instructions that you cannot use the brush too close to your hairline or it will twirl your hair into dreadlocks.</li>
            <li>I looked at the more expensive ones, but I felt they wanted too much for them.  </li>
            <li>There is only so much time in the day for extra beauty regimens.</li>
            <li>This works just enough to get the dirt,skin, and grime off but still be gentle enough for nightly use.  </li>
            <li>so I hadn&#x27;t even thought of getting something like this until i noticed white bumps and larger pores and no matter how much I scrubbed my face</li>
            <li>When it comes to facial brushes, you can spend up to $100 and over, or you can spend under $30-either way, as an esthetician, I can tell you-aside from price, they are  really all the same.</li>
            <li>and the battery seems to last pretty long in this.  </li>
            <li>It is worth 10x less.  </li>
            <li>For years I thought I was washing my face with a wash cloth and my very thorough \\&quot;routine.\\&quot; After using this, and seeing how much I had been missing...</li>
            <li>The battery compartment could have been designed much better so that it can at least be pried open!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t much care for the cleanser it came with, but I mix it with a cleanser I made with a basic soap with a couple drops of essential oils in it or with my dandruff shampoo,</li>
            <li>Based on conversations with several friends, young and old,  I went withe Olay Pro.  </li>
            <li>The sample scrub that comes with the unit is just enough for 2 uses, and the battery compartment is a real challenge to open.</li>
            <li>Has lessened the appearance of some old red spots from some old acne spots on my chin.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, fits in hand well without slipping out, waterproof/submersible, comes with two real (Duracell) batteries too, been using it almost every day for a month and no signs of power degeneration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your skin is breaking out more after using this, you may be using the wrong cleanser or using this product too much.</li>
            <li>If your skin is breaking out more after using this, you may be using the wrong cleanser or using this product too much.</li>
            <li>African American with very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But this product i feel is even worth less that 15$, if i talk about the cheep plastic quality.</li>
            <li>although when I was in a store and felt the Clarisonic brushes, wow, those things are INCREDIBLY soft, so that&#x27;s the only reason I took a star off-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, no dry patches anymore, and no impurities.</li>
            <li>This is the first facial cleaner I have tried and I wish I had done it long before now.</li>
            <li>Although I have been shopping with Amazon for several years, and really appreciate the product reviews when making a buying decision (whether or not I ultimately buy the product from Amazon)</li>
            <li>It along with the head is pretty small, therefore it takes a while to do your whole face.</li>
            <li>It seemed like such a simple concept and wondered if it would make that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels so smooth and it only takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li>the battery last a long time, I have not changed mine since I first started using it.</li>
            <li>I think a cream cleanser works really well with this product because the nature of the device is to exfoliate and the cream cleanser can keep the skin hydrated while that is happening, but that&#x27;s just a personal opinion, no medical evidence.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but using the brush in conjunction with my regular routine has left my skin much smoother than it ever was before.  </li>
            <li>I checked local stores and it&#x27;s at least 10 dollars more elsewhere.</li>
            <li>When I read the product&#x27;s ingredients, there didn&#x27;t seem to be any magic to it - just the same sort of common sense stuff you&#x27;d buy at the drug store to combat acne.</li>
            <li>My skin is exfoliated, soft, not dry, and is glowing in the morning.</li>
            <li>Of all of the beauty products that I have tried in the last ten years, this one is the very best.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but using the brush in conjunction with my regular routine has left my skin much smoother than it ever was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even if one of these dies every two years, you would still have to buy 5 of these at Amazon&#x27;s present price to cost as much as one Clarisonic, which is ten years of use, and I guarantee one</li>
            <li>The Olay system really does work as well as the more expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Dont need to overdue on the time, just a quick few min in the shower and BAM - done.  </li>
            <li>This facial cleansing system does a really good, but unfortunately, the motor broke after a month.</li>
            <li>I love the brush and the replacement brushes are very affordable but the sample cleanser it comes with is so expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather spend more money and buy a high quality product such as the Clarisonic that has warranty and will last than waste money on something that will only work for a short period of time.</li>
            <li>now it is works just fine for me and has cut my morning routine down by a minute my skin is definitely smoother my pores seem smaller.</li>
            <li>sometimes the price on amazon waivers up and down, right now it&#x27;s $23.99</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and only use it about once a week with the exfoliating gel.</li>
            <li>I will now buy another brush for my teenage daughter, who has very sensitive skin, and tends to break out.</li>
            <li>my skin feels soother after using it, however i have very sensitive skin, so i can only use 2 to 3 times a week</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I use this with the Aveeno facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>but this happens sometimes only because i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>tried not pushing so hard, or using it so long, but in the end, my skin looks better when I use my old skincare regime.</li>
            <li>I alternate with Cetaphil, which is very gentle, and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li>so I substituted it for Aveeno&#x27;s cream based facial cleanser and it leaves my face so clear and radiant!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but I hope with continued use, my skin will stay clear!</li>
            <li>While it is not like a deep microdermabrasion, consistent use will definitely yield results that I could not get outside of a Dr’s office.</li>
            <li>It perfoms just as well as other brand priced much higher.</li>
            <li>I wish Olay will manufacture a small bag/box to store it so that I won&#x27;t need to use the original box.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I will go ahead and buy the more expensive version as I am totally satisfied with this.  </li>
            <li>It might not be the same exact thing but in my opinion its the same concept and your skin can only be so clean/cleaned/scrubbed.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a major improvement in my skin complexion.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical because this brush was so relatively inexpensive but have been very pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I debated between buying the Olay brush or the expensive clarisonic brush, and I&#x27;m glad I bought the $20 version!</li>
            <li>but I apparently didn&#x27;t realize my face could be cleaner!</li>
            <li>The cleanser will last a lot longer than most do to the fact you only have to use a small amount for it to do its job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; cleaner like other offerings at much higher prices and should not be compared to those.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any major improvement in my skin</li>
            <li>Last night I was sitting on the couch watching TV and happen to touch my forehead and just kept rubbing it because it was SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>It makes you rethink regular old soap and water!  </li>
            <li>I started off with the low speed the first few weeks to get used to it, then I switched to the fast speed.</li>
            <li>I occasionally read that others considered it to be too cheap and poorly manufactured, but that was pretty rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple of times so far, but I like it!</li>
            <li>My usually thrifty mother has the clarsonic model, which is pretty much exactly the same except that it pulses instead of rotates.  </li>
            <li>So I bought the Pro-X to exfoliate to give my skin a major overhaul.</li>
            <li>I used many different cleansers in the past and I will never go back or stop using this one.</li>
            <li>I brought this brush 5 days ago and I can already tell a major difference in the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li>May be a little more money then other products like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mine for a few months now, and since the very first use I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I have no regrets!</li>
            <li>Bristles are pretty soft and the rotation speed is fairly slow helping it do the job without too much abrasion.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the professional style that you have to spend 6x more on, this is not worth the money or the time wasted.  </li>
            <li>Price is right too compared to the ultra expensive brands available.  </li>
            <li>One round with this puppy fixed that right up, even on the gentler cycle.</li>
            <li>First of all - I am guy and bought the product as I felt my skin was blocked and have those occasional dry patches and bumps on my face.   </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t bother to read the back of the cleanser bottle (apply to wet/moist face) and I used it on dry skin.</li>
            <li>What you get in the box is the actual handheld device, a brush head that easily pops on and off the handheld device (they also sell brush heads separately so you can change those out when needed,) a small travel sized Olay cleanser, and 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>and I had to hold the button down continuously to get it to spin, then in the middle of the night, I&#x27;d suddenly start hearing a whirring sound from my bathroom</li>
            <li>I guess I didn&#x27;t really have a set expectation but wanted to try this particular product before investing in something more expensive!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She said it took a few days to notice any real difference in the cleaning action but that ultimately she feels her skin is much cleaner after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve recently found another product for adult acne--Clearasil Adult Daily Clear, with resorcinol and sulfur--these two products seem to be doing what I hoped the Olay brush would do for me.</li>
            <li>He had a bout with acne and need just a little something extra to keep his skin clean.  </li>
            <li>The tube that comes with it contains an adequate source of cleansing, though I&#x27;m lead to believe that she also sometimes uses plain dove soap as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans super deep down</li>
            <li>It was a little hard to pull the bottom off to place the batteries inside but other than that it made my face feel smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li>it seems quite fun to use at first but the interest dies down after a while as it is quite rough on my facial skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this in combination with the Olay microdermabrasion kit to address some skin issues I have been noticing lately including fine lines, brown spots, and breakouts.</li>
            <li>Other than that it really made my life easier in the mornings and have clear skin every day.</li>
            <li>Probably would be a great product if it worked, any amount of water and it stops working until fully dry again, although it says its made for use in the shower, its quite expensive for the product you actually get.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how all the expensive Cleansing systems work, but this is so great for the money I spent on it!</li>
            <li>I usually use the apricot scrubs to get my face clean</li>
            <li>really helps get rid of dry skin!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel velvety soft, which is fantastic in the winter months as I do get a few dry spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I do not know how I lived so long without it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit rough if you press too hard, but with gentle use feels just fine.  </li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t have any skin issues, for the price its so worth it to have this little luxury that is so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice system for the price, but if you are buying because you think you will have the same results as the more expensive clairsonic, you are wrong.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t bad for just cleaning your face although I would like a bit more pressure to clean my face.</li>
            <li>&quot; every few days for a deep clean.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean and some dead skin is lifted and washed away at the same time.</li>
            <li>I did use it for longer than I probably will on a regular basis, but I imagine with regular usage it will do a decent job of exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>I may be the wrong candidate to try this product as it does seem more targeted for women much older</li>
            <li>What I really wanted was something to clean my skin and exfoliate without irritating my Roseacea.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re managing problem skin (frequent outbreaks, clogged pores, blackheads and blemishes) and you&#x27;ve got a few hundred bucks to burn, then the Mia is definitely the better pick.</li>
            <li>I have been wanting the clarasonic for a long time but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price for it.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t compare it to any other product, but if you want a gentle massage and exfoliation without getting into it in a big expensive way, this Olay Professionals product is a good entree.</li>
            <li>I wish that this device would have more than one speed, which is very slow.</li>
            <li>At first my face was a little sensitive to it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used scrubbers and special cleansers but usually end up with irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used scrubbers and special cleansers but usually end up with irritated skin.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t spin very fast, well at least not as fast as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>The brush has a high and low speed and the unit is so simple to operate.  </li>
            <li>brush only has two settings- low and high.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive but high quality facial brush.</li>
            <li>For a basic daily cleansing system, I&#x27;d highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>The head also rotates much more slowly than any other brush I&#x27;ve used, even on its faster setting and with new batteries.  </li>
            <li>I try to use it consistently, but its hard when you don&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li>not only does it GENTLY clean your face from all the make-up, extra oil, and other things, but it definiely makes your skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>, this little system is definatley getting my face back on track and clear, I do believe that this cleanses 6x better than the average cleaner.</li>
            <li>The scrub head moves at a decent rotation speed on high setting, but once you press it against the facial skin with some pressure the speed dramatically reduced due to friction.</li>
            <li>There is a huge difference in quality to say the least.</li>
            <li>With those, you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about replacing batteries or changing the scrubby bit (you can buy replacements), because the scrubby is generally on the package when you buy it.</li>
            <li>I generally use it on the lower setting.</li>
            <li>general</li>
            <li>It did come with some facial cleanser which is nice but paying this much money for what I got was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li>I like it a lot and have seen a pronounced improvement in my skin&#x27;s general texture and shine.</li>
            <li>And now I use it with Obagi Clenziderm, which works well with it too and definitely helped clear up the acne.  </li>
            <li>IF I USED IT LONG ENOUGH TO SEE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE,</li>
            <li>The brush has a three month life, but who wants to use the same brush that long?</li>
            <li>I noticed improvement after one use, and daily thereafter, until my skin was completely clear after one week.  </li>
            <li>and if I do have the occasional spot, this helps it to clear up</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t get this gentle touch with maximum exfoliation with a &amp;#34;rag.&amp;#34; Plus it would take a long time to get the number of passes over the skin that this machine will accomplish in a short time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of my skin starting to clear up, I tried using it again.</li>
            <li>After I managed to open the battery compartment on the brush, I noticed there was a sticky, clear gel that covered the metal contacts where the batteries were supposed to go.</li>
            <li>am a 46 year old African American Female and to receive such compliments from my co-workers that made me feel REALLY good,&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is a common reaction for me with most cleansers, so I was not surprised that this did not work well for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this product to friends and if you are reading this considering buying it, it&#x27;s cheap enough that if you are not satisfied, you&#x27;re not out hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>Together with PanOxyl, has already helped to clear up my face after only a week.  </li>
            <li>I have combination/oily skin, with a mixed race background, and am 30 years old.  </li>
            <li>You do need to be careful about using it too close to the under-eye area as it can feel like its tugging or pulling on that gentle</li>
            <li>I am only 12 years old</li>
            <li>Using this one was no harder than hand-washing my face.  </li>
            <li>Only one try so far, but I like it.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised how different my skin felt afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I have battled with oily skin and acne througout the years but as you get a bit older acne products dry out a lot</li>
            <li>Perhaps I expected too much, but this device seems to make no difference at all to the way my face feels after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was worried that the CS or this one would leave me with very red, inflamed skin from the brushes and the cleansing action.  </li>
            <li>They do work differently, apparently.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve only used this 4 times so far</li>
            <li>The brush is soft enough and won&#x27;t hurt my skin, but I won&#x27;t recommend using this brush every day since it will thinner the skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and deep pores that often get clogged.</li>
            <li>so far i still can&#x27;t put in the battery, just can&#x27;t open it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used the old fashioned exfoliating pads and gloves with my brand of choice for facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was curious about the Mia but didn&#x27;t want to drop that much money on it.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far about two day apart, been four days since the last time and I feel no need to use it again yet.</li>
            <li>The brush is just soft enough.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser gets rid of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; but does not rough up my skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the cleaning scrub that comes with it although my skin is extra sensitive</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier and nearly a year later, I still use the product.  </li>
            <li>The brush is too soft and short.</li>
            <li>just had any effect on cleaning my face and bringing it back to my old self.</li>
            <li>It works really well for what we expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 47 year old women with Asian olive skin tone.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this product it left my skin soft and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently online shopping for the professional version of their competitor.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I had was how soft the bristles on the cleansing brush were.</li>
            <li>This thing barely even spins.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used generic, and I&#x27;m not a fan of how soft they are.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m careful to be gentle with the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m careful to be gentle with the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The batteries last 3 to 5 weeks - which surprised me....</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who is only 8 years old.  </li>
            <li>My \\&quot;old system\\&quot;- Ivory Soap and a scrubby facial sponge-</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but resilient, so it actually can exfoliate</li>
            <li>I am a 48 yr old male, and have oily skin.</li>
            <li>The Amazon price is also far cheaper than the in-store prices that I have seen locally.</li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS COMBINATION AND SENSITIVE WITH AN OCCASIONAL BREAKOUT....</li>
            <li>Also the brush barely does anything.</li>
            <li>Natural Anti-Wrinkle, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]].  </li>
            <li>the brush isn&#x27;t soft enough to my face.</li>
            <li>I will purchase one for my daughter in the near future.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft enough-</li>
            <li>That being said, 4 years later it completely stopped working and wouldn&#x27;t power on.</li>
            <li>All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!</li>
            <li>It took about a week for that problem area on my left cheek to completely disappear.  </li>
            <li>Younger looking and soft skin.  </li>
            <li>then why not provide a reasonable warranty on a product that I spent upwards of $200</li>
            <li>Why was my 30 year old skin reverting to my teenage years?  </li>
            <li>Fast and careful</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the basic soft brush attachment, but all I need.</li>
            <li>but I do use the exfoliator every so often for extra action.</li>
            <li>I am a 26 year old AA female.</li>
            <li>So, being a guy I don&#x27;t particularly care for lots of products &amp; messing about with exfoliating, cleansing, &amp; dry skin issues</li>
            <li>BUT I&#x27;ve been working regularly outdoors for nearly 4 years.</li>
            <li>As a 26 year old, I would get an occasional pimple or whatnot, but since using the cleanser, I haven&#x27;t had any.</li>
            <li>It does not rough the skin up.  </li>
            <li>And I would have been severely upset if I spent that much on a brush that wrecked my skin.  </li>
            <li>Soft enough for the face</li>
            <li>It feels like it barely moves</li>
            <li>But first use usually wouldn&#x27;t show much effect, so will wait after a longer use to give final verdict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>The rotating bristle brush is soft and the exfoliating wash is terrific too.</li>
            <li>Would be cautious about using it daily if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If anyone has sensitive skin, this is definitely not the way to go&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I have only used this twice so far but thought I&#x27;d review it.</li>
            <li>I that I came across this after so much money spent on the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Apparently the circular spinning can create wrinkles?  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets buying this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be curious to try the Clarisonic to see if it makes a visible difference, but again, I can&#x27;t really justify the price tag so for me</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough that her &amp;#34;peaches and cream&amp;#34; skin is not irritated.</li>
            <li>Using the Olay ProX feels like tiny ninja&#x27;s are spinning around my face, hacking off excess oil and dead skin cells with their tiny throwing stars, leaving my skin feeling smooth and baby-soft.</li>
            <li>I would agree that using the cleanser that comes with it might be too abrasive for regular use on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The brush on the Olay is soft and it has a couple different speed settings for rotation.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it works as described and loves this.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, it doesn&#x27;t require a lot of pressure to cleanse thoroughly, and it&#x27;s battery powered - simple!</li>
            <li>I still didn&#x27;t learn my lesson and decided maybe i cant use it daily and put to the side for a week and let my face completely heal.</li>
            <li>it was totally &amp;#34;fluff &amp; stuff&amp;#34; for the short-time it lasted... the Clairsonic in my professional opinion is exemplary of the fact that ... &amp;#34;A fool &amp; their Money are Soon Parted.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I use only natural products</li>
            <li>you can barely tell I ever had a problem-</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I would not buy this or only use this once a month</li>
            <li>My combination skin is only sensitive to chemicals and has no problems with abrasion or breakouts.  </li>
            <li>The brush is also much softer than what I expected</li>
            <li>My skin is a bit too sensitive to use it every day, so three or four mornings a week is enough.</li>
            <li>Like some have said, the first week or so using this brush is rough, especially if you are acne prone.  </li>
            <li>but no, when I looked in the mirror I saw that they became smaller and actually looked normally sized and not jurrasic-ending-meteor-craters.</li>
            <li>Now I use my normal facial cleansing product to wash my face of makeup, but I use the Olay pro-x cleansing system with my cleanser at the end to help with deep pore cleansing.  </li>
            <li>When I used my regular cleanser from Mario Badescu, everything went back to normal.</li>
            <li>it went back to normal speed the next day!  </li>
            <li>This product is useful to remove the dead skin in the face.</li>
            <li>, is the Pro-X better or worse than \\&quot;manual\\</li>
            <li>that it takes much longer and is more difficult to achieve the same results.</li>
            <li>Also the cream separately is kind of expensive</li>
            <li>I feel like it gets worse, then gets better.  </li>
            <li>It is so useful at getting rid of all the heavy makeup that I wear.</li>
            <li>You might have to go through a time of looking worse before you look better.</li>
            <li>This thing does make my skin feel really nice after using it in the morning, but by the evening, I&#x27;ve noticed that I always end up with a few small breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, and I also wear a CPAP machine so I can&#x27;t use a lot of harsh products on my face.  </li>
            <li>cream itself is a small tube as you will no doubt need to purchase a full size after about a month or two of using this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ok for cleaning but not a great exfoliator.</li>
            <li>When I saw this product, and all of its enthusiastic reviews, I was still skeptical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been let down so many times and not to mention the money wasted.</li>
            <li>I love how it works, but using it every day kinda makes my face feel raw and burning, so I do it like every other day or something like that.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, as long as you don&#x27;t put pressure on it or leave it on one spot for too long, it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any special products, just a plain facial scrub from St. Ives and the Olay Exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li>First of all although I appreciated the instructions in other reviews it wasn&#x27;t clear to me that the part that comes off is the little end piece that says \\&quot;OLAY</li>
            <li>Battery seems to last awhile, but if you are worried that the compartment is hard to take off, just put on some dishwasher gloves or latex gloves on and it opens easily.</li>
            <li>this little guy gets the job done and leaves me with lots of extra money for makeup and other goodies :)</li>
            <li>Its a little bit smaller than the other brands but its ok since its just for the face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that has dry or acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>Less break outs and fades away scars very gently.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish this came was the other attachments (if I would have read the description more closely, I would have spent the extra 5 dollars and purchased the toilettree brand because it not only comes with over 5 diff attachments</li>
            <li>My only critic is the amount of cleanser it came with was small but a quick trip to the pharmacy fixed that.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought them too soft, but the effect is less redness on my skin and a polished look that looks like I had a facial at the spa.</li>
            <li>And of course Amazon is taking it back and sending out a new one instantly.</li>
            <li>Usually go for about a minute and the higher speed and my face feels like new after.</li>
            <li>I have stress/hormonal acne since starting medical school and this system (along with some new products)</li>
            <li>I had been on two new topical prescriptions from my dermatologist (Retin-a Micro and Finacea) for about 1.5 months, and figured those would have purged my skin enough to not experience purging with this</li>
            <li>I have had this for a few months and probably am about ready for a new brush head...</li>
            <li>so much I tend to wash a little longer in certain places where the pores are bigger (especially in the summer because of oily skin)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product due the soft bristles that do not irritate my skin and the simplicity of using it.</li>
            <li>And even with two people using them so much, the batteries last very long.</li>
            <li>It really cleans deep uses little battery power and you can reuse the head for a decent time.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews and some articles comparing this to the Mia Clarisonic, I am happy I purchased this much less expensive but comparative option.</li>
            <li>I am using less produce (toner especially)to clean my skin, which in turn means I&#x27;m having fewer difficulties with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is much softer and it seems as if my breakouts occur less frequently.</li>
            <li>A washcloth can do a better job cleaning and exfoliating your face than the Pro-X can, and it is certainly less messy &amp; traumatic.</li>
            <li>Slightly stiffer bristles could be more helpful to slough off dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>Just gentle enough and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday now but with mild facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>The only issue is the brushes get funky really quick and are not cheap to replace.</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s gentle enough to use once a day, but for sensitive skin I&#x27;d advise every other day or once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews that said it will take the place of that higher-priced unit, and owning both, I would say that I disagree - further, I think I could PROBABLY have used the other unit with a sensitive or gentle brush and saved my money on this one.  </li>
            <li>So when I use the Pro X, I move it up, down, left, right all the while...rather than holding it in place.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and only use it once a week, but I have seen a big improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>What I did not like what that there was not any specific instructions, especially of what you should and should not do since the skin on your face is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I must say i was very exceptical about this product, i mean i got it for 19 dollars and it has more than 1,200 reviews rating like if it was just plain</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine a long time and the bristles are like new.</li>
            <li>I think this works fine and am not sure I would invest in a more expensive version.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and everytime I use it</li>
            <li>but they are pretty much half the price of the product itself</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted for alot less than in the stores.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and read about the cleansing brush</li>
            <li>After unboxing the Pro-X I was disappointed by how chinsey it felt in my hand even for an $18 item, I was still excited nevertheless to try it out and reveal my magically lovely skin.</li>
            <li>I would like it to be a little rougher on my face to feel like it cleans a little better but</li>
            <li>But now I use it no less than 2 times daily.</li>
            <li>Although I am not sure that the change in my skin is completely due to using this product, I am sure it has helped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this device for the past 2 weeks and see a significant difference in how my skin is acting.</li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin, and the device itself causes no long lasting irritation.</li>
            <li>I did some research and found that the other products that were in the $125 dollar range did exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li>SORRY, I WAS HOPING FOR MORE ACTION!  </li>
            <li>so here&#x27;s an alternative for some who are willing to try: if you bought this product but are still wishing/wanting for an more expensive product such as the mia2 EVEN though i think they do the SAME thing, try different cleansers with this.</li>
            <li>the current subscribe-and-save price, this little baby is unbeatable and the negatives are pretty much completely forgotten about.</li>
            <li>FIrst of all, I was little bit surprised that it was smaller than I thought at first.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The sample size of the cleanser is also a nice tester, but I was a little disappointed as to the size, of course the more the merrier.  </li>
            <li>My face is acne-prone and I use an acne prescription, Differin, which regenerates the skin with new skin cells, so I can&#x27;t exfoliate everyday since it would be too harsh, although I wish I could because it makes my face feel amazingly clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is even with the 2 speed settings it doesn&#x27;t go fast enough to really get rid of dead skin sometimes.</li>
            <li>It is slow, even on high speed and brushes are too soft to get much done.  </li>
            <li>and now my skin is raw, full of acne that is emerging, red and blotchy.</li>
            <li>In less than two weeks, my skin is cleaner, clearer, smoother and just plain better looking.  </li>
            <li>I get a few pimples from time to time, and I have normal skin (perhaps a little more on the dry side).</li>
            <li>There are two speeds, high and low, but I typically use the high speed setting.</li>
            <li>Or, if you have very dry skin and want to massage a moisturizing mask on, then I think this would be a gentle enough utensil for you.  </li>
            <li>This product really does the work, I have been using it every other day for a week now</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d probably get jut as much out of the non-battery powered scrubby tools that some other cleansers come with.</li>
            <li>I like this one so much that I&#x27;m not interested in trying any others yet.</li>
            <li>Having used this, I am now going to buy a Clarisonic plus System, which I had thought about in the beginning, but having never used this type of product before, was not willing to spend so much money on something I might not like.</li>
            <li>Installing the batteries was a breeze thanks to the help of other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m keeping it, but it&#x27;s just little bit too soft to really do much exfoliating.</li>
            <li>The flakes are hard to clean from the brushes.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and other products made my skin feel like a greased paper towel.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the Pro-X had a gentler brush which I really like.</li>
            <li>Battery charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough to give any real scrub.</li>
            <li>So much that due to her hair and my hair being tangled around the part where the brush head attaches to the handheld device, that eventually, the brush died.</li>
            <li>I have not used any other products like this, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I am not willing to pay that much again.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference other than my skin did feel softer afterwards.</li>
            <li>(the other time I wash my face during the day I use a washcloth) and my skin is so much softer and smoother now.</li>
            <li>I first cleansed my face with Pond&#x27;s Cold cream, rinse that off, and put a tiny bit more of the cream on my damp face.</li>
            <li>My skin was drying out due to too much glycolic acid use, so I had to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always seemed to be very cystic acne prone with extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Surprisingly, due to its price, it really works well.  </li>
            <li>It is very small and light weight and can be used every day.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried other cleansing systems, but I&#x27;m not going to be so fast in spending $150</li>
            <li>I have owned a Clarisonic Mia for a few years and only wish I had tried this first and saved a LOT of money!</li>
            <li>Only change I would make would be to make the head a little bigger like the original youthful essence product and offer different attachments.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this everyday because it is a little bit too time consuming, but after using it for 3-4 a week, my skin has a glow that I love.</li>
            <li>After the third week of use and immediately putting on my normal facial moisturizer after the shower use, I would wake up the next day with a sore spot on my chin and around mouth.  </li>
            <li>etc.)tend to get my skin kind of overexcited if used too often, so that it gets rough from trying (apparently) to overcome the loss of cells or protective layers.  </li>
            <li>There was not a single difference I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li>Did not notice that it has only the facial brush and for a few dollars more, the other brands come with a variety of attachments.  </li>
            <li>My cheeks and nose are always dry (live in the Northeast) but my chin is oily and tends to break out.  </li>
            <li>I usually use it about every other day and feel that it gets my face very clean.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using them because the skin on my face would peel off leaving ugly red blotches even after using a great moisturizer from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>I was completely amazed at how much of a difference I saw in just a few days.</li>
            <li>It really does help clear away dead skin cells from the face.</li>
            <li>Been to dermatologists multiple times and the only thing to ever clear it up was Accutane, which I&#x27;ve been through twice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and it really has helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>For personal reasons,my skin is very thin,after I used,my face is always red and dry.</li>
            <li>My forehead is completely clear and my chin only gets the occasional blemish every once in a while.</li>
            <li>I use to only remove makeup with remover wipes and then use my fingers to wash my face but after using this I will never go back to my old regimen.</li>
            <li>so if you have sensitive skin, use it on low speed and low pressure, it wont irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>Brush is much rougher on my skin than I had expected, I stopped using it after a month when I noticed my skin was getting too irritated, just washing my face with a washcloth works well enough for me</li>
            <li>It was very affordable although not as big of a brush as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Not as big or as fast as I expected.</li>
            <li>But I don´t feel the need to use it everyday because it really takes all the natural oils from the skin.</li>
            <li>I use one regularly at home, and as I travel fairly frequently and do not wish to pack the brush I use at home, I bought a second brush and gave myself the indulgent pleasure of brush I use exclusively for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike</li>
            <li>The blue design ones are soft and I don&#x27;t feel that they exfoliate enough.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a simple idea of a rotating brush, but it is soft enough not to irritate.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt almost the same as it does after a professional facial and just for $20.  </li>
            <li>Only thing that concerns me is the fact that it spins in a complete circle opposed to spinning back and forth like the Clarisonic, which helps with wear and tear on the skin.</li>
            <li>I thought that I could get the same exfoliation benefits from an old fashioned face brush or a facial scrub.</li>
            <li>This did not dry my cheeks and took care of the blackheads immediately.</li>
            <li>This is just as good in my opinion and does everything I expected the expensive system to do.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve never really been one to spend a lot of time on a skincare regimen, as I get older, and as winter turns my skin drier, I am working on trying to resolve some issues with my skin.</li>
            <li>I was tempted to buy the expensive different brand but thought I should see if i liked using a device before putting out the cash.  </li>
            <li>Although I do not use the Pro-X cleanser (product shy because of sensitive skin), the took works fabulously with my cleanser!</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised how small it was, but I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised how small it was, but I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>This didnt work as well as I had hoped and actually ended up irritating my skin more than anything.</li>
            <li>I pre-wash my face first and try the product, and it still did not clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I got mine at [...] and just love how deep it peels my face and neck without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the brush portion would be a little more stiff- almost like a toothbrush-</li>
            <li>I did not find anything special about it, and I hardly use it now.</li>
            <li>My skin used to get extremely dry and very flakey in the winter, to the point where I was using heavy night-creams and oils with limited success.  </li>
            <li>The product works just fine but was a little smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks in this very dry winter and have noticed a couple dry spots that feel a little better.</li>
            <li>I think the brisles are right on, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little drying at first</li>
            <li>the first time i used it it broke me out just one little pimple in my chin, but I didnt mind becuz</li>
            <li>major problem with this product is that the motor only spins in one direction.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have major acne or anything, but enough to annoy me.</li>
            <li>know the improvement in my skin is not due to the serum because I have been using the serum since last year.</li>
            <li>I have even tried washing my face first with a facial sponge or other method and then following up with this</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already seen a major different!</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s less gentle than an ordinary washcloth -- which also happens to be a lot less expensive and more effective.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes but just can&#x27;t deal with the rotary spinning that makes you work harder.  </li>
            <li>I shall use this brush as long as I can and would recommend it to all who need a clean face without trating the tender facial skin harshly.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, my terrible experience with the Pro-X sent me right out to purchase a Clarisonic which I have been using for several months now and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Cons: It slows down after a few months and the brushes wear out a bit, I&#x27;m sure that you can add a few batteries in though and it will be fast cleansing again.</li>
            <li>, after my first use I figured I might at least have a new laundry stain scrubber...</li>
            <li>I thought the Pro-X would work well, but would be more time-consuming and inconvenient than my normal routine, and I was only half right.  </li>
            <li>You do have to put a little pressure on it if you are trying to clear blackheads because the gentle brush doesn&#x27;t do enough without that bit of pressure.</li>
            <li>I am a little upset though as two days after I got it one of the big warehouse stores I shop at had it on sale for a few dollars more</li>
            <li>I rarely use it with the exfoliating cream that came with it but do occasionally for a little extra scrub.</li>
            <li>Takes three years off your age the 1st time you use it, Not rough, but soft and still works to remove dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>My skin was not rough or dry before, it has always had a tendency to be soft, but never like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the first three uses my pores appear smaller and blackheads are less visible if not gone.</li>
            <li>The first time i used it, bubbles from my facial wash turned a slightly greyish</li>
            <li>I have had only 2-3 small zits since buying this and the cleansing brush clears them up quickly.</li>
            <li>At first I was worried about the bristles being hard, but they are really soft!</li>
            <li>and has dealt with mild to moderate acne for the past years, stating from when I was 12 and now 20.</li>
            <li>Hard to tell if it makes a difference, but for the very small price, I FEEL like I am getting my face, neck and décolleté cleaner and exfoliated, so I think it is a good value.</li>
            <li>My acne is going away from my face finally, clean and small pores!</li>
            <li>I quickly found that my makeup looked better, it wasn&#x27;t sitting on dead, flaky skin (sorry, I know, gross).</li>
            <li>so I spent a long time looking for an affordable option with largely positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This was a plus, but the brush head went bad pretty fast and it would have been even better if it came with other types of non-brush heads.</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s a great product, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Plus a clean face shows the wrinkles less, or a dirty face shows the wrinkles a lot more.  </li>
            <li>I would have expected a bit more or extra brush head at least for price.  </li>
            <li>I had one side of my face that was really scarred and had dark marks everywhere from acne.</li>
            <li>I had one side of my face that was really scarred and had dark marks everywhere from acne.</li>
            <li>but in general  my pores  look the same , and I feel like  </li>
            <li>The brush is quite gentle, but it really does remove rough, dead skin.</li>
            <li>The other thing I use is Origins facial micordermabrasion scrub, Modern Friction.</li>
            <li>Package doesn&#x27;t come with extra brush heads  Hard to clean brush head</li>
            <li>I think it might be because I&#x27;ve already been exfoliating regularly (Aveda&#x27;s tourmaline scrub), and so there might not be as much of a difference due to that.</li>
            <li>The most common complaints I read from other reviewers were as follows:</li>
            <li>I cut back to using it every other day because it felt like it was drying out my skin too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products and they always left me feeling like I still had the whole day on my face.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne for a long time, and now into my adult years, I was sometimes embarrassed because of how my face looked.</li>
            <li>but I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying one of these because it is not remotely close to the same thing.</li>
            <li>and I use it on the lower speed for daily cleansing, it is not rough on my skin even using it every day.</li>
            <li>I still get minor adult acne, and my skin didn&#x27;t feel cleaner than before.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets, only that I did not get it sooner.  </li>
            <li>This product surprised me especially for such a low price.</li>
            <li>but I could feel a difference after the first few times using it.</li>
            <li>It did make a few blemishes surface the first week</li>
            <li>The cleansing cream that came in a tube with the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System was a total rip-off.</li>
            <li>I say don&#x27;t waste money on this one though unless you&#x27;re looking for a tester to see if you would be interested in a pricier one.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought this type of brush, so just have few thoughts about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not quite sold that it&#x27;s cleaning my face as well as it claims because I still see marks on the cotton wool when I use my toner.&lt;br /&gt;The first few times</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a face cleaner just spend the money and go with clairsonic, i did and wish i wouldnt have wasted the money on this one first.</li>
            <li>the first few days of using this, some of the blackheads formed into pimples, because the dirt was being lifted out of the pore, basically.</li>
            <li>I wanted a higher speed to exfoliate my dead skin.</li>
            <li>After the first few days, I immediately bought one for my mom too.</li>
            <li>The product is small and yet powerful.</li>
            <li>it is a small tool,i dont know if it is useful.</li>
            <li>I experience breakouts on my t-zone when I use this, and the bristles are pretty harsh imho.</li>
            <li>The bristles are rough, and I felt like it made my skin redder than it normally is.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the other expensive brand like Clarisonic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because I live in an extremely dry climate, it is necessary to exfoliate to allow maximumize my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it will help to make my rough facial hair a bit looser and easier to shave, hence the main reason I purchased this</li>
            <li>My skin, which was getting rough patches as I get older, has smoothed out and my skin looks radiant and significantly younger than my</li>
            <li>Just hold the device horizontally (with the brush facing away from you) and then gently wiggle the battery compartment up and down</li>
            <li>Great for travelling too because it is not too heavy, I am hoping that after another few weeks of usage that my acne can be a thing of the past, fingers crossed!</li>
            <li>After having made it through my teens and early early adolescence pretty much pimple free -- at 28 years old my skin started to take a turn for the worst.</li>
            <li>I am 33 (woman) and the skin on my face is mixed, normal to oily on the T-zone and very dry for the rest.</li>
            <li>My face was definitely smoother and had less breakouts after the initial breakthrough period (your skin may break out when first using it because of dirt and impurities rising to the surface of the skin).  </li>
            <li>This product works the same, if not better, then many other more expensive competing versions.</li>
            <li>I mean, even saying how it is better than that other $300 product....</li>
            <li>it was probably due to oil and dirt and getting older, since I have never had issues before.</li>
            <li>It does not have the power of the clarisonic or the other tools, but it does a decent job if you use a granular type exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li>my fine lines are slowly disappearing!  </li>
            <li>I am often told I look young for my age (48 years old) and I have spent decades merely using a mild cleanser and rich moisturizing cream (both less than $10 each)</li>
            <li>super soft brush, clearer skin~ smaller pores, less black heads.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft, so I&#x27;m not sure how much exfoliating is actually happening.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use, it&#x27;s very gentle, yet abrasive enough to remove dead skin and unclog pores.</li>
            <li>I had dry patches around my nose and chin that got red and irritated after I washed my face which wouldn&#x27;t calm down until after an hour.</li>
            <li>The brush is pretty soft and stops spinning if you press too hard.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s very little difference between the high and low modes that she just uses it on high all the time.</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to my little mini facial massage at night, my face looks a lot better, and it&#x27;s at least as convenient as my old wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I have no complaints and no need at the moment to spend 5x as much on the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>I am using my usual face wash (Aveeno Ultra Calming in the morning and Aveeno Essentials Detoxifying Scrub in the evening) and right off the bat</li>
            <li>I will be surprised if it holds up very long.</li>
            <li>They look like the dirt is being scrubbed out of them, and I can only hope that the pores will get smaller if I continue to use this brush, since one week is not really long enough to show major results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clarisonic is gentle on sensitive skin, and has even-ed out my skin tone, instead of leaving it raw and red.</li>
            <li>In the past I have had great results with glycolic peels but they can be expensive and I was looking for a cheaper exfoliating alternative.</li>
            <li>I suffer from sensitive, acne-prone, dry skin</li>
            <li>my skin has become extremely dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>The whole half of my eye was blood covered....</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes for this are less than $10 on Amazon, whereas the replacement heads for the Clarisonic can be up to four times that much.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, fairly dry, but deal with frequent break outs on my chin.</li>
            <li>It really is helping my skin, diminishing black heads and exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I can already see my skin appears much smoother and pores also are less noticeable .</li>
            <li>My peeling dry skin is under control and my skin is soooo soft.</li>
            <li>It seems like my skin is too dry &amp; the brush head is too soft</li>
            <li>I have hormonal adult acne with lots of dry patches</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive, over 50 skin.  </li>
            <li>When using my hands (gently) with my face wash I get a slight rosacea flare up, but with using this brush, I get no flare up</li>
            <li>I also use the St. Ives apricot scrub once a week with the brush and its has really diminished the black heads.</li>
            <li>It does exfoliate, but I still had black heads on the tip of my nose after using this for about a week straight now, morning and night.</li>
            <li>Do you have sensitive dry skin?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly exfoliating and even works to exfoliate the lips, but gently.  </li>
            <li>I use this every night and my skin is much clearer and breaks out so much less.</li>
            <li>I have a dry mature completion</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, so I have an oily t-zone, and dry and sensitive cheeks.</li>
            <li>My pores are less visible and my skin seems much smoother.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still keeping my skin much clearer than in the past and my skin has developed a healthier looking glow to it.</li>
            <li>battery is not powerful enough for the real polishing and cell renewal I am looking for.</li>
            <li>It is small, light, and can get wet with no malfunctioning.  </li>
            <li>.Batteries don&#x27;t last long so the scrubbing action is lacking .I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Its been over 6 months and so far I can only count 2 minor blemishes.</li>
            <li>the small tube of exfoliant that comes with the brush: It is probably too harsh for most people.</li>
            <li>I went to the dermatologist, got RX to try to tame the bumps, but nothing really worked until I started using this brush to wash!</li>
            <li>Be aware that scrubbing your face intensely can make the pores worse.</li>
            <li>Over the past few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed the my skin is not a flaky for dryness as it has been and my skin tone looks better.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not a total waste;-)</li>
            <li>I replaced the batteries, but it did nothing to change the now super slow speed.  </li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin, so using a washcloth and also using the exfoliating cleansers so often in my attempts to control dry patches left me with red, irritated skin...and still flaky.  </li>
            <li>It really forces the cleanser to get deep down into my pores and fight any acne/scars that I have and really make the acne either less noticeable/go away.</li>
            <li>I think the key is using it daily, but it adds very little time to my regimen and is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a smart little product.  </li>
            <li>-- Additionally the speeds/modes offered are not long enough</li>
            <li>The brush is gentle, it doesnt feel harsh at all, the 2-speed setting seems adecuate to start with the slow one and after a while go to the full speed.</li>
            <li>It will be rough and cause irritation and lots of dry skin and peeling if used with too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I have really acne-prone skin, especially on my cheeks, and I have a ton of black heads everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I have desert dry skin, and no matter how much I exfoliate or how rough the product, I still suffer from scaly patches of skin.</li>
            <li>-- I only know that the Olay causes a lot less injury to my face while still getting the makeup really off, either it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; or uses a softer brush head, or both.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, which has caused black heads, and white heads.</li>
            <li>just what i expected for the price - not super powerful though has two speeds</li>
            <li>Although the brush was super soft, it still irritated my skin and made my face worse.</li>
            <li>, it has a seal that keeps it tight so you can use it in the shower, but the design of the handle doesn&#x27;t give you much to grip when trying to remove the battery cover.</li>
            <li>But after using this product the first time, my face felt scratched and raw.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s marked on the device which side is positive up and which side is negative up.</li>
            <li>My facial cleansing foam is always gentle so the facial scrub slightly but visibly improve my skin condition.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to use an extreme aveeno moisturizer just to get my face back to normal.</li>
            <li>This is coming from a 53 year old woman who has had hard cored, large pores all of her life.  </li>
            <li>I also got a few compliments from friends that I have a certain \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am CERTAIN that I can provide a very similar cleansing experience with a face brush (which I am about to buy next) and a little elbow grease.</li>
            <li>As I age, my facial skin has developed a very specific dry T-zone and I could never moisturize enough.</li>
            <li>I really like this little</li>
            <li>It comes with a little beaded wash thingie, like the st ives apricot scrub that I gently massaged into my face and neck,  </li>
            <li>For me, it may be a little too gentle.</li>
            <li>I noticed if I applied too much pressure and concentrated on one area and did not move in circular motions as the bush rotated, then it would feel a little abrasive on that area.  </li>
            <li>When I first used this product I was completely shocked that my pores were actually empty clean!!</li>
            <li>I use my Olay PRO-X Advanced Cleasing System everyday!!!</li>
            <li>I have very dry, flakey skin in my T-Zone in the winter and am recently dealing with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>(I was a little afraid it would be like an electric toothbrush and droplets would fly everywhere), and her skin is brighter.  </li>
            <li>This little device really amps up the facial experience.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels silky smooth immediately after using, I have little to none dead skin, which was a problem I had from just using a washcloth.</li>
            <li>They have about a sentence on it, and it doesn&#x27;t do justice to what a pain it really is, which is why I think this little gasket will actually wear out from the pressure</li>
            <li>Even slight pressure really slows down the spinning brush, even with new batteries.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product as opposed to the more expensive Clairsonic to see if these little machines really worked.  </li>
            <li>I had the full size clarasonic at one point, so when I received this, I was a little surprised it was so small.</li>
            <li>Hard core top of pores soften and then are gone after a few days.  </li>
            <li>The device works really, hands down!</li>
            <li>Great product for a lot less money than other expensive products</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think that this cheaper brand deserves to be rated bad for still doing a good job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear lotion on my face because I&#x27;m afraid of breaking out, but don&#x27;t feel like I need it with how amazing my skin feels.</li>
            <li>Feel stupid for paying $22 and believing all those great reviews.  </li>
            <li>The brush head is smaller than the Clarisonic, that is both good and bad.</li>
            <li>I knew a drugstore brand couldn&#x27;t be as nice as a $200 one, but I&#x27;m surprised at just how bad this product is--</li>
            <li>I love the cleaning feel of my skin after using it every day as i am getting less and less black heads on my tzone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will post an update after a few week of usage, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll clear, and keep clear some pores that seem to stay clogged and therefore look larger.</li>

            <li> yet it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The best way to use it is to massage cleanser into your face and then use the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best investments I ever made.</li>
            <li> and i must admit i am quite impressed.</li>
            <li> so great to have cleaner, smoother feeling skin!</li>
            <li> and my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> It is perfect!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> It was delivered in great time...especially since it was during Christmas!  </li>
            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> (although the spa has wonderful tea, and the bathrobes are to die for!)  </li>
            <li> My skin feels great after!</li>
            <li> I feel that for the price this is a wonderful exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> I felt wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use this about every 2-3 days, and my face looks great!</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro x advance system is a wonderful addition, if you have some skin issues!</li>
            <li> I also ordered one for my Mom because this works great!</li>
            <li> I almost feel like those proactive people on TV lol!  </li>
            <li> I cannot say that it does a superb job cleaning, as makeup residues still deposit on my towels after makeup remover, face cleanser, and using this product as indicated.</li>
            <li> I found the Olay pro-x and am so happy with it!  </li>
            <li> You did a great job!</li>
            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> I will tell you about this product AMAZING !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome tool, have had it 5 years</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to have perfect skin again!</li>
            <li> but the brush workes great!</li>
            <li> Very happy with quality for the price!</li>
            <li> turned out perfect.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job!  </li>
            <li> my make up application is flawless and my skin has this radiance its never had before!</li>
            <li> it is perfect.</li>
            <li> but I use Oil of Olay and it works great!</li>
            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful wonderful wonderful!</li>
            <li> as a man it feels really great on my face!!</li>
            <li> I use the cleanser as well as a scrub with this and am very very happy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best bang for your buck).</li>
            <li> Great cost x benefit!  </li>
            <li> Please dont be brainwashed into thinking that you need to spend $150 plus to get good results!!!</li>
            <li> I was soo impressed that I immediately returned my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the $150 one, but the Olay one is awesome</li>
            <li> For best results, replace the brush head every 3 months or sooner if bristles become deformed.    </li>
            <li> I ordered this instead and am very happy.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to find the best face scrubber, the clearasonic was named the best</li>
            <li> My skin looks the best</li>
            <li> But the best part is the massage that my face gets - it feels like a spa treatment every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Great price!</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the quality of this product when comparing the price to others but it is great!  </li>

            <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>

            <li> The brush is perfect!</li>
            <li> The combination seems to be excellent - this brush and the cleanser.</li>

            <li> I saw the Olay X-Pro and saw the value was great!</li>
            <li> The best part is, you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told by the user of this, whom I bought it for, this is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> For almost two months I&#x27;ve been doing research on the best cleansing brush out there.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that it is waterproof, it is easier for me just to do it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>

            <li> My complexion is clearer now than it&#x27;s ever been, I&#x27;m very happy about that.</li>
            <li> and it works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I cannot compare this to the Clarsonic because I have never used it, but if you are like me and wanted one and couldnt afford it, this cleansing system is an awesome alternative.</li>
            <li> Great gift idea!</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly in your hand and you can use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Excellent feeling after washing face.</li>

            <li> Skin looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> Size - I would say this is one of the best selling points for me over the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite part of my skin care routine!!!!</li>

            <li> This works great!  </li>
            <li> It works great!  </li>
            <li> This has been the best skincare purchase I have ever made (and as someone who has oily skin, prone to breakouts, I&#x27;ve made a lot of them).  </li>
            <li> I especially love the price tag of this rather than spending over $100 on the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Not the best results.</li>
            <li> can help exfoliate so ordered this before investing in clarisonic brush and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Great item and seller!</li>

            <li> I am very happy with this product and recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scrubber is perfect for combination skin.</li>
            <li> If your just trying the product its the perfect kit.</li>
            <li> Does the job and works great!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful!</li>
            <li> and so grateful for the wonderful reviews that helped solidify my purchase.</li>

            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> The brush does a great cleaning.  </li>

            <li> Great value and great product.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, and I don&#x27;t often leave rave reviews.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  </li>
            <li> I did buy one that had to be returned because the brush wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;click\\&quot; onto the unit, but amazon was great with the return.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>

            <li> I am happy that the unit is waterproof, so I can use it in the shower.</li>

            <li> The exfoliating cleanser is great  </li>
            <li> The brush system itself is great and withstands use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> 2013- Still working great.</li>
            <li> made it a joy to use.</li>
            <li> The olay microdermabrasion kit is also great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for cleaning</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and looks great.  </li>
            <li> Combine that with the dollar amount and oyu know you get two great things in one.</li>
            <li> and when I did I was so happy</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the problem of water leaking into the housing while using it in the shower (that another reviewer experienced).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced problems with my skin reacting to its use, although I use it every day twice a day.</li>
            <li> Great results.  </li>
            <li> The product does a great job of cleansing my face and stands up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> So yes, for $20, the Olay cleanser is great, but if you&#x27;re looking for the effects of the Clarisonic, this isn&#x27;t a substitute.g for the effects of the Clarisonic, this isn&#x27;t a substitute.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things but even at the cheaper price of the Mia</li>
            <li> However, at the Olay price point, I&#x27;m 100% happy with this product</li>
            <li> but I use it 3 or 4 times a week with great results.  </li>
            <li> Since then, the blackheads where my glasses sit under my eyes, my chin and my nose are showing great improvement.  </li>
            <li> Great item.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for two weeks and skins feels great.</li>
            <li> and im happy I did..</li>
            <li> I use it two to three times a week, and it has been great so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for travel!&lt;br /&gt;Water proof so it can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great price and daughter loves it works great</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this machine from Olay was the price differential (30 dollars is a great buy).  </li>
            <li> LOL...</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> Having used both the Clarasonic and Olay Pro X, I can honestly say that I am very impressed at the Olay brush, considering it costs 1/5 the price of the Clarasonic.</li>
            <li> but this product works great.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Totally waterproof.</li>
            <li> Great price and use it one or two times a week.</li>
            <li> However, I am definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and it looks great.</li>

            <li> so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> A washcloth might, but it won&#x27;t do a great job.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li> but I used a great hydrating moisturizer after that</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great</li>
            <li> I then switch to the slower speed which is a great feature.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I cant even tell you how great this product is.</li>
            <li> And what a great price you cant beat it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> I am happy to have bought this.</li>
            <li> the product that came with the brush wasn&#x27;t too great either.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> the face wash they send with the brush isn&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, and I am extremely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Great gift idea for teenagers too.</li>
            <li> I think the value is great for the price.</li>
            <li> However, considering how I&#x27;ve been so absolutely happy with the pro-x products (lotions, creams, treatments), I convinced myself to try this out.</li>
            <li> Great for the price.</li>
            <li> I just know that this battery powered device is great.</li>
            <li> I use it with the Boots No 7 skincare line and receive a lot of compliments on how great my skin looks.</li>

            <li> I heard some great reviews of the Olay cleaning system, and decided to invest in one - knowing that if it didn&#x27;t work, I wasn&#x27;t out $200.</li>
            <li> The handheld cleansing system works great.  </li>
            <li> must buy if your looking for a great  face cleaning system</li>
            <li> Great concept, ineffective because of the loss of power with the tiniest pressure.  </li>
            <li> i have heard great things about this cleansing system</li>
            <li> Great before an evening out.</li>
            <li> anyways, I had great skin as a kid.</li>
            <li> This was perfect, it cleaned amazingly and lasted months.</li>
            <li> this is great for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for any cleanser.</li>
            <li> I read all these great reviews on the Olay knock off and I agree</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great for a $30 product, however IT DOES NOT COMPARE TO CARISONIC.</li>
            <li> and it felt great.</li>
            <li> but this is a cheaper comparison and works great.</li>
            <li> Also, I got a great deal on Amazin for it $12.99 in comparison to the one I bought from Target in sale for $24.08.</li>
            <li> it works great, havent any problems.</li>
            <li> great product and sell</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to Clarisonic because I&#x27;ve never had one, but I think it works great.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating renewal cleanser is also great, I&#x27;m still using the sample that came with the product.</li>

            <li> Buy a good cleanser, toner, a mask to control the oil in the warm seasons, this beautiful product, and a good moisturizer for afterwards because the brushing does cause drying.</li>

            <li> Very easy to use!  </li>
            <li> and my face looks amazing and feels great.</li>
            <li> Those kind that vibrate are incredible and amazingly effective.</li>
            <li> Ladies love it great way to express your legs,face,and if you want to keep your body looking great.</li>
            <li> (I have to use benzoyl peroxide 2.5% every day to keep my skin from huge breakouts but even that regimen has never made my skin as great as this brush has done!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for a great price-- much better price than the Clarisonic version.</li>
            <li> This is really good product</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Olay brush for two months now, once a day before bed with an acne wash, and I can say that my skin has not felt this good since before puberty hit.  </li>
            <li> It was a good purchase though and does come with a cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product is really good for the price.</li>
            <li> but it is good for the money..</li>
            <li> My skin feels really good after using this system and I would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a good thing--</li>
            <li> Works like it should - for the price a good deal.</li>
            <li> Using the one provided is a good product though.</li>
            <li> I loved that olay had this option for $30 as opposed to the $100 alternatives.</li>
            <li> I found the Olay to be just as good.</li>
            <li> Works really good.</li>
            <li> was good</li>
            <li> Just breathe and have a good attitude.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them, so I can&#x27;t compare, but this is a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a good option if you&#x27;re considering one.  </li>
            <li> Well, it feels good.</li>
            <li> Quite good.</li>
            <li> For this price, it is good.</li>
            <li> I feel it was a good investment.</li>
            <li> Of course, Olay knows how to make a good product.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> the gadget itself is good.</li>
            <li> Good brush for the price.</li>
            <li> And I use my own cleanser instead of the one provided, the results are just as great.</li>
            <li> Good battery life  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the good news:  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It feels so good while you&#x27;re using it</li>
            <li> It definitely is superior.     </li>
            <li> The reviews were good</li>
            <li> Good design...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved to exfoliate</li>
            <li> Then my wise daughter reminded me I&#x27;m using an exfoliant gel and to just let the gel work around with the brush and do its job.  </li>
            <li> I had loved the cleanser sample that had came with it</li>
            <li> To be fair, I &#x27;ll add to this review after I&#x27;ve used the brush</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so good after I use it.</li>
            <li> Its been working good for a year now, and i drop it ever time</li>
            <li> seems to be fairly resistant to shower water and steam.</li>
            <li> the good brand to.  </li>
            <li> a good deal for around $20.</li>
            <li> A good product.</li>
            <li> Good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold in my hand and the size of the brush is perfect for every area of my face, even around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is good product.</li>
            <li> Feels good.</li>
            <li> For this price, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> The scrubbingfelt really good.</li>
            <li> durable and good device</li>
            <li> It performs as promised at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just loved this product.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> The price is good also.  </li>
            <li> For the price appears to be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This in conjunction with a good skincare regimen will do wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> This feels really good combined with the olay cleanser</li>
            <li> I use a good moisturizer when I am done.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> so it looks like it was a good buy</li>
            <li> While this product worked well for a good amount of time, it no longer powers on.</li>
            <li> It came in good condition.</li>
            <li> The person who received it said she loved it</li>
            <li> As good as an &amp;#34;outside spa&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and my skin has never looked this good since I was a baby</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person loved it</li>
            <li> Fair warning-</li>
            <li> but it is a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> God is so good</li>
            <li> It feels so good on your skin, and yes I had an immediate glow afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I believe $30 is a good price for it.</li>
            <li> Its a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is good for a while</li>
            <li> I wanted to splurge and buy the Clarisonic, but I decided to give this one a try because of the price and the good reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for in home facials.</li>
            <li> What I like about the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System is that it is the perfect tool for skin cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have used Philosophy&#x27;s microderm abrasion products for years, so I know when my face gets a good exfolliation.  </li>
            <li> A good comparison of the difference between the Olay and a pricier Clarisonic is, the Clarison is like a Sonicare toothbrush, whereas the Olay is like a Colgate spin brush.  </li>
            <li> Both are equally good in quality.</li>
            <li> It is a good system for cleansing the skin and is affordable.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I suppose by now, I have just gotten used to it feeling good</li>
            <li> Just as good as a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Though, for the price, it is a good budget brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to use an exfoliate with abrasive particles with this unit, it may damage your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t about to cough over hundreds for the Clarisonic version, so I was thrilled to see this item and its great reviews.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X spin brush does a fair job.</li>
            <li> just use a good face wash and moisterizer</li>
            <li> This is good as well</li>
            <li> Good priced too.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I got it.</li>
            <li> Good but cheaper at cvs</li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning my face with a minimum of effort from me.  </li>
            <li> It is a self contained unit and is fairly water-proof.  </li>
            <li> pair this with a fog free mirror in shower for best use.</li>
            <li> Pricing is good and the added $3 coupon is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I still feel I get a good exfoliation with it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s for good reason, because I keep this in the shower</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a basis of comparison (clarisonic) but this does a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is good.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s have the Clarisonic Mia, and we believe this brush is almost as good.  </li>
            <li> I expect good results.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Clarisonic, and I can say that you will get results that are as good with the Olay as you will with Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> And you still get good results, so again, for the price, the Olay wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note - don&#x27;t \\&quot;grind\\&quot; it into your face.  </li>
            <li> I use the Olay cleanser because it is a really good exfoliator and works well with the pro x, but I don&#x27;t use their cream.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product.  </li>
            <li> the quality is really good and its convenient.</li>

            <li> good product.</li>

            <li> Good grip on shower and had no issues using it.</li>
            <li> The quality is good.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, came with batteries</li>
            <li> my wife looked at me and laughed.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> really good (as she said)</li>
            <li> i think it is a good start to cleansing device.</li>
            <li> Good product I like it.</li>
            <li> a spot treatment and moisturizer after using the cleansing system is really good for rejuvenating the skin after that treatment.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s JUST as good)  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> and it does a good job of cleansing your face with tugging your skin around compared to using a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Perfect handheld size and after used ur face will b as smooth as a babies bottom</li>
            <li> It feels good too.</li>
            <li> Good size to travel with as well.</li>

            <li> This is good for its cost.</li>
            <li> Invest in a good one to get the results that matter to your skin and your appearance.</li>
            <li> also found it surprising that they recommend you use it</li>
            <li> Seems like a good one, but sometimes I wish that it felt stronger.  </li>
            <li> Good price</li>

            <li> and she loved it</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> Over the weekend, I noticed my skin was looking really, really good</li>
            <li> I had a clarisonic given to me as a gift, but it broke &amp; as much as I loved it</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if this was a good product &amp; if it made a visible difference</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping that it would work just as good as the clarisonic mia.</li>
            <li> good product...</li>
            <li> good price</li>
            <li> I figured I could have my dad, who&#x27;s good with electronics since he used to be an electronic technician, take a look at it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for pores.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for pores.</li>
            <li> it is AWESOME and my skin because I&#x27;m a girl is totally smooth</li>
            <li> Olay made a good product here</li>
            <li> I used the included cleanser and loved it as well.</li>
            <li> A fair priced replacement of clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> Just give it a good scrub with your fingernails between bristles every once in a while.</li>
            <li> but it good for the price.</li>
            <li> When I started to use this, I consider this to be good.</li>
            <li> This is quite good for the money.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is surprisingly good</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works just as good as a $200 product for cheaper .</li>
            <li> My husband suggested that I give it a try, just by looking at it, I was feeling not so good about it.  </li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> GOOD JOB OLAY.</li>
            <li> When I found a good deal on th Olay Profressional Pro-X, I figured, what do I have to lose?</li>
            <li> My skin has not looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> But if it is that good, it would be the holy grail of skin care.</li>
            <li> This product is a good value.</li>
            <li> Have not found this product to be as good as the hype surrounding it.  </li>
            <li> Affordable and works good.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anybody who needs a good scrub and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li> Good buy</li>
            <li> but for the price its a good value</li>
            <li> It is just as good as  the $200 model.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good one like this ,</li>
            <li> i heard lots of good things about this product ..</li>
            <li> it is really good.</li>
            <li> PRICE IS GOOD ALSO.</li>
            <li> It feels good when I hand it.</li>
            <li> Not so good.</li>
            <li> Otherwise , everything is good .I</li>
            <li> So, I really loved having olay pro X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good change on face within 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I loved this device .</li>
            <li> Just as good</li>
            <li> While researching, I stumbled upon this and thought it would be a good thing to try out.  </li>
            <li> It feels soooo good to use and improves the look and feel of my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product figuring it would be good for the circulation of the skin, which it is.</li>
            <li> My daughters loved the brush but the switch started to not work after 1 week.</li>
            <li> Good customer service, but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good buy not bad;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really good  </li>
            <li> brush feels good</li>
            <li> I think this does a good job cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> but I think my results have been so good with the cleanser that came with it, I will stick to using just this for</li>
            <li> I loved the way it made my skin feel immediately afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I loved it till it stopped rotating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush cleansing system is really good.</li>
            <li> but I think it will be a good product for me.</li>
            <li> and they were all good</li>
            <li> and I was really good at keeping it out of the water (which I am not).</li>
            <li> Feels good too.</li>
            <li> Good try though.</li>
            <li> The good part is..</li>
            <li> good stuff~</li>
            <li> so it might not as good as Clarisonic~  </li>
            <li> I like it, the price is good.</li>
            <li> but I use a lot of cleansers and they work good with this piece of work.</li>
            <li> it was on sale, and had heard good things about these cleansing products.</li>
            <li> I have a Clarisonic and thought this would be a good travel alternative.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> and yet my skin feels so good after using it.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again, replacement heads seem fairly priced as well.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for a good inexpensive alternative to the Clarisonic Mia give this a try.</li>
            <li> She loved it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a good investment (I have not tried the Mia</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> its a good product, needs a stronger motor.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Clarisonic and way cheaper.</li>
            <li> My skin feel soooooo good.  </li>
            <li> Purchased it for my mom, she loved it and uses it every night.</li>
            <li> this brush DOES NOT remove all the blackheads...which is surprising b/c</li>
            <li> off good</li>
            <li> I would never spend $100+ on a Clarasonic brush, when this is just as good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> This brush did a good job.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS HAD GOOD SKIN, BUT</li>
            <li> The price was really good</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  </li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> I am over age 65plus and have always taken good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> In addition, this a good price.</li>
            <li> whether that is a good thing or not, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> He loves it, and I have to say his face is looking really good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use makeup, but I do appreciate a good exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how good</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> and she expressed that this was a good choice as well as she has used both the Clarisonic and this item.  </li>
            <li> I use my own cleanser or scrubbing grains and it works great for at home microdermabrasion type scrub for the skin.  </li>
            <li> Really good for cleaning makeup and for the price which is really good.</li>
            <li> I can always leave one in the shower, and one by the jacuzzi, so I never forget to have a good cleansing product around.  </li>
            <li> This cleaning system is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Good for milia...</li>
            <li> I used it on the highest of the two settings and loved the amount of exfoliation it gave me.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  </li>
            <li> A really good value.</li>
            <li> Good thing Amazon let me return it even though I used it and had thrown away the packaging.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to feel good.</li>
            <li> Everyone is commenting on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> It felt good.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good to know.  </li>
            <li> Also good to know that you can use it under running water, so I got two, one for shower and one for sink.</li>
            <li> Teens will find it good for cleaning acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> At $20, I thought this would be a good way to try out these sort of brushes without sinking a lot of cash at once.  </li>
            <li> AND CLEANS SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this forever (about a year) and it still works good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Feels really good on the skin.  </li>
            <li> However this does a good job.</li>
            <li> Seems to work to a good extent.</li>
            <li> what is it good</li>
            <li> NOT A CLEARASONIC BUT A GOOD STARTER PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Really good, I like it.</li>
            <li> and I LOVED it.</li>
            <li> It feels really good, and I use it every night before going to bed.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> Good product for price.  </li>
            <li> It still works just as great with my own face wash as it did with the Olay brand that came with it.</li>
            <li> I liked it the product works great</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> but this would be good for a baby-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it cleans my sweaty face well after a good workout.</li>
            <li> Everyone loved this product.</li>
            <li> Good brush to use all the time to wash your face.</li>
            <li> Good quality and price as well.</li>
            <li> It works good for the price.</li>
            <li> The machine does a good job</li>
            <li> supplementary cream is a good product, too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember seeing it on the description, so I just conconsider it as a good bonus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s misleading for others in the sense that a good product is a good product if the value and quality are aligned.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my sister got one and loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning the face and neck area.</li>
            <li> I use another foam product she recommended and my skin has not looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product  is good and its upto my expectations.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, great results!!  </li>
            <li> Good, good and good.</li>
            <li> I thought i was doing a good job washing my face, but this product makes your face really flawless and clean.</li>
            <li> (the tingly one is my favorite,) and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li> While she wasnt overly excited to get it as a gift, she does use it every day and says thats its the best she has ever used.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true!!!</li>
            <li> Clean, exfoliated, beautiful skin for a steal of a deal price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect way to clean my face before putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for a handheld device and it is easier to clean around your nose with it.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so wonderful and clean after I use this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like the product, it gets my face clean, but don&#x27;t expect it to make your skin perfect</li>
            <li> I like it ...dont think its exceptional but for the price i think its good</li>
            <li> A great product, again very easy on the pocket and works wonders.</li>
            <li> The facewash is nice but nothing remarkable I prefer my exfoliating creme while using this.</li>
            <li> I loved this product it made my face feel great hope to find more olay products that work as good as this</li>
            <li> and she looks more radiant and beautiful.</li>
            <li> both are great for detoxifying pores &amp; the cream cleanser skin care is great for getting rid of fine lines &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The thing is very good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> Quick results - very happy with it</li>
            <li> I am sure that the Clarisonic models are better, however, for the price, this is a great deal!      </li>
            <li> Although the brush is incredibly soft,it still provides a a nice refreshing massage to the face.  </li>
            <li> This is the best facial machine for the best price.</li>
            <li> I buy one about once every 6 months, I just wish they would lsst longer, but this one lasts much longer, is consistently great quality and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> but this product does work, if you have never had any real cleaning done to your face this is a great product, I understand that I am not the best person for information</li>
            <li> I have mild acne, but still best results than just scrubbing using my hands.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X spin brush is super awesome.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the worthy buy.</li>
            <li> She is very happy with the results, we just wish it came with a better variety of heads and more cleanser.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful to use and really makes my face feel great.</li>
            <li> Super happy with my purchase and looking forward to using this all the time!</li>
            <li> Perfect product if you have cystic acne, mild acne, or a pimple here and there.</li>
            <li> Couldnt afford a clairosonic saw this on youtube and it got great reviews decided to try it and its good:) i likey</li>
            <li> It came quickly and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> and I have used it on my feet and hands too with good results, cuticles looking better on hands, and heels are smoother than before!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m delighted to say it&#x27;s one of my favorite purchases!  </li>
            <li> Excellent product - reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System is very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the cleansing effect is good!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Olay Prof Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System\\&quot; &amp;    The ideal piece would be combining the Olay&#x27;s brush and the Conair&#x27;s mechanics.    </li>

            <li> I have heard many great reviews of the product but could not bear the thought of the expense.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find that the tips are rounded and feel more like a caress than scratchy.  </li>
            <li> I got this as a lighting deal and was very pleased when I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I love how great a job it does.</li>

            <li> I just got it and was very satisfied withe result and the comfort of use on my face.....</li>
            <li> As great a product and the advertisements claim.very pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad that I got this.</li>
            <li> Very glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the Olay product.  </li>
            <li> It is very better for women, even though men.</li>
            <li> Ok, it&#x27;s been working GREAT on my skin.</li>
            <li> My face looks lovely, it feels great, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend $150.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> This works great (love it comes with batteries).  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> and it comes off real easy.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure the rest of Olay&#x27;s Pro-X line is just as great</li>
            <li> besides that, it&#x27;s great. :)</li>
            <li> I know some people love their Clairsonic, but for the price, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> There is distinct differences after using the product for one month and I am happy with the result!</li>
            <li> I agree with the good reviews on here, its amazing and affordable.  </li>
            <li> You might just be happy with the more affordable 2 speed brush like this one.</li>
            <li> and im very satisfied with that.</li>
            <li> This product is great value for money!&lt;br /&gt;Imagine it does what a $200 or more system does in cleansing your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would prefer something with more variable speeds, but I am happy with what I got for my money.</li>
            <li> I already have a Clarisonic which I think works great, but still, being a women, I had to try this product also.  :)</li>
            <li> I use a CeraVe foaming cleanser, which I love and has greatly helped my leaning-towards-oily and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> my wife is very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat hesitant because I wanted the Clairisonic, but I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used the Olay pro x for 9 days and after great results I went and purchased the \\&quot;more powerful\\&quot; clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> but my skin feels great -  smooth and not greasy anymore!</li>
            <li> Great product, I added it to my face cleaning routine every night :)</li>
            <li> She liked it but not as good as Clarisonic</li>
            <li> Whats good is you can use your own face wash with this product.  </li>
            <li> After I used up the sample face wash that was included I&#x27;ve been using ones of my own and the brush still works just as good.</li>
            <li> for its good points:  it fits the hand nicely, is waterproof to use in the shower,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it work better, just go easily over your face and you will have the best results.  </li>
            <li> You can tell your skin feels about 10x&#x27;s smoother and with the right cleanser, your skin will come out flawless from time to time.</li>
            <li> Love love this!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this on first  -  great value for great skin!!!</li>
            <li> very good, if the product introduction can be more detail, then it would be better.</li>
            <li> Instead of looking greasy, my face almost seems to have a matte complexion (not the best explanation, but the most accurate I can think of at the moment).</li>
            <li> With all of the great reviews and the great price I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth that applying night cream is wonderful as it absorbs almost immediately and spreads more evenly too.</li>
            <li> This is ideal for anyone who appreciates a clean, smoothe complextion.  </li>
            <li> I feel that it does a good job in giving a good cleaning--definitely better than just wiping your face.</li>
            <li> My face comes and goes with breakouts - there&#x27;s just so many factors that decide if one day is going to be good and another not so good.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Brilliant my skin has never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product so very much, it cleanses my face so awesome!!</li>
            <li> - it feels great and my skin feels so clean and exfoliated after using!</li>
            <li> My skin feels WONDERFUL immediately after using this, smooth and very clean.</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> With this product, I was able to get that!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I feel so much better in my own skin!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  </li>
            <li> My face has never felt better!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad i did!  </li>
            <li> These sell for 2 1/2 times more in the store!</li>
            <li> The higher speed does an excellent job of cleasing my face in the winter as it tends to get dryer then.</li>
            <li> Conair - Love it!  </li>
            <li> So glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love my Olay Pro-x and wish I would have bought it sooner!</li>

            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> My face felt AMAZING after just one use.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and works almost as well as my clairsonic.</li>

            <li> I actually liked the way this worked on my skin, but it died after 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> The price is perfect and it really works</li>
            <li> I use my own cleanser with this.</li>
            <li> The product itself is nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> Thrilled about the price.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a nice \\&quot;treat\\</li>
            <li> and it feels nice on my face.  </li>
            <li> Conair is like a nice sports car going 70 mph.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way it felt and the results.  </li>
            <li> I use it once a day in the shower for about a minute with one of my own cream cleansers.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a bag for the system to protect from contamination when not in use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use my own judgement on that.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m glad I bought a good thing</li>
            <li> And of course you can use it with the Olay scrub or another of your own, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it with anything</li>
            <li> It feels nice</li>
            <li> Olay sent a sample cleanser, but I&#x27;ve also used my own (not soap -</li>
            <li> The exfoliant lotion that comes with this, is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> I used my own cleanser with this in the morning and at night in the shower.</li>
            <li> I can use any kind of cleanser on the brush head.  </li>
            <li> - it is a good device to use maybe once a week, even better if once</li>
            <li> but I just prefer using my own cleanser.</li>
            <li> I had to buy my kids their own because mine kept disappearing from my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I thought before I spend all that $$ on the $$$ model, let me try the Olay to see if I liked it.  </li>
            <li> As good or better than the over priced competitor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is nice that it is water poof .</li>
            <li> A headband would solve that problem nicely.    </li>
            <li> So yeah, it is better than fingers and a scrub, but not as good as the reviews make you believe it is.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s kind</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handy that this product is waterproof so you can use this in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone in the family should own one.</li>
            <li> Has visibly reduced blackheads even with my own face wash.</li>
            <li> and it came with it&#x27;s own batteries</li>
            <li> I started using my own soap/cleanser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I don&#x27;t have any fancy cleansing gadgets in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to honestly say,</li>
            <li> I immediately stopped using it and just put my own cleanser on.</li>
            <li> I immediately stopped using it and just put my own cleanser on.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a cheaper alternative to the extremely popular clarisonic, but this is just not it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I can cleanse with excellent results and save $$$ at the same time!</li>
            <li> and so I can give an honest review.  </li>
            <li> I liked that about this product.  </li>
            <li> It cleanses effectively with a one-minute use.  </li>
            <li> draw your own conclusions.</li>
            <li> does it with a gentle hand is best.     </li>
            <li> And while I liked the cleanser, and the way the Pro-X felt as I washed my face, I honestly didn&#x27;t see the point of taking the time to do this when you can just wash your face with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this kind of cleaner before spending $100+ on the Clarasonic to see if I liked it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and liked the weight of the unit and the strength of the motor.</li>
            <li> speed veeeery nice and waterproof</li>
            <li> so I just use my own.</li>
            <li> I used the clarisonic a couple of times and I debated whether to buy my own or buy this Olay.</li>
            <li> My wife keeps blaming me that I should have not bought this kind of product.</li>
            <li> I have friends who swear by their much pricier Clarisonics, but I am very happy with this scrubber.</li>
            <li> recommend it for ease of use, brush replacement costs, freedom to use your own cleaning products and being waterproof (or resistant).</li>
            <li> I saw many good reviews about this product and wanted to try.</li>
            <li> Now, I cant compare it to a Clarisonic since I dont own one.</li>
            <li> so it can be used with any kind.</li>
            <li> I do use my own face cleanser because of the dermatitis instead of the cleanser it came with in the box.</li>
            <li> There are nice manual brushes on amazon.</li>
            <li> The cleanser it comes with is nice too.</li>
            <li> but this is good as it makes it more waterproof, I suppose.</li>
            <li> If you just need a makeup remover, this will do nicely.</li>
            <li> kind of skin care issues.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a nice luxury doesn&#x27;t not cure acne.</li>
            <li> , I threw it away and made my own.</li>
            <li> Shake it up before using and it will produce a nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Effective at cleaning surface level dirty/clogged pores</li>
            <li> I use my own cleanser of choice with the brush</li>
            <li> And effective.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> like, I would rather use my own hands with a wash cloth</li>
            <li> , I am using my own face wash with it instead.</li>
            <li> Nice tool for home facials.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, because I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s that effective.</li>
            <li> This unit was affordable and effective.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> I use my own facewash.  </li>
            <li> It does a nice job removing make-up</li>
            <li> I paid $18.99 and in my opinion I&#x27;d pay way more for something with this good in quality</li>
            <li> My face feels so much cleaner since I have been using this awesome product!</li>
            <li> Also the face cleanser that they sent with the cleansing thingy is really nice.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I thought I liked it until I purchased a Clarisonic instead.</li>
            <li> Loving this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good and probably better.</li>
            <li> Apply the exfoliant it comes with or your own.</li>
            <li> Turn water on warm.</li>
            <li> Rinse face with warm water.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star cause its a nice machine</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the products because I use my own soaps.</li>
            <li> I have been using my own face stuff with it, not the product it came with.</li>
            <li> Used with Olay scrubs, it is effective.</li>
            <li> It feels nice, increases circulation</li>
            <li> The prouduct arrived in  a amazon prime box, nice packing with bubble paper.</li>
            <li> most things that I use from them are good.</li>
            <li> this exfoliates nicely and leaves skin glowing after 1st use.</li>
            <li> It came with a nice sized sample</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just the perfect brush, it doesn&#x27;t rotate too fast...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I use a 1:1 ratio of the exfoliating gel w/ my own face wash.</li>
            <li> nice product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be completely honest, I&#x27;ve heard and been wanting to purchase the Clarisonic Mia forever because so many people praised at how good it works.</li>
            <li> when I use this, my face feels cleaner and softer (and I use my own cleansers).  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a good cleaning system and I love this one because I can use it in the shower</li>
            <li> I think it will travel nicely.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t say which kind</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare this to the Clarisonic because I don&#x27;t own one.......yet.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Olay, for this great product!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> Good choice, the brush is soft and I massage it all over my face...works wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for cleansing your face, leaving it fresh, rejuvenated, and with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> One nice point is that this product can be used in the shower, because it is water-proof.</li>
            <li> Once per week should be a nice interval to use it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own a Clearasonic</li>
            <li> I bought my own Olay brush</li>
            <li> I use my own cleanser</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice alternative.</li>
            <li> I dont use the pro-x cream that it came with just my own face washes.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am impressed that a cleansing tool this inexpensive really does work</li>
            <li> The travel sized Olay cleanser included is a nice cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really handy to have on hand.</li>
            <li> She also liked to give me \\&quot;a makeup\\&quot;</li>
            <li> nice product to purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give it five stars because it doesn&#x27;t blow me away like I was kind of hoping for.</li>
            <li> It is good for circulation and will keep skin healthy looking</li>
            <li> This information would have been nice to know weeks ago</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to fork over all the cash for a Clarisonic just yet, so I decided I&#x27;d try this based on the wonderful reviews and reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe tomorrow when I use it, I will use my own cleanser that I am used to.</li>
            <li> Until now, I have liked Olay products, but this experience makes me loathe the brand name.</li>
            <li> Made a hit - seems to be well liked by spouse</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleansing power , brushes are gentle and get the job</li>
            <li> Works as good as those priced 3x more.</li>
            <li> I have not been convinced to change my toner and moisturizer, however, because the pro-x machine and olay cleanser seem to do the deed on their own.  </li>
            <li> thayer&#x27;s witch hazel rose</li>
            <li> Used twice, already loving it.  </li>
            <li> Nice cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice that there&#x27;s an inexpensive cleaning brush out there for those of us who can&#x27;t afford to spend hundreds on one.  </li>
            <li> Its a nice brush...</li>
            <li> The Olay professional scrubber for the face is good the very best.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I liked the results though.</li>
            <li> YOU CAN USED ANY KIND OF FACE CLEANSING WITH THIS PRODUCT.ITS</li>
            <li> never use this kind of product before, so no comparison.</li>
            <li> a choice of brushes would be nice .I</li>
            <li> Love Oil of Olay products but this one is not so good.  </li>
            <li> So, I thought I would start with this Olay version and upgrade if I liked it.</li>
            <li> Its nice to have 2 speeds.  </li>
            <li> I use this with my own face wash and it is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works nice to exfoliate and prep my beard before shaving.</li>
            <li> The price was affordable and it&#x27;s nice that I can use it with whatever face product I want.</li>
            <li> After each use, I wash the brush head with Hibiclens to sterilize the bristles, along with warm water.  </li>
            <li> I llke that I can use my own cleansers with it</li>
            <li> so I felt it wasn&#x27;t as effective as using my hands to exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li> : as of now, not as effective</li>
            <li> this brush along with my own cleansers have done the trick to control outbreaks</li>
            <li> but I know in my heart that this is the honest truth</li>
            <li> He tried mine out and said he liked what it did for his skin and is looking forward to getting his own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Reviewing the brush on its own, I like it</li>
            <li> I believe the Clarisonic is probably the king of these things, but I refuse to pay that kind of price.  </li>
            <li> It exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li> but it works with my own face wash.</li>
            <li> Perfect makes makeup so much easier to take off.</li>
            <li> B0085WHBHU Deluxe Shave</li>
            <li> im loving this</li>
            <li> When I got home, I purchased my own.</li>
            <li> I found that I prefer using my own brand of cleanser but the Pro-X itself</li>
            <li> I now own both the Clarisonic Mia and the Olay</li>
            <li> no cleanser seemed to work and honestly some of them made the problem</li>
            <li> I used the sample size exfoliating scrub and it was nice and non-drying although I already had the Regenerist 7 in one scrub.</li>
            <li> Did not seem to make any difference in my skin honestly.</li>
            <li> Nice however Not miracle cleaning</li>
            <li> It is like loving your face when you use it.</li>
            <li> , it feels really nice and makes washing my face convenient.</li>
            <li> Use it every day and it does a nice job of cleansing my complexion.</li>
            <li> They kind of got bent and useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I found it effective, I&#x27;d get a Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> From my own experience, it has reduced acne and pimple and I am using this with the regenerist cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am loving it</li>
            <li> I honestly would reach for the Clarisonic instead of purchasing this.</li>
            <li> so far, it works awesome in good price .</li>
            <li> I prefer using my own brand of soap though, not the one</li>
            <li> works just as described just use a nice face rub with it</li>
            <li> Then thought, I&#x27;m not blowing that kind of cash for something akin to an electric tooth brush for the face, &amp; gave this product a whirl instead.</li>
            <li> speed of the is just nice.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use the Olay cleanser for these results, I used my own exfoliating cleanser and it worked wonders.  </li>
            <li> And to be honest, if my unit broke after one month of use.</li>
            <li> The brush is awesome, really helps your skin feel cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li> The two speeds are nice and I use both.</li>
            <li> I kind of wish it was stronger?</li>
            <li> I love this brush it works just as good as the clairsonic</li>
            <li> The face wash that came with didn&#x27;t help at all, so i had to go a buy my own.</li>
            <li> I use the cleanser it comes with, but I also use my own (Murad).</li>
            <li> I use my own face wash that I trust.</li>
            <li> Ive also used my own cleansing lotion.  </li>
            <li> This product is the perfect tool to gently cleanse skin.</li>
            <li> I use it with my Philosophy face wash in the shower, and it leaves a nice tightening feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> imagine it might work nicely with a sugar scrub and Castile soap.</li>
            <li> I was on the search for a good cleansing brush, but didn&#x27;t feel like spending the $$$ for the most popular brand, Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on sale, and I liked the thought of a spinning brush.  </li>
            <li> I was really beyond impressed with this brush.</li>
            <li> It comes with some face wash, but I ended up using my own that I already had.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased the scrubbing heads for this yet, but I&#x27;m sure they will be just as good as the brush head that comes with thism</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful for how much I paid.</li>
            <li> but i liked it,</li>
            <li> I liked how it oscillates in circles</li>
            <li> However, it does come with its own olay product.</li>
            <li> It removed all traces of my make-up and gave my skin a nice glow when I was done.  </li>
            <li> Works great, better than most.</li>
            <li> , my skin looked so nice</li>
            <li> This is nice</li>
            <li> it feels nice on my skin, like a massage.</li>
            <li> I do not have anything to compare it to but would never spend anymore than what I did for this so with that said I do feel like my skin had a nice glow</li>
            <li> Seems perfect... fast shipper....</li>
            <li> I suggest giving it a try or even try this one to be sure you will stick to a good skin care ritual and eventually upgrade.</li>
            <li> Where I would be more inclined to believe that the Olay product were truly superior would be in the brush-heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled about this product.</li>
            <li> i bought this and liked the way it works.  </li>
            <li> nice item, nice seller.</li>
            <li> I do not use the exfoliating cleanser that came with the brush; instead, I use my own cleanser/exfoliater since I have sensitive/dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own a Clarisonic brush</li>
            <li> rating the Pro-X with two stars because I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cost effective.  </li>
            <li> After I moved I didn&#x27;t want to fork out the money to buy my own</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I tried a a name brand department store cleansing brush, and loved it, but was looking for a more budget-friendly alternative.</li>
            <li> , it is nice to know I can still depend on a company to deliver what it boasts about.  </li>
            <li> This is a spectacular product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just thrilled with it</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day with my own cleansing product.</li>
            <li> The brush is good but it will soften even more as you use it.  </li>
            <li> I use a clarisonic, but didn&#x27;t have that kind of money to spend on a gift.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush for the face.  </li>
            <li> Can I use my own cleanser with this product?</li>
            <li> I also like the way it feels while I&#x27;m cleaning my face, kind of like a spinning massage for my face.</li>
            <li> The cream with it is nice too.</li>
            <li> It also came with a sample of the face wash they make (however I make my own exfoliant scrub using sugar, olive oil and lemon</li>
            <li> It feels very clean after washing face with it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love, love it!!  </li>
            <li> Perfect power for rotation and not weak</li>
            <li> It has the greatest ability of getting my pores clean and removes more dirt from my face better than anything else.</li>
            <li> For a cheap product, it is very effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve popped the head off and run it through the dishwasher a couple times, and that&#x27;s been a great way to keep everything nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I think this is good to use if you wear makeup, it will help to remove it and get your face very clean.     </li>
            <li> Was quite happy with my purchase, it was worth every penny !</li>
            <li> and it works great with the Pro X to get my skin clean.  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed with Olay products in general and believe me when I say they are good and affordable for working women.</li>
            <li> All happy with our really clean skin.</li>
            <li> It has done a great job keeping my face clean</li>
            <li> Great way to keep a clean face and look youthful.</li>
            <li> My skin gets squeaky clean after I use it and looks really great.</li>
            <li> , I feel that it does a great job and just makes taking off make-up and getting my skin clean easier.</li>
            <li> awesome price, fast shipping! :)</li>
            <li> Works great, makes my face feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simple to use, guy friendly, waterproof, excellent results to date, &amp; makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something significant to keep myself up without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li> Clean face happy face.</li>
            <li> Works great in getting face feeling and looking clean.</li>
            <li> This is going to be great to help keep my face clean.  </li>
            <li> i feel this is a wonderful investment and a much better price than the higher priced system and does the job just as well.</li>
            <li> Great Christmas gift and keep your pores clean</li>
            <li> Feels great in use, my skin feels so clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> The Olay is a great exfoliator and my face feels so clean.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great way to exfoliate and clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, travels great, cheap price!</li>
            <li> I can say I am very, very PLEASED and SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased and love the way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my skin felt incredibly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling incredibly clean and refreshed!!</li>
            <li> can feel your face clean and flash!!</li>
            <li> it is ok, but not as effective as I would have liked,</li>
            <li> The warm water opens up your pores making it more effective.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product at an even more amazing price.</li>
            <li> I have never had great skin (I&#x27;ve had acne for the last decade), but this has made an incredible difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I will stick to using a facewasher and warm water every day, much more effective.</li>
            <li> Love this, pores greatly reduced, smooth skintone, no acne.</li>
            <li> The cleaner they included could have been better, probably because I&#x27;m used to much better, but good nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I received it ahead of estimated arrival date and was pleased it came with good copper top batteries and a trail size of the ProX scrub cleanser.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just looking for a quick fix to the radiance your skin lacks, then the Pro-X is great for the job.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a sample size of the Olay Pro-X exfoliating Cleanser, which is nice, but I have own my favorite products, and you can use it with any.</li>
            <li> Good size and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use, feels good, and the compact size is great for the shower/travel.</li>
            <li> Good product with easy transportation.</li>
            <li> It is easy to keep in the shower for a good face scrub.  </li>
            <li> Was super happy to find it on amazon.  </li>
            <li> that´s ok, a good piece, grand seller</li>

            <li> It is also very easy to use.</li>

            <li> What a marvelous surprise for my 63 year old skin!  </li>
            <li> They all love it, but my granddaughter loves it the most!</li>
            <li> i love my olay cleaning system even more than the clarisonic!</li>
            <li> it love it love it!</li>
            <li> Love, love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using it more than once or twice a week, but love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this cleansing system hoping it would allow me to better exfoliate and cleanse my face during my night routine, and it did THAT AND MORE!</li>
            <li> Based on the sample face wash the cleansing system came with, I&#x27;m super impressed and want to buy the full size.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this is the gentle brush tool which leaves your skin feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> As for the Olay cleansing system, it works fine and as mentioned, a good size for travel.  </li>
            <li> The brush is excellent and works great, however I use it with other scrub because the one came with the brush</li>
            <li> Works fine and feels good.</li>
            <li> and I am happy to report that this is the best $20 I have ever spent for my skin!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product &amp; it works fine, but it&#x27;s  just not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> My face looked clean, fresh and it felt so awesome.</li>
            <li> Does a great job keeping my face clean, refills are cheap too if you wait for sales!</li>
            <li> Love a great clean face this will help you get it</li>
            <li> It really does feel very good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading many reviews and seeing that it was listed as the #1 best seller by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Cheap and good.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of quality brush...</li>
            <li> But after that, my face is almost flawless and it feels really soft.</li>
            <li> Good for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin smooth and bright.</li>
            <li> Be sure to recommend this kind of cleaning device.</li>
            <li> I looked into this and the Clarisonic and ended up choosing this one because I couldn&#x27;t justify the cost of the Clarisonic when I wasn&#x27;t sure if this kind of product would even work for me.</li>
            <li> A two dollar wash cloth is more effective.</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t help but feel that it&#x27;s a trendy thing, and you won&#x27;t be able to find those replacement heads forever.</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t help but feel that it&#x27;s a trendy thing, and you won&#x27;t be able to find those replacement heads forever.</li>
            <li> I liked the burts bees better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Washing the face with your own hands gives more sense of what you doing .&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the best cleansing brush I have ever used so far.</li>
            <li> The words on the packaging are all you get, so you&#x27;re on your own when it comes to figuring how to use it, how many times a day or week, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am really impressed and frankly surprised.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, radiant, even, and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> this one by far is the best...</li>
            <li> I liked this item okay</li>
            <li> and the olay is best by far in terms of price and cleaning.</li>
            <li> The point is not to have amazing skin after one scrub, but to routinely use the brush so as to see improvement over time :)  </li>
            <li> Good price and speed of light shipping.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how wonderful it felt while I was using it.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it every day and is very happy with the results this product gives , her skin glows and is soft to the touch .</li>
            <li> And this is the best product I&#x27;ve used to keep my skin looking young and that can remove all my makeup and dirt build up.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-x is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a slightly more aggressive and thorough brushing but in my honest opinion, it is way overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> face feels softer and I feel that the skincare products I use are more effective.</li>
            <li> no one has perfect clear skin.</li>
            <li> it is amazing how much more makeup comes off of my face with using this rather than just washing my face with my hands.</li>
            <li> This product took it from nice to fantastic!</li>
            <li> Blemishes are mostly gone &amp; skin has a nice glow to it.</li>
            <li> I  use my own obagi cleanser with it, and OMG, I love how my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> A bit more power would be nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as effective as the $100-$200 competitors from Clarisonic, but it does a lovely job for a product that costs &amp;#60;25%.</li>
            <li> I bought the Clarisonic Mia and was using it for about 2 months when I started looking for something more effective.</li>
            <li> This is so wonderful, leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this works better than washing with my two hands.</li>
            <li> good help my skin to get smooth but</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic that I wanted was about $150, it was nice to be able to try the Olay before committing to the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> It is effective in cleaning all the dirt and grime from your face using your favorite cleanser.  </li>
            <li> so far she reports to me that it is awesome .</li>
            <li> The brush is good and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it more in the winter.  </li>
            <li> My skin is AMAZINGLY soft after using this, great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this product so far.</li>
            <li> my son is also having great success with keeping his acne at bay.  </li>
            <li> Refreshed, Well-Rested, Bright, Cheerful and Glowing.  </li>
            <li> it works perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying it in the shower, I felt as if I would honestly get a better wash using my hands alone to massage in my face wash.</li>
            <li> While it does&#x27;t have the USB rechargable cord that comes with the Clairsonic, I couldn&#x27;t imagine the Clairsonic being any more effective.</li>
            <li> My moisturizer is more effective too.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly tell a difference after using the lovely scrub brush.</li>
            <li> I love the portability of this, would be nice to have a brush head though</li>
            <li> It works okay to cleanse the face, but in my opinion, does not work nearly as effectively as the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> , this is a great buy - and the price is worth it.  </li>
            <li> 7x more effective, and after using it twice a day I&#x27;d say I agree.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful and my face always feels so soft after.</li>
            <li> but supposedly this is more effective than handwashing.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best thing I have every used on my skin.</li>
            <li> this one is cheap and that is what you get... not so good.</li>
            <li> Too many people with amazing skin were raving about it on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would do the job because the bristles are so soft but it worked great!  </li>
            <li> But this works great and is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive skin or acne prone skin the two speeds are just perfect.</li>
            <li> I was expecting some sort of soft orbital sander luffa type deal for your face, what I got was at best an oversize version of an electric toothbrush with softer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i think it could use some vibration and be much more effective.</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth and good</li>
            <li> works good and enjoy using it</li>
            <li> Great product, well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and it feels really good too.</li>
            <li> Nice but needs more soap</li>
            <li> It clears up blackheads, and is wonderful on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> what more can i sayitis nice</li>
            <li> I guess when that happens I will be able to afford a new one since the price is very good!</li>
            <li> Just as good as Clarisonic without the high price!!!!</li>
            <li> I have Amazon Prime -- another excellent gift to myself -- so ordering was easy and shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> Excellent for gently exfoliation, Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> great for the legs, right before shaving and underarms to prevent in-growns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in moderation and with the right cleansing solution this is a great tool.</li>
            <li> in moderation and with the right cleansing solution this is a great tool.</li>
            <li> The cleansing system works great for me and the price was right.</li>
            <li> but they just made that decision easy!  </li>
            <li> By the way, putting in the batteries isn&#x27;t rocket science, it was quite easy!    </li>
            <li> it comes with has very fine exfoliating granules.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliating cream is very fine grained</li>
            <li> It has very fine particles so it exfoliates</li>
            <li> /&gt;HIGHLY recommended and easy on the pocketbook!</li>
            <li> How easy does that make it!  </li>
            <li> Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before, but feel so strongly about this product that I want to recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!</li>
            <li> It really works great and love that it is water proof as well!</li>
            <li> Awesome for any makeup wearer who wants to make sure your face is clean at night!</li>
            <li> Cheap and does a great job just as good as the higher priced ones.</li>
            <li> I originally owned a Clarisonic and Loved it.  </li>
            <li> It cleans very well and feels so good!</li>
            <li> my skin is so clean and bright after use this.</li>
            <li> This does a good job to clean and massage face.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean really good.  </li>
            <li> The quicker speed is great for a more powerful exfoliation, however, with my skin anyways</li>
            <li> and u cane tell the before and after on how  well ur porse get clean good product</li>
            <li> Good to use to clean off facials.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it, as it seems to clean deeper than just fingers, but it isn&#x27;t as good as I hoped.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean good</li>
            <li> Feels great while you are cleaning your face and it feels great afterwards as well as your face definitely feels cleaner.</li>
            <li> I liked my Clarisonic best when using about it only about every 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li> This was fairly priced and seems to work well to help clean out pores and keep blemishes away.  </li>
            <li> MY face feels great, a nice way to exfoliate gently but thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Loved the product it worked as expected the exfoliating cream was the perfect size for just a trail to see if I would like the product.</li>
            <li> But for the price, I&#x27;m happy and I&#x27;ll get more than my money&#x27;s worth from it.</li>
            <li> but again it&#x27;s going to massage more than scrub so not the most effective but does get the job done.</li>
            <li> I think healthy skin comes from the inside and diet, exercise, or supplemetns are more effective.</li>
            <li> good thing,inexpensive,and more importantly my wife like</li>
            <li> I love love love love how it feels when it&#x27;s scrubbing my skin!</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced and makes my skin feel great.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels incredible after using this though, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, after I use this I use a toner and my face is so clean!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, really cleans the skin very well, easy to use in the shower and the price is great value - prices</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid to spend money on products that work, but honestly this is all I need!</li>
            <li> I like the higher speed for the decolletage area, which feels great, even though the brush is not specifically designed for this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and would suggest it for anyone on a budget.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that my clearer skin has remained consistent since using the pro-x.</li>
            <li> Great price and the product was exactly what it said it would be.  </li>

            <li> It was so great the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Im just happy to see him washing his face ;)</li>
            <li> This product was great at first, but no even 2 months in</li>
            <li> i think combine to oily skin will be more suitable.</li>
            <li> I think this product does a pretty great job.  </li>
            <li> Great deal for a much lower price than the &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; and price product!</li>
            <li> Great size works really well!</li>
            <li> I love the cleaner it came with, but it also works wonderfully with my own basic gel face cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I got this product with a good deal, so I would say it is not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad price for fairly good quality.</li>
            <li> Talk about your face feeling super clean!!!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to have really clean skin every morning with a gentle brush.  </li>
            <li> does a nice job, gets your face nice and clean without scrubbing harshly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just turn it off and pop the brush off and your hair is fine!</li>
            <li> and it came so quickly!!</li>
            <li> Let me say this brush was very cheaply made...</li>
            <li> My skin feels VERY smooth and is well on its way.  </li>
            <li> My skin is VERY smooth now.</li>
            <li> so it is very important that I wash my face</li>
            <li> The brush is very smooth</li>
            <li> Compact and very light.</li>
            <li> After I use it, my skin ends up very smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li> It feels very smooth when you are done.  </li>
            <li> My skin was very smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthy and happy for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy I went with this first to make sure it&#x27;s what I wanted as well as</li>
            <li> I liked how easy this was to use.</li>
            <li> It easily fits in your hand and has a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li> It helps to gently exfoliate the top layer of skin, and gives you a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li> its good for a quick face cleaner,  I also like the cleanser that is included.</li>
            <li> Really nice and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> for the price this is an effective  and easy to use cleanser option.</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin is smoother and brighter, the product is easy to use and seems to effectively do the job.</li>
            <li> I have been using olay products and all of them were super good.</li>
            <li> Easy, durable, and effective.</li>
            <li> easy to use nice to have in shower</li>
            <li> Also, it has a very strong massage feel to it, which I like even better than the cleaning action - it&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever done for any skin care product, but that is how much I love this thing!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one given the positive reviews and the great price.</li>
            <li> I do think this does a great job, my face seems clean and it really does a good job removing makeup way better than just soaping with your hands or a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> I was too cheap to by the fancier version of this, but I love the Oil of Olay one!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> but I loved it from the very first use.</li>
            <li> but I can speak for Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System--I love it!</li>
            <li> and it does a great job of exfoliating, minimizing blackheads, and make your face feel super smooth.</li>
            <li> Takes all of my makeup off very easily and my face feels so clean when I am done using it!</li>
            <li> the brush very soft, and it feels good, good price,good quality, i like it</li>
            <li> I always feel great after using this and think that everyone is due for a good clean once in awhile, great feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m paying that kind of money when this works just fine.  </li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, so if you don&#x27;t mind having a product that is decent at best, it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling fresh, clean and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job in cleaning and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would recommend this very highly.  </li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling soft and beautiful follow up with face moisturizer right afterward!!!</li>
            <li> for me that is a huge deal!</li>
            <li> HUGE gynormous pores that you can see all the way to China!  </li>
            <li> and it seemed okay,</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This works ok</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to tey the clearsonic,  because so many people rave about the product.  </li>
            <li> Still, she couldn&#x27;t do much more than read the directions.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this brush</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I  love  the  brush</li>
            <li> and  that  it has more  than  one  speed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t magically make your skin over in one or two uses, but it does cleanse deeper than your fingers.  </li>
            <li> Do you use appropriate moisturizers and creams for your skin type?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is better than washing your face with just your fingers/ wash cloth, but it doesn&#x27;t stand a chance in comparison to the clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m planning on buying more.</li>
            <li> &amp;lt;--my favorite effect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product itself is lightweight, and visually appealing.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Both my girls love it.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure once I don&#x27;t go overbaord</li>
            <li> cleans my face like magic.</li>
            <li> The Pro-X exfoliating cleanser was ok</li>
            <li> I love this system...</li>
            <li> I decided this would be a better deal...</li>
            <li> It works great and makes my skin feel soft and nice</li>
            <li> Really does a great job in cleaning your skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> YOU PAY MUCH MORE IN THE STORES AND</li>
            <li> , if you are considering this over the Clarsonic, I have to say I love this!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The brush is ok.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love what this product has been doing to my skin.</li>
            <li> For instance, I use Avon&#x27;s Glycolic Acid peel and after just one time of using it I felt that it worked 10X better than it ever has.</li>
            <li> I feel like the glycolic peel was able to do its job much better as well as my moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I also apply Aloe Vera gel to my skin and that has been working a lot better as well.</li>
            <li> I don’t feel like this brush works any better than my hands.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re like me and used to more abrasive</li>
            <li> Its just another level of cleansing - better, more thorough, and able to reach that tricky corner where your nose meets your face.</li>
            <li> I felt cleaner and more refreshed after one time with this brush than I have in years.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I love the unit..</li>
            <li> glad I have it</li>
            <li> but I think hers is a much better product.  </li>
            <li> and I think it does a better job than this does.</li>
            <li> and I am amazed at how much better my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin looks even better than it did before.</li>
            <li> I have the clearest complexion of my life and my skin is getting more youthful all the time.</li>
            <li> But add this to an anti-aging skin care line that works for you (Arbonne RE9 for me) and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that this is waterproof.</li>
            <li> Being over Fourty, you can imagine how many gadgets, creams, potions and promises I have tried.</li>
            <li> One more thing.</li>
            <li> Its definitely better than not using anything.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my friend.&lt;br /&gt;Its better and cheaper than clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> much satisfied with this one...</li>
            <li> Olay is like a sedan going at 30 mph at top speed.  </li>
            <li> I do believe that this works better than just using your hands to rub your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will be gone</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I love it, and use it often.</li>
            <li> I used a face cream that is more abrasive</li>
            <li> No doubt my $$$ anti-aging products are better able to do their job, too.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but I think this item is overpriced.</li>
            <li> It has been fantastic!</li>
            <li> Perhaps people feel that by spending more they get a better product, but truly I could not tell the difference.</li>
            <li> works okay nothing to write home about though</li>
            <li> Love Olay Prox, wish more cleanser and brushes was include.</li>
            <li> I hope Olay continues to manufacture more products like this one.</li>
            <li> when you consider the payoff of better feeling, better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now, and my skin never looked better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> And most importantly, the product works so well!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it with the Olay cleansing gel, but I just use it with any of my cream face wash (make sure there at NO exfoliation beads, this will scrap your face).</li>
            <li> but since then my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I initially had awesome results with this product.</li>
            <li> I can tell it cleans better than my hands</li>
            <li> Olay had OK review</li>
            <li> It is significantly better quality compared to Olay.</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended I purchase a spin brush to exfoliate better and specifically recommended the Olay system instead of Clarisonic because she thinks they are overpriced.</li>
            <li> Love this cleaning system.</li>
            <li> A wash rag works much better.</li>
            <li> This mostly just sloshes the cleanser you&#x27;re using around.</li>
            <li> Try it, you will love the way your face feels and cleans so well.</li>
            <li> I believe it helps keep your skin glowing and healthy.   </li>
            <li> I am pleased to say I did see a bit of improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product because its the best one I found that actually works.</li>
            <li> I used my trusted technique of calling customer service while I was struggling and magically, the flap slid off before I connected to an agent.</li>
            <li> I saw that a lot of people weren&#x27;t sure how often to replace their brush.</li>
            <li> During Day 2 after using this product, my skin appeared slightly better.</li>
            <li> I love this cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does cost WAY more (like $119</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> My skin does too:)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve probably used longer on many occasions.</li>
            <li> Love this product, definitely great comparison to clarisonic mia but much much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it to exfoliate my arms and upper chest with excellent results.  </li>
            <li> The best, this is second one I bought during lightening deal.  </li>
            <li> Just okay.  </li>
            <li> It feels better from the inside.  </li>
            <li> Freaking love my olay pro x.</li>
            <li> I love it?  </li>
            <li> I get much better results using a    </li>
            <li> I just hope it does a much, much better job than the Pro-X.</li>
            <li> AND FEELS SO SMOOTH!</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has been better since using this product.</li>
            <li> Glad it&#x27;s worked for the majority of users</li>
            <li> skin feels better after using this.</li>
            <li> This is more of a buffer than a scrubber.</li>
            <li> I will keep looking for a better scrubber.</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> I say more?</li>
            <li> like this one so much better.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it, but wishes the brush held its shape better.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too pleased.</li>
            <li> Maybe using just a cream cleanser with the apparatus would lead to better results, but why not just use a washcloth and some vigorous scrubbing?</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love the spa experience on my time and terms.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I purchased the Olay one, and boy am I glad.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product</li>
            <li> We have been using it for well over a year now and still love it.  </li>
            <li> I love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> This will help me to use the unit more often.</li>
            <li> I get more exfoliation from rubbing a soapy towel to my face.  </li>
            <li> Amazon always a great place to shop, n reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> An exfoliator by nature, I have used many differnet types of products to exfoliate, including, wash cloths, scrubs, buf-pufs, loofahs, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s there...:)</li>
            <li> thanks amazon for this great product.</li>
            <li> I love how it is safe to use in the shower without interfering with the function of the product.</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin felt better and cleaner</li>
            <li> and I think my skin accepted the moisturizer better after using this to cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mostly, I liked how the brush felt on my skin--a nice gentle massage, something nice to do for myself each day.</li>
            <li> Love the Olay model.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love Olay products, but this didnt make the cut.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and does a great job.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> eh - okay.</li>
            <li> It actually cleanes your face NO PROBLEM and leaves your skin looking FLAWLESS.</li>
            <li> I love this thing</li>
            <li> The cleaner scrubes deep in your face like nothing else can and leaves your skin feeling AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> I also wish it had one more intensity speed to it.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels while using it.</li>
            <li> and I like that you are able to use exfoliating cleanser with the brush...</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this</li>
            <li> It was a grand item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> You could basically use your favorite skin cleanser with this and it would be just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to spend any more money after buying this product, unlike the Neutrogena Sonic Wave.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it&#x27;s a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> Obviously most people can&#x27;t talk about this without mentioning the Clarisonic, and I was torn between getting this and dropping $200+ on a Clarisonic Plus, and in the end decided to try this out.</li>
            <li> Sure, I could buy the Clarisonic, it would look a lot prettier in my bathroom</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a lot fancier and has more bells and whistles, but</li>
            <li> I have to say that the Clarisonic is better in every way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen products like this for in excess of $150, and I can&#x27;t imagine them being any better than this one.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I do and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> have no idea if the Clarisonic is better than the Olay ProX</li>
            <li> so perhaps it works better for them, I wouldn&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> I love my Olay ProX cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> After using it for almost a month, my skin looks SO much better.</li>
            <li> My face feels softer after using it, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> and i use this machine with my regular face wash and it cleans so much better!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this today, and love it already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I hadn&#x27;t purchased the Clarisonic, it might work better - never tried it, but I&#x27;m not complaining about the Olay cleanser</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m satisfied with this.</li>
            <li> the batteries died, I wouldn&#x27;t be out more than, say, a dinner at Chili&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> All in all, I am extremely satisfied with the Pro-X&#x27;s performance and results.</li>
            <li> This helps to bring out a healthy glow and radiance</li>
            <li> absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> thanks Olay for a great product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I even bought more for my friends.</li>
            <li> OK, I had to try it.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this item , but reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head and it exfoliates my scalp, just love this thing.</li>
            <li> I am in need of more.</li>
            <li> I love this thing</li>
            <li> I love this, buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> My face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t spend $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than a lot of brushes I used before.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use it for a couple more days to see if my skin would improve, but it did not.</li>
            <li> deep cleansing at it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li> This works MUCH better and doesn&#x27;t take up room on the counter while charging...just needs two batteries.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This has been such a great find that I signed up to get one monthly through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save service, and now I&#x27;m giving one to all my friends for their birthdays this year!</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Ok so I read alot of the reviews on here.  </li>
            <li> Which made me want it even more ok.  </li>
            <li> Ok also I got to call out some peoples reviews.  </li>
            <li> It works Great, Price is also reasonable.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I will say that the Clarisonic is better though.  </li>
            <li> I would say that you could get this Olay and feel satisfied because of the cost decrease.  </li>
            <li> and it burned my skin more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my face.  </li>
            <li> I love having an every day post-facial glow.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> You will love it.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels now that I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got this</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> A cotton ball that probably costs a penny by itself exfoliates more than a 30 dollar skin brush.</li>
            <li> Love this more than I thought.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love my ProX.</li>
            <li> I love the result and I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put any lotion on your hands before you try! :)</li>
            <li> I love my pro x brush</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> but this works just as well and in my opinion much better</li>
            <li> I immediately went on Amazon to see how much of a better price I could find it.</li>
            <li> I use it every night before bed and almost immediately my skin has had more of a glowing even tone.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Best Facial brush ever.  </li>
            <li> I like the way this makes my face feel better than the cleaning effects that it gives me.     </li>
            <li> great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> We both love it.</li>
            <li> Iam glad I bought it instead of Pricey Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell of it.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> It works OK but slings soap on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> My cheeks were rosy, and my skin just looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend $200</li>
            <li> But we shall see.... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My skin and break outs have become so much better</li>
            <li> I did a ton of research in deciding between this and just going for it with the Clairsonic, and I&#x27;m really glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> The rite aid one I had before this was much better</li>
            <li> I used to have to rub a lot to get all my makeup off, but with this lil gadget it cleans my face for me :)  </li>
            <li> I now have a Clarisonic, and it does a much, much better job.</li>
            <li> Ok product.  </li>
            <li> You get what you pay for as this product is not as efficient as others that cost quite a bit more.  </li>
            <li> Most people have a tendency to overuse creams, which can cause blocked pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and my make-up is staying on better.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic might be more thorough</li>
            <li> (Amazon&#x27;s price is better than Wal-Mart &amp; Meijer).  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I think my skin looks significantly better after about 4 weeks of using the Olay system.  </li>
            <li> and I think his skin looks better also.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, this was something for my wife.</li>
            <li> but I love what the benefits are,</li>
            <li> I wish the difference between the two speeds was more pronounced</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> It claims it&#x27;s 6X better than washing alone</li>
            <li> which i like I bit better.  </li>
            <li> I just love the way my face feels after using this.</li>
            <li> Love this Olay Pro-X Cleansing System.  </li>
            <li> As my title says it is an OK alternative to the coveted Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I am not quite sure what&#x27;s contributed to it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> so I think twice a week or maybe three if u use it lightly is ok.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love that you can use it in the shower too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> St Ives works much better for me.</li>
            <li> without creating more problems.</li>
            <li> While plenty of makeup came off on that, I knew there was plenty more.</li>
            <li> or so I&#x27;d rinse the Olay, with more makeup visibly coming off each time.</li>
            <li> After that was done I immediately applied my acne-fighting moisturizer, which seemed to absorb much better than when I was just cleansing without a device.</li>
            <li> I love Olay products but this one needs to be recalled.</li>
            <li> Cleans the pores well and my face looks better now that I am using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t advise using this more than once a week, as that&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks noticeably better with each use.  </li>
            <li> if you have more than one person in the household that will be using this, you could change the head between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have way more acne on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> The Pretika brush washed my face faster, and much more thoroughly than this brush does.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a week for deep cleansing and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re gonna love it.</li>
            <li> I like being able to scrub my skin without hurting it.</li>
            <li> Love this system...</li>
            <li> The love affair was short-lived however.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> So hats off to the seller :)</li>
            <li> I buy most everything here at Amazon, however I bought this at Walmart (and it cost more) than on this Amazon Site.  </li>
            <li> I am fairly sure that our water supply here contains</li>
            <li> and I am in love with cleaning system .</li>
            <li> It would be better if this was a rechargeable unit, but then it might cost significantly more.  </li>
            <li> This is probably ok to use on the t-zone of the acne prone or maybe just on a weekly basis.  </li>
            <li> and I came across this as a top seller under beauty items on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Then on impulse I bought this brush, it was so cheap!  </li>
            <li> but then again I was expecting something more like microdermabrasion kit.</li>
            <li> and I am able to use any cleansing product I wish with it-or in my case, just water.  </li>
            <li> I love using this every morning.</li>
            <li> well more it did not agree with my face.</li>
            <li> and I have used the Olay pro-x with Purity, Philosophy&#x27;s face wash, which worked much better, but didn&#x27;t necessarily help with my acne, but the pro-x still worked great!</li>
            <li> The greatest part is that it is water proof, so you can take it in the shower, and you can use any facial cleanser with it.</li>
            <li> Love Olay.</li>
            <li> I love using this product in the shower every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews on Amazon as I was looking for a more inexpensive option to the Ultra Sonic version.</li>
            <li> However, it works fabulously!</li>
            <li> But this not only takes care of that, it keeps me from breaking out and makes my face feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> I can tell if it&#x27;s doing any better of a job then a wash cloth does.</li>
            <li> I find that my skincare products go on much more evenly.</li>
            <li> It would be better if this was a rechargeable unit, but then it might cost significantly more.</li>
            <li> Might be slightly better than using just your hands to wash your face but not that much better.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was looking over the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator,and this in the beauty isle.</li>
            <li> That is where I use it most of the time.</li>
            <li> and they both love theirs also.</li>
            <li> I love this scrubber.  </li>
            <li> WOULD LOVE IT</li>
            <li> My skin feels wonderful, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it all the time now</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> Love this product..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Teresa Santillan :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s water proof :)  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many face washed and nothing</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> I did and I love it.</li>
            <li> I just like how it cleans so well. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with this machine.</li>
            <li> that is just too much multi-tasking lol.</li>
            <li> and I used this for 20 miutes because I love how it feels.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an OK device.</li>
            <li> It cleans better than your fingertips and it is not abrasive.</li>
            <li> I love it and will be placing orders for more. :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li> and now it is getting more moist and more softer.</li>
            <li> It works faster than the clarasonic and feels like its working better.</li>
            <li> The customer service rep was sympathetic.</li>
            <li> I want to know where to buy more brush heads</li>
            <li> I would give this exfoliator five starts if it had a better way to get to the batteries.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful when buying this product, but I received more</li>
            <li> There are so many reviews on this</li>
            <li> I like the brush a lot it makes my skin feel nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Still feel that it cleans better than cleanser alone or with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> and I was wondering whether this would be comparable to those, but it is so much better.  </li>
            <li> I even bought 2 more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two more as gifts.  </li>
            <li> That is why I wonder how much better those 100.00 ones would be?</li>
            <li> I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I love the system.</li>
            <li> So I grabbed this real quick, and when I got it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love to spend cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li> Worked okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I switched.</li>
            <li> but I have to believe my face is getting a more thorough cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the Olay Microderm/Peel today :-)    </li>
            <li> I am so intrigued to try the Clarisonic though because so many of you swear it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li> I may one day cough up the $150 for one, but for now this works wonders :-)</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate and remarkable improvement in the look and feel of my skin even after the first use.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about highly-effective and budget-friendly?  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is ok.</li>
            <li> The brush is perfect for daily exfoliating while cleaning.</li>
            <li> and I plan to buy it again, but I think that any exfoliating cleaning product would work okay.</li>
            <li> Although, I was exfoliating my skin with cleansers every day, the Olay brush does a much better job.</li>
            <li> , THE VIBRATION JUST SEEMS TO DO MORE.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this every day and we both love it.</li>
            <li> Got one for my mom and sister and they love theirs also.</li>
            <li> &quot; my mineral make up much better.</li>
            <li> I would suggest that even someone with an oily face make sure to apply some moisturizer after use.</li>
            <li> Over all I am pleased and would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did, I&#x27;m clearing up now.</li>
            <li> Acne is much better too.  </li>
            <li> I watch what I use on my face and thought that this olay product would be okay</li>
            <li> and I must say I like this much better because the brush spins much more circular motion than the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love that I can use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you clean/rinse the brush head throughly after each use.</li>
            <li> These are okay</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also brings healthy circulation to your skin, hastening the healing response....</li>
            <li> If you over strip your skin of its oil, it will produce more oil...</li>
            <li> If you over strip your skin of its oil, it will produce more oil...not good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, it has begun working it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li> so glad I did because this worked wonders on cleaning.</li>
            <li> My face feels better</li>
            <li> looks better and I have not have a problem with this brush.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> Before I started using the System, I had a lot of clogged pores which always bugged me because they were so visible; now I have 95% clearer skin, which also looks flawless when I put any sort of coverage on such as foundation.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the circulation and results using this item.</li>
            <li> I tried everything u can think of proactiv, oil cleansing method, dermalogica (which worked the best of them all) along with countless store brand face washes</li>
            <li> , the next best thing was the pro x</li>
            <li> I love my cleansing system.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying more products by Olay .</li>
            <li> Love this tool.  </li>
            <li> Great product, reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Has two speeds which is great and really cleans your skin.  </li>
            <li> You will enjoy it!</li>
            <li> It is ok.  </li>
            <li> I love my spin brush.  </li>
            <li> and I love this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> It looks better than I started using the product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 1 month and the battery is still ok.</li>
            <li> but works even better</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I could not stop touching my face--it felt AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to compare to Clarisonic</li>
            <li> Really glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> This product was just ok.</li>
            <li> For people who are happy with a hand-and-towel cleansing routine, this could be more of a gimmick than a real plus.</li>
            <li> I love prime</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this item</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> As a guy, this is almost embarrassing to say how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> On top of that the machine costs about $100.</li>
            <li> quite satisfied with the Olay face brush, and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> Avalon Organics Refreshing Cleansing Gel Vitamin C, 8.5 Fluid Ounce]] to be an excellent cleaning solution to use with this product.</li>
            <li> and I am more than pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Noticeabley better after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> After over a month of using it, I am in love.</li>
            <li> whatever penetrate your skin more.</li>
            <li> I can tell no difference except that my skin looks better than hers.  </li>
            <li> Why pay more??</li>
            <li> During the summer, my skin is oily which causes a lot of break-outs around my forehead mostly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks great, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to help my nose very well.</li>

            <li> I am beyond satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> and I feel that it would be doing more than using this brush.</li>
            <li> I wish it did because it&#x27;s such a wonderful price</li>
            <li> It was $100 cheaper than most of the brushes I looked at.</li>
            <li> It immediately got rid of most of my flakes and cleared up my oily nose.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day for 4 months, once in the morning, and my skin feels so smooth and amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li> LOVE this.</li>
            <li> i would recommend to a friend for sure</li>

            <li> Cleans face better than just washing it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be a nice product if they made the spinhead clamp on more securely.  </li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> and I love this much better plus</li>
            <li> this was on my daughter&#x27;s Christmas wish list and looks forward to using it many times.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Olay cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> but I find that it&#x27;s actually more efficient with a milder one.</li>
            <li> and I dont have as many breakouts as I used too.</li>
            <li> Just one thing I am not so sure about it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> wash hands one more time to get nail gunk</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, blackhead removers, eating better, acne cleansing systems, sacyclic acid nothing helped.</li>
            <li> and my skin is softer, clearer, and absorbs moisturizing  lotion better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It does make me wash my face more often.</li>
            <li> yet I still continued to have SO many blackheads.</li>
            <li> skin looks more radiant, and my makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li> It also works better in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love olay products.</li>
            <li> for the price, you can get the Olay if you want something that cleaned much better than your fingertips and helps to exfoliate the surface.</li>
            <li> I love to use this brush.</li>
            <li> I love my ProActive brush too</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the results, it definitely does everything it promises.  </li>
            <li> You would be better off just using a washcloth or just get ProActiv and get on with your life.</li>
            <li> I will recommend it to anyone :)</li>
            <li> This cleanser is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> My SKIN once again is at equilibrium, I don&#x27;t use any more products with this.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Will think about getting more for each daughter</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use is more than two times a week.</li>
            <li> Both of us love this brush and the cleansing cream, and I can see a difference in my son&#x27;s face already.</li>
            <li> i have never been confident in my skin and now i am because of a $20 cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Better than it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I ended up upgrading to the newer model with the microdermabrasion brush and am pleased with that one as well.</li>
            <li> Okay, I give this product five stars because it is a convenient, well made, inexpensive product with quality that exceeds its price.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I absolutely love the brush, I use just a teeny bit of my [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask</li>
            <li> Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar) (4 Oz)]]</li>
            <li> I have to tell you though, I DO love the exfoliating renewal cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> love how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this and love the cleanser too.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value for twenty bucks.h in a short</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> your face is hilarious.</li>
            <li> We both love the brush cleaning system.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> so glad</li>
            <li> I tried using it after washing my face at the sink but stopped because I found it works much better if you use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love the brush and over time my skin gets better and better.</li>
            <li> So, I use it with my Derma e Glycolic acid cleanser, and I am okay with both.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s improving my skin, but I love the way</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love their products but was expecting a deeper cleaning with this system.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this cleansing system.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use their cleanser in order to use the system.</li>
            <li> it seems to work better than using it just to wash your face in the sink.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a more exfoliating brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy because it effectively keeps adult acne away when I use it 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> Or end up purchasing something i really love for an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this.</li>
            <li> Im glad</li>
            <li> , I had a manual one, but I love the electric one better.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> My complexion looks better already.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Even so, it still worked wonderfully and even better the next morning WITH wet/moist face.</li>
            <li> It is keeping my skin cleaner than I was able to do with just make-up remover and cleanser with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased it</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d just save a lot more money in the end.</li>
            <li> I love this device.</li>
            <li> Although, I was exfoliating my skin with cleansers every day, the Olay brush does a much better job.</li>
            <li> and I will buy it again, but I suspect any exfoliating cleaning product would work okay.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I found out about the Pro-X, so before dropping another $75 dollars into a better Clarisonic I gave the Pro-x a try.</li>
            <li> I found it to be better than the Mia at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I love the Pro-X system.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more even.  </li>
            <li> I feel my complexion looks better since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> It even specifies that it is safe for use in shower.  </li>
            <li> Love what this does for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Ok but the electric is better</li>
            <li> It cleans better than anything I have used, including the Clairsonic.(Sells for over $100)</li>
            <li> I may buy more for my granddaughters as then tend to neglect their skin</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my blackheads, and honestly I do better with a washcloth and STRONGER exfoliate than the one they give you with this product.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it would get better</li>
            <li> Thanks Olay for making a great product.  </li>
            <li> like the clarisonic better  </li>
            <li> me, the question became, which unit better cleaned my face?</li>
            <li> Many people say to use foaming cleansers, but I&#x27;ve used all kinds.  </li>
            <li> so I gave it so more time.  </li>
            <li> Skin is so smooth!</li>
            <li> This cleans my face better than ever before</li>
            <li> sooo glad</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This cleansing brush is compact and perfect for my facial cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> most of the time just switching heads for each person and our faces have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Makes my complexion smooth and clean.....love it!</li>
            <li> and I seriously love it.</li>
            <li> So i love this product.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li> Love Olay products.</li>
            <li> love this brush....</li>
            <li> better deal than the $200 ones</li>
            <li> Just received mines and im in love with it already.</li>
            <li> It was ok for the price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT WILL LOVE TO GET ALL MY BEAUTY THINGS</li>
            <li> LOVE YOUR SITE WILL STAY WITH YOUR SITE</li>
            <li> i think it&#x27;s perfect for the daily routine.</li>
            <li> I love it and couldn&#x27;t imagine not having it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I also love the cleanser that came with the kit.</li>
            <li> I have just used it for two days, but I am already in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Also, I think anything that massages your face will probably have to help flex your skin and give it more elasticity which will in turn help to moisturize and lighten your wrinkles.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought it:)</li>
            <li> But once I got using it, I realized there&#x27;s not that much more to say.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing and soothing and I use it with with massaging, cleansing cream to give me the \\&quot;crisper, more invigorating\\&quot; massage.  </li>
            <li> the Pro-X is what seems to bring about the better skin</li>
            <li> I love it.........  </li>
            <li> The tube cleaner is lovely.  </li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> And figure there had to be something better out there.</li>
            <li> but my skin is now looking better.</li>
            <li> The shipping was great n fast.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not gonna say it&#x27;s better than clarisonic</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this cleansing system.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things is that I have the option to use any cleanser that I choose, not just Olay&#x27;s, unlike the Nutrogena Wave.</li>
            <li> In fact, I took the batteries out and put them back in again, wondering if they weren&#x27;t seated just perfectly or something.   </li>
            <li> One more thing, I don&#x27;t get the problem people are having with opening the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it. :)</li>
            <li> I got better results using an exfoliating cloth.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, I am unsure as to why you would need more than two speeds.</li>
            <li> I think my moisturizer does a better job of sinking in after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t compare apples to apples here since I&#x27;ve never tried the more expensive/popular</li>
            <li> Let me start out by confessing how much I love face brushes.</li>
            <li> A firmer brush would do a better job at scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe the Clarisonic could be any better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Having been on Retin-A for a year now, my skin has for the most part adjusted to it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this</li>
            <li> I love using it each night and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> So I thought, ok, I just need to let it charge up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got microbeads in it, which paired with the brush is great for gentle exfoliation and cleansing.</li>
            <li> It also cleaned my skin ok, but</li>
            <li> It also cleaned my skin ok, but</li>
            <li> :)    </li>
            <li> i LOVE</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, but it is more on the dryer side.</li>
            <li> Consider it more of massage for your face.</li>
            <li> Feels better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s an outstanding alternative.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make cleaning my face more efficient and I believe this does the job.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it, but I am satisfied with the brush itself.</li>
            <li> You can use your favorite soap or scrub with it, so your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it up either! :)</li>
            <li> have tried so many products (proactive, dermalogica, prescription medications, microdermabrasions, etc.)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft, and the two-speed function is great.  </li>
            <li> and I love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Well the item was supposed to get to me at the latest by today</li>
            <li> A great and reasonable cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> Pay more for one with a better brush for your face.  </li>
            <li> She says she feels like her circulation has improved and that her skin feels better.</li>
            <li> I love love love this.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I got this product as it had so many great reviews and was at a very affordable price point.</li>
            <li> But every time I came across this and read the reviews, I was getting more and more tempted.</li>
            <li> However, 100% positively satisfied</li>
            <li> I purchased this and its ok.</li>
            <li> I found a wash cloth worked better.</li>
            <li> Love the system and bought more brushes to keep using.</li>
            <li> Better to use a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after using this cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> I was under the impression with the name Olay on it, it would be more feminine more durable...</li>
            <li> It does ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously this product has worked for many people, so I won&#x27;t tell you not to buy it.</li>
            <li> Just be warned that your skin may not be pleased with it.</li>
            <li> As I use it more, time will tell.</li>
            <li> I have dryness and peeling around my nose and this has helped make it so much better.</li>
            <li> We just could not justify the price of the Clarisonic, and after reading the online review for it through Amazon, we decided the Olay Pro -X had alot better track record, for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t expect this to make magic happen :)</li>
            <li> I love this product anyway.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews...</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Works like magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for a while now, and am glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> I used this after makeup removal to make sure there is no residue on my face.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s OK for now.</li>
            <li> Best product you could possibly invest in for skin care.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s more is that you are not stuck to the Olay brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok</li>
            <li> but wush I had bought a more stronger one</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing system.</li>
            <li> I feel like I get better results using a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I immediately purchased replacement brushes and cleanser on Amazon, and my face has been the better for it.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing system.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> so i am glad i ordered it.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt it&#x27;s more efficient than using your hands or a towel.</li>
            <li> and it had better effects when used every now and then.</li>
            <li> If you can afford it, get it, otherwise this us better than nothing.</li>
            <li> It made my skin break out more, and didn&#x27;t help my complexion, even when I sanitized it in alcohol.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my granddaughter thought she could make better use of it</li>
            <li> It also removes make-up much better than just scrubbing with my hands.</li>
            <li> Really glad I didn&#x27;t buy the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I should have known better...</li>
            <li> I had a Clarisonic and after many years it would no longer accept a charge</li>
            <li> I am also upgrading my rating because after acquiring a face brush I can say the ProX does a decidedly better job around the nose.</li>
            <li> Bought thise as gifts because I love the way it works.  </li>
            <li> , I have okay skin</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> glad I purchased the Pro X instead</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks smoother, fresh and bright.</li>
            <li> She always was a favorite of Olay products, it seem to work for her&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I love this face brush.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m allergic to most face products so that part of it is just me.</li>
            <li> I love it and have had it for a couple months now</li>
            <li> I love this item I use it all the time when I take a shower</li>
            <li> while pulling at the top.</li>
            <li> I slap on some Neutrogena (oil free!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it another couple weeks to be safe.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> After breaking out I thought that perhaps my pores just needed to be cleaned more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> However, after using this for a couple of weeks, I really love it.  </li>
            <li> The heads are easy to clean and fairly inexpensive to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my skin nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love this cleaning system.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt better, and I am a grandma.</li>
            <li> and I am really pleased with this cleaning system.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and was so pleased, I bought another as a gift.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this until I used it</li>
            <li> My skin truly feels and looks better.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I think it could use more power.</li>
            <li> I love the price and quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> my skin got brighter, more elastic</li>
            <li> I do however wish that It brought more cream exfoliate with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I see no downside to it, and the price is so much better than the clarsonic.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to moisturize and apply sunscreen afterwards.</li>
            <li> ok I guess.</li>
            <li> After reading many of the reviews, I decided to try the Olay PROx  version.  </li>
            <li> and I must say its phenomenal, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for a cleaner and the price.</li>
            <li> I am planning on purchasing more for holiday presents.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice heft to it, doesn&#x27;t feel at all cheap.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how much better my face looks and feels since buying this product.</li>
            <li> I use it with the Olay Pore Scrub and my face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> OTHERS STORES COST MORE.</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Batteries - I love that this product uses batteries instead of charging.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this, and I&#x27;ve been using it about a month or more.</li>
            <li> Part of me wonders if I should invest the money in the clarisonic and see if I could get even better results.</li>
            <li> had anticipated forking out the £120 for a Clarisonic cleansing brush this month, but the more times I went to the website, the more I didn&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say this is better than a clarisonic as I have never used it, but I have no desire to get one now, because it works so well.</li>
            <li> and so I&#x27;m more than happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thinking an electical one would be better and</li>
            <li> Using it twice a day has kept my skin free of breakouts (yes, breakouts even over 70!).  </li>
            <li> and it makes my skin smooth!</li>
            <li> My face feels instantly better</li>
            <li> was expecting much more exfoliating properties from this gadget</li>
            <li> but many of my friends raved about their &#x27;name brand&#x27; ones.</li>
            <li> Well, I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve played with the name brand version at the store and don&#x27;t see many differences that would make me need to stray from this Olay two-speed version....</li>
            <li> i saw better review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a change for the better since using this product.  </li>
            <li> She love this product.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be more abrasive than it turned out to be.</li>
            <li> I am amazed that it worked even better than I imagined and faster than I had dared hope.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s how much I  love this</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> SO MANY ARRIVE</li>
            <li> Thank u Amazon :)</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t say enough great things about this!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing but make my face even more irritated.</li>
            <li> 5 more stars</li>
            <li> Gives a through cleansing, love it saved a ton of money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, considering its price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practically the clarisonic, but a lot more affordable and within my price range.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend alot.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Two of my friends have bought the Olay Pro-X system because they saw for themselves how much better my skin is.</li>
            <li> my face feels alot more cleaner than hand washed.</li>
            <li> For those days I can devote more time to my face.  </li>
            <li> it really works great.</li>
            <li> I love mine.</li>
            <li> The price that I was able to get this item for was les than I could have purchased at any retail store.  </li>
            <li> And it has gotten more oily in the T-zone.  </li>
            <li> I have one and love it.  </li>
            <li> so i know that it&#x27;s cleaning my face better than before.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I love to have received more of the cleanser or maybe a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself and my sister and we both love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to wash my face now, and it feel so good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Sure, the pro x/battery powered tooth brush does a better job and makes a difference, but the clarisonic/sonicare simply does the best job.</li>
            <li> I love using this.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love all Olay products</li>
            <li> this cleanser did more for me in 1 week than Epiduo did in 5 months.</li>
            <li> One of the best brush for daily routines, you can notice the difference within a week</li>
            <li> Very happy I purchased and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many many years.</li>
            <li> Although I do have to admit that what I&#x27;m about to say no one is probably going to believe me; and that&#x27;s Ok if you don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> SATISFIED</li>
            <li> my face is much better now  </li>
            <li> Was hoping it would be more like my daughter&#x27;s Clinique cleansing brush...</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> /&gt; (where I paid more than this price,btw ,Costco no longer carries</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now and my skin has never looked or felt better since I was a kid.  </li>
            <li> and my moisturizer seems to have soaked into my skin much better.  </li>
            <li> I came across this product by looking over the top 100 products in the Beauty Dept and this was in the top 5.</li>
            <li> Do I need to say more?</li>
            <li> Skin looks better after one week for me.</li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure about the use of it.  </li>
            <li> My mother loves all Olay products and the Pro-X Advanced Cleansing system is no exception!</li>
            <li> gifted item.. doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with it</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Anyone looking for an affordable way to keep your skin looking healthy, this is it.</li>
            <li> (I bought more).</li>
            <li> Using this brush is certainly better than just using your hands to wash your face.</li>
            <li> I thought this was kind of cheap though.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and i wish it can really do more magic than towel to my skin.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This product will do all most everything the Clarisonic will do at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> A dip in alcohol, or spritzing of vinegar, just to be safe.  </li>
            <li> One thing I have noticed is that I seem to get more?</li>
            <li> I have never got along :).</li>
            <li> She has passed away and her skin looked better than mine</li>
            <li> After many years and my noticing my aging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suggested it to many friends</li>
            <li> It gave me the WEIRDEST, GROSSEST, MOST INTENSE breakout I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase and the price.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> I must say, she does wear make-up for work and before this brush she had significantly more issues than she does now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO glad I bought this rather than a Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> And the refills are cheap too!  </li>
            <li> love love love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will purchase more of these as gifts for my family.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my girlfriend, daughter and granddaughter and they love it.</li>
            <li> Love love this cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this more than a minute or your skin will start to sting.</li>
            <li> im looking forward to seeing better skin now that i have this.</li>
            <li> I love my brush.</li>
            <li> feels refreshing after using it and pores do not clog anymore.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay to use it once  </li>
            <li> I use argan oil as a moisturizer, and the effects of the brush seem to help the oil absorb into my skin better and leave it more supple than before.  </li>
            <li> How could a product purchased in the supermarket do a better job?  </li>
            <li> I love my Olay Cleansing System and would buy again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Definitely love this cleansing  product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoying using this product.</li>
            <li> This is 10x better and removes my makeup.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this products.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I took a chance and bought this system.</li>
            <li> I love using this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> I love how it can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> :) will be using this product for awhile</li>
            <li> and I am pleased that I did.</li>
            <li> I Love this cleansing system.</li>
            <li> save your money or splurge on a clarisonic, this is just like using your fingers but takes more time.</li>
            <li> Some people say the magic is in the cleansers you use, but for my money it is also in the device.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $ and does a good job</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend enjoyed it as a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much I posted a review in my own magazine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> /&gt;While researching a number of products I noticed many, many ways to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I am sure there is more than one way to address any problem that you may have.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love using this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than the cleanser included.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I get better exfoliation from my St. Ives apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> ive had this cleansing system for about 2-3 months now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> i love how it feels ahhh</li>
            <li> ah i love it</li>
            <li> My moisturizers go on so much better</li>
            <li> it was ok it did make my face a bit better</li>

            <li> I love this cleaning system.</li>
            <li> I have one of these and love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this...</li>
            <li> This cleaner is good but not as powerful as others.</li>
            <li> The cleanser that was included with it is okay, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> LOVE makeup...</li>
            <li> the more, the better...</li>
            <li> but more often than not, I will fall asleep in my caked up face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is okay.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found I use mostly the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; speed.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use whatever cleanser I like with it as well.</li>
            <li> Purchase two of these cleaning systems for my daughters and they love them.</li>
            <li> Love the cleaning cream that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> It is okay cleaning brush..</li>
            <li> I ordered one from QVC (w/ installed payments) and LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> But I was able to find Olay&#x27;s replacement brush heads for this product 2 for $6 on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Checked the reviews for this item before purchasing and must say it&#x27;s better quality for the cost of others.</li>
            <li> I could see the change on my face skin day by day, now I say bye shiny skin :)</li>
            <li> Love this product for my face.</li>
            <li> Love this face brush.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is clearer and more refined.  </li>
            <li> it came with, and I love it.</li>
            <li> so haven&#x27;t got that to compare with but for me its better than hands.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looking and feeling a lot better after using this machine.</li>
            <li> I dont really use the cleanser it came with as I prefer the soap I use, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Much better than washing with my hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use, and expect the results to even get better.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with batteries and a travel size cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my face feels softer after and better balanced after using it.</li>
            <li> excellent product with instant result.</li>
            <li> Better than cleaning with your hands.</li>
            <li> Bought as gifts for my daughters and they both love them</li>
            <li> A washcloth probably does a better job.</li>
            <li> okay recommends.</li>
            <li> The price compared to in-store prices is so much better.</li>
            <li> Love is not even the word to describe what I feel for this product.</li>
            <li> I also love using this after taking my makeup off.</li>
            <li> i love this brush cleanser.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face better then just using my hands and a cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine that they do anything more or better.</li>
            <li> Way better than overpriced clarasonic cleansing system.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> but im not in love with it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I got it for such a good price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like it or even use it every day.  </li>
            <li> So yes, would recommend it to my friends and family. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product because it is helping me with something that I have suffered with for years.</li>
            <li> Its safe for shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this instead of wasting a bunch of money on a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I love more about it</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying the results of this electric brush.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was on time and product intact, I was not overly impressed with the spin speed of the brush, a friend recently introduced me to the newer and cheaper neutrogena product, I think I might switch.....</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> also was recvd in a very timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou for a great product.</li>
            <li> I try not to exfoliate more than 3-4 times a week</li>
            <li> I love any and all Olay products, but had put off purchasing this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I began taking better care of my health</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> but this did a wonderful job on my fragile skin</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure acne, but it sure helps.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone who does not want to pay top dollar for something that works just as well...</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> it rotates, which seems more abrasive.  </li>
            <li> I can use it in the shower!!!! :-)</li>
            <li> It also helps my moisturizer work better.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love this product it works better than my hands..</li>
            <li> i think this is TOTALLY A BETTER BUY than the clearsonic</li>
            <li> Satisfied with it</li>
            <li> I love that I can use an exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li> do wish there were options for the heads, but I&#x27;m okay with the one they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had been looking at this and the $200 products for many months now.</li>
            <li> I used it on the slowest setting across my nose and cheeks because that&#x27;s where I used my Pore cleanser most</li>
            <li> /&gt;That works 100x better than this machine.</li>
            <li> A wash cloth does a much better job at cleaning and exfoliating than this product.</li>
            <li> I feel like the rotating brush cleaned better than hands alone..</li>
            <li> I love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I feel one could achieve better results with a toothbrush on the face.</li>
            <li> There are much better and even cheaper drugstore alternatives.</li>
            <li> It is OK.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is just ok.  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I use this daily, and I am very happy with the results after using this product since February.</li>
            <li> Plus it made my skin feel smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> NOW, AN EXFOLIATER WORKS BETTER.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens for $25 :).</li>
            <li> ran out, i bought the clarisonic Refreshing gel CLEANSER which is about $20 and used it with</li>
            <li> It replaced a facial bristle brush I purchased from a dollar tree, and I have been thoroughly impressed with the difference.</li>
            <li> I love the way it cleans my face.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of using this brush system.</li>
            <li> May want to spend more money for more power.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is okay</li>
            <li> Makes my night time routine easier and my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent device for the price compared to pricier types that do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could use it more efficiently on my body.</li>
            <li> I might buy more as gifts for my siblings.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; and thank you for reading my review.  :)</li>
            <li> Like many others I wanted the Mia</li>
            <li> This is an excellent facial cleansing tool.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use too many products, with this</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It seems sturdy &amp; it works OK.  </li>
            <li> Pay more get more...</li>
            <li> After about 2 months of using this, my wife&#x27;s skin is noticeable smoother and more radiant.  </li>
            <li> easy to clean and looks good when you have a bunch of stuff on the shelf or in your shower.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love it, I bought one for each my mom, sister, and me.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I assumed it stopped working because I dropped it so many times.  </li>
            <li> another would have been better.</li>
            <li> only thing i dont like is the roughness of the brush...other than that it is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> This brush is okay..</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing system from olay.  </li>
            <li> Boy am I glad i found this product instead.</li>
            <li> all I can say is I get better results by scrubbing with a baby washcloth &amp; soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of cheaply made though.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my sister and she&#x27;s in love with it.</li>
            <li> Retin-A that I use are greater and therefore creating better results with skin texture and tone.</li>
            <li> If any of you are trying to get better looking, healthier skin this year</li>
            <li> It lived up to its hype and I am truly content with it and the fact that I didn&#x27;t have to go out and spend $150 is even better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> it needs to have more in it.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay line</li>
            <li> I would buy it again. :)</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare, but I do love the way the ProX makes my face feel after using.</li>
            <li> but if you have acne prone skin probably not the best consider you are reusing the same brush.</li>
            <li> I figured being an Olay Branded product, it would have worked out better.</li>
            <li> I eat healthy and wash my face and medicate over the counter but still have had problems.</li>
            <li> I love it and wish I had bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> and I have have healthier, better looking skin.</li>
            <li> The buttons seem touchy at times, I have to hit it more than once for it to turn on or change speeds.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> So glad I got this.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Cleans better than washing with your hands.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this</li>
            <li> The number one factor that influenced my buy was the price and that Revlon is a reputable brand.</li>
            <li> An OK cleansing device .</li>
            <li> Wish it had more power.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done and I feel like it is cleaning my face much better than just using a facewash.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it four stars is because it could be stronger, but for the price its great!</li>
            <li> Great price, works very well.</li>
            <li> This system is so easy to use and feels so good while doing it and after, one&#x27;s face feels refreshed and so clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good at removing the oil and dirt before it becomes blackheads, the exfoliation is alright, but not as great as a teen</li>
            <li> He asked what I was using because he wanted to try it too &#x3D;).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this brush....</li>
            <li> I love Olay products because they work.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW IT SRUBS.</li>
            <li> Why spend $99 or more?</li>
            <li> :) I love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this system.</li>
            <li> Can use with any product, but I use the Olay facial cleansers and get great results!</li>
            <li> Researched this product against clarisonic and felt that this was a better buy for the benefit.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this, just wish It worked better cleaning the pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt and looked better.  </li>
            <li> I Love it.  </li>
            <li> and it worked much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure after I&#x27;ve used it awhile</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase the replacement heads for it because I don&#x27;t feel like it works any better than a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I use exfoliating scrub, and this cleans WAY better...</li>
            <li> and I love them both -</li>
            <li> This cleanses and exfoliates/softens, and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I would love it even more.</li>
            <li> i love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of the brush on my skin, however mine kept pausing during use.  </li>
            <li> some should pay more attention to (e.g. pores, blackheads, etc. )</li>
            <li> MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used the sonicare toothbrush for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I have them both.</li>
            <li> but I have used many exfoliating scrubs, masks, and peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even better than the clarisonic in my opinion</li>
            <li> I love this and will be buying this for my family and friends</li>
            <li> this gives you that luxury with a more sensible price tag than paying over $100.</li>
            <li> I like that it is waterproof, and I like that it is battery-operated versus rechargable because it makes it much more portable and compact.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li> I get better results by just using my hands.  </li>
            <li> Complexion looks better in three days.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can use it in the shower too.</li>
            <li> This works ok.</li>
            <li> I cannot explain how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> I love this devices.</li>
            <li> I feel like I get a better wash with a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> and *seems* to be more radiant as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is an excellent product that works well and does wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li> love the two speeds, though I tend to use the faster one more often.</li>
            <li> I love this Olay Pro-X</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels after using it.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product ever so similar to the Clairsonic product that cost way more.</li>
            <li> and I think it cleans my skin better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My skin looks clearer and the color even seems to be better.</li>
            <li> Love this  even my grandson loves it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It seems like with each passing day my skin looks better.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> so I am quite satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> For what we paid for it we love it.</li>
            <li> face seems cleaner and smooth!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on whim in hopes of a better way to cleanse my oily and acne prone face.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> But I enjoyed using it</li>
            <li> use it daily, I am very happy with my face scrubber.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using it, which I do every day.</li>
            <li> So, if anyone who is still smoking/tanning, no product is going to be able to give you results but if you are not then I recommend trying Olay Pro-x</li>
            <li> , THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li> I do believe that it cleans better than your hands or a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> Not only is this awesome because it is waterproof</li>
            <li> I keep it in the shower and use as part of my morning routine which I love.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Ty ProX by Olay Advanced!</li>
            <li> However, after weeks of usage I am convinced that this is a worthwhile addition to one&#x27;s beauty set.</li>
            <li> The cleanser it comes with is okay.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok, I didnt notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I love using it.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to order this product because my go-to cosmetics reviewers at beautypedia say it&#x27;s not any better than a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad i found it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery great price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it, wish it spun even faster.  </li>
            <li> For some reason I think that would make me feel like I was cleaning better.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing system.</li>
            <li> Love love love this.  </li>
            <li> It leaves skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> My face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not the product&#x27;s fault, it is more how my skin reacted.  </li>
            <li> switch up the days I use it, in hopes that it gets better.</li>
            <li> Now, my skin is softer and more radiant.</li>
            <li> love most of the Olay products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I couldn&#x27;t afford the famous Clarisonic</li>
            <li> It does make the cleanser foam up a bit though, so the creamy ones work better.</li>
            <li> I had been doing better with a soapy washcloth and my fingertips and have returned to that method.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure clarisonic has</li>
            <li> It is okay.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a better one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and effective...can&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li> But, indeed, it&#x27;s a good product and can make you feel fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> 100X better than the cheap-o Neutrogena Sonic</li>
            <li> Works ok at beginning.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely Love it&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love the two speeds, and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Wonderful facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It does help to remove more makeup than just using a cleanser or face pad</li>
            <li> I am glad it is safe to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> but I guess it does okay.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is more radiant these days.</li>
            <li> it works just as well for a better price.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much better they are, or how much better they could be for that amount of money.</li>
            <li> I was so tempted to get the Clarisonic but did not want to shell out $200 for it and am so glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, and I leave it in the shower for greater convenience.</li>
            <li> This cleansing brush is ok.</li>
            <li> I use this brush twice a day with the tea tree face wash from the Body Shop, my skin feels much better and the acne has reduced drastically.</li>
            <li> Make sure you order extras.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have researched the Clarisonic, and most people would say that it does more than just \\&quot;clean your face\\&quot;, but I think the Pro-X is a pretty good alternative for the price!</li>
            <li> it makes my face feels so clean and smooth !!</li>
            <li> I bought this item because people were saying good things about it and they were right.</li>
            <li> Just use the right moisterizer and sunscreen and you should be good.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for someone who wants smooth, clean skin - without a lot of effort and investment.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel smooth and clean after each wash:)I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> only regret is that I didn&#x27;t take before and after pictures - honestly the results are that good!</li>
            <li> This is the first of this kind of product that I have tried and I love it!</li>
            <li> I dont have to wear as much makeup because my skin has better texture (smoothness!!)</li>
            <li> It is gentle, but very effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle but very effective at cleansing the pores in my skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle, but VERY effective.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle on my skin and very effective, and a fraction of the price of my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> This is very nice and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very soft, yet it exfoliates beautifully.  </li>
            <li> And the free clean gel is good.</li>
            <li> love it keeps my face nice and clean</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice so far, at night in the shower, to clean my face thoroughly, and I am very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> My face feels cleaner and my moisturizer is more effective with a clean face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use, feels good when you are using it, and my face is smoother than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li> Contemplated and read reviews for weeks before I bought it (especially excited of all the positive reviews).</li>
            <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> You do not need to spend that much on a machine and goes in circles!!!!</li>
            <li> although I did want to get a facial cleanse brush, so glad I got this one!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best, but&lt;br /&gt;it is great for traveling, small, light weight and works well.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product out.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to started using</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not completely giving up on the product, because I really like it and when my skin is happy, it looks flawless; however, if I keep getting break outs, I will have to stop using it.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> But so far, so good!  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> but so far it seems to be good, and I hope the quality of my skin will continue to improve!</li>
            <li> I use this system twice a day and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Iwas given this as a gift and even though my complexion is not bad, I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> My fiance was so impressed with the results he asked if they make one with a little more power for men so he can get one! :)</li>
            <li> If not, grab a washcloth, your favorite cleanser, some baking soda - and you probably have a pretty fair match.</li>
            <li> You can use pretty much any cleanser that you want, but exfoliating kinds work best.</li>
            <li> Gives my face a nice clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding that Olay is becoming more and more my product of choice for skincare.  </li>
            <li> After using it, my face feels really nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I am going to purchase my own!</li>
            <li> However, It does do a good job of removing makeup and for a lazy person like me who doesn&#x27;t like scrubbing, this is awesome.</li>
            <li> it feels nice when i used the brush to clean my face though</li>
            <li> Pretty good but doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans my skin significantly more than without it</li>
            <li> I sent this to a truly beautiful 15 year old who has a lovely complexion in the hope that she&#x27;ll continue with that beaufitul</li>
            <li> nice product face feels clean</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so good after a long day at work and my complection looks great.</li>
            <li> Mostly, my skin is fairly oily and ergo breaks out pretty often.</li>
            <li> Decent product, not as great as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Since using this product I can honestly say my face looks and feels clean</li>
            <li> Is just as described and it works fine quick delivery and good quality for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using philosophy face wash, that along with this brush leaves my face feeling so nice and clean.</li>
            <li> but when I do, it leaves my face nice and clean.</li>
            <li> SO MANY GOOD REVIEWS IS MOST OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS</li>
            <li> The brush head is very easy to take on and off and replacements are cheap (under $10 for a 2 pack).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product at a great price point.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels great and I highly recommend.</li>

            <li> Very gentle, good for sensative skin.</li>

            <li> I bought this after reading multiple great reviews and I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> If you want a true, amazing cleansing experience, get a Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great tool for healthy skin!</li>
            <li> So smooth, feel great on the face, good to do a facial with.</li>
            <li> Best thing to have in the shower after a long day.</li>
            <li> She loved it so much she suggested we buy one for my mom on her birthday!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this to slough off flakey skin from my Retin A regime and it works pretty good for that.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are easily acquirable and clean up so nice(much better than my Clarisonic ones ever did)  and the choice of two speeds is nice.  </li>
            <li> I loved this so much, I bought it for a friend for her birthday!</li>
            <li> Had first ordered the Clarisonic Plus from another site (good discount) but it would not charge.</li>
            <li> My tone is slowly becoming more even and my face feels cleaner.  </li>
            <li> My pores are tighter even though they were pretty good before the product I can still notice the difference after using.  </li>
            <li> and I think it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> But being a fan of Olay for 30 years I knew going in that the chances were pretty darn good that this product would meet or exceed my expectations.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, works well to wash your face.</li>
            <li> I am a frugal person who does not believe in throwing my money away on the trendy things in life just to be cool.</li>
            <li> This does a pretty good job</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> The exfoliator that comes with it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find something so awesome for my face.</li>
            <li> It works so good and my skin looks so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> exfoliating lotion is pretty good though.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, the build quality seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> this is pretty good - doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power</li>
            <li> makea my skin very smooth and feels nice and fresh</li>
            <li> :) it leaves it clean, smooth and radiant :) and I am NOT exaggerating!</li>

            <li> Honestly, I think I am among those lucky people that has pretty good skin</li>
            <li> and my pores are becoming more clean and are shrinking!</li>
            <li> WORTH THE PRICE!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product!</li>
            <li> I am definitely not disappointed!</li>
            <li> For the price it is totally worth it!!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I am still using the original batteries!</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth the price though!!</li>
            <li> Has significantly cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use the face wash sample with it because it made me breakout, but this isn&#x27;t uncommon for me when trying new soaps.</li>
            <li> This one does an awesome job, lasts a very long time even though I use it in the shower every day.</li>
            <li> pretty SWEET!!!</li>
            <li> This entire line is yielding amazing results for me and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> and though it&#x27;s really scratchy and not quite pleasant, it keeps the area</li>
            <li> and I love how easy it is</li>
            <li> Easy &amp; safe to use</li>
            <li> Easy and done. :)</li>
            <li> I love that its battery powered and easy to tote between the sink and shower.</li>
            <li> it works so easy this is better than doing it with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but this device is so easy and enjoyable to use</li>
            <li> Amazing price, and super portable.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and is a nice quality.  </li>
            <li> Can put the face to get rid of excess cutin, I use two times a week now, each time finished face is exquisite and smooth, combined with the mask, the next day, feel the skin look brand-new</li>
            <li> This one uses nice soft bristles that feel good on the face.  </li>
            <li> I have also bought a lot of different cleansers- both high-end brands and drug store, trying to find the best fit for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very frugal, cut &amp; color own hair, make own jewelry,etc &amp;</li>
            <li> more like once a week because I&#x27;m incredibly lax about my facial regime.  </li>
            <li> and I wonder if I could have done better with a slightly more advanced product.</li>
            <li> It did seem kind of harsh, but the brush itself felt great!</li>
            <li> Feels good to get a good facial scrub!</li>
            <li> Additionally, use the Oxy Advanced Cleaning in the shower or after, to ensure that your pores are open and the brush can do the best job it can.</li>
            <li> Good for teens but not as pricey and the replacement brushes are more reasonable too.</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice a day (with both the included cleanser and my own, in conjunction with another facial products) and my skin condition has greatly improved.</li>
            <li> I love using this brush, it makes my skin soft and happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and kind of cheap feeling.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s gentle and yet it does a good job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Great product at a very modest price.</li>
            <li> This machine is very easy to use and leaves my skin felling refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad most users are experiencing good results, but I&#x27;m not reading anything extraordinary that would make me run right out and buy it.  </li>
            <li> This brush paired with a great moisturizer has completely solved the problem, almost immediately!  </li>
            <li> Great tool for a modest price!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has actually helped me achieve that beautiful flawless skin I&#x27;ve dreamed of all my life.</li>
            <li> in all it works, and it&#x27;s better than using paper towels (better for the environment/less trash), which is what I normally use because wash clothes aren&#x27;t supposed to be good for your face (unless you bleach them).</li>
            <li> I love it, it leaves my skin very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I was considering diving head first into the clarisonic craze since there are so many good reviews out there, but I thought I might as well try this first since it&#x27;s so amazingly priced.  </li>
            <li> You think your manual toothbrush is just fine, until you see how great and clean your teeth feel after using an electric toothbrush for the first time</li>
            <li> My skin is fresher and clean!</li>
            <li> and it was completely clean!</li>
            <li> and my face seemed fine, better even.  </li>
            <li> After two uses, my face feels so clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean!</li>
            <li> My face is finally clean!</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so clean!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gay and my skin feels better</li>
            <li> I also use it to clean my rings!</li>
            <li> My face feels really, really clean, haven&#x27;t felt that way in years!</li>
            <li> You can feel it clean through your skin and just exfoliate your pores!</li>
            <li> my face was never washed this clean before!</li>
            <li> My face felt so clean!</li>
            <li> I always feel clean and it is so relaxing, plus you can take it in the shower!</li>
            <li> &amp; I look &amp; feel relaxed, clean &amp; exfoliated!</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my face and pores were!</li>
            <li> I can feel the clean and soon as i start putting on on my face!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting something to clean my face thoroughly and this is it!</li>
            <li> My face feels tingly and clean!</li>
            <li> and then I used this on what I thought was my clean face and immediately saw the difference on the pad- DIRT!</li>
            <li> Face looked brighter and so clean!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin clean and&lt;br /&gt;Fresh!</li>
            <li> Works best with the Olay &amp;#34;designed&amp;#34; cream, which I do not particularly like...</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin nice and clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I truly believe the brush does a better job at enabling products to clean the skin better than a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product.t provides a much deeper clean than you can get with just using a cleanser and wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I love the way the brush spins 360 degrees, it feels like I&#x27;m getting a deeper and more thorough clean than the Clarasonics 10 degree spin.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel, so clean and smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally able to properly clean all the junk out of my pores every day, giving my face a better chance of healing and looking the clearest it has looked in a while.</li>
            <li> It scrubs my pores clean and my face is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> have used mine for more than a year and my skin looks clean and Healthy</li>
            <li> I used my awesome Delon cotton rounds (sold on amazon) to remove what the face wash and pro x didn&#x27;t remove and NOTHING showed up on my still white and clean rounds.</li>
            <li> My products do better with my skin because of the clean that I am able to get with this device.</li>
            <li> It face wash very clean, compact, easy to carry.</li>
            <li> Very nice cleansing - leaves my face very soft.  </li>
            <li> Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> I saw a segment from Dr. Phils s company \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot; and the plastic surgeon said you would get very good results if you used it regularly.</li>
            <li> Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very good product.  </li>
            <li> the cleanser that came with it was very good and even seemed to get off any left over makeup after i used my makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and extremely easy to keep clean and store.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job at cleansing and I recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap and high quality brush.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and am super pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for a month now because I wanted to make sure that my review was accurate.</li>
            <li> but I do know that the Olay version is amazing and well worth the $.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on A LOT better and it wears longer because I&#x27;m not sweating it off with my huge pores.</li>
            <li> I get the most satisfaction when I&#x27;m applying foundation because now it&#x27;s so smooth and glowing</li>
            <li> It feels great on my face which I consider it to be sensitive since I have Rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I love my Olay Pro-X - as my face feels really smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating which comes with the box is great and i am using it every day although I am having sensitive skin \\&quot;oily</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS GREAT FOR MY ACNE PRONE SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been used for about a month, and so far works great for a low-cost item.</li>
            <li> I reacted to the free sample exfoliator (sensitive skin) but the brush is excellent and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent, cleans skin better than a wash cloth and brush is soft on the skin, not irritating.</li>
            <li> First, I want to start out my review by saying WOW, I AM SO IMPRESSED!!!</li>
            <li> Enjoy, I am sure you will.</li>
            <li> Might be ideal for traveling since it&#x27;s lighter and smaller</li>
            <li> the results are basically the same you end up with beautifully exfoliated healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> My skin cleared up, and my makeup goes on much more smoothly.</li>
            <li> I love it and my skin looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have been using it with the Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser (which is great) but as soon as that&#x27;s gone I will give the Olay Pore Scrub a try.</li>
            <li> but so far, the Olay brush has been great.  </li>
            <li> this cheap anyway.  :)</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and works great</li>
            <li> So far, this has been a great buy.</li>
            <li> Most companies are too cheap to supply you with batteries.</li>
            <li> Its soft, but cleanses great.</li>
            <li> It feels more scratchy than anything and after using it my skin doesn&#x27;t feel smooth like they say.</li>
            <li> It works great and leaves my skin so soft and dewy looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to use a light touch and go over your face a couple of times than to push the brush into your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended it and wow it is great.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth feels after washing with this brush.</li>
            <li> When i first opened the product i was very satisfied with the look because it had reached my expetations.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job for a minimal price.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful for a smooth face with better tone</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with it and will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Now I have a soft face, and I am so happy.  </li>
            <li> Great on sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> Yes, an Advanced Cleansing System, but I wish it had a easier-to-grasp  and more descriptive name.</li>
            <li> I checked on Amazon for something more affordable, and I came across this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> It seems too soft at first but when it spin it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> Use it for 30 seconds and it&#x27;ll be the best 30 bucks you ever spent on your face.</li>
            <li> And it truly does seem to make my face cream more effective from the first try.</li>
            <li> My opinion, is that this is going to be great, but if your skin is sensitive, just use the face cleanser that you know works with your skin</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, because it is pretty powerful, but it is great for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> My face is extremely smooth after using this product and I will continue to use this until something better comes out.</li>
            <li> , I feel my face is more smoothly, ^_^&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> first time I used the PROx with the included cleanser, I have to say I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> It is the best money I have spent on a face product in ages.  </li>
            <li> it is the best beauty secret I now own!  </li>
            <li> And the most important thing i got it for 17 $ with the coupon.</li>
            <li> : always make sure you moisturize after you use this (even if you have oily skin - use an oil free moisturizer) to prevent it from becoming flaky.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I find myself touching my face to see if it&#x27;s still really so smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid user of scrubs, scrubbing pads, etc, and this has given me the best results by far, without irritation.</li>
            <li> and when I go get my makeup done professionally, they tell me how great my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> anyway~ enjoy~ :) .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this tool, and I would completely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and the 2 speeds are great.</li>
            <li> I really love the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> When I use it, my face feels more smooth and it does help with exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using it and would take even more time with it.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System is okay</li>
            <li> This is an incredible idea, but lacks the real punch that most of us with problem skin really desire.</li>
            <li> My 4-star rating is primarily because I love the Olay line of products.  </li>
            <li> fabulous love</li>
            <li> I noticed that even for it&#x27;s soft bristles compared to the Clarisonic it still does a really great job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Felt great on the skin, soft but my skin broke out and that&#x27;s even with cleaning the brush.</li>
            <li> I just love my Olay Pro-x Advanced Cleansing System..</li>
            <li> Best of all, you can use this on rough areas of your body like your elbows as well- for that purpose</li>
            <li> I have never felt my face this smooth in many months (I get quarterly facials).</li>
            <li> have to admit, I am so glad I gave the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System a try.  </li>
            <li> pretty good leaves smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive yet oily skin, and it works great on me.</li>
            <li> It feels good after I use it but can&#x27;t tell much difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this one, hoping it would work as good as the reviews indicated and it absolutely does.</li>
            <li> This helps really get a good scrubbing on your face.</li>
            <li> This is gentle and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> , It really works good, hold batterey power</li>
            <li> do not use it as much as i should but for the money stimulates your skin,  good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the Pro-X because I also own a Clarisonic Pro and thought my opinion may be useful to some buyers.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought my grandmother one</li>
            <li> Good luck, and thanks for reading my review</li>
            <li> Good luck, and thanks for reading my review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used this product before and loved it so much i decided to buy another one to bring with me on holidays.</li>
            <li> I also have tried the Clarisonic and think the Olay Pro-X is just as good for much lower price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I loved it so much I bought one for my sink as well.  </li>
            <li> so soft~its made in china，his material feels very soft，small and exquisite。very good ~！Exfoliate</li>
            <li> This brush is not as powerful as I would have liked, but I am keeping for the price.  </li>
            <li> So I waited awhile to review this to really get a good feel for</li>
            <li> Loved the gentle yet thorough exfoliation with 2 speed brushes.  </li>
            <li> This is so much cheaper than the Clarisonic face brush and works just as good.</li>
            <li> Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying the whole kit that comes with the brush and the pad, just having the brush is okay, but both are more effective.</li>
            <li> so I see no difference between before and after use, but my mother says that it is really good and works very well after every use</li>
            <li> good for gentle cleaning, not as power as clarisonic</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> loved it so much</li>
            <li> Great product, very easy to use, and if automatic heating to dry the better ...</li>
            <li> because this is a rotating brush instead of a sonic technology but for the price seems just right, its better than just washing your face for sure, it has helped my makeup to stay longer and look better.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any of the higher end cleansing brushes but this brush works great and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Super cheap and effective, my wife loves it！</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, cute, easy use.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Make-up goes on smoother, moisturizers and acne products soak in more quickly and over-all better.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed at the quick results especially with reduction in blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> Love, this is I&#x27;ve always wanted to buy, I feel very great, light makeup skin care no longer discharge makeup, is washed clean, cheap, but forgot to buy the brush head, the next time also come</li>
            <li> Wash clean and very comfortable</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and can help me clean my face.</li>
            <li> so I used my own, it washes all right</li>
            <li> I had to wash it off right away, then start over with a cleanser of my own.  </li>
            <li> wash face with olay pro-x brush + exfoliating creme (right now I&#x27;m using korres rose scrub)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling super clean and I love it!</li>
            <li> I then used the rotating soft bristle device and my skin has never felt smoother or looked more even in tone... and that is after just 1 use!!</li>
            <li> This brush is what I was looking for - soft, but very effective.</li>
            <li> after some days,I found skin more fine and smooth.</li>
            <li> My face feels very clean and smooth after each use.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my face very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product, works great and last long.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I know...sounds corny, but it it true!</li>
            <li> well, I&#x27;ve tried other machines but this one is the best!</li>
            <li> I use mine every other day and the cleansing brush is still in great shape!!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably due to my glasses and the build up of oil under them, but when I started using this thing it was great!</li>
            <li> easy to use, and it is comfort when touch the skin, clean the skin pretty good</li>
            <li> I had one of the original Olay face cleaners and that was so much better.</li>
            <li> So after watching a shopping channel show on the Clarisonic Mia, I began researching that product and more budget friendly versions.</li>
            <li> I love Oil of Olay products and I was not disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Other then that, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This was such a good buy!</li>
            <li> I would like it to have a variable speed or direction, but other than that it is awesome.</li>
            <li> Due to this I try to take care of my face the best I can.</li>
            <li> so I went looking for a more budget friendly alternative.  </li>
            <li> But other then that it was a great purchase!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made the most significant difference in my skin of anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I know I shouldn&#x27;t be so excited about washing my face, but with this I just can&#x27;t help it :)  </li>
            <li> Not a bad product!</li>
            <li> I have large pores, that tend to clog easily and form lots of blackheads and no exfoliant on it&#x27;s own has ever been able to solve the problem, so I bought this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny and light device and works very good, but I had some problems with dispatch and it took a month.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say the first time I use this product.i saw a immediate difference in my skin,this is a awesome product ,it left my skin smooth and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Face feels very clean and bright after use, and is very soft to touch.</li>
            <li> Yes many acne products contribute but in the end, keeping it clean is the most essential component of having great</li>
            <li> Batteries went in easily (contrary to another review), BUT I couldn&#x27;t get the brush head to snap on.</li>
            <li> Easily blemished.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this Olay cleansing brush, I wondered if it could clean better than a washcloth using either the Olay cleanser that comes with it or my Dove/baking soda combination.  </li>
            <li> Incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love how clean my face feels after.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Water got inside or these easily and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> No matter how many face cleansers I would use, I would get out of the shower and still my face would have make up and not feel or look clean.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> It will travel easily.</li>
            <li> I found the motor to be very adequate for the purposes this device was built for.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a way to make sure I got my face completely clean once the day was over.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and refresh after every use, and I have noticed that my skin looks even better than it did before.</li>
            <li> I believe that it does clean the skin better than just using a washcloth or your hands.</li>
            <li> Love this, my face is shiny clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> but I really love how clean it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, I can easily get around all the curves and angles of my face, even my nose, with ease.</li>
            <li> Easy to use in the shower</li>
            <li> and that makes it easy to get.  </li>
            <li> and that makes it easy to get.</li>
            <li> I take it easy</li>
            <li> It also makes it easy to take with you when you travel.</li>
            <li> I like feeling more clean with using this product.</li>

            <li> The brush is easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> The brush head is easy to remove and replace.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit stubborn, but it&#x27;s easy to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Brush has always worked great, replacing batteries every few months to keep a good spin.</li>
            <li> be sure to have a good moisturizer near by.</li>
            <li> I just manuever around that and spend more time on each part of my face, but it gets my face really clean</li>
            <li> and then it comes off easily.  </li>
            <li> I just love it, it leaves my skin clean with no make up and after use my skin looks radiant.</li>
            <li> not something you can easily do when washing with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> considering some similar products cost $50-$75 or more, the price was great and the product&lt;</li>
            <li> If any start to sprout, it goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li> End of the day works great for me because it gets rid of the grime from the day and lets my night cream seep in more, but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> It was easy to put together as well.</li>

            <li> Then it&#x27;s extremely easy to take off.</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly and I like the way it cleans my face and</li>
            <li> I STRONGLY ADVISE EVERYONE NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> The brush itself itsnt quite as strong as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong as to damage the skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a month without breakouts or issues and the batteries are still going strong (the ones that came with it).</li>
            <li> The brush will pop off from time to time, but it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I strongly considered returning it, but she does use it, so I kept it since it was not that expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than some of the name more popular ones, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> I guess the produce was too strong for my face.</li>
            <li> There are two speed settings, but neither one is too strong.</li>
            <li> Unless you have exceptionally strong hands, don&#x27;t even think about ordering this brush.</li>
            <li> I saw the Pro-X in the store, but just assumed it was an inferior product until I saw the strong rating on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I is not as strong as I would like, I bought it based on reviews</li>
            <li> The two speed setting is nice and the brush is soft yet effective.  </li>
            <li> I have one of those 5x mirrors, so I&#x27;ve been able to really see how effective this product has been.</li>
            <li> And the motor doesn&#x27;t seem that strong.  </li>
            <li> A good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li> So Thanks to Good Morning America &amp; Olay Pro-X Advanced  Cleansing System</li>
            <li> While this product does work fairly well and do what it claims, It isn&#x27;t a very natural cleanser, which is much more important than you might think.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, feel like my face is very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t high tech or fancy, but does a good job.  </li>
            <li> But I highly recommend to use a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, but effective.</li>
            <li> She has pretty flawless skin anyway, but this just get&#x27;s all those impurities out and leaves her face clean and clear.</li>
            <li> My face felt so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> The liquid cleanser isn&#x27;t special at all, nor does it have an appealing smell.</li>
            <li> Its ok nothing special if I would have known I would have purchased a manual face brush</li>
            <li> good product, good price, much better price that the other name brand, cleanes well use it often to keep pores clean</li>
            <li> Overall, a very good product, it is great for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> my face feels very clean and fresh !</li>
            <li> and it felt great on the face, not rough.</li>
            <li> Great system, easy to use, and does the trick to keep skin clean and clear at affordable price.</li>
            <li> and I noticed an amazing difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> It is nice getting my face nice and smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for guys, too, so don&#x27;t be turned off by the fact that it&#x27;s made by Olay and generally marketed towards women.</li>
            <li> now that&#x27;s pretty amazing,</li>
            <li> This device is amazing at reducing blackheads, shrinking pores, and overall giving the user a smooth, bright complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Weeks have passed and I am still very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone even considering throwing away so much money on the Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> so I cannot compare but this product on it&#x27;s own is amazing, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging dock, and the brush heads are more affordable, smaller than the mia2.</li>
            <li> This is the first product of this kind that I have tried.</li>
            <li> After I got mine and used it the first time, I looked around the house and ended up making my own travel protector sleeve out of a (used) K-Cup -</li>
            <li> I liked the novalty of this when i first bought it</li>
            <li> I did try the exfoliating cleanser sample that came with it this morning and that seemed pretty nice.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal, good price, and fast, affordable international shipping.</li>
            <li> it is pretty effective.</li>
            <li> With the kind of price, it is doing its job very well!</li>
            <li> and I really liked it the first time i used it my face looked so radiant</li>
            <li> I have also dropped it many times on the floor and in a full tub of water.</li>
            <li> I honestly saw results the day after the first use.  </li>
            <li> and if I liked it I could always invest in a higher end product.  </li>
            <li> This was my first brush of this kind.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with Freeman&#x27;s Feeling Beautiful Pineapple Enzyme Facial Mask</li>
            <li> Hot water, soap, a washcloth, and your own hands.  </li>
            <li> you have enough to have a beautiful skin</li>
            <li> In fact, about two weeks after starting to use the product a woman walked up to me in the grocery store and told me I had beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li> My skins is more visibly softer, and it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> even though I live in Italy, it took only 10 days, and the packaging was very safe, very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with the ProX face cleaner, it leaves your face feeling clean and baby soft.  </li>
            <li> But this product gives you a great clean and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This thing really works and i get a good clean face after using it.</li>
            <li> Love it- super easy to travel with, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> But when I make sure to clean it after use, then my skin looks fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to take a chance with the Olay Pro-X. Leaves my face feeling so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Best part is I do not have to buy all the other products in order to get this as a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; gift from the TV ad!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product and was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and effective right in the comfort of your own bathroom.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for a good price and it will definitely make your skin cleaner, but does not get rid of pimples right away.</li>
            <li> A pulsing back and forth would probably be more effective, and the sonic products that cost a lot more are definitely more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wash hands in warm water mild soap, clean under nails (even short ones) rigorously with nail clipper file thing lol.</li>
            <li> works great  at a very reasonable price, I can not see why somebody would pay $200 for a simular product really what fools they must be</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and smooth and for the first time in forever, I&#x27;ve been able to go outside with no BB cream&lt;br /&gt;or foundation :D</li>
            <li> A good price and my face feel new everytime</li>
            <li> Then, of course, you need to buy new brushes fairly often.</li>
            <li> It was fine.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed that you will need to buy more brushes and those extra brushes would&#x27;ve been nice!</li>
            <li> I became more and more interested in the clarisonic mia brush (the cheapest model) but that week I saw an ad for this Olay brush.</li>
            <li> This machine seems just fine.  </li>
            <li> I thought my exfoliating cleansers were doing a fine job with removing make-up and oils at night.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t try to scrub your face, this is just fine.  </li>
            <li> It still works fine..</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works out fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof too, so it&#x27;s shower friendly if you like to clean your face while showering!</li>
            <li> This was the first facial cleansing brush I have purchased, and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> but it worked fine.</li>
            <li> and it was fine.  </li>
            <li> After a year the brush is still fine and the batteries still working.  </li>
            <li> I would like to fine another with some horse power.</li>
            <li> But I enjoy using it, it comes with two speeds, easy to use.</li>
            <li> The cleaner looks fine in quality。But</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro works just fine to exfoliate</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It just does not meet my needs but is fine for now.</li>
            <li> My skin feels wonderful and I am having less breakouts now as well.</li>
            <li> the sample cleanser worked fine.</li>
            <li> The ProX is fine.</li>
            <li> and it still works just fine...</li>
            <li> does the job just fine, may get another one as a gift.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cleans skin well and works fine with any soap.  </li>
            <li> I have had considerably less breakouts since using this and to me, that is priceless.</li>
            <li> and she said if I got one of these brushes, I should be fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, smoother, and the fine lines around my eyes and lips are gone, and my skin is always hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I tried the cleanser that came with it and was less impressed.  </li>
            <li> It was fine, but nothing I would buy again.  </li>
            <li> I use mine nightly and have fewer fine lines, glowing skin and look rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> This one is the perfect replacement but for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> While I could not take this product seriously at first (Mr. and I were going through a bag of goodies we were gifted and this was included), I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This brush from Olay works just fine.</li>
            <li> IT WAS FINE SINCE APRIL 2014, BUT, NOW THE BRUSH WILL NOT STAY ON.  </li>
            <li> I Love Olay products and this is my first time using this :).</li>
            <li> It works in the shower just fine.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> bought the face wash that goes along with it, but I also use another face wash and they both seem just fine.</li>
            <li> but for now this one will do just fine.  </li>
            <li> and it kept working just fine.  </li>
            <li> have purchased many many products from Amazon and this is the first review I have writen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable on your face an easy to you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, I suppose.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s light weight and can travel easily, too.</li>
            <li> the Olay Pro-X does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are diminished around my eyes.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t afford that system, then this will do just fine, while it lasts.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me.  </li>
            <li> but this one does the job just fine.  </li>
            <li> i used this for the first time this morning and left the shower with my face feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> It works fine in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery thanks!</li>
            <li> The cleaner supplied is god, but I&#x27;ve tried Nivea ones and they also work fine.</li>
            <li> It worked fine and had two speeds.</li>
            <li> This does the job just fine, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and it works just fine on the spinning brush head.  </li>
            <li> Affordable and works fine</li>
            <li> and I think they all work fine.</li>
            <li> and it is still working fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer absorbs more quickly than before and offsets and additional dryness caused by this method of cleansing.    </li>
            <li> Luckily, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about that!</li>
            <li> Super affordable for a quality product!</li>
            <li> You may want to start off with something more mild, like the L&#x27;Oreal 360 scrubbing tool before graduating to this type of cleaning system.might.</li>
            <li> You may want to start off with something more mild, like the L&#x27;Oreal 360 scrubbing tool before graduating to this type of cleaning system.</li>
            <li> lucky me, she loves it!  </li>
            <li> It strongly reminded me of one of those cheap portable hand fans you buy at the dollar store attached with a baby brush.</li>
            <li> However, after using the Olay Pro-x, the number of breakouts reduced tremendously!</li>
            <li> something is clearing up my mild acne!</li>
            <li> A quick google search shows the many awards this product has received and the hundreds of reviews attest to its quality.</li>
            <li> Any moisturizing product that is applied after cleaning absorbs quickly and much more thoroughly than before.  </li>
            <li> I  am in love, my new fave!!!!</li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin) but it still does a good job.</li>
            <li> At 28 my fair skin still is very sensitive, and I break out often.</li>
            <li> like it so much I am hoping to get two more as gifts!</li>
            <li> Hahaha, I love this product!</li>
            <li> Not to mention this product makes it very fun and easy.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but it does a good job, and the brush itself cleans easily.  </li>
            <li> and the soap that comes with it isn&#x27;t any better than the super cheap stuff.  </li>
            <li> Has a fairly strong movement, but soft on the face and neck, just what I wanted and feels good.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li> its easy to clean and easy to store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> A great buy, face feels super soft after use.</li>
            <li> It has fine beads in it for exfoliating (it doesn&#x27;t suds at all if that is important to you).</li>
            <li> You can run your fingernail across in a certain way and they ooze out, but you can&#x27;t see them unless you&#x27;re investigating your own face in the mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular unit is a must have!!!!</li>
            <li> Those little exfoliating sponges are great!</li>
            <li> I am glad that I tried the Olay first and as a result will not invest $150.00 on the original version of this cleansing system, as I cannot imagine it does that much more than the Olay does.</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a month ago and have been using it once a day (my nightly routine) and I have to say that I am highly impressed!</li>
            <li> This is the best little device I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> and after I am done it feels like I just had a facial, very pleased!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this little contraption.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it feels like you&#x27;re getting a wonderful little face massage while using.</li>
            <li> Great way to deep clean your face and clean out those pores !  </li>
            <li> It cleanses my face so well, getting rid of most of my blemishes while not drying it out too much!!</li>
            <li> This little thing is excellent quality with two speed settings.</li>
            <li> This little machine is awesome.</li>
            <li> To be perfect it should spin a little faster.</li>
            <li> This little machine works great!</li>
            <li> I love this so much!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t willing to drop $200+ on a Clarisonic, so this was the next best option I could find, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it came so fast!!</li>
            <li> This little scrubber is wonderful!</li>
            <li> and though it seems like the motion is not doing much, I&#x27;m sure it did clean my face because I have had no painful breakouts.</li>
            <li> I suppose my expectations weren&#x27;t really high, so I was very pleased when I tried this out.  </li>
            <li> Use it carefully and you can expect to get very good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it carefully and you can expect to get very good results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also helps with shaving or waxing, because the fine hairs that don&#x27;t always grow completely out get released from the skin so your waxing or shaving is more effective.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong on the original battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little product, sold at like a tenth of the price of its competitor, does the job fantastically well, and it also an excellent companion to a light exfoliator like the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub.  </li>
            <li> After one use, I was able to tell that my skin looked cleaner... more vibrant!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see a good clean face with the enclosed wash unless you have a new born baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> After using it, I find that my face feels very clean and soft, even to the point that I&#x27;m not always sure if I have cleaned all my cleanser off!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 4 days in and see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and wash my face really comfortable and clean</li>
            <li> which is a HUGE plus because I have found that rechargeable ones just start losing their charging power.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now and have noticed a huge change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> As for the two speeds, I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the two.  </li>
            <li> It is a great buy and refills are available on the same page.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of exfoliating, from home made scrubs to luxurious products</li>
            <li> I will say that I have no complaints but not seeing a huge improvement from scrubbing with my fingers</li>
            <li> HUGE difference in my face after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and have noticed a HUGE difference in my pores and the texture of my face.</li>
            <li> and my pores went from huge to almost invisible.</li>
            <li> Almost immediately I noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer the faster of the two, but the slower is nice for more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I can already see/feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I love this product use with my own natural cleaning products...</li>
            <li> and I have already seen a huge improvement in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> This has made a huge difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> but I can tell a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and handle comfortable to hold and sealed well to keep water out so as not to damage batteries.  </li>
            <li> It has helped hugely with preventing breakouts.</li>
            <li> Great scrubber...soft, but cleans deep into your pores.</li>
            <li> This Olay Cleansing System is truly a great product, I use it several times a week!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve ended up being its primary user.  </li>
            <li> But as women do, we get sucked in by &#x27;the next great product guaranteeing the Fountain of Youth&#x27;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will start by saying, I am not a woman, but I can see this thing being more useful to them with the make</li>
            <li> it leaves my face feeling so smooth</li>
            <li> but overall I think it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> Also, I have tendonitis and honestly, sometimes my hands hurt so much that I don&#x27;t wash my face because it hurts to make those motions with my hands or to hold a scrubby or towel.</li>
            <li> Feels comfortable in my hand</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be sucked in by a cheap price.  </li>
            <li> But overall great product.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about this brush.</li>
            <li> I am gonna buy that woman a great Christmas present this year!</li>
            <li> Gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> After a month of using the Olay Pro-X twice a day, my skin looks and feels silky smooth and my pores are noticeably reduced.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Try it and you&#x27;ll think the price is cheap.</li>
            <li> I liked it for the year that it worked, though I didn&#x27;t really notice the difference on my face.</li>
            <li> my skin has not felt so smooth before in my life.</li>
            <li> Affordable and overall a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, but gentle - my skin has never been irritated by the brush.</li>
            <li> At 71, cleansing and moisturizing is important if you don&#x27;t want to look like a shrunken potato.</li>
            <li> my skin ends up so smooth.  </li>
            <li> My husband even noticed how smooth and radiant my face looked after using the brush with the exfoliation facewash.  </li>
            <li> My face becomes soft and bright.</li>
            <li> Having suffered from acne since I can remember and being on various prescription face medication, this is the first time I can honestly say that my skin is noticeably and remarkably clearer.</li>
            <li> If you are realistically never going to spend the money on the Clarisonic, then I guess this could be a great addition to your face cleansing routine to give you some extra exfoliation.</li>
            <li> The results are sooo over my expectations for the cheap price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and it is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> but the facial scrubber was great.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li> When I use my moisturizer on my face,my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, haven&#x27;t had break outs in a while.</li>
            <li> Literally after using this product one time, my skin felt incredibly smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I do have the line of products that came with it.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various cleansers and they all work great with this.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more powerful</li>
            <li> I will see what else is available to use with the brush.</li>
            <li> what kind of cleanser you use because either way the brush is what&#x27;s really doing the trick.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a must buy for great skin,</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something comparable but without the big price tag, this product is great.</li>
            <li> and it is such a great price.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product though for those on a budget</li>
            <li> I will say that when you are using it on your face it feels wonderful and even after you are done using it your face feels tingly for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Cleans well, gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth</li>
            <li> I had some pore issues and this lightly scrubs your skin, which cleared the problem for me.</li>
            <li> It is great for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> plus you get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are also available for sell.</li>
            <li> For the difference in cost between the two, this is totally worth it, and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It also made my sides of my face smooth</li>
            <li> This product super-cleans my skin and leaves it so smooth that the rest of my skincare products glide on and</li>
            <li> This is great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t nearly as nice, and I don&#x27;t think the brush rotates as fast.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great brush for the money.</li>
            <li> and after I am done my face feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use and leave it in the shower, which makes me more apt to use it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> The Olay&#x27;s brush head is so much softer, but still really effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, because Im too cheap to buy a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product, especially with the price that Amazon charges.</li>
            <li> I had low expectations though I had read great reviews.  </li>
            <li> I did find that using it was a bit much for my skin - any kind of exfoliation, mechanical (like this) or chemical (retinoids,</li>
            <li> Compared to similar cleaning brushes out there the price is great.</li>
            <li> Overall, GREAT product and</li>
            <li> I enjoy my pro-x system.</li>
            <li> Her face feels smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and is great!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth way more</li>
            <li> I had always wanted to have one of these advanced cleaning systems but didn&#x27;t think that they would be affordable.</li>
            <li> but overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li> What I really liked about this cleanser is that you really feel it working after one use</li>
            <li> Pulls the skin when used, even with a light hand.</li>
            <li> But overall for the price I paid, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely softer since I started using this once or twice a week and has a great glow.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply made for the price,and I feel it is overpriced by about $10.</li>
            <li> My result, is a smoother complexion, if it is used with a great facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> The cleansing system really works effectively.  </li>
            <li> I use the low speed now &amp; find it does a great job cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li> but the brush works great; especially on Acne Prone skin.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because I wish there was a softer brush available or a body brush.  </li>
            <li> Works great, smaller size, and two speeds.</li>
            <li> and my skin looked fabulous.</li>
            <li> it still proves to be able to handle being in the water</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different cleansing and exfoliating products and by far this is the best one.</li>
            <li> all white design looks great.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to grip in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal and cheaper here than at my local Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li> My face was so smooth it almost felt like my girlfriends</li>
            <li> The brush head replacements are cheap too.</li>
            <li> My skin feel so smooth after using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great that this can be used with any of your preferred facial cleaning product (as the one it comes with does nothing for me).</li>
            <li> but I was too cheap.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Keep it light</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed my skin felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> Pros: cheap, works, can use whatever lotion&#x27;n&#x27;potion</li>
            <li> I got the Pro-X because I am too cheap to buy a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if bristles oscillated so I would not have to do so much work.</li>
            <li> the cheap design follows .......</li>
            <li> Great facial brush</li>
            <li> Its so smooth now</li>
            <li> Makes skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I now fully enjoy using this product nightly.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, my skin is looking and feeling fantastic.</li>
            <li> * not rechargeable and no base.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my legs, and I get a really smooth result.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have taken 10 years of living off my face after using it, and then with the Bel Essence, my skin is even softer, line free, even toned and firmer.</li>
            <li> so foundation would not cause breakouts and I could break free from the catch</li>
            <li> Another product I enjoy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have heard fabulous things about the clarisonic and knew I couldn&#x27;t justify spending over a hundred dollars on one, so I went looking...  </li>
            <li> I have been using my Olay Pro-X Advanced for about 3-4 months now and can tell a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a smaller brush size than the ProActive and can get in the corner of the nose area and feels like a great exfoliating massage.</li>
            <li> It exfoliated well, was comfortable on my skin, and has lasted a year now without any problems.</li>
            <li> product with make you baby smooth.</li>
            <li> My face feels so silky smooth</li>
            <li> The sponge didn&#x27;t really work for me, but the brush is amazing-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I feel like Olay was cheap about it.</li>
            <li> TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment -</li>
            <li> Feels heavenly with a nice gentle scrub.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This won&#x27;t change your life but it will give your face a nice, gentle scrub.  </li>
            <li> It is soo gentle yet soo effective.</li>
            <li> I found it for such a great price.  </li>
            <li> I bought for my wife and she is quiet happy with it.</li>
            <li> There is no way our own hands are capable of achieving what a machine can do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take time away, but it definitely leaves my skin feeling and looking great.</li>
            <li> I was using it as an exfoliator, and while it was cleaning and exfoliating my face, it wasn&#x27;t leaving my skin as smooth and blemish-free as I had imagined</li>
            <li> how smooth my make up goes on now.  </li>
            <li> Also, I wish there was a micro-dermabrasion head available for this appliance.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> It really exfoliates nicely.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to purchase the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.  </li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much and with the warm weather coming</li>
            <li> The red is attractive and I don&#x27;t store my Pro-X out on my bathroom counter</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it</li>
            <li> The cleanser you use is important too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean out the brush.</li>
            <li> I must say that I was happy with the price, which makes experimentation affordable, especially with Prime Shipping.  </li>
            <li> No need to use harsh exfoliators or masks anymore, the brush is just the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been such a great product that I can&#x27;t imagine what the Clarisonic must be like because this is all I need at a 10th of the price.</li>
            <li> and cheap.</li>
            <li> I have used this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and NutraSonic.</li>
            <li> This Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System works just as well as my NutraSonic did.</li>
            <li> How thoughtful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing too see how much dirt I still have on my skin after removing my makeup.</li>
            <li> I use this with my own cleanser, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li> It just kind of feels like a gentle kaleidoscope of butterflies fluttering on your skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction, ty seller.</li>
            <li> use to use a cheap electric tooth brush but all it did was just vibrate.  </li>
            <li> It was gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> I enjoy washing my face with it.</li>
            <li> After one use, I can feel my skin refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> It massages the face and is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, but effective.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll trade an acne free face for a tan face any day.</li>
            <li> Overall great.</li>
            <li> Great product and especially at the price</li>

            <li> so they too can enjoy the benefits.</li>
            <li> However, I thought the device was too smooth for my skin type.  </li>
            <li> Over all, this product is totally worth the $$ :-)</li>
            <li> My face always feels smooth and stimulated (rosy) when I use it.</li>
            <li> but my skin feels smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great introductory cleansing system for my teen.</li>
            <li> Olay has created a solid product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> fantastic-</li>
            <li> easy to keep clean and sterile</li>
            <li> They were very happy with the gifts and use them everyday.  </li>
            <li> its the most thing that changed my skin to a better smoother and more young skin ....</li>
            <li> It works great with Burt&#x27;s Bees scrub as well as facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, seems to apply the cleanser well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great, just wish that it came with extra heads.</li>
            <li> The good thing about an oilier complexion is my skin is younger looking than most of my contemporaries</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> So far so good,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nowhere near as good as my Clarisonic was.</li>
            <li> Smartly, Olay makes the head pop right off, so all was good once I figured out</li>
            <li> I love how super clean my face feels after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much more efficient or effective the brush system is over a hot wash towel and a good scrubbing and to be honest</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin, so it&#x27;s exciting to find something reasonably priced that does the job as well as department store potions.</li>
            <li> NO it won&#x27;t remove wrinkles or do magic on your skin, but what it does is make your skin super increadibly clean.  </li>
            <li> Even if this thing doesn&#x27;t clear up my acne, it feels so good... like a massage.</li>
            <li> so far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far pro-x is helping me good with</li>
            <li> It does a good job for at home cleansing but does not compare to professional cleansing.</li>
            <li> The disc is so soft you don&#x27;t get a good scrub.</li>
            <li> I have had a professional microdermabrasion procedure and this at home kit is just as good.</li>
            <li> + year old skin has not looked this good in decades.  </li>
            <li> yet so it was a good present for her :)</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I love how the brush head feels on my face and feels super clean after.</li>
            <li> This brush is gentle for the facial skin and cleans perfectly.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It fascinated my young daughter who loved turning it on and watching it rotate, and she \\&quot;brushed\\&quot;</li>
            <li> After all these years, I was so surprised in a good way.</li>
            <li> After all these years, I was so surprised in a good way.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft (feels good on your face).  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and feels good on the skin, without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li> It makes my face so nice and soft and is way better than any micro-bead exfoliator.</li>
            <li> but it is good if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the super clean feel this product gives my face.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I recommend it to any man or woman who wants a fantastic face cleanser without emptying your wallet!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for me because my skin is pretty normal.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find the bristles are baby soft.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and invest in a good cleanser, a good exfoliate and give your face a steam bath every few days.</li>
            <li> I recalled watching \\&quot;The Drs\\&quot; show and they mentioned this brush being just as good as going to a professional clinic and getting the microdermabrasion</li>
            <li> I am confident that I will love the clarisonic just as much.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was a day late but the product was perfect! :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use Olay products though so I am using the brush with Shiseido which is really good for Asian skin. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR DAILY CARE OF HEALTHY SKIN</li>
            <li> I love the Pro-X so much that I bought 3 more for my family members for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> So far so good, does what it&#x27;s meant to do without irratating my skin.</li>
            <li> It sure does, wayyyy better than using a washcloth or scrubby pad while being gentle on the face.</li>
            <li> I use very light pressure and it still gets my skin very clean and smooth and ready for moisturizer and makeup.  </li>
            <li> The brushes were very soft, and i don&#x27;t feel like it was any better than using my own hand to clean my face.</li>
            <li> That rotating brush had just the right amount of softness, as the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System has 2 speeds which feels great on the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I love that I can keep it right in the shower...</li>
            <li> I ordered it and as soon as I got it, I was able to use it right away ...</li>
            <li> The two speed options are great: the gentle one is perfect for my face every other night (after removing my makeup, I use my own cleanser with the brush) and my face feels as clean and fresh as if I&#x27;ve just had a facial.  </li>
            <li> Both of them work fine and did a job to clean my face.</li>
            <li> It works fine to clean your face</li>
            <li> My skin looks remarkably clean after a couple of uses and there has been a reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really happy I bought this, and I&#x27;m excited to see continued improvement in my skin&#x27;s dryness and dullness.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin so smooth and clean and the moisturizer gets absorbed by skin so much better after cleaning.</li>
            <li> But I was more happy about the oxy pro cleaning system then any other gift I got (b-day).</li>
            <li> I use it once a day with my own gentle cleanser - worth the $!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and at first it didn&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li> everyone should try this first!!</li>
            <li> It works so well on the skin and is so gentle!!!</li>
            <li> THIS HAS HELPED MY Acne SOOOOO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li> A very useful machine.</li>
            <li> but it is very powerful</li>
            <li> It could be very useful to teens as well.</li>
            <li> Very effective and quiet.</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> Its a very good product in which at first was hesitant to try but was relieved that it was better than expected.</li>
            <li> I have good skin to start with, no major issues, don&#x27;t have too many blackheads</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and clean and it helps self tanner go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Now if only there were a tool to lift the drooping ,clean, skin I would be completely happy.</li>
            <li> What a great clean feeling I&#x27;m left with once I&#x27;ve used this scrubber!</li>
            <li> I love the clean, fresh feeling it gives me</li>
            <li> Good value for the money, and my face has never felt this clean and soft.</li>
            <li> use it with my Clean N&#x27; Clear 3-in-1 Exfoliating Cleanser, and my skin feels so good</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s useful and my face more clean now.</li>
            <li> Awesome face brush, you can feel your clean firm and tighten up after just one washing.</li>
            <li> While it does what it does clean and exfoliate I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it because it does not do a better job than the multitude of exfoliating cleansers on the market.  </li>
            <li> It feels so good and leaves my face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> A FLAT bottom would have made it great-</li>
            <li> Most importantly It cleans like a lot better than normal cleaning.</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended in low price - but mia 2 is the best</li>
            <li> If you have the olay pore scrub, the cleansing system really gets your face clean!!</li>
            <li> super fast, so I was pleased about that!  </li>
            <li> I see the difference soon after using first time., and my skin feels very smooth...</li>
            <li> is just as smooth and clean as it was when I used my Mia.</li>
            <li> When I use the device to clean my face, I also lightly go over my brow area to remove any makeup.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is so clean and smooth after.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Why pay $20 for a tool when you could spend the money on a cleanser that makes your face just as smooth and clean and not have the additional costs of replacement batteries and brush heads.  </li>
            <li> lol I found the brush to be pretty soft.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d play it safe) and my skin is now super smooth, even, and fresh looking.</li>

            <li> It is easy and quick to use every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, I purchased the product because I am always trying to find a quick and easy way to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I can easily pick them (quick swipe - no squeezing or anything like that) off with my finger.  </li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected to receive, and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This cleans your face as good as the higher priced brands, What I like about it is, the brush rotates, really cleaning.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this little machine!  </li>
            <li> What is working the BEST of everything (including ProActive) is this little brush and a mild cleanser.</li>
            <li> very lightweight very easy to use</li>
            <li> I use good skin care and lots of broad spectrum sunscreen</li>
            <li> The price is great too because I&#x27;ve seen similar products for over $100, so I say great buy, great product, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hopes were set too high, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be that amazing.</li>
            <li> i love this product very much.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product very much, I wish I had purchased it sooner, it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a Clarisonic Mia and really liked it, but couldn&#x27;t justify the high price tag.</li>
            <li> product works well and is very reasonably priced, I was also able to use a coupon with it.</li>
            <li> After use your skin feels fresh &amp; clean &amp; renewed!</li>
            <li> but I think any facial cleansing product would work just fine and that any moisturizer would be more effective after cleansing with this device.</li>
            <li> Easy, quick and my combination skin is noticeably better (thanks to this tool and the Pro X Acne Protocol) !  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for one of these machines, so this was a great way to introduce myself to a whole new world.</li>
            <li> Starting a new job was the added boost I needed to look my best.</li>
            <li> perfect for her experience with acne problems, a new venture for her, only being 11 yrs.</li>
            <li> I plan to use with my own cleanser, so I can use something a little more designed for acne treatment, but the cleanser in the pack feels nice as well.</li>
            <li> As I get a little more proficient at working it, I think my results will be better, just as good as my spa treatment</li>
            <li> With less oil and a more smoother canvas it looks great.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer and cream are absorbed more quickly.</li>
            <li> This system came at a great price, much less then even at Wal-Mart and I love the results on my face.</li>
            <li> Just received the kit 2 days ago so far have notice my skin completely different much more clean and bright loving it♥</li>
            <li> Other than that, though, it makes for a great deep-down clean 3-4 times a week!</li>
            <li> I conducted a whole afternoon of research into a good skin treatment system, and bought the Olay system based on the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a different cleanser brand, but this brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this product and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> After extensive reading of reviews and comparisons of products - this is amazing without breaking the bank!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the brush for several weeks, and my skin now looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this product the first time I used it my face was brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought Sirius Sonic Skin Care System, because I wanted blows and whistles at a cheaper than Clarisonic price.</li>
            <li> :)read this far! :)</li>
            <li> I tried the slower speed first to acclimate it to my face and was glad I did.</li>
            <li> However, that is a minor inconvenience compared to the great cleaning it does.  </li>
            <li> Worth what my son paid for it!</li>
            <li> Worth to recommend!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $30!  </li>
            <li> WORTH THE 27 BUCKS!</li>
            <li> Even if it&#x27;s \\&quot;not as good\\&quot; (which I think it is) as Clarisonic, it&#x27;s $30 versus $120, worth a shot for everyone!</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by this product and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> The original cleanser has some micro-abrasive particles</li>
            <li> The price was music to my ears because I originally wanted the Clarisonic is which $195 in comparison to this $30 product.</li>
            <li> Two months later I am able to get away with not using makeup on weekends and fell confident!</li>
            <li> I thought about trying it again to see if it would work for me now, and I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews on the Olay cleansing system first.  </li>
            <li> So glad I tried it out first.</li>
            <li> I have since bought these for myFriends and family because I am so excited to share this with them.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel as it is small</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem like much at first, but after 1 week my face looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> The head came off while I was in the shower, though I&#x27;m pretty sure I had put it on correctly.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> I have all original correspondence(e-mails, letter, and coupon.)</li>
            <li> But its soooo worth it!</li>
            <li> I threw away the original package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are worth it!  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, and use my own cleansers and exfoliators as I would normally.  </li>
            <li> I originally visited Amazon to price a Clarisonic system, but while here, I was diverted to the Olay ProX.  </li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> Worth it and would recommend!</li>
            <li> the clarisonic which was wayyy too rich for my blood</li>
            <li> the price I don&#x27;t think this product can be beat, although there are better options at higher price</li>
            <li> So I was excited to try out this cleansing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sorry I tried it, but I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> When my original broke, I purchased another.</li>
            <li> Many reviews compare this to the higher priced brands and I cannot speak to that</li>
            <li> Love this brush so much!</li>
            <li> It made my acne better the first time i used it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend $200+ on my first brush, since I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work for me</li>
            <li> Small yet perfect!</li>
            <li> Original review  (August 2015)   </li>
            <li> I get so excited to use this thing.</li>
            <li> My skin has been glowy al day, feels much smoother, and I was able to clean out my pres really easily after I used it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so excited about this stuff that I will be ordering some of the rest of the pro-x line</li>
            <li> Love this for the price compared to much higher price tag models.</li>
            <li> It was okay the first couple of times.  </li>
            <li> THANKS YOU FOR READING THIS! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so excited to wash my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is WELL worth your money, ,at any age!  </li>
            <li> My skin looks healthier and fresh and youthfull!</li>
            <li> The Olay cleansing system definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This was well worth the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful facial cleaning and gets along well with my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> So far she is very pleased with the results she has seen using the Pro-X. Her skin</li>
            <li> Really worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> Perhaps one more speed higher that the 2 preset ones.</li>
            <li> and I can buy many of these before I reach the cost of the higher end competitors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use my original cleanser with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it was okay , but My face is much softer now!</li>
            <li> This was well worth the price!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the original bottle.</li>
            <li> Its great for when I come home after a long day.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for just over two weeks now and it is definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> i was so excited about it</li>
            <li> so when I saw this, I was excited.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price!  </li>
            <li> I received it in the mail I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I first bought this item close to two years ago, and have bought three more of them since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this olay brush before buying one of the higher priced brands...</li>
            <li> I use my favorite Mary Kay foaming cleanser with it - and it seems to make it go so much farther!  </li>
            <li> and it has been worth every penny! .</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t use it in the shower, great product.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in my skin after the first use and it continues to get better after evey use.</li>
            <li> I can say that it&#x27;s been worth buying &amp; using!</li>
            <li> I would for sure recommend this product to anyone who is interested.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> But this is worth a try!</li>
            <li> Good price, great exfoliator and comparable to the more expensive like products.</li>
            <li> but so far very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the MIa 2 and $160</li>
            <li> For the amount I paid for, it is definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure she uses it every night.</li>
            <li> I love my brush so much!</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, brush leaves skin feeling refreshed and included sample of the Olay cleanser is fragrance free and worked well.  </li>
            <li> I am prone to break-outs, but feel that they have been significantly decreasing since using this product with my routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush about once a week for the last month, and I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li> :) IT CLEANS LIKE A DREAM AND HAS GOT RID OF SO MUCH BULID UP OF BLACKHEADS AND CLOGED PORES!</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve this in the mail.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!! :)</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get my pro-x in the mail</li>
            <li> It made my skin look cleaner and more refreshed for the first week.</li>
            <li> After the first week, i got more pimples</li>
            <li> His face has cleared up pretty well, he still has breakouts and acne, but it looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and soft -good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It was originally recommended by my derm, but every skin process is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> So i was excited to receive it and try it.</li>
            <li> First thing, i&#x27;m glad it already came with the batteries</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth buying!</li>
            <li> does the job :) so glad i got it for a much better price than my local drug stores</li>
            <li> Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> She originally suggested the Clarisonic but for the price difference she said this would work as well.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a cheap 10 dollar one prior for her to try before I bought a better one to see if she actually liked it and would use it.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, this really does do a great job of removing all the dirt and makeup from my skin, and I notice a huge difference in how clean and soft my face feels afterward compared to just washing with my hands.  </li>
            <li> It certainly helps me enjoy the time I now wash my face more often, and am now more consistent with clearer skin and softer appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use the higher speed setting and it&#x27;s still very gentle and does an amazing job at removing all my face makeup and eye gunk.</li>

            <li> This is such a great product, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own the fancy Clarisonic thing that this imitates, but based on owning this, my advice would be do it right (and cough up the three-figure amount for the real deal) or don&#x27;t do it at all.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that because Clarisonic is so popular right now you may find their Customer Service really lacking if your unit stops working.</li>
            <li> Very, very good little brush.</li>
            <li> Until I&#x27;m ready to make the investment in a Clarisonic, this will work just fine!</li>

            <li> I use the Olay face wash now and then, but mostly use my own foam wash as I have sensitive skin and the device exfoliates my skin enough on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I have fair, very sensitive skin too and it is not irritating in the slightest!</li>
            <li> It has a high/low speed and it&#x27;s easy to use right out the box.</li>

            <li> I find it gentle on my skin, easy to use and easy to clean after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that have cost way more for the monthly membership and didn&#x27;t make my face look as good.  </li>

            <li> Isn&#x27;t powerful enough for my skin type, but would be excellent for very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> sux specially if you have the clarisonic like i do.</li>
            <li> For me, the cleanser is nothing special--</li>

            <li> If I had more demanding skin needs, I would certainly spring for the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> This battery-operated, wasteful device doesn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> AND THE PRICE IS JUST RIGHT!</li>

            <li> I love it, and clean face very well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too strong, you don&#x27;t want to scrub your face like it&#x27;s the kitchen floor, so take a light touch and use this sparingly but remember that healthy young skin renews every 28 days so this will helps keep it fresh and smooth.</li>

            <li> Incredibly smooth and so vibrant &amp; healthy looking.</li>
            <li> but if really seems to make my face feel so much more clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean as well as sonic face cleaners, but it&#x27;s good enough for me, and I like that it can be used in a shower.</li>
            <li> The first time I try this, it made my face clean and glow!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this system, my skin felt unbelievably clean!</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> So happy with this purchase as it works simply, but very, very well.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know if it was a good idea, but it is a very affordable item and the shipping was very fast (considering the fact that it came from the US).&lt;br</li>
            <li> B0073GO01E Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel, 5 oz]] with it as well with very good results.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin super clean and soft....and the price is right!</li>
            <li> first week I used [[ASIN:B001I45ZFC Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Bar, 4.5-Ounce Bar (Pack of 6)]] with the brush, and my skin felt soft and very clean, but not stripped and no irritation, which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I spent a great deal of time debating---</li>
            <li> Works great, as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for something to clear my skin up for over 15 years this brush is amazing and did just that.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and helped me clear my skin.</li>
            <li> Water seeped into my first unit and corroded the batteries, but I liked it so much I bought this replacement.</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally and its great, just wish the speed was higher</li>
            <li> after my wife got several facials and looked at this before in the stores at a much higher price - i got this for her at a great amazon price.  </li>
            <li> This thing is priced great and does the job the more expresnsive one  that i have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> I just bought this at target about a week ago, and honestly, my skin felt so much smoother and cleaner just after the first use.</li>
            <li> gentle but effective from the first use.</li>
            <li> The brush is softer than I expected, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the small investment and great results delivered as promised!</li>
            <li> Works great, and does what I expected it too.</li>
            <li> I decided to look at it first when I saw an aging segment on Good Morning America, about buying a cleansing system to moisturize your face to keep you looking young.</li>
            <li> But i always thought olay catered to more gentle youthful skin, so i came across the pro x and decided to five it a try........</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I love it so much I invested in the Clarisonic Pro</li>
            <li> just twice a week is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I have good skin and use a apricot scrub daily</li>
            <li> Cool device.</li>
            <li> But the true test will be the shaving aspect I mentioned.</li>
            <li> Neither women enjoyed the product much.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to spend that much money, I decided to try the Oil of Olay product as I use many of their products.  </li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s good product for the price.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment is definitely a bit troublesome, but otherwise, I think this product is really good for its price.</li>
            <li> My face really looks better.</li>
            <li> A travel tip - remove the batteries, take an extra set (AA size), toss everything into a ziplock bag and you&#x27;re good to go anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li> Your face feels nice after the cleaning, not dried out like as you used soap.  </li>
            <li> This gives a more gentle experience and seems to let the product do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> More abrasive and thorough cleansing have psychological appeal, but the ingredients in cleansers (salicylic acid etc) are more important.</li>
            <li> I noticed my face to be more cleaner after using it and within a week, my face really cleared up.</li>
            <li> Well...I really, REALLY wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> seems to hold good charge and runs only on AA battery.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush for many reasons.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old son has eczema and uses it on his own.</li>
            <li> and I still have more black/white heads than I would really like.  </li>
            <li> I think more than that would be too much for my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it works out very well. :)</li>
            <li> It gets your skin super clean and with time leaves it with a glow.</li>
            <li> Somehow I think this rotation might work better for the flakiness issues, but I wouldn&#x27;t really know unless I tried them both.  </li>
            <li> This is actually a good thing, because it means I can use it daily without turning my face into hamburger.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much power and you&#x27;re better off using your hands with a micro-dermabrasion cream than this brush.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t blame Amazon at all, this product really needs a seriously better battery redesign.</li>
            <li> I actually scrub my face with a washcloth to get the whiteheads out ,which I know this couldn&#x27;t be good for my skin, but what&#x27;s a girl to do?</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> I feel as though I must get my makeup and dirt out of my pores better and the stimulation of the rotating brush head must be very beneficial.</li>
            <li> I read reviews prior and one of the reviews gave good instructions.</li>
            <li> Wish the unit was sealed better because if you bang it or drop it, the whole thing comes apart and you get water inside the battery chamber.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much I bought one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> but so far its nice</li>
            <li> It also really helps your skin get the most out of your moisturizer and skin care products.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to moisturize afterwards as it is very drying.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s well worth the money, can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap for a product that is so efficient and does what it says.&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin looks more even, is cleaner, and is so much softer.</li>
            <li> Really cleaning i love it</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the Clairsonic and gives fabulous results!</li>
            <li> After you wash your face with it you feel super clean.  </li>
            <li> Want nice soft face?  </li>
            <li> it appears to assist my moisturizer in absorbing more efficiently as well.</li>
            <li> and I think it was my bodies reaction to stay cool because of the heat that my body was always faced with.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> The product is waterproof, so it can be used over the sink or in the shower or even in the bathtub for something more intimate (~_^).</li>
            <li> Plus it has 2 power settings, which is nice if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the low price and good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think this brush cleans better than an exfoliating cleanser and a washcloth.</li>
            <li> 30-1hour showers most the time the whole time</li>
            <li> One thing is I would suggest is you would probably not want to use any face scrubs that have exfoliating products already in them, as that would likely not be good for your skin.</li>
            <li> The ladies in my family think it is good present.</li>
            <li> It is a good present for woman.</li>
            <li> It really cleans all the dirt and/or makeup off your face more than your fingertips do.</li>
            <li> am going to buy my sister one because I want her to see how cool it is.</li>
            <li> I had been hearing so much about these cleansing systems, but wasn&#x27;t about to pay $100 or more for one</li>
            <li> Loved adding this to my nightly routine, only thing I wish is that it came within additional heads or the bristles</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth &amp; I rarely have any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Buying one for my mom as a gift because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t see any real cleaning or refining after many uses.  </li>
            <li> the bristle seems more gentle</li>
            <li> brand, good quality.&lt;br /&gt;The same as the product announced on TV</li>
            <li> My face was so clear, bright and soft after, I wanted to be able to do this at home.  </li>
            <li> The Clarisonic is much more gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> The latest one I&#x27;ve used is St. Ives Gentle Apricot Scrub.</li>
            <li> and it really does make my skin look better after using it.</li>
            <li> Good price for something that is part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I loved this sulfur mask before I tried the cleansing system, but these two products totally belong together, and attention should be made to that point.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle, I can use it every day with my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> It worked okay, but it scrubs too gently for me</li>
            <li> My face feels super clean after using it every time.</li>
            <li> Make sure that your face is very moist when you apply it because that way it makes mores suds.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cost effective to change batteries so frequently on this product.</li>
            <li> started using the Pro-X and the cleanser, and was so surprised with how effective it was.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and love the results so much have reordered the cleaner twice.  </li>
            <li> Something simple like that can make a woman feel sooooo good.  </li>
            <li> #34;it looks so smooth, and fresh and healthy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> But if you want a good cleaning brush for an affordable price then definitely go with the Olay Pro-X.</li>
            <li> Ok i really like this.</li>
            <li> I think it does a much better, and much quicker job at getting the job dome.</li>
            <li> It is a bit more gentle</li>
            <li> /&gt;Naming issues aside, it DOES have an easy-to-grasp handle, feels good and solid in the hand.</li>
            <li> Good tool for facial cleaning.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t really compare, but I&#x27;m really satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t had many skin problems.</li>
            <li> not use much, but it is ok</li>
            <li> and I like it just as much, and the value is better.</li>
            <li> The mia \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush works a lot better and is gentle  </li>
            <li> My wife and I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Its really about that sophisticated.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it... that is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Good quality overall.  </li>
            <li> Love this so much.</li>
            <li> I just received this item today, so I can&#x27;t give a full review yet, but I will update if there is anything I learn that hasn&#x27;t been posted elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Their competitor cost like $250, and here only cost $28.50, and the result can be done as good as treatment.</li>
            <li> It really is a good option for low- price skin care cleansing.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I am a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Glad I did not spend to much for this product.</li>
            <li> I do pair it with a gentle exfoliating scrub and absolutely love the way my skin feels and looks when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I prefer a simpler and more gentle cleaning gel.</li>
            <li> It would have to be 8 times better than the Olay version, because it costs eight times as much.  </li>
            <li> My makeup goes on better now, and I&#x27;ve also noticed that I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much as I use to.</li>
            <li> My face feels softer, I don&#x27;t break out nearly as much anymore, and I feel like my skin is so healthy now.</li>
            <li> overall good product</li>
            <li> It is more gentle than my hands when using my scrubby acne cleanser.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> I think this product is fabulous and well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Overall good product</li>
            <li> So I ran to the store and bought this one, seeing as it has such good reviews.</li>
            <li> And after much research, I have decided I can do more for my exfoliating needs with a simple face brush and a good exfoliating cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This product was cool--</li>
            <li> Not that cool...</li>
            <li> any more than that would have been way too much.</li>
            <li> Overall the quality of the product is really good.</li>
            <li> One of the most reasonably priced beauty items ever.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far.</li>
            <li> The true test was end of the day make-up removal.</li>
            <li> I love my Olay Pro-Advanced so much that I purchased one for my sister and mother!&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it really made any more difference than washing with a washrag.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the shower and give my face a good scrub with it almost daily.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Seems to work really well, better value compared to competition.  </li>
            <li> But it really didn&#x27;t do any better than a warm soft wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Helps very well with the cleansing of your face and keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li> Probably true,</li>
            <li> I need a bit more power for this tool, and the sample it came with I just threw out because it smelled very chemically.</li>
            <li> Good while it last.</li>
            <li> a full ninety days  </li>
            <li> box and the brush lasted a full month</li>
            <li> If nothing else, it feels really nice and soft on my skin and encourages me to take my time while cleansing.</li>
            <li> I was really optimistic about this product after hearing how my friends/family have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I think the Pro-X is cool.</li>
            <li> My acne is doing better and my skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> replacement heads are cheap and the unit itself was well worth the 30 days.</li>
            <li> you wont get the full size bottle of the exfoliater</li>
            <li> still loved the idea of using a brush, and although the motion was different- decided to take my chances with the Oil of Olay Pro-X cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> I used it while in the bath each morning and its gentle brushing gives my face a lovely feel.  </li>
            <li> I use it with the Olay Sensitive Foaming Face Wash, which does a nice job.</li>
            <li> It works really good except that I wish the brushes are bit wider or bigger.</li>
            <li> Its good, you can see difference in your skin after  using this....but it should come with extra brush...</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of taking all of my makeup off and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave it red afterwards.</li>
            <li> and I was expecting a full size.</li>
            <li> that the dirt can finally get out after good cleansing/exfoliation.</li>
            <li> After several months of use, the bristles are still in good shape.  </li>
            <li> Then I went to the cubbard &amp; got out the extra virgin olive oil put a dab on my finger &amp; rubbed it all over my face, rubbed it in good &amp;#34;they</li>
            <li> it will leave your face smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> I ended up buying one for my husband too, and he uses it daily with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Welp, guess it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> This is must have for a good daily skin care routine, at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a mini-spa treatment on your face and truly leaves your face feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t even been a full year</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the spinning is effective.</li>
            <li> Price was good, and I feel like my skin gets that extra cleanse.</li>
            <li> Its so soft but so effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 55 and use it with grainy, exfoliant products and it really gives me smooth skin!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me not to use this kind of thing as in the long run it will do more damage than not.</li>
            <li> For $30, not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> The price is not bad i do change the brush once a month since it can develop bacteria.</li>
            <li> not bad in this price range.</li>
            <li> Not bad ,I thought it was a good price, but while I was at the store i found the same one with a cheaper price ,,,,,,</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so it is pretty good for me.</li>
            <li> The battery life lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s nice that you can just turn it on and cleanse, unlike with the NutraSonic, where you have to plug it in and make sure it&#x27;s charged up.</li>
            <li> It is not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad for money.  </li>
            <li> I would break out very easily, but now I can wake up without seeing a patch of new blemishes all over my face.</li>
            <li> It is good,  easy to operate and very handy when you clean your face everyday use your daily xleaning product!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> He told me it turns the follicle over very quickly which could be great for someone chronically broke out, but for someone who generally has clear skin it can cause break outs.</li>
            <li> I was so flummoxed by the positive reviews of this product that I had to call my old English professor to find the best word to use that would accurately describe the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just received this and after the first use I noticed a difference right away, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have used the real Clarisonic brush that costs nearly 10x as much as this one, as well as the Clarisonic knock-off called Pretika, and I can honestly say that the Olay brush is my favorite of the bunch!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this really does anything special, but my skin feels very clean when I use the cleaner</li>
            <li> It is amazing for on the skin, and your skin becomes super soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and only takes about a minute two times per day to get amazing results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and only takes about a minute two times per day to get amazing results.  </li>
            <li> This simple yet effective face scrubber is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Takes of any makeup/dirt/oil, exfoliates super well, and leaves my face feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> As far as the size, I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s so compact and therefore easy to tote around for trips.</li>
            <li> I love this, after only the first use my face looked so much better!</li>
            <li> I was impressed and felt better about my purchase, especially after reading some other posts out there...</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful little system that has truly made a major change for the better in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one since my kids took over my first one :)  LOVE this!</li>
            <li> Honestly I think stabilizing on the right pill had something to do with the clear up, but this brush has most definitely sped it up and has been making my skin feel so clean!!  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve paired it with the Olay Serum right after cleansing and it has made a HUGE difference in my skin in just a week.    </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t sound quite right to me.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> Important to moisturize right after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I feel sure it will help clean my pores and exfoliate my skin more than cleaning alone or using facial masks.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty strong for a woman, but I couldn&#x27;t get it myself.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the scrub that was included because I prefer Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Daily Pore Scrub, which works incredibly well.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t clean any better than if you use a Wonder Puff and cleanse your face in circular motions for a few a minutes with a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use it twice daily, and have found that using it with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean, Anti-Breakout Facial Cleanser works best for me.  </li>
            <li> good product really work leave my skin looking clean and soft and youthful looking</li>
            <li> I would recommend using the exfoliater cleanser once a week because it is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and not uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li> You get a great deep clean and I feel like it really pulls out all of the dirt and oils from your pors.</li>
            <li> I use it once/day on my face with a regular face cleanser, and my skin feels soooo smooth and nice and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I keep fionding myself touching my skin because it is soooo smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> My wife likes it so much she wants to get more as gifts for others!</li>
            <li> I had read so many great reviews, but am too cheap to spend the money on the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Most are high priced and I really wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like one.</li>
            <li> glow and fresh skin is right under our reach, easy</li>
            <li> She was amazed how clean and smooth her face was the first time she used it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cleans very well and leaves my skin feeling very clean with no residue.</li>
            <li> Very \\&quot;polished\\&quot; Very clean.</li>
            <li> this brush is gentle yet it leaves your skin very clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- wash face gently with sulfur soap (I think my face likes to be very clean, but</li>
            <li> Good brush to clean your face daily with the right cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure if my face is much clearer than before, I&#x27;ve always had mild to moderate acne, and it still is, maaaayybbeee more mild, but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure if my face is much clearer than before, I&#x27;ve always had mild to moderate acne, and it still is, maaaayybbeee more mild, but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after, and if it continues to prevent breakouts, it&#x27;s more than worth the small price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the price point (compared to the crazy price for the Clarisonic) and to find it is still of good quality and effective.</li>
            <li> And it would be great if it had a body brush as well, but if you use it for like 2min every other day your skin will look fine.​</li>
            <li> I use it with other brands of scrubbing skin cleansers, and find that it works great.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the time I use Bare Minerals cleansers and make up - love that stuff!</li>
            <li> a great price compared to other ones.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and smoother, however, I don&#x27;t see any noticeable visible difference like some other users experienced.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X Cleansing Brush is a great alternative and value to other high-end devices out there (aka Clairsonic).</li>
            <li> Great for the money spent!</li>
            <li> this is a great starter unit for those, like me, who wanted to see what the fuss is about but dont want to spend the 100&#x27;s on other units.</li>
            <li> Whenever I would use this in the shower, my face felt so soft and clean!!</li>
            <li> Now here&#x27;s a product I passed right over for a long time because I could not imagine scrubbing my sensitive skin with anything - until someone with skin like mine, and who looked wonderful, told me to try it.</li>
            <li> Week 4, huge reduction of breakouts, I&#x27;d say 75% more clear.</li>
            <li> face is now fresh, clean, and moist everytime</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and fresh after I use it.</li>
            <li> and I am seriously amazed at how beautiful my skin looks, i would recommend it to anybody!</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and fresh and looks brighter.  </li>
            <li> The only improvement I would suggest is making the head a bit more secure as it is easy to come off since it is replaceable  </li>
            <li> You skin feels so clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> and I just want my face to feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and my face feels much fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> My face feels so fresh and clean afterward.</li>
            <li> My face feels so fresh and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Can feel the results, my skin feels really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I just wanted to get a fresh and clean face and feel some brightness in my skintone.</li>
            <li> If you take a whole minute to clean your face you will get clean and if you are using a microdermabrasion cleanser you will get smooth.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin clean and fresh</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> THIS FACIAL BRUSH IS SUCH AN AWESOME DEAL!!!  </li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m sure this product is meant to be used for microdermabrasion--anti aging stuff, but for me, this is FINALLY a solution to a life-long battle with clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest that I am not 100% sure what I expected to get out of this product.  </li>
            <li> I think women who enjoy spending a lot of time with cleansers and/or makeup may enjoy the process and it seems reasonably priced for this type of item.  </li>
            <li> Beauty devices like the Olay Professional Pro-X Cleansing System are most accurately reviewed after an extended sampling by the reviewer.</li>
            <li> its okay kind of rough</li>
            <li> Some quick notes about the product:  1.</li>
            <li> The head is a nice compact size great for cleansing beneath the jawline, behind the ears and neck, and on the temples.  </li>
            <li> A quick note on cleansers:</li>
            <li> It is super inexpensive for what it does for my skin.</li>
            <li> Luckily I picked this up</li>
            <li> Skin does feel cleaner but will try the brush with a mild soap.  </li>
            <li> And, the best part is, this Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, cost much less than the product I saw advertised.  </li>
            <li> Now, I just tried the Olay cleansing machine and can say there is a noticeable difference between the two; however, if you are looking for an adequate machine that works</li>
            <li> This was after one use, I&#x27;m sure with more uses my white heads probably will not even be a problem.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that rivals the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The scrubber action is gentle, and the scrubber head is a good size for skimming on the edges of my nose and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i feel like it cleans better, and it is also much more quiet!</li>
            <li> But it did arrive quickly and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel so soft and smooth, and lets you daytime or nitetime moistures work all that much better well cleaned face.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this cleanser which feels great on my face--it gently scrubs and cleans.  </li>
            <li> I use it with olay&#x27;s Total Effects cleanser with blemish control, and I have to say, it works great, minimizes pores and helps your moisturizer really sink into your skin.  </li>
            <li> Also there&#x27;s a really really mild fragrance in it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen tremendous improvement in my skin tone since using the cleansing system.</li>
            <li> the combination of both has cleared my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li> Super happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure you are using professional skin products, not that cheap stuff at the box stores.</li>
            <li> but I have blackheads and have mild acne in concentrated areas.</li>
            <li> You can use ANY face wash with this product and it does a super job.  </li>
            <li> really does a great job of deep cleaning the face.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I wish I had started using it sooner.</li>
            <li> I got lucky and started using Olay in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used much more expensive brushes, and this one leaves my face feeling just as wonderful.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seven months pregnant</li>
            <li> and there, they go away quickly though.</li>
            <li> It runs smoothly and I can feel it clear the top of my skin from dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> AND I ALWAYS USE A MILD LOTION AFTERWARDS LIKE CERAVE....</li>
            <li> but I am going to be a loyal user</li>
            <li> after seen so many comments and reviews about this thing, i finally decided to get and try it see what&#x27;s so magical about this.</li>
            <li> My skin got softer using a mild scrubbing face wash and my hands.</li>
            <li> Need to order more cleanser, but I&#x27;m sure I could use my regular with it.</li>
            <li> I use it with the Olay cleanser and also with a Clinique scrub cream which is a mild exfoliator.</li>
            <li> This one did the job and was super affordable.</li>
            <li> For more high-end cleansers, I recommend Clinique face soap and Philosophy Purity Made Simple, because these cleansers alone, even with a wash cloth, did wonders for my skin, and would be even better combined with this</li>
            <li> It works perfect and really cleans all the dead cells and dirt also.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> I received it in the mail quickly and got to work using it.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of exfoliation, because I have found that exfoliation helps my acne-prone, sensitive skin the most.  </li>
            <li> Super price.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft so it is great for my pre-teens sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My face cleared up tremendously with the Retin-A, except for those darn spots.  </li>
            <li> It still deep cleans my skin, gently exfoliates, and does great things for the pores and blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> It still deep cleans my skin, gently exfoliates, and does great things for the pores and blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> the $12 one in my opinion is actually better, not only because it is the same value for a better price, but because it is a BETTER value for a BETTER price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Olay Pro-X advanced Cleansing System a few weeks ago because I&#x27;ve heard great things.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a week of using the cleanser, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed how well my face has been clearing up; it&#x27;s so much smoother and just looks great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this ever since I got pregnant</li>
            <li> Luckily I purchased it during amazon deals or else</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would love having a facial exfoliator</li>
            <li> How many more times can I possibly say &#x27;name brand&#x27; in a review?!!</li>
            <li> I had never had a problem with acne until I got pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Quick way to thoroughly wash your face.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect facial cleansing brush for my teenage son.</li>
            <li> I rarely feel like I got a good buy when purchasing facial cleansing products.</li>
            <li> She was a satisfied user of the product and she actually recommended to many of her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely forever use this product ( also keep in mind that the brush needs to be replaced every three months for better results, just like a toothbrush :) ).</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use the exfoliating cleaner every day, but the &#x27;abrasive&#x27; element is about the consistency of baking soda, so it&#x27;s extremely mild, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not yet had to change the brush out, but I bought the refills with the unit just because it seems they sell out quite quickly.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I dip it into squeezed lemon juice and just do a quick cleanse.</li>
            <li> the gentle facial massage is great in the morning.</li>
            <li> I already threw the packaging away because I was sure that I would love it and definitely not return it...</li>
            <li> You are able to use your favorite facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I then switched to the Simple gel cleanser, and the brush helps the gel turn into a light, frothy foam which feels really nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, on day 5 my skin looks and feels more vibrant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super water resistant.</li>
            <li> and I believe that it does a better job of cleaning than just myself using my hands, but my roommate has a different brand and the bristles move quicker probably because she paid more for it.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> I also think that some people are very pleased with this product because if they follow the directions they are washing their face for a whole minute which might be longer than they normally take to cleanse.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say my skin is more clear because of using Olay cleansing system but still enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> As an &#x27;old&#x27; guy who is getting those dang blackheads all old guys get in my sideburns, this works great to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer soaks into my skin quickly too.</li>
            <li> I have only used the Olay brand for several years, but since using ProX my skin feels its best!</li>
            <li> The dermatologist diagnosed it as mild Rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I think any mildly exfoliating cleanser would do the trick.</li>
            <li> I also purchased one for my mom and aunt, who also noticed that their skin has become more vibrant.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied--especially since this was offered for a great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> so luckily I did have others.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li> I used it with my own gentle Cetaphil as I have very sensitive skin and the results are smooth, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> What ended up working best was gently cleaning my skin with very gentle no-fragrance cleansers (Cetaphil is fabulous, the Aveeno I&#x27;m using is as well), and avoiding harsh products because they are not needed.  </li>
            <li> When you buy something special, as described, very practical, strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skincare nut and shell out top dollars for high end cleansers but never felt the need for a cleansing brush - wrote it off as a lazy-man&#x27;s device...</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic vibrates at a high frequency which cleans better.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product along with your favorite skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> It has 2 speeds, but I prefer to use the high speed, it removes more dirt.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i was really pleased with this and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I love this face brush, and highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose that fill up easily and this product works great to clear them and keep them clear.  </li>
            <li> Really helps to clean my pores and get rid of any existing acne!</li>
            <li> and my wife says it really does feel clean!</li>
            <li> Give a boy a power tool and suddenly he wants to clean!</li>
            <li> it does deep clean pretty good....</li>
            <li> Like many other systems, they try to sell the cleansing system cheap, and hope you buy more their fluid, looks like they are good at this.</li>
            <li> a good ol&#x27; plain washcloth does a better job for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin really looked more radiant in the morning and felt smoother right away.</li>
            <li> Seems to clean well, easy to use and clean, have used the original batteres so far</li>
            <li> This little thing did a great job my face felt smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this battery operated little brush.  </li>
            <li> I use this every other day and LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> The trial sized tube of cleanser didn&#x27;t last me very long, but I was able to use it very sparingly and the results were wonderful.</li>
            <li> Very nice, it helps clean the hidden spot.</li>
            <li> I have been more than satisfied with my purchase, and like most Olay products, this one hasn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s great that you can use it in the shower; a little scrub with the exfoliant, rinse, and your skin feels to clean.</li>
            <li> to clean, the head pops right off.</li>
            <li> I wash my face and it feels really clean right after.  </li>
            <li> bristle is very fine and soft, and is very gentle on my acne filled</li>
            <li> I saw a huge difference after just the first try.</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed a huge improvement on how this makeup applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin just within a couple weeks after trying it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with this product - have given several as gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 56 year young woman and dedicated anti-wrinkle warrior with sensitive skin, so I use the Pro-X Exfoliating Cleanser every 2-3 days to avoid irritation, but so far I&#x27;m happy with the results!</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied with the product, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> But all in all, very pleased, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now, and it is still working great on the original batteries.</li>
            <li> I use this with other face washes too (St. Ives apricot, MyChelle scrub, Cetaphil), but the scrub that the cleansing system comes with is far and beyond the best.</li>
            <li> First time user of a powered brush exfoliater and I am sold on this one, it is portable, comfortable to hold, has 2 speeds</li>
            <li> This machine is barely doing a thing, except producing a nice foam.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very pleased with the product overall.</li>
            <li> Great transaction, but the product is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, but wish I had shopped more carefully and purchased the two in one brush available (like this but faster, with microdermabrasion pad)</li>
            <li> I used to sweat more often than normal when I returned</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cheap</li>
            <li> My first one broke after about a year, so I contacted Olay and they sent me a certificate for a free replacement.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase and will definitely be ordering the refill brushes.</li>
            <li> It looks like they are available in the higher price Cleansing system from Olay Pro-X.</li>
            <li> I have even been using other skin products that I own with the scrubber and am pleased with the results....</li>
            <li> Other than than, its a good cheap investment.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Great buy and relatively economical in comparison to other products.  </li>
            <li> Just as the detailed message another reviewer gave exactly.</li>
            <li> It is definitely better than manual washing...if you have normal skin and just want something to get your make up</li>
            <li> my skin became so soft and super CLEAN :]</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and does a great job of exfoliating my skin, especially the dryness around my eyebrows I tend to get in the winter.</li>
            <li> Probablly one of the more gentle home dermabrasion tools around, but like most, with prolonged use can  irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> pretty cheap- pricewise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how smooth my skin felt after using it the first time.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference from the very first use.  </li>
            <li> This product could be greatly improved with a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; type cleaning action and a slightly more abrasive brush head option akin to a pink buf-puf texture.  </li>
            <li> Some times I wash my face too long because it feel so good that my face hurts when I put toner on.</li>
            <li> This might be good for someone with oily and flaky skin that was not sensitive for high-level exfoliation.</li>
            <li> probably would not want to use it too long (even if it does feel good) because I can imagine that it could be abrasive if over-used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more gentle than I expected, which is actually a good thing.  </li>
            <li> It felt so good after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> The skin detaches very easily with a cotton ball, but I wanted to more easily rinse the dead skin away.</li>
            <li> The bristles were Ok, not soft not hard, I think it depends on your skin type if they are good for you or not.</li>
            <li> My pores are so clean, my skin so soft - LOVE this.</li>
            <li> You can use the included sample tube of cleanser/ exfoliator immediately to get a deep clean or just your own face wash.</li>
            <li> it makes your face feel rejuvenated stimulated so soft and clean love</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling and how soft the skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> Love how soft and clean it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love the soothing massaging action of this on my face and my skin is incredibly clean after using this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly,the cleansing brush is very smooth,but sometimes it&#x27;s too smooth to clean my skin.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and so far, the batteries are still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I do not use Olay&#x27;s cleansing products on my face, rather those from my dermatologist, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the brush is great to use with other face cleansing products!</li>
            <li> Once I got it and used the specially included \\&quot;goo\\&quot; right away.  </li>
            <li> This works just fine and keeps my facial skin clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very fine and soft.</li>
            <li> Your face feels super clean after use and it is has very gentle bristles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not paying $200+ for the high end, so this is good for my 12 yr old.</li>
            <li> Obviously to each is own; however, honestly, you really don&#x27;t have to spend the $200 for the Clarisonic to get a product that works really well.</li>
            <li> As a female in her early 30s, I&#x27;ve tried so many products that have rarely made good on their claims.</li>
            <li> I agree with many other reviewers here that this is just as good a device as the Clarisonic and comes with a MUCH cheaper price tag.</li>
            <li> Maybe the &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; rumors really are true!</li>
            <li> The only thing I have noticed is that it is kind of a pain in the butt to keep my hair away from it, but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I can live without it.</li>
            <li> or a new hair product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I tried a friend&#x27;s Clarisonic (with a new brush head, of course), so I&#x27;m able to make the comparison.</li>
            <li> (its awesome!),I also ordered the day time moisturizer+night time cream which closes the pores in your faces and sooths the skin as new and doesnt let any bacteria into the pores :).</li>
            <li> So while I&#x27;ll probably never use it on my face again, it has found a new life. :)</li>
            <li> Im not going to stay something new, but i have to say i love it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could love this product based on all the positive reviews, but this did nothing positive for my face.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great produt, after clean my face I use the Cleaning brush, it is soft and does some deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great price and exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> less breakouts and smoother skin  Great for removing makeup</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after I use it, and it lets me use less moisturizer at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Face feels super fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> This works just as good if not better than the calrisonic that&#x27;s is sold for a lot more money.</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet strong.  </li>
            <li> Mild cleansers, along with this brush, yield a fresh looking complexion.</li>
            <li> it feels good on my face, don&#x27;t like where batterey is located but for the price it seemed too work pretty well only used one time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really waterproof and easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works under the shower, nice and quite operation, long battery life, smooth on face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed the brush, and the cleanser is very refreshing without being too harsh.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really easy to carry around and it works really well.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this and used it daily.  </li>
            <li> First I purchased a NutraSonic from Amazon years ago, and I loved the way it deep cleaned my skin and my enlarged pores and blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> This product has been a tremendous success.</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with this product, and I hope that it will last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love how my moisturizer now really sinks in after cleaning with an exfoliant in the morning, and I love the totally clean feeling my skin has at night after getting rid of all the day&#x27;s make-up, oil, ect.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Cleans my face very well, will strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Other cleansing systems are very pricy, this one is good and gets the job done for about a quarter of the price!</li>
            <li> I have been blessed with pretty good skin, so when I recently discovered that I had un unused Amazon gift card and the Olay products were on sale, it was a given -</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was quite a godsend: I could remove makeup / dirt / grime easily without putting my skin through too much trauma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a pretty good facial brush.  </li>
            <li> and it really makes cleaning your face easy and thorough.</li>
            <li> the price was reasonable and the cleanser is easy to replace.  </li>
            <li> After I use normal face wash at the end of the day, and feel pretty clean after, I can still get more foundation off with this thing.</li>
            <li> It was easy to put together and works very well.</li>
            <li> Even though the brush heads are very soft, you can over scrub if used for more than a minute or so.</li>
            <li> Made my skin very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure product would work for my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel clean and fresh!  </li>
            <li> This is such a cool product, it kind of buffs ur face, so that I guess if u dont have super sensitive skin, it leaves it what some people refer to as radiant:)</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System had a lot of reviews and the majority of them were positive.</li>
            <li> Oh well, the positive is I enjoy using it and</li>
            <li> This facial brush has two speeds, not too harsh on your skin, and great to give a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> It did cause a breakout on my chin the 2nd week of use (haven&#x27;t had a pimple in many years! )</li>
            <li> After the first use I could tell this product does a great job of removing makeup and dirt, but is gentle enough to use twice a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how good I am going to be about buying refill heads versus just exfoliating with my hands, but we&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> the bottom is the exact size of the brush head!  </li>
            <li> Ok..at the risk of sounding like a commercial for this item...I Love my PRO X system!  </li>
            <li> In buying Olay&#x27;s machine, I was really really hoping that it would be the solution to my blackhead conundrum!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had chosen the Olay brush in the first place!</li>
            <li> If my skin freaks out, I will definitely update this review because I thinkit&#x27;s an important factor!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> noticed a difference after the first use!</li>
            <li> I am not a big chemical product user, so I use it with my homemade washes and scrubs and love how glowing my skin is!</li>
            <li> In buying Olay&#x27;s machine, I was really really hoping that it would be the solution to my blackhead conundrum!!</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and was glowing after the first use!</li>
            <li> Now, weeks later, my skine looks and feels better than ever!</li>
            <li> I was amazed by the amount of dirt this picked up the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> saved so much buying this online!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time in the shower and there&#x27;s no comparing this to a washcloth and soap!  </li>
            <li> First try and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Your thoughts and opinions are very much appreciated to help me out with this!!</li>
            <li> Cleans and really cleans!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Just be aware that over-exfoliation leads to premature aging!</li>
            <li> Started using this religiously after the Holidays and my skin looks better than ever!  </li>
            <li> but I think it is pretty straightforward.  </li>
            <li> I saw results the first time I used this!  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m also only 19), but my skin is 10x smoother and it just looks better!</li>
            <li> Actually spins as where most of the others just vibrate and cant see why to even buy them!  </li>
            <li> Mildly impressed, spin seems weak.  </li>
            <li> Gentle scrubbing of the skin!!</li>
            <li> I have at one time or antoher even gotten out of bed in the middle of the night to make sure i get that face wash in!  </li>
            <li> From the first time I used it my face felt cleaner than it had ever been!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 days now, and WOW!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well to get the job done!</li>
            <li> I have used this and really like it!!</li>
            <li> I noticed improvement on my skin immediately after the first use!</li>
            <li> I use it daily and have purchased 2 more as Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li> And it stimulates the cells in your skin to produce new skin cells, so it is always flawless and firm.  </li>
            <li> skin has never looked more fresh, and I feel confident taking selfies even though my face is not splattered on with foundation and other harmful ingredients!!! :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and makes skin look fresh and bright.</li>
            <li> love the soft brush and the mild exfoliating wash.  </li>
            <li> I get stress breakouts fairly easily but this helped to clear my skin up and kept my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> like that the replacement brushes are easy to find, but obviously the clarisonic has more types of brush heads to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t want to spend big money on a clarisonic definitely buy this nifty gadget to clean face instead of hands that don&#x27;t do as good of a job!</li>
            <li> I have pretty OK skin that withstands Olay&#x27;s rotating brush and scrub, so I had a good result with Olay, but if you have a sensitive skin and extra $100 to spend, get Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;About</li>
            <li> Its very important that for those with sensitive skin this might break you out.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and leaves my skin very soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> With this, my lotion is completely absorbed and the skin feels so healthy and soft!  </li>
            <li> After the first use my skin feels clean.  </li>
            <li> Not only did the brush feel great on my skin while I was using it, but after moisturizing my skin was so soft and glowing!</li>
            <li> But the first step is having really clean skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely keep expecting super soft skin and great moisturizer absorption.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used this, I can tell how clean my face was.</li>
            <li> I only use it 3-4x a week and still get great results, can&#x27;t believe how soft my face is!</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother, softer and fine wrinkle lines have reduce.  </li>
            <li> The only con about this product is that it might not have the high pressures and DEEP cleaning that Clarisonic has, but for $20, you save a lot more on something that is almost as good!</li>
            <li> If it works like this when snapped on properly (and I expect it does, it could just come off more easily), then I would say it doesn&#x27;t do any more than a soft face brush that you could use manually.</li>
            <li> Requires little time for great results.  </li>
            <li> Great little investment.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a great little machine.  </li>
            <li> It works great, I just wish the bristles were a little stronger.</li>
            <li> This is a great little device, my wife and I keep it in our shower and use it 1-2x per week.  </li>
            <li> Great little tool.</li>
            <li> would be a great little gift for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for offering the Amazon &#x27;deal&#x27;</li>
            <li> I like to exfoliate my face, and this little gadget is great for that.  </li>
            <li> Great little brush.  </li>
            <li> I wish the bristles were a little shorter, but I found this to be great for once a week exfoliation.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sitting here typing this right now with a bunch of new acne all across my chin, with a few of those wonderful, beneath</li>
            <li> However that being said, I have also noticed that the appearance of blackheads has really deminished quite drastically and the texture of my skin (normally very dry) has improved a great deal.</li>
            <li> : Mix the exfoliating gel that comes with the brush with a little of your own facewash product to get more coverage.</li>
            <li> I would have liked a little more power in the spin of the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that when I consistently use this right before I sleep my acne will be significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something a little bit more rough, but besides that it is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I am always trying new skincare products so the idea of having a \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; seemed exciting!!</li>
            <li> A great price compared to the other retailers!!</li>
            <li> When I use it, my skin feels so smooth and my pores look much tighter.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and much cleaner than washing by hand.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated without causing much irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in the size of my pores since I started using it and my face is so much softer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother (your face really feels amazingly smooth after using it), brighter, and</li>
            <li> I use it with various products and my skin feels amazing</li>
            <li> But I ordered the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, and since I started using it two weeks ago, everyone is commenting on how much brighter my face looks.  </li>
            <li> I found the idea of an electric powered face cleansing gadget intriguing.  </li>
            <li> It has really made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy Olay&#x27;s products and will probably always, but this not so much.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for 2 days and the difference is amazing</li>
            <li> Great for removing dead skin off of your face and also removes some impurities that I have.</li>
            <li> I got this Olay Pro-X Advanced cleansing System she loves it , its works very well and the Olay soup</li>
            <li> skin and your make up really glides on smoothly after you use it.</li>
            <li> I really the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> after a few weeks I&#x27;ve seen great improvement on my skin....</li>
            <li> Skin is definitely rejuvenated, shiny from the cleaning, and amazingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having never owned a Clarisonic, I can&#x27;t really compare the two, although I based my decision to buy on another fantastic, in depth review given by a woman who owns both.</li>
            <li> Using it everyday and it works great.</li>
            <li> Really cheap and work just as much as the 100 bucks one.</li>
            <li> The wife has used it a few times already and is happy as a lark.</li>
            <li> After just two uses, my skin feels amazing and actually has a glow.  </li>
            <li> Great for washing your face and removing heavy make up.</li>
            <li> It really gets makeup off and makes your face smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I think it does a great job cleansing my face, clearing out my pores and removing dead cells.</li>
            <li> My face started clearing up and it really makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what a difference this makes versus just regular face scrub.</li>
            <li> He has been using it for several months now and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I bought the generic Olay skin cleansing cream at Target and the Olay toner and have noticed an amazing difference in my skin within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> amazing by the second week</li>
            <li> My skin has also never been so soft and smooth and now my skin just has this amazing natural glow to it.  </li>
            <li> The facial cleanser that comes with it works amazing</li>
            <li> But this product cleanses you face really well and makes the face feels smooth and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> For the price it was worth a try, maybe it will work for you.</li>
            <li> This product was definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> Good price for a name-brand facial brush that is gentle on the face and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I bought this one instead; it does only one function - cleanses, and it does it nicely, rotating at 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> It urged me to add my success story to the growing list.  </li>
            <li> it does cost 5x the the Olay Cleaning system, but it&#x27;s well worth the price...</li>
            <li> They are worth it and stay charged a lot longer.</li>
            <li> So far, I love it.  </li>
            <li> This is a surprisingly effective device for facial cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I think it is fun to use it</li>
            <li> will say, it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tingly fresh like a lot of face scrubing lotions do, but</li>
            <li> Also, it seems to help my light facial moisturizer penetrate better.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Afterwards makes your face tingling and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> But, that&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li> I use this about once a week as kind of big exfoliation</li>
            <li> Investing in this was worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So far, after three or four scrubbings, I really love it.  </li>
            <li> Makes cleansing fun at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The product worked quite well but to me it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li> If it could just make the chin acne go completely away, I&#x27;d be over the moon, but that&#x27;s more than what this product is made to do.</li>
            <li> Not a crazy lopsided wobbling but for $26</li>
            <li> I think that in the end the clarisonic is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I figured for $30 it was worth a shot to try it before buying the Clarasonic.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth it</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels really fresh when I use it</li>
            <li> I believe I can safely recomend it to young boys going thru puberty.   </li>
            <li> I am so amazed by the simple, yet effective nature of this device.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the $30.00 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer went on and absorbed well instead of feeling like it was sitting on the surface.  </li>
            <li> This is far better than the puff kinds of exfolient pads we&#x27;ve all tried.  </li>
            <li> Clarisonic does have additional options for different brushes, but I don&#x27;t honestly see the need for that.</li>
            <li> I use the Olay cleanser in the shower, and it really makes my face feel super clean.  </li>
            <li> That being said, the Pro-X has far exceeded my expectations in most areas.   </li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product after watching a segment on &#x27;The Doctors&#x27; about effective cleansing.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy and</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Plus you can use your own facial cleansers or scrubs.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as some of the others on the market.</li>
            <li> The two advantages I feel the  Olay sytem  has over the Conair facial brush is that its shape and size do feel more comfortable in the hand and the push button off/on switch is easier to use than the sliding switch on the Conair.  </li>
            <li> However, the Conair switch also offers the option to reverse the direction of the bristles, which also gives it a feeling that it may be doing a bit more thorough cleansing job.  </li>
            <li> I rarely recommend things but</li>
            <li> You can use your own cleaner, results are the same.  </li>
            <li> Although I rarely return anything I returned this.</li>
            <li> I liked it enough to buy one for my mother.</li>
            <li> Now that I have used it, I can say that I would be willing to pay full price for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The entire package is a product of China, and more importantly, the cleanser cream is as well made from China.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X is so gentle and even has a slower, more gentle speed.</li>
            <li> my skin looks so fresh and youthful.</li>
            <li> However I love the fact that it has two speed and the fact that  when I use it my face feels extremely soft.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it ever has in my adult life</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the product itself</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> The sample bottle of cleanser is probably a tablespoon worth.</li>
            <li> 3x week, but it makes my face look more alive.  </li>
            <li> So worth it.  </li>
            <li> this is worth trying out.</li>
            <li> It is perfect to hold, the brush comes off for washing, it has two speeds and the lower one does a nice overall job, the upper good for difficult places.  </li>
            <li> For 25 or 30 bucks it&#x27;s definatley worth it.</li>
            <li> Inexpense, gentle, and once again leaves you with that super clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> The Clarisonic is by far much better then this Olay brush.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is worth the splurge .</li>
            <li> I love how soft it is on my skin</li>
            <li> I have never purchased the Olay cleansing product that came with this facial brush, I use my own cleanser.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates well and worth the money</li>
            <li> (I got $5 coupon clip during the purchase), this is the worth a try.</li>
            <li> and it was worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the slower speed to start with, again because of my sensitive skin, and it leaves my face feeling really smooth!</li>
            <li> It seems to be a far more thorough cleansing routine then a makeup remover and cleanser alone.</li>
            <li> Also, I use my own facial cleanser with this instead of the tube of cleanser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using an old favorite soap and lotion of mine: Purpose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Skin, surface now smooth and one layer opposed to many layers of various flakiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it an extra star because it really does feel good on your face.</li>
            <li> The brush is worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> polished &amp; fresh look..</li>
            <li> Most days I use it with Cetaphil for sensitive skin, and some days I use it with my exfoliant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is Ivory body wash nice big bottle of it for about 6 bucks and on amazon you can get a pack of 6 for about 25</li>
            <li> Quality is worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it was well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like the 2 speed settings, but the &amp;#34;on / off and speed level buttons&amp;#34; could be marked better.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> I found that if you put the cleanser directly on your face it works better than if placing it on the scrub.</li>
            <li> It has also made my skin look and feel more alive, so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product so far.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and it makes cleaning her face fun.  </li>
            <li> but my skin does feel cleaner and fresh.</li>
            <li> For the price I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> , it hasn&#x27;t erased those of course, but it has made my skin so soft and it feels healthy now.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the rotating head to provide more powerful scrub action.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels afterward.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, which was not a lot.</li>
            <li> More on the soft side than anything else.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much fun to use that you&#x27;ll be tempted to use it every time you wash your face (assuming you wash your face in the morning and night).</li>
            <li> (fun bonus</li>
            <li> I rarely regret buying stuff bcz</li>
            <li> but it was too many bristles on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday and sure takes all the make up off nicely.  </li>
            <li> This product does worth its price.</li>
            <li> I am more sensitive</li>
            <li> I have okay luck with using nutregena body clear with it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> I feel it is worth every cent I paid</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really worth a try.</li>
            <li> I was giving a spa treatment as a gift, and I had a professional use a \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; cleanser on my face.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads constantly fall off, no matter what kind you get.</li>
            <li> The brush feels rough on my face, but it does a good job cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Worth the monty.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a nice complement to my nightly facial care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure, makes my skin feel soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li> My face always feels good and clean after using it and I have less problems with acne if I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I only used the brush with my own cleanser, not the one that comes with this item, so can&#x27;t comment on the cleanser</li>
            <li> this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that using a bit of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting a nice invigorating facial message.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> and for around $20 this is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely use a wash cloth or scrubs.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost here on Amazon</li>
            <li> but my own facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> and I think it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this for me after hearing me talk about it for months, wondering if it was worth the hype, and noticed I hadn&#x27;t bought one.</li>
            <li> I think this is very much worth a $45 investment.</li>
            <li> Also, while the Pro-x brush rotates it doesn&#x27;t have the outer vibrating bristles that the Mia has, which I don&#x27;t think makes a difference except it makes the Mia brush head a bit bigger than the Pro-x, but to make my Pro-x really effective</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> Wow, I am so glad I returned the Clarisonic and bought the Olay Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> The Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System (spin brush) is a jewel!  </li>
            <li> I use it 2-3 times per week at night and rarely 2 days in a row.   </li>
            <li> I decided to try this cleansing system after years of not being able to achieve clear skin.</li>
            <li> WELL worth the money.  </li>
            <li> certainly  worth for recommendation.</li>
            <li> I am going to continue using it though, because it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> and I have probably the most sensitive skin in the world.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> , andI still find that they are worth it.</li>
            <li> but worked nicely all the same.</li>
            <li> Batteries run out often increasing the overall cost to own it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price compared to the pricey alternatives.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s worth it -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the end all answer, but it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li> For a while, I would just cover it up with make up, BUT NOW I am not afraid to go out with out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use their cleanser with the product because I like more natural cleaners</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s from my natural cleanser</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this so far...</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling so fresh.</li>
            <li> Soft but does a good job so far.</li>
            <li> This was indeed worth the prize.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I expected more for something costing almost 30 dollars, it&#x27;s worth more like $11.99</li>
            <li> It really smoothes and exfoliates very well and the medicated moisturizer works so much better.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Neutrogena pad cleanser, the Olay offers better value for money.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this product and it actually is better than i expected</li>
            <li> I personally just kind of think that these contraptions strip my skin.</li>
            <li> The pro-x has been the only thing I use every morning and night with my own cleanser to wash my face</li>
            <li> and it cleans so much better than your hands and makes your face really soft by exfoliation.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt so soft :)</li>
            <li> Worth the &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I especially like that I can use it in the shower and with my own face wash.</li>
            <li> An unexpected upside has been better management of those unsightly stray hairs that pop up on my chin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have since stopped using it because just rinsing my face every morning is better at keeping my face clear of any acne.</li>
            <li> I did not see it being worth it.</li>
            <li> If it lasts for even 6 months I&#x27;ll have gotten my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> It is worth your money.</li>
            <li> On and off button with 2 speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the product (I use my own face wash on a daily basis and use the Olay&#x27;s micro abrasion stuff once a week)</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> she is pleased, says it is exactly what she needed, small compact so good for traveling and storage</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but for the price I paid for it - it was worth it.</li>
            <li> For a fraction of the cost in comparison to some of the spendier version this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that my skin will continue to clear and my acne will eventually be more under control.  </li>
            <li> Know what works FAR better?  </li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I got the Olay Pro X because I had heard good things about Clarisonic&#x27;s Mia from my sister (who has similar skin) but wasn&#x27;t ready to commit to buying a clarisonic yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> However, this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and it is totally worth the $$$</li>
            <li> The Advanced Cleansing System cleans 6 times better than basic cleansing with a cloth or your hands.  </li>
            <li> Nice deep cleansing system.</li>
            <li> a daily really cleans my face good</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had some complexion problems and needed to try some way to maintain healthy clear</li>
            <li> Definitly worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> and I can already notice 3 distinct improvements in my skin&lt;</li>
            <li> Not that exciting a product.</li>
            <li> A very tiny sample of cleansing gel came with this, but you can use any kind you like.</li>
            <li> I have a nice glow after using, however I use the cleanser I&#x27;ve always used for my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and my skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive cleansing system...its worth the money.  </li>
            <li> For the price it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> So worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> I use my own exfoliating facial scrub (neutrogena, I think).</li>
            <li> Now I can actually have my own spa at home.</li>
            <li> The brush head is much smaller than the Clarisonic, but it Works nicely though.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Use your own facial cleanser if you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> This brush is 100% worth the results</li>
            <li> This brush is 100% worth the results</li>
            <li> for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I guess for only $20 its okay, but think next time I would spend a bit more to get a better quality.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cleaning brush that is effective, yet inexpensive, Olay Prox is definitely it!</li>
            <li> My skin has never been THIS SOFT and THIS SMOOTH!  </li>
            <li> That way, it creates more shifting action like the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> It is worth to buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been in use for about a month and seems sturdy and useful.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be more professional.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I using it everyday, loving it and my skin now look better then ever</li>
            <li> and it has helped my complexion stay clear and pimple free!</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never before been able to use anything because of my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> (LOL-I can laugh and joke about this now, but up til</li>
            <li> It was worth the price and it delivered beyond expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 2 months ago, and the product proves to be great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;CLEANSING - Clarisonic \\&quot; has 300 movements per second to gently, yet thoroughly remove 6X more makeup and 2X more dirt and oil than cleansing with your hands</li>
            <li> The Mia is by far a better product.</li>
            <li> A gift to my wife and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles really felt nice.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as nice as the one that comes with the facial cleansing product on TV.</li>
            <li> The oil of olay brush is also considerably smaller, lighter and feels way more comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> My blackheads have cleared, I rarely have break outs, my skin is softer, and my acne scars have started to fade.</li>
            <li> my skin is smoother and more clear already.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband and for my own use as a replacement because I kept dropping the Clarisonic until it stopped functioning after the last drop.  </li>
            <li> Since it didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s fallen out of my rotation because frankly if it doesn&#x27;t do anything exciting, I don&#x27;t have time for it.</li>
            <li> and I am not crazy</li>
            <li> this product is so worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I started out using it twice a day (morning and evening) with my own facial cleanser</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, inexpensive, does the job nicely, not to harsh.</li>
            <li> I do think it works better then just washing your face with a soft wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fun to use to</li>
            <li> I love the feel of how soft my skin is after using the product.</li>
            <li> I own a SonicCare toothbrush, and I  thought the technology would be similar, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it.</li>
            <li> Still, I dont think it was worth it.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem a bit too soft &amp; could use a bit more power</li>
            <li> This made me smile.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed this product so far.  </li>
            <li> So far my skin looks better in a bit brighter since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> , it makes it fun to wash your face while simultaneously drawing attention to areas of your complexion</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Honestly If i could I would return it and get my money back.</li>
            <li> , well worth it.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive so even going over the breakouts is okay.</li>
            <li> but it is definately worth it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, but not too soft, and the exfoliating sample is a good quality.  </li>
            <li> , I actually look forward to cleaning my face and applying my moisturizer because I can&#x27;t wait to see how nice my skin look and feels in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I actually look forward to cleaning my face and applying my moisturizer because I can&#x27;t wait to see how nice my skin look and feels in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I ran out of the cleanser that came with the Pro-X, I started using my own face wash (a deep cleansing wash from Target).</li>
            <li> I returned to using the old fashioned Buff Puff, which works better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Amazingly soft and supple skin with ProX by Olay Advanced!</li>
            <li> It is useful.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> but this is a GOOD and inexpensive way to get a deep facial cleansing and for most of us</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin to be more clear.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but effective and the two speeds come in handy for control in sensitive are near the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Another thing I liked about it is it took any foundation I had left on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is not bad, just did not have the amazing clean as the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin very smooth, soft, bright and clean after few week of using it.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin feeling very dry, rather than very clean and as a result I need moisturizer now more than ever.</li>
            <li> I am a 50 year old man, but I have oily facial skin, so I decided to try it, and I am very pleased with how it cleans and makes cleaning easy and fun.</li>
            <li> but luckily I watched a how to video before purchasing product, very gentle on skin</li>
            <li> Easy to operate, small but perfect for facial care.  </li>
            <li> The Olay Advanced Cleaning System cleans very well and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to have a stronger or more stiff brush head.  </li>
            <li> The speed of the rotating bristles is just right so that it removes dirt but is still smooth and gentle to your face.</li>
            <li> The brush head rotates, and the bristles are of the perfect density, not too stiff, not too soft.</li>
            <li> It is small so can be packed easily, even slipped in your handbag, if your carry a good sized one like me.</li>
            <li> Its super quick, easy and not very messy</li>
            <li> I had been trying to decide between buying the more expensive Clarsonic and ended up purchasing this instead since it got great reviews and was significantly cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love it for cleaning my face and getting all the dirt out, It is good for other things as well, I like it as it is soft on your skin as well as it gets into places</li>
            <li> I looked into getting the more expensive versions, but glad that I bought this instead as it&#x27;s much more budget friendly!</li>
            <li> Since the very day I started to use this product my face has felt more alive and fresh!  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this tool is less or equally effective as using a nonelectric skin brush and less effective as using the Aveda Shammy Cloth.</li>
            <li> it comes with (more of a cleanser with tiny gentle exfoliating beads) which made my skin feel so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Just received this and am very pleased, especially since reviews seem to be overwhelmingly positive.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy since it was very inexpensive compared to other products, but works great</li>
            <li> I like the polisher, it&#x27;s relatively affordable, and gives me a great deep clean.</li>
            <li> The brush rotates just fine, and cleans very well, better than I can do with my bare hands.</li>
            <li> Its awesome, cheaper and does that same thing the other brand does that is like 150.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it works for so many other people, though--</li>
            <li> Thought I was cleansing well, but this is super &amp; gentle!</li>
            <li> After using the scrub and the pro x consistently with my morning shower, I can see a tremendous improvement.</li>
            <li> Great little cleansing b rush and very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> So this is by far named the second best, it&#x27;s water proof which is amazing because you can wash your face in the shower which I find cleans better because your pores are open due to the steam from the hot water.</li>
            <li> My mother, a natural redhead with bright green eyes, was sitting next to me and told me how beautiful the pores on the side of my face looked, and immediately demanded I buy her a brush.  </li>
            <li> This little machine works gently but very effectively, my face feels extremely clean but not \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; after use.  </li>
            <li> Especially good for older delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Read a few reviews and it seems a good price and way to clean</li>
            <li> I can feel my skin clean and clear smooth and reduce scar and whitehead and blackhead.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the jewelry will be in the way and you won&#x27;t be able to clean that area properly.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over a month and it truly does open and clean my pores better than hands alone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in hopes of getting better results removing make-up and deep clean pores.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft against your skin and leaves your face feeling clean, smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> So I was pleasantly surprised to see how well this product worked to keep my face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> After using the olay pro x with my neatrageana oil free face wash my skin feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> clean skin very efficiently, it does a peeling and is also useful to remove make up using  face cleaning.</li>
            <li> This thing was more than clean - it was totally sterile!</li>
            <li> My face always feels so clean, soft and smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It gets my skin clean and makes it smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for a week and really enjoy how clean and soft my skin is already.</li>
            <li> I can say that my face definitely feels more clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it dry just to buff away some dry skin on my nose - and it works beautifully!  </li>
            <li> really like the fact that it leaves my skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> seems to help clean the dead skin off face feels good after use</li>
            <li> and I thought it stopped working, but I think it was mostly because I did not wash the brush clean enough.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a facial cleansing system so this particular model is a good value for money, for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean after each use and it has been clear even since I started using it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very clean and so soft.  </li>
            <li> I often get compliments on my skin, and I know that the Olay Pro-X Cleansing System is the major part of my skin staying clear and having good texture.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and fits in a nice, small organizer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut my skin like other brands, and my skin feels soooooo good.</li>
            <li> Price was good compared to the other systems that cost hundreds.</li>
            <li> This is a fair price compared to the other products.</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty soft and good for a pre-teen with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this product based off of other good reviews.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t like the fact that it does not come with instructions but other then that it is a good</li>
            <li> but other then that good product</li>
            <li> We use it with other soaps and cleaners and have had good results.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s still a good product and not a bad facial product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Also, is it really making our skin look better or is it the fact that we tend to wash our faces more frequently when we have a new product?  </li>
            <li> Thank You so very much for making it available and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The high speed is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> The brush is gentle enough not to feel like you are &amp;#34;over-scrubbing&amp;#34; your skin but strong enough to make you feel you are getting a truly thorough cleaning (a great balance).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and highly recommend others to buy it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Oil free and sensitive skin lotions, exfoliating face washes, special toners, etc.  </li>
            <li> Right before I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right before I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying it as the price is right</li>
            <li> Not liking the condition my skin is in right now...</li>
            <li> and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> I exfoliate right before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> That is why I wrote this out and why I endorse the product, not because I have to or because I feel obligated but because it means a lot to me to feel right</li>
            <li> But, for 150 bucks, I am going to pass for right now.  </li>
            <li> but for my needs it is just right.  </li>
            <li> so it fits right in your shower holder</li>
            <li> The machine is compact so it fits right in your shower holder</li>
            <li> It felt like the right amount of rotation when combined with the cleaner.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> and it pops right off.</li>
            <li> so I must be doing something right.  </li>
            <li> She said it broke her our a couple places, but I think its just the impurities right under the skin get exposed.</li>
            <li> the motor&#x27;s speed is just right.</li>
            <li> just right?    </li>
            <li> Moisturizers and skin care products just melt right into your skin like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  </li>
            <li> and I never seem to find the right cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I started using it right away</li>
            <li> They started out on the right side of my face, then went to my forehead, then went to my chin area.</li>
            <li> So i decided to stop using it for right now.</li>
            <li> I found the Olay system, and the price seemed right.</li>
            <li> The price was right so it will work for me for the time being.</li>
            <li> It is priced just right and does what I want it to do.</li>
            <li> The size is right, too.</li>
            <li> It pulls right out, and you can put the batteries in.</li>
            <li> So after doing research, I went to Ulta (I didn&#x27;t want to wait for shipping), and bought it, took it home and used it right away.</li>
            <li> I used it right away, with the product it came with.</li>
            <li> Still when I compare, the price is right</li>
            <li> It works well and has just the right amount of pressure.</li>
            <li> and it comes right off.</li>
            <li> and you can notice the results right away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on the Clarsonic for a while, but it was something I just couldnt afford right now.</li>
            <li> and  my makeup just glides right on.  </li>
            <li> and it gets the job done right.</li>
            <li> The brush head that is included is just the right firmness...</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I would keep it in my shower caddy or right beside the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> reviewers are right.</li>
            <li> I used the product and right away could feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I feel the difference right away, my skin improved after I used it.</li>
            <li> The instructions are printed right on the box</li>
            <li> I know these brushes are all the rage right now, maybe  I don&#x27;t have the right skin for this(?)</li>
            <li> The size is just right for use in the shower, it is water proof and it has two speeds.</li>
            <li> uh right, whatever.  </li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> Jury is still out on whether or not the Clairsonic is right for me or if this will just suffice as I&#x27;m still on the fence in spending the money on a Clairsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin stared shining right after I have stared using it.</li>
            <li> I say go get this right now and give it a try.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> i wonder if you can send me a softer comb or something softer since i think i have the right...</li>
            <li> Right now I use twice a week.</li>
            <li> face if he&#x27;s within arms reach of me when I&#x27;m using it because ..hey guys need to exfoliate too right?</li>
            <li> I started using it right away and can already tell a differency in my skin.</li>
            <li> Its good for a regular facial clean but if you really need some deep cleaning...probably do better to get a more powerful brush and unit.</li>
            <li> I do not use any other cleaning product on my face now; it&#x27;s gentle and feels very nice.  </li>
            <li> If you have more acne, you will probably go through a longer process of new breakouts caused by this brush, but in a lot of cases, it is a necessary step to getting better</li>
            <li> First use, sloughed off dead skin, felt great.</li>
            <li> but with a huge bottle of that cleanser for a decent price.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how gentle and quiet it is.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the Olay Cleanser that was enclosed, so I have been using it with a drop of anti-aging body wash or even Noxema for a gentle massage and clean.  </li>
            <li> surprised to see how small the cleaning soap was but was very happy with brush.</li>
            <li> It really gets your face clean.</li>
            <li> Small, comfortable in hands, waterproof and the sample Olay cleansing cream is good too.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle and clean my face well.</li>
            <li> It really works to clean your face and I will use it always.  </li>
            <li> It really makes your face feel clean and brightens your complexion.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem to deeply clean</li>
            <li> It provides a much deeper clean than you can get with just using a cleanser and wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> When I first received the System and used it, the next day I had a friend comment on how nice my face looked.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I love how small it is, it fits nicely in your hand and travels well.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wash my face without a product like this ever again, it definitely is a much deeper clean than using just a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> The device delivers the expectation which clean my skin very well.</li>
            <li> The low speed is strong enough to make my skin feel like it&#x27;s gotten a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Really gets my pores squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I use it with Proactive &amp; it really gets my pores clean.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants clean skin.  </li>
            <li> (I normally use biore foaming facial cleaner which is good but has nothing on this)</li>
            <li> It was vibrant and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> but I at least can be happy I got the full refund</li>
            <li> And it is MUCH easier to clean.</li>
            <li> The Olay is very inexpensive compared to Clarisonic and it does the job and encourages the girls to really clean their skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to exfoliate their skin to help look clean and keep acne at bay.  </li>
            <li> Really liked the way it made my face feel so decided to buy a second one from Walmart since I got a coupon from the purchase of first one.  </li>
            <li> This system does exactly what I hoped it would - it cleans my face better than anything I&#x27;ve tried thus far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fortunate to have decent skin to begin with, but I was looking for something that would help scrub off the excess oil and grime that would build up throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It works remarkably well, especially at it&#x27;s price point for delivering a result of soft, well cleansed skin.</li>
            <li> I believe this system helps me clean my face really well every day.</li>
            <li> Clean the face very well</li>
            <li> The applicator is extremely easy to use, light weight, and only takes 2 AAA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Olay Pro-X along with a cleansing cream that I purchased along with the applicator, my skin felt fresh.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally awesome - your skin just comes off in your hands and your face is unbelievable soft after.  </li>
            <li> This make my face feel clean and much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from cystic acne and this really helps me to clean my face the way it needs to be cleaned.</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants clean skin will benefit, men and women both.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would really get into my pores and clean the oil out while reducing the size of my pores.  </li>
            <li> Really getts skin clean without irritation.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped to brighten and clean my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did--the brush is exactly like my old one.</li>
            <li> Thus, it doesn&#x27;t really get the face clean</li>
            <li> It really gets out all the dirt and makeup and thus keeps my complexion clean.</li>
            <li> I combine it with Cetaphil for a gentle, but thorough clean.</li>
            <li> Great little machine!</li>
            <li> , I am so happy with this little gadget!</li>
            <li> Great little cleanser!</li>
            <li> The brush is soft which I like because I have sensitive skin, and having 2 speeds is perfect so you can either lightly go over your face for morning cleansing, or do a little deeper cleaning at night when you take your makeup off.</li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail price for this.</li>
            <li> for the product review:&lt;br /&gt;I think it does a very good job of removing dead skin cells and promoting new skin growth.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it&#x27;s very easy to get the battery cover off - as the instructions suggest, rock it back and forth while pulling it away from the unit.</li>
            <li> It tiny and isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is very easy to use, I use it daily.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive too and easily irritated.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about, because my box had very clear and easy to follow directions.  </li>
            <li> Well, I have to say, it does a wonderful job of getting deep down into the pores-</li>
            <li> The one with a cosmetic brand name... sold at the department store, too, and offered online for MUCH MORE if you are not careful!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too soon to see any major results, but I have noticed that my skin feels SO smooth after using it!  </li>
            <li> this is comparable to the more expensive system, I am glad I didn&#x27;t spend more money!</li>
            <li> but since the results from this product have been so positive and so quick</li>
            <li> but since the results from this product have been so positive and so quick</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this system for a smooth and softer face.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves how soft and clean her face is now!  </li>
            <li> My face is soft and clean after using it!</li>
            <li> I wish it had a stand or holder though, to stand it to dry after use  UPDATE: I still love it!</li>
            <li> My face is so soft and clean!</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and clean!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need a special body brush, I use this all over.</li>
            <li> You will really see a difference in your skin right away!  </li>
            <li> I thought well is it really doing anything special?  </li>
            <li> Great value for the money compared to other high end units that cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful little soft brush that really cleanses your face.  </li>
            <li> I believe that the magic is really more the brush and less the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I had been on the fence about whether this was worth all of the hype I had been reading, but then decided if it works half as well for my skin, then it would be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Ok anyways I got over it quick when I saw the price, I was watching tv last night and saw a comerciall for this product and googled it.  </li>
            <li> and I always tell people that it&#x27;s thanks to the Pro-X. I also want to point out that the cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but still does a good job of removing my makeup.</li>
            <li> It works about as well as Anew&#x27;s mild glycolic retexturizing peel to keep my skin looking younger and smoother, but unlike most of the masks I&#x27;ve tried there&#x27;s no drying effect.</li>
            <li> It makes exfoliation a quick and enjoyable part of one&#x27;s daily routine and this alone makes it a valuable tool.</li>
            <li> I went to a lot of trouble to find it again to replace the first one I had because I like it very much and think it is a great price.  </li>
            <li> If you, however, have very sensitive, fragile skin it might be a good alternative for you.</li>
            <li> Hmm, I would say it&#x27;s pretty useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But overall, I really like the cleansing system and would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay too much to get a good face cleansing system.</li>
            <li> It gives you a thorough cleaning and clears out pores that you may not have been able to get to before with your bare fingers.  </li>
            <li> I am sure the Clarisonic is worth every penny as the reviews imply, however I was excited to try something similar for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> This gives just enough exfoliation to make your skin look and feel great, but it it gentle, too and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If different size brush heads were available, this would probably be a good treatment for chest and back acne.</li>
            <li> Better than washing with your bare hands or paying almost $200 for cleansing device.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this system that I&#x27;m not sure whether</li>
            <li> in all, this a great product if you&#x27;re looking for something to boost the efficacy of your usual face wash.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product for small price that it costs.</li>
            <li> I used it lightly, on the lower setting, for a normal amount of time.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I went ahead and bought the full size one because it&#x27;s the only thing that helps clear up my acne!</li>
            <li> It gets my face really clean and leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> They are using them religiously and I am so please they have embraced good skin care habits at this young age!  </li>
            <li> While there are more high end models charging you high end prices, this one here gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is such a deep clean that I can now go throughout my day feeling more confident in my appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product for someone her age with acne, since she is not quite old enough to always want to clean her skin thoroughly, even though she desperately wants the acne to be gone.</li>
            <li> It is really good if you just want an extra deep cleaning and my face feels so clean and fresh after.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I ordered 4 brush refills and a large bottle of cleanser just to make sure I&#x27;d have it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> lol - but by the end of my first week&#x27;s use I was starting to get the pesky little whiteheads which is a sure sign of over-exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I just use a cheap generic brand of exfoliant scrub and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine, but honestly it doesn&#x27;t compare to the Clarisonic for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> The brush is really gentle, but clean my skin really well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and easy to use and helps exfoliates her skin making it look brighter!</li>
            <li> The product works fine and left my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It is tiny and easy to use it during shower!</li>
            <li> I do wish it was more advanced..or a little more power..</li>
            <li> My skin feels fantastic after using it, and it feels like a nice little face massage while using it.</li>
            <li> Somehow it is way easier to brush longer when it feels good and soothing, is effortless, maybe even a little fun, and you see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - (just 1 more thing to love about this little beauty)</li>
            <li> When the exceptional deal price popped up the other day, i grabbed it.</li>
            <li> When I use it consistently with a mild face wash or the exfoliating gel that comes with it, my face stays clear and free of blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for several weeks and the batteries are still going strong too!</li>
            <li> I use my own facial cleanser to wash my face first, then I go in with a bit more cleanser and the Olay brush to do the deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> its fine it did give some changes on my face so good product :) but the wash cleanser bottle is like half way empty</li>
            <li> perfectly.this little mild gentle scrubber, used daily, will do that perfectly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I found it for a much cheaper price than many other brands.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very smooth, but without being overly tight after I use it, and the best part: my pores are significantly smaller in size, something I never thought would be possible.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the positive reviews and substantial marketing materials that made it sound like a very new and upgraded way to wash your face.</li>
            <li> Only good / positive remarks that I can add to that is - That the proof is in the product &amp; little handy dandy durable machine (lol).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I saw and felt results right away.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a large bottle of the pro-x face cleanser!</li>
            <li> Even my first time using the product, I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> That is EXACTLY what happened right after using this product.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it I saw the difference right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;you can notice the difference right after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> The cleansing liquid is soft and not irritating, and my skin feels clean and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up in only a week thanks to this handy tool.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said it is too rough to use and really isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> so cleaned it up using a Q-tip and used a blow dryer to kind of dry this residue i even changed the battery just in case</li>
            <li> Plus with the rotating motion of the brush, I feel you&#x27;re getting a good CLEANSING action (maybe not enough exfoliating...</li>
            <li> Am happy to report my pores are smaller, skin is smoother than ever, and skin is definitely back in the \\&quot;you&#x27;re glowing\\&quot; category.</li>
            <li> The brush action more gentle than anticipated</li>
            <li> I am so happy I chose Olay instead of the more expensive version from Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> Having naturally oily skin, I noticed a significant difference the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Also, the Sirius Sonic which is very comparable to the pricy Clarisonic is amazing and only $50.</li>
            <li> I was actually contemplating purchasing the Clarisonic cleanser after reading such great reviews from the beauty blogging community, but was hesitant because of the price.  </li>
            <li> I had been saving up to buy a Clarisonic cleansing brush after it was strongly recommended to me during a professional makeup consultation.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how soft the brush head was for it to be as effective as it is.</li>
            <li> Mine is a year old now and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I use a different cleanser, but the spin brush exfoliates great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It is a bit different but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad someone recommended this affordable face scrubber machine rather than spend so much on the professional $200 machine that will also scrub your body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, and it&#x27;s nice and gentle.  </li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, they have great products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Post facial products are being absorbed better than before.</li>
            <li> So... why is gentle better than a literally-sonic scrub action?</li>
            <li> I went back and forth between the two, reading reviews and so on, and it was when I finally saw a report by a dermatologist who said that the Clarisonic works great in cleaning the skin but that it&#x27;s not an exfoliator and doesn&#x27;t stop wrinkles.</li>
            <li> They really should PROVIDE TWO BRUSHES, one for sensitive skin and one for more friction.</li>
            <li> :) If I remember, I will write an update after a few more weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the many reviews raving about it and the few that were not as pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Similar concept and useful for a deeper scrub as the pads are rougher and more exfoliating.</li>
            <li> love this &amp; use it every few days in the shower, love that uts waterproof</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend Cetaphil&lt;br /&gt;or baby shampoo for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m using it every morning in the shower, just a quick two times over my whole face.  </li>
            <li> Just like most I was looking for something more affordable than a few hundred dollars.</li>
            <li> only thing that didn&#x27;t make me so happy is that I paid the same ampunt for the item and the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I thought about buying the more expensive items but this was a great buy and it works.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how much money you spend on a facial cleanser it won&#x27;t work effectively unless you have a cleansing system and for 1/3 the price of a clearosonic</li>
            <li> but my face has a natural nice glow to it where my skin is clear.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the clarisonic system that&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
            <li> When I watch the demos on QVC, the Clarisonic (Mia) seems to work super fast on waterproof makeup.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle, and my face feels adequately exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ready to shell out big bucks for another system, but I knew that my skin, blackheads, and pores needed something effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price, when compared to the more expensive options.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This costs less than the others and does just as good a job.</li>
            <li> Of course I still had a couple of blackheads, but that&#x27;s much easier to clear than the many I had days before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After about a week and a half of using this, I began to notice a good improvement in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> is good but with poor power, is better is you use your hands, the batery ends inmediatly, I don´t like it</li>
            <li> This item I received super fast</li>
            <li> The skin on my face feels so nice with the gentle daily exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I plan to stick with this one as opposed to the more expensive versions because the results are great.  </li>
            <li> The brush always helps remove dry skin effectively.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and effective - especially for those with combination skin.  </li>
            <li> This is an easy way to thoroughly clean your skin while exfoliating at the same time.  </li>
            <li> : Keeps skin soft, cleans out blackheads, easy to find replacement brush heads</li>
            <li> It really leaves my face soft with a healthy polished glow.</li>
            <li> Feels GREAT on the face and definitely beats washing your face with your hands, I just wish the exfoliating clenser in the box a bigger quantity and not just a sample size</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and super clean.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are easy to change, and I&#x27;ve replaced it once so far.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing system, soft brush and makes your face feel so clean and soft</li>
            <li> After use, it appears to make my skin super clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have no reason to buy a more expensive brand because this works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25-year-old female with fair, oily, acne-prone and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I feel that the bristles really get into my facial skin and clean the makeup off better than a washcloth or just using my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All facial brushes do the same thing, it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I passed the Olay Cleansing System several times in stores but figured there must be something not so great about it if it&#x27;s only $20-30 dollars.</li>
            <li> recently read a review that stated if you compare the two products they are very similar and get the job done equally as great.</li>
            <li> I have been using my regular Cetaphil cleanser with the brush twice daily, and the Olay scrub once a week with great results.  </li>
            <li> Whatever it takes to get good habits inbedded as early as possibly, huh?</li>
            <li> This is super gentle...too much so for me.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic is definitely more powerful and has a bigger brush head the olays.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel super soft, minimizes pores and leaves you with a really clean feeling face.</li>
            <li> delivery was super fast,</li>
            <li> The Pro-X does a nice cleansing job at a good speed you don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It feels high quality, it&#x27;s very simple to use and works great so far.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and smooth and not irritated.</li>
            <li> This cleansing tool is fabulous and always makes my skin feel so very soft afterward.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and comfortable on my face</li>
            <li> face is baby soft, I keep on feeling it and am amazed--my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft or looked this good since high school</li>
            <li> Blemishes are clearing quickly now that I actually get my face CLEAN!</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t super rough or too easy, it&#x27;s just right and leaves your face feeling clean &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the wash they sent but my face feels so smooth and buttery soft when I use this thing!  </li>
            <li> Being an avid couponer, I was so happy to see that when I bought this system the second time, there was a digital coupon for $2 off this product!</li>
            <li> Being an avid couponer, I was so happy to see that when I bought this system the second time, there was a digital coupon for $2 off this product!</li>
            <li> I have a light complexion and sensitive skin and this works for me!</li>
            <li> Also, the exfoliator that comes with this kit is pretty rough, there are better ones available in stores.</li>
            <li> so I cannot compare,  the only thing is I would of liked the brush bristles to be a bit softer as I believe that the face skin is very delicate, but once you use a light hand your good to go.</li>
            <li> 2A&#x27;s    Conair - Cover slipped right off  Olay - I tried and haven&#x27;t been able to open the battery compartment yet.  </li>
            <li> great product, very cheap and is the same exact thing as the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft so most people will probably be fine with daily use of the brush.  </li>
            <li> Running the brush over my face is quite relaxing and pleasant, not harsh at all as long as I pay attention.  </li>
            <li> The brush applied the cleanser easily with no mess.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you very very much.</li>
            <li> The unit is very gentle to your skin</li>
            <li> Also, is very much under powered.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> The CS vibrates very fast....</li>
            <li> but this is very gently and</li>
            <li> It was very gentle with no fragrances.</li>
            <li> The brush is very gentle</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have very much power.</li>
            <li> , I need to be very gentle to my skin when cleansing.</li>
            <li> I find it very gentle</li>
            <li> The brush is very gentle</li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> This product is a very gentle yet thorough cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I like this system very much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very much like the buffer I was using from Susan Lucci.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliating cleanser is very gentle</li>
            <li> She likes it very much.</li>
            <li> , I need to be very gentle to my skin when cleansing.</li>
            <li> I like it very much but find they have a shorter life span than I would expect.  </li>
            <li> Bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Its very gentle on my face and gets th e job done.</li>
            <li> very gentle brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The giftee was very very happty to receive it.</li>
            <li> The sheets are just what I wanted,like very much.</li>
            <li> I am very gentle with using it</li>
            <li> This made my skin look so polished from day 1 and very gentle.</li>
            <li> I used the battery operated brush on my face and it was very gentle, but it did polish my face and exfoliate it.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> The scrub that comes with this runs out very fast.  </li>
            <li> very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, dont like being made to give a revew</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t have very much power, probably because it is battery operated.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have very much power.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle to the feel on the face</li>
            <li> and I use it with very gentle face soap -</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and I couldn&#x27;t tell that it was doing anything while using it</li>
            <li> The nice thing about this package is that the batteries are included in the package, but not physically in the handheld device, so you know that the batteries are new and fresh, not sitting in the device just dying.</li>
            <li> It works very well on your face and it feels very clean and soft afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally used to just clean my face with wipes and then wash my face with face wash</li>
            <li> works fine so far.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and using this is just fine.</li>
            <li> brush has two speeds and both are just fine by my sensitive, mid-30 skin.</li>
            <li> I have a really oily face with a lot of black spots, using it on a daily basis has help reduce both problems, very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, it uses batteries, can get wet, and leaves your skin nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> But so far it works fine.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews, I haven&#x27;t noticed a great difference yet, but it&#x27;s clearly a quality product.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it is fantastic and I am glad I bought it and would buy another one.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel real soft and clean,  </li>
            <li> i really, REALLY try to stay away from exfoliators but decided an electronic cleanser would be ok with my mild daily face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this new tool in my new regime.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that can&#x27;t handle most exfoliation products, yet occasional exfoliation is integral to smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles, i did notice it kept my face clear, easy to use and to clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with how soft the bristles actually are because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> positive reviews are right.</li>
            <li> This little beauty does a good job though.</li>
            <li> I loved the little sample that came with it.</li>
            <li> Good, because it gets into the little spaces on your face that the Clarisonic does not.</li>
            <li> Shipper got it to me fast, and I&#x27;m ready to purchase replacement heads!!</li>
            <li> Considering the price of other products similar to this one, this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System is an effective and well built bargain!</li>
            <li> I wish it came with a little bag, but a plastic baggie works just as good if you are traveling.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product but losing $32 wasn&#x27;t funny at all!</li>
            <li> My breakouts are rare and my skin always feels soft and clean after using the brush.</li>
            <li> It felt so clean, fresh, and soft.</li>
            <li> I brought this product mainly because everyone talked about the big name brand competitor and how amazing it was.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that will deep clean my makeup off and leave my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion otherwise is that you should not use it more then once a day because you can easily over stimulate your skin (especially if you have sensitive skin) which can cause more oil producation and breakage of your skin which can cause redness/swelling.</li>
            <li> the fact has 2 different speeds &amp; so economical..received item quickly &amp; had it 4 months now &amp; still working strong....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, smooth, tight, and just feels so good.  </li>
            <li> Such a wonderful little product!</li>
            <li> My skin is on the dryer side of normal and feels smoother, but not raw, and looks more even after using the spinning brush head with an oil-based cleanser (not part of the system).  </li>
            <li> I am looking for something more natural with the same fine exfoliating texture.  </li>
            <li> I also travel a bit, so I prefer the battery operated Olay product because it&#x27;s easier to pack and use on the go (a little tricky when you first change the batteries, but after that, you&#x27;re good to go).  </li>
            <li> But, I think for most people this would not clean good enough.  </li>
            <li> The movement isn&#x27;t as great as the clarisonic and maybe the brush is not as hard has the clarisonic</li>
            <li> Not as high powered as my last one, but it works nicely.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, no extra charges, safely packaged.</li>
            <li> Wish more speeds were available but overall it saves on having to wash face towels constantly and provides a clean feeling when done.</li>
            <li> The brush is as powerful as the more expensive ones and gives a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> so I use one without the little exfoliation beads, I feel like this tool does a good enough job without adding more abrasiveness.</li>
            <li> Face cleansing was never high on my priority list, but this gadget makes it so easy that I actually enjoy the process.</li>
            <li> I have huge pores, oily skin, and frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is a well designed product that I like so much I am thinking of getting one for my daughter and another for her mother-in-law!</li>
            <li> Love this facial brush!</li>
            <li> Even I&#x27;d you don&#x27;t use the microderm cleanser and just use your every day facewash it makes washing your face so much easier!</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after first use.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed todo, but at 75% the purchase price.  </li>
            <li> Really!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I buy it.</li>
            <li> Is not expensive, waterproof so you can leave it</li>
            <li> And persevere through the first time.</li>
            <li> In short, I&#x27;m really glad I bought this cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> I debated about purchasing this because I&#x27;m pretty disciplined with my established skin care regime, but using the cleansing system is like a trip to the spa (without the expense).</li>
            <li> Although I use mine at the sink, it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s not going to burn out because it got wet.</li>
            <li> They really should have included instructions for this!</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> This facial brush cleans better and my skin is smoother when I apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I rub the cleanser into my skin with my hands first and then go over it with the brush.  </li>
            <li> It really cleans out my skin and makes my face look fresh.</li>
            <li> AND it had more a couple extra brushes with it.</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin is evidently softer and smoother after each use.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the Clarisonic because the head is a lot smaller which allows you to get into every nook in your face without having soap splash everywhere.</li>
            <li> Broke after first use.</li>
            <li> I can only attribute that to the fact that it is in fact cleaning my skin better than just the cleanser alone.  </li>
            <li> First let me say I do exfoliate often.</li>
            <li> Maybe it does some more exfoliation, but I don&#x27;t fee the different yet.</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> it was more oily and my pores seemed larger after each use.</li>
            <li> I also love that it comes with a sample of the PRO-x exfoliation facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought an extra head for the hand held device</li>
            <li> For $25 more the Sirius Sonic will actually last.</li>
            <li> and my hands first, then use an AHA wash afterwards with this brush, and you can see how much more make-up this product removes, that the actual cleanser missed</li>
            <li> Long story short, get it, I think you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
            <li> After the first couple of days of use, I noticed there were \\&quot;flakes\\&quot; in my brows-</li>
            <li> do I spend $150.00 for the real deal, or get the Olay spin-off!?</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter especially like it because it cleans skin well and exfoliates, cleans much better than just soap and water alone.</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> I just used my pro-x for the first time</li>
            <li> Thoroughly cleaned my face, leaving it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System     </li>
            <li> I typed in oil control in amazon and this was the first one which grabbed my attention.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this, I instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li> and when I went back to buy another one they were all gone, went to 5 more stores and everyone was sold out</li>
            <li> It works pretty well -</li>
            <li> Actually this will work even better for travel</li>
            <li> is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a gadget like this</li>
            <li> so at first I thought it should feel stronger.  </li>
            <li> But then I bought the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and began using them together.</li>
            <li> I have been using it consistently for a week.</li>
            <li> you need to cleanse first and then use the exfolliant.</li>
            <li> But it delivers what the higher priced products do.</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a month or so, but am hoping it works on oily skin better than a sponge/washcloth.</li>
            <li> The first week or two, my skin was all over the place, but I stuck with it because another reviewer says that will fade away.</li>
            <li> , make sure you put it on low speed and not pressure on your skin.</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t exactly work for me....</li>
            <li> Overall though, I&#x27;m glad I got this instead of spending that $130 on a Clairisonic.</li>
            <li> My current favorite am</li>
            <li> so much so that you don&#x27;t want to stop!    </li>
            <li> (that might be the first time I ever said that word) to my face.</li>
            <li> Also the battery compartment was filled with clear goo?</li>
            <li> I personally think you fare better using the cleansing bath gloves on your face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that tube of cleanser worth that much of money.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research first on the clarisonic system</li>
            <li> I can see my pores were more deeply cleaned after just one to two uses.</li>
            <li> This product is so gentle and leaves my skin exfoliated and cleans my pores!</li>
            <li> I wanted my skin all pretty like the picture said.</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s gentle!</li>
            <li> I think you can get better exfoliation using a basic washcloth.  </li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> I was at Saphora looking at the more expensive version of this and thought to use the Amazon app to check the online price (which is great with the barcode scanner by the way) and Olay Pro-X came up as a related/suggested product and it was really affordable.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft and cleaner than ever before.</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> Also, for those of you that are looking at the Clerisonic...you might want to try this one first before spending $200.</li>
            <li> I have even used it on two of my family member&#x27;s faces and we both saw/felt results from the first use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do what I did! ;)</li>
            <li> a great buy, considering that traditional manual exfoliating gloves/brushes/pads can cost nearly just as much and aren&#x27;t as comfortable to use.ush is all worn in the middle.</li>
            <li> ;)     </li>
            <li> Overall a great buy, considering that traditional manual exfoliating gloves/brushes/pads can cost nearly just as much and aren&#x27;t as comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> *fits hand perfect but yet small enough to travel with.    </li>
            <li> I get regular facial peels and it seems as though I benefit more from the peels now because of my better nightly regime including this device.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased four of these Olay Cleansing Systems and gifted three of them to my two daughters and 15-year-old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> The first lasted five years in the shower.</li>
            <li> but then found olay cleaner and toner at TJ Maxx and it works really well!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> have now been using it for 3 months and just bought my first replacement heads and now notice that my blackheads are almost non existent.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> At this point I know I love the facial scrubbers</li>
            <li> If there were a way to achieve the same results without batteries, that would be a better option.  </li>
            <li> , I was always aware of it being there.</li>
            <li> I use the brush with my proactive cream and it worked fast!</li>
            <li> My skin immediately felt smoother and free of dead cell debris and my moisturizer absorbed a lot faster and better upon application.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve tried this I can say that i would only try a clairsonic if it was gifted to me or somehow i got an 85% off deal.</li>
            <li> I love that it has 2 speeds and the waterproof qualities already gives it 2 advantages above the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Not only did my skin look and feel better from</li>
            <li> All that being said, it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> My wife has used this product pretty consistently since we received it over a month ago.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, Olay came out with one $170 cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I like how this makes the makeup looks so much better the next day</li>
            <li> I like the multiple speeds and being able to take it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I was going to purchase the Clarisonic device first but read the reviews about the Olay product and decided to try it first because it was so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> (the switch was the first thing to go...)</li>
            <li> This is my first review...ever.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I wet my face and applied my own creamy (non-exfoliating) cleanser, then turned on the Olay device.</li>
            <li> So: it cleans well enough to wash away pore-gunk that I was failing at removing before, while seeming to create a much more welcoming environment for my anti-acne moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This brush cleansing tool softened the texture of my face after the first use.</li>
            <li> made my skin more red.</li>
            <li> Pores are smaller and makeup goes on better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to exfoliate but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on a big one.</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily for more than 4 months without any issues/complaints.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> It looks pretty, but it won&#x27;t make YOU look any prettier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a clarisonic to compare this to, but I really like this product!</li>
            <li> This is the first review I ever wrote for a product, for a reason!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> always have it on the higher setting, but I would suggest to use the first setting in the beginning just to test out the waters.</li>
            <li> THE BRUSH HAD A FUNNY SMELL, LIKE IT WAS SITTING AROUND SOMEWHERE WHICH WAS A TURN OFF.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really not to much else to say, just simply is worth investing in.</li>
            <li> Make sure you order the 2 count box of extra brushes.</li>
            <li> at first.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s interesting to read in the various reviews how some people think it&#x27;s too wimpy while others think it&#x27;s too strong/scratchy.  </li>
            <li> The first one I at Walmart whilst on vacation</li>
            <li> I can compare it to the clarisonic which I used first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a week, but I can say my skin looks noticeably better.</li>
            <li> -- it literally has made my skin baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> When you use this system, you will wonder why you never used it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s not to big!</li>
            <li> So for the price and freedom to decide, I picked the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing</li>
            <li> I have no feedback for that product because I have not noticed any outstanding feature of it after several uses.</li>
            <li> I have wanted a Clarisonic since they first came out.  </li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> I bought one for my sister and she really likes it as well!</li>
            <li> The first week I did get 3 pimples but they have gone away.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It works better when I use it with st Ives facial scrub</li>
            <li> It had been about 36 hours since I started using it twice a day, when I broke out for the first time in over a decade.  </li>
            <li> and I dip the brush under hot water as I am using it to continue foam.</li>
            <li> Let me be the first to say that as a Guy</li>
            <li> After getting a start, i was able to open it.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money if you dont want to spend so much on the clarasonic.</li>
            <li> when I saw the tv commercials for this, I thought I&#x27;d try it first.  </li>
            <li> I think maybe the smaller grit of the scrub that comes with this brush is better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still interested in trying the clarisonic</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t buy anything now without first shopping Amazon first.  </li>
            <li> I like to use it with my favorite facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> In fact, I could see improvement within the first week.</li>
            <li> One month later after using almost 1-2 times a day (gently) with my own cleanser and taking a day off if getting too much drying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin brushing!you are using professional skin products, not that cheap stuff at the box stores.</li>
            <li> but, after reading reviews (and price tags) I decided to give the Olay one a try first.  </li>
            <li> I saw an ad for a really pretty Clarisonic Mia2 and thought well maybe I need a pretty one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was only $20.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for those that want to feel what a completely makeup free face feels like.</li>
            <li> so I could pack more souvenirs in, but looking back</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m hoping that this one will last more than a year.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> For the price it really  doesn&#x27;t seem  worth it.  </li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My skin tingles after I use it, and it is SO gentle, but it does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> More than ten years ago I purchased one that Susan Lucci (All My Children) was promoting on TV.  </li>
            <li> After first use..makes a difference of your skin..</li>
            <li> The Olay is smaller and more compact, which makes it easier for travel.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I don&#x27;t believe it competes with the higher brand ones.</li>
            <li> test it on your hand or something first...</li>
            <li> glowing.i only wish it had more cleaning product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item locally (not from Amazon) and enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> Almost better than after a facial.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable too!</li>
            <li> love it and have recommended it to several people.</li>
            <li> I was loathe to spend a lot on something without trying it out first.</li>
            <li> item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Really like this cleansing system!</li>
            <li> The soft rubberized exterior feels durable and is comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first day i got this and used it, my face had a reduce size in bumps.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, light, but I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s actually doing anything or noticed that it took off my make up that well on its own.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews about many different facial brushes, I decided to buy this from Target.</li>
            <li> I was pretty stoked about that.</li>
            <li> I have to say first off that I&#x27;ve never tried the Clairsonic, however.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m assuming that it is cleaning out my pores pretty well.</li>
            <li> So I will be getting some moisturizer for my face, for the first time.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the coupon Amazon!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I am a DEVOTED Pro-X user.</li>
            <li> This Olay Pro-X works just as well if not better than the Clarisonic products, and at such a better price point!!!!  </li>
            <li> I feel like it does the same magic for 1/8th of the price.</li>
            <li> It delivers way more strokes than washing with your hands possibly can.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect and first time I used it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Highly recomended item for all women!!</li>
            <li> and I feel it does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to perform miracles the first night.</li>
            <li> I use Proactiv Plus and it works pretty well</li>
            <li> I wish it had a stand to put in the shower or at the sink but other than that, love it!  </li>
            <li> made my face smoother from the first time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to get this one.</li>
            <li> Also, I stopped using the provided scrub because I personally think a heavier duty scrub works better.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week, but when I first received it I used it every day.  </li>
            <li> I had the same problem as many reviews...</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you see.</li>
            <li> Most people think I&#x27;m 10 years younger than I am.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have washed my face first and then used this after for skin refining?  </li>
            <li> Without feeling like it took off my first layer of skin.</li>
            <li> Works well, just didn&#x27;t use it too much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and is still working!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love this item very much, i only use at night,  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> Never thought something so simple and cheap would work so well on my face!</li>
            <li> not that it was that much but well worth what I paid</li>
            <li> Was thinking about the Clarisonic, but a friend who has used both suggested I try this first.</li>
            <li> Sure it doesn&#x27;t time the scrubbing for you and might not get quite as deep, but for the price</li>
            <li> It does not have the same power nor does it feel any better after than washing with your hands.</li>
            <li> I love it , it removes all the dirt and left over make up on my face  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion is make more than 2 variable speed types.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give 5 stars is b/c I would like a bit more power in the spin brush-</li>
            <li> Would recommend for first time users.  </li>
            <li> Just goes to show that the more expensive product isn&#x27;t necessarily the best.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who is interested in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> The cleansing agent really gets in to the pores and cleans well!</li>
            <li> I actually think the Pro works better.</li>
            <li> I planned to buy a cleansing foam at first.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I have already ordered a second one, plus replacement brush heads, to make sure I can continue using this proven version for years to come.</li>
            <li> wash hands, Turn water on HOT.</li>
            <li> So I recommend anything fragrance free and natural.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is definitely sturdier and much more</li>
            <li> This is such an inexpensive, fantastic beauty find!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase the Clarisonic for $150 b/c this product does exactly what you need it to do.</li>
            <li> I change the brush every 3-4 months and the replacement brush heads are not expensive.</li>
            <li> At first I felt like I was buffing my car, except I&#x27;m exfoliating, and its my face not my car.</li>
            <li> loveee that the bristles &amp; the motion of the cleaner is so gentle!</li>
            <li> Comparable to higher priced items, but without the expense.</li>
            <li> it really did kept my skin from breaking out!</li>
            <li> First of all I wish this was softer and this pulls on your face in circles.</li>
            <li> Exactly 1 year after purchase the power button won&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the higher prices systems that people talk about</li>
            <li> My skin immediately felt smoother and free of dead cell debris and my moisturizer absorbed a lot faster and better upon application.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Actually think this brush is better to use on my body than my face because its pretty abrasive compared to my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Love the ease and feel of this simple machine.  </li>
            <li> So at first when I bought this I was skectipcal.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on so smoothly and my face has completely cleared up</li>
            <li> I love this facial  cleanser system..</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to a friend or a stranger ;-)</li>
            <li> You can literally feel the difference after the first try.</li>
            <li> In fact, I could see improvement within the first week.</li>
            <li> On the first use I found my skin to be 10x softer and smoother than before.</li>
            <li> My facial cleaning routine has been lax for many years.</li>
            <li> Works better than just a standard brush.  </li>
            <li> Prior to use I also started developing the type of deep-seeded blackhead that looks like dirt (versus the more whitehead type), but that seems to have come to a halt since I&#x27;ve been using the Pro-X.  </li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> THEN I get this out and used the scrub it came with, and I can&#x27;t believe how much makeup was on the brush!</li>
            <li> First, I thought the batteries ran out, so I changed them.</li>
            <li> Although I had wanted the Pro-X for sometime I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the drug store price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> It also arrived very swiftly!</li>
            <li> Better than my facial wipes or my washcloth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally bought this.  </li>
            <li> and I am still using Cetaphil (which is not expensive).  </li>
            <li> Olay is one of my favorite facial products.  </li>
            <li> I saw the same package at Costco for $10 more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been able to achieve the same results with this though.  </li>
            <li> When I was going between the $150 Clarisonic and this I decided to try this first</li>
            <li> and I think about first world problems.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> I did break out at first</li>
            <li> It is the first one I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> It really does wonders for my face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna buy more for my sisters and friends as gifts when I see them next year in summer!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The brush also does not have a splatter guard as the Clairsonic does - this means that the higher speed splatters water a bit.</li>
            <li> On the first night, I opened the thing up, put the batteries in and turned it on.</li>
            <li> Overall, the pro-x is just ok, but if you can splurge on the clarisonic</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the way this product works, i have seen a drastic change in my complection after using it for only a month.</li>
            <li> Then it will probably turn into my first choice face brush.</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased after my NutraSonic died served me well.</li>
            <li> First being the Boscia Konjac Cleansing Sponge with Bamboo Charcoal.</li>
            <li> So now I have my NutraSonic back, and I have this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System!</li>
            <li> So now I have my NutraSonic back, and I have this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, especially for the $13 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend removing eye makeup first before using it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I hadn&#x27;t removed my mascara</li>
            <li> So this works pretty well</li>
            <li> At first I thought it&#x27;s the cleanser</li>
            <li> and this was the first time a product irritated and broke out my skin</li>
            <li> The bristles were smooth and did not hurt my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I figured that I would try this one first</li>
            <li> I emailed the seller and got a refund minutes later which I was glad to get.</li>
            <li> I really like it and feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I tried it in the first place</li>
            <li> That was my first choice</li>
            <li> Not as thrilling</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed I began breaking out more, with deep, beneath-the-skin lumps.</li>
            <li> I figured this was the initial purging stage, and eventually things would get better, but it got to the point that I had to stop using it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this first because I didn&#x27;t want to pay the price for Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> and I would higher recommend it</li>
            <li> This works very well for the price!</li>
            <li> She has look in many different retail outlets and none compares to this price.</li>
            <li> Why spend up to $200 on a facial cleansing brush, when this was under $20, and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> she loves it - and it will probably save her some money on facials as this exfoliates really well!</li>
            <li> and this really seems to keep my face fresh.</li>
            <li> I know if I could CONSISTENTLY keep up any routine, I would achieve the results I want without needing all the bells and whistles to do so.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> the product is pretty much as advertised!  </li>
            <li> Possibly, it&#x27;s lightening the appearance of my rosacea - can&#x27;t tell for sure yet.  </li>
            <li> Thanks !</li>
            <li> I have gone to the dermatologist and have tried so many topical creams and oral medications.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li> is soft and smooth</li>
            <li> When the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System arrived, I opened the box to examine it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Just at first glance, I had formed an opinion without using it.  </li>
            <li> I reccommend this facial scrubber over the vibrating ones as it seems it does a better scrubbing job.</li>
            <li> The only wish is to have more gel sent with the device.</li>
            <li> The only comment I would make on this product is that the brush for it I wish it had either more bristles or stronger ones.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and have been using it for about 2 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> My flaking has cleared up so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different creams, prescription medications and pore strips.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what is described.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face both soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend!! :)</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> I had it on the higher spin setting and used it for about one minute.</li>
            <li> It was smoother and softer after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of the Olay cleanser, I decided to see how things went using my current favorite cleanser, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Now that these things are being advertised as the #1 way to keep your skin looking younger, I&#x27;m glad i bought one.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliation usually causes one of 2 things for me more oil or more pimples.</li>
            <li> I ultimately decided to give the Olay Pro-X a test run, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> im sure you would get the same results.</li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> Bought first one from Amazon &amp; it lasted about 8 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I found that most of the reviewers who had both actually preferred the Clarisonic, but they also said that for the money, this worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the most essential part for me that is \\&quot;blackheads\\&quot; .</li>
            <li> comfortable  not harsh.</li>
            <li> My face is soooo smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause overdrying, irritation, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s tearing at your skin but leaves it smooth, soft, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it religiously now.</li>
            <li> I use the cleansing system first time this morning</li>
            <li> Love it &amp; will definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> This thing really cleans your face well!</li>
            <li> It has worked well for me since the first use.  </li>
            <li> Lov this thing so much!</li>
            <li> I use a goat&#x27;s milk soap now, and I actually like the way that makes my skin feel better.</li>
            <li> I had been interested in buying a face cleanser for quite some time.</li>
            <li> The first one lost the seal around the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> My face was noticeable brighter, smooth and soft after one use.  </li>
            <li> My wife told me she does like Olay for her face and love Olay for a christmas present from me and told me to buy olay for Christmas this year.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a product like this, but wasn&#x27;t willing to spend</li>
            <li> It could be possible that the two products work better when used together.</li>
            <li> Actually, you could do more with hand washing with a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> Love it, I was unable to buy the $100 version of this product, so I heard about this one and opted out for it, so glad I made that decision, I Love it.</li>
            <li> Although still get occasional acne and clogged pores I have noticed a difference and love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Overall I have been quite pleased by&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how it cleans deep to get the make-up and dirt out of my pores!</li>
            <li> My ski thanks me for buying this product!</li>
            <li> and I wanted this so much!</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t use the face wash that comes in the box, and I only use it twice a week at most.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get the clarisonic at first but after reading the reviews I decided to try this first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m debating on whether or not it would be worth it to return the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t be able to take it into the shower, but it took me a while to figure out how to open it up.  </li>
            <li> I have had 2 of these in so many years and both did the same thing.</li>
            <li> It definitely cleans so much better than just a wash clothe alone</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> First, let me say I have the hide of a rhino</li>
            <li> This cleansing system is the first I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> The first week I started to use it</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Get yourself some Eneloop Rechargeable batteries and you&#x27;ll be ready to go!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve had this for awhile, I&#x27;ve learned the exact formula for my skin.</li>
            <li> At first I was using it every night along with a 10% benzoyl peroxide cream, spot treatment, and then moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Amazon after seeing some youtube videos on the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massager as such is not so refreshing as I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles in the brush got out of shape in just 2 massages.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> For this price, this product really does the trick!</li>
            <li> I never realized that this would help my face so much!</li>
            <li> I tried many different kinds of batteries and still not working.</li>
            <li> I am aware that a lot of people compare this to the MIA2, I&#x27;ve never used or owned a Mia2</li>
            <li> At first, I couldn&#x27;t notice a difference, but now, when I don&#x27;t use it, I can tell.  </li>
            <li> The trick is consistent use.</li>
            <li> Feels like it&#x27;s getting my face cleaned pretty well</li>
            <li> I should not have been using the Pro-X in the shower in the first place, but thats where I prefer to use it.</li>
            <li> Got this item today and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> So glad I ordered it and plan to use it daily.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth and soft after using this.</li>
            <li> My skin is sooo much smoother and brighter after using this!  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to try it first.</li>
            <li> When I first got it</li>
            <li> this product is exactly as what it describes.</li>
            <li> I use an exfoliating scrub on the lower speed, and when I use the higher speed, I use a cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> really affordable!</li>
            <li> Why would you pay more for another brush that does the same thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries.</li>
            <li> their performance &amp; facial lines are more pronounced.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a MUST for removing all my make-up at the end of the day and cleansing oily skin first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> My skin was soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The first benefit: if you are one of those people who tend to fall asleep without washing your face...this will put a stop to that.  </li>
            <li> Works very well!  </li>
            <li> I use this about 3 times a week &amp; it really cleanses my face!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s others priced much higher.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> *).</li>
            <li> Be sure, however, to buy replacement brushes as well, if you plan to use this with a scrub-like facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> My pores are visibly cleaner and I have only used this twice and most of my blackheads are already gone.</li>
            <li> and I used it for the first time ..</li>
            <li> On the first run out I used my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and I think the face wash should come in a bigger size and should be more of a scrub.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> and the Pro-X cleansing system has made a remarkable difference in tone and color, also I am starting to see a change in my facial wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> My skin was brighter the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Overall my face feels and looks better.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> SEEN MUCH DIFFERENCE, YET!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It sounds like more work than it actually is.</li>
            <li> I feel I am taking much better care of my aging skin now that I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Within the first use, you can see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I have never been interested in taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li> However, I reckon if I did use it twice daily, I might get better results.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I tried Olay Prox yesterday for the first time.</li>
            <li> You can tell the difference in your skin after the first use whatever age.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered two more as gifts from a different website and got a unbeatable deal for the Olay Professionals Holiday set.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever bought a product of this nature.</li>
            <li> but after I got it in the mail and tried it out the first day...</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this product and already love it.</li>
            <li> At first it did nothing</li>
            <li> No issue with seller or shipping ;-)</li>
            <li> I thought, at first, that I needed to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> So it works well enough on the face, but it could definitely be better.</li>
            <li> The brush makes my skin feel so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going pretty well.</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE HOW THE EXTRA SOAP SAYS IN MY SKIN</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> My skin has just been so much better since starting to use this and the olay cleanser with it.</li>
            <li> I say “probably” and “might” here because it is possible that Olay uses substantially better parts in its devices; but I doubt that.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen my skin look this healthy in years after using this brush for only a week.</li>
            <li> thanks...will be willing to write a better review if you can send me a softer one because that is the only problem...!</li>
            <li> This is the exact product i saw advertised in a magazine</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne and flaking skin, so I was willing to try this Olay brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, don&#x27;t assume the magic is in the 50ml tube of the facial cleanser that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have given a higher rating if my product wasn&#x27;t defective.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I got it and especially at this price point.</li>
            <li> Love this thing, and my skin is definitely a lot softer since using it.</li>
            <li> Cleanses my face gently!</li>
            <li> my friends and family tell me I look 5-years younger since using ProX :)  </li>
            <li> and it was the exact</li>
            <li> It really polishes my skin and makes me glow!</li>
            <li> The Pro-X cleans pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial cleansers and moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> This cleans really well!</li>
            <li> no CON&#x27;S here, just PRO&#x27;S ;)</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t beat the price ;)</li>
            <li> I works better for me than simply using face wash.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> She proclaimed that her face felt was extra smooth feeling after using it!</li>
            <li> Performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The first week I used it, my face broke out.</li>
            <li> (pretty sure it&#x27;s the same reason) ..</li>
            <li> : for all those people giving this a low rating just because they like their clarisonic more, PLEASE, don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> I use it first then enter the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my upper arms to help exfoliate more in the shower.</li>
            <li> And it has totally changed his skin for the better.</li>
            <li> so I decided to start with a lower priced item first.  </li>
            <li> if it helps my skin since I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month, but my skin FEELS better to the touch.</li>
            <li> It makes my face clear and smooth, it even helps wake me up in the morning.</li>
            <li> My very temperamental skin now looks rejuvenated and fresh.</li>
            <li> My first day using it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, for the price especially compared to the Clarasonic, I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and during the winter months I didnt use it everyday .</li>
            <li> I purchased this items a few weeks ago because the reviews were good</li>
            <li> I purchased this items a few months ago because the comments were good</li>
            <li> I got this a week ago and have been using it everyday, and it seems like a really good concept, but I&#x27;m still on the fence about it.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush I use it in the shower everyday while it&#x27;s not water proof</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using everyday, and it is really good.</li>
            <li> and the good think this thing its not available in TURKEY</li>
            <li> I was prepared to buy it again if mine was dead for good.</li>
            <li> dead isn&#x27;t good quality.</li>
            <li> She use it everyday and is seeing good results ever time</li>
            <li> -- my face feels very soft and clean after I use.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> It really gets down in the pores and cleans good.</li>
            <li> Recommending for daily use to have a deep clean and healthy skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ability to sloth of dead shin cells helps any face cream you may use to be absorbed by the skin much better while help generating the new skin cells to grow making you skin look more youthful and glow.</li>
            <li> The other cleaning tools clean in a more vibrating, sonic way.</li>
            <li> My grandkids love to use it to clean other parts of the body during play</li>
            <li> but somehow my skin feels way more clean and polished than it did the other.</li>
            <li> I started out originally using it just once a day at night to clean off the makeup and daily grind.  </li>
            <li> gives me a clean feeling that is better than I can get with other methods.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t break out excessively before, but I can say that I very rarely have any kind of blemish now.</li>
            <li> , it leaves my skin super super clean as if I just had a facial, I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush, love the two speeds, the slow is good for the nose and the fast works for the forehead.  </li>
            <li> My face has never felt so clean and soft!  </li>
            <li> My face feels so clean and soft that even my husband notices the difference!</li>
            <li> Look good for less!</li>
            <li> The Olay brush works great so far but is not on the level of the higher priced Sonic brushes and has less power.</li>
            <li> , whats the point of shedding the old skin off and cleaning the pores if your not going to take care of the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works better than the neutrogena sonic wave cleaners</li>
            <li> The Olay brush I feel isn&#x27;t strong enough to adequately exfoliate my skin, it really felt just like a very VERY gentle rotating scrubbing which didn&#x27;t make a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have not used it for a very long time but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleansing brush, it cleanses very thoroughly and leaves skin very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft and gentle, easy to detach and wash, and scrubber has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> But the way I figure it - in spending  $20 vs. $200, if the $20 item is half as good as the $200 one, for a 1/10th of the price - I&#x27;m that much ahead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 39 &amp; have been lucky to have nice skin, except for a few blackheads around nose &amp; some stress acne.</li>
            <li> , I have noticed my skin seems brighter, more evenly toned, amazingly smooth, and less oily.</li>
            <li> I guess I will sometime, but I&#x27;m kind of partial to my own soap, homemade with my choice of oils and other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve issued other top rated brushes and this one by far my favorite for the price.</li>
            <li> Even more excited when I tried it out, and it left my face beautifully soft.</li>
            <li> It keeps me honest in the fact that I believe that this brush allows me to get my money&#x27;s worth out of the other products that I use, by really getting to and exposing the skin&#x27;s surface.  </li>
            <li> This Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System is very compact and the brush is very soft.</li>
            <li> The scrubber is very soft and the soap sample that comes with it is nice enough.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and any kind of facial exfoliant</li>
            <li> I really love this little tool and would highly recommend over the more costly brand names.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine, and these refills are just fine.</li>
            <li> /use it in the shower, and is ready to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really tell you to run out and get one right now.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not talking about anything revolutionary here!ike it and will continue using it, but I can&#x27;t really tell you to run out and get one right now.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on your skin and you will feel the difference right away.  </li>
            <li> I found that I had to gently move the Pro-X in a counterclockwise motion or it would walk right off my face.</li>
            <li> Right from the start, I felt my skin getting much softer.  </li>
            <li> The system doesn&#x27;t rotate as fast as I expected and the brush is quite soft, but it really does clean wonderfully and even after a long day you can still feel a clean, soft skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure at first, but when I used it for the first time it really scrubbed my face and felt good.</li>
            <li> I bought the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System because I wanted to try out one of these types of products, didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune (in case it didn&#x27;t help), and the reviews on this site and others have been really positive.</li>
            <li> great product for a lot less than the other brands, maybe lacks the power others have, but I don&#x27;t have a face made of marble to clean!</li>
            <li> I really like the way it cleanses your skin, leaving it soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> i did not see any dramatic change in my skin, but my face felt much cleaner and it was fast which was wonderful.</li>
            <li> Overall it does a decent job at cleansing and my skin felt smoother and fresher and absorbed skin care products better.</li>
            <li> My skin is getting more clear and clean, especially the \\&quot;T\\&quot; area.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to use - the detachable brush can be washed and fixed back easily.  </li>
            <li> Its worth the  money I use it everyday love it!</li>
            <li> This completely cleanses it deeply, and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy too use (thanks to earlier reviews on how to put the batteries in as i would have thought I was breaking it!!)</li>
            <li> Due to the more even texture of my skin, I got nice smooth coverage with less make up.</li>
            <li> The tube of exfoliating cleanser that&#x27;s included is pretty pitiful in size, but I&#x27;m finding that I like using the Pro X with my normal face wash better anyway, so I&#x27;m glad I went with this one for half the price instead of the one that you can get with the large bottle of cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Also, they could very easily and cheaply come out with accessories such as a simple stand and a brush cap to protect the bristles for travel/storage.</li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle even on the higher speed (just be careful around your eyelids!), very compact, and does a near-perfect job of cleansing and polishing your skin (really should be used twice daily for the absolute best results).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found its really important to moisturize right after using the system or my skin tends to dry out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel really smooth and clean after I use it in the evening - I alternate a gentle cleanser with an exfoliating cleanser every other day, and my skin has never felt this nice.</li>
            <li> I would easily purchase this again if ever needed before purchasing those HIGH PRICED similar items that don&#x27;t clean your skin and cleaner than this on does.</li>
            <li> I had a similar one several years ago...but am more satisfied with item...works very well..</li>
            <li> Based on what I have seen, I am sure it will work great on facial skin where more care is needed but it does not provide a deep enough scrub for other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> This cleansing system exfoliates your skin in the most gentle way possible and gives you a super supple, clear and glowing face, it feels so fresh after usage.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is my first cleansing system and I have to say I feel the clean.  </li>
            <li> The first night I used it, my skin felt so soft and clean,  cleaner than it had ever felt.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin clean and soft, has cleared up my blackheads pretty well on my nose and in the corners of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The pores on my nose are very clean now-an extraction at a facial resulted in -</li>
            <li> Needless to say this brush is gonna be gifted to a ton of my friends and family this xmas!!!</li>
            <li> Though the overall process is much more comfortable and enjoyable and the massage factor seems to bring color to my face which is always a plus when you&#x27;re as pale as</li>
            <li> My pores have become so small, my face feels clean, my black heads are literally almost gone and my skin is even and so bright!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this little Machine it makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product but was hoping the brush would be a little harder .  </li>
            <li> Since it is much cheaper than other similar products, it is really a good deal!</li>
            <li> Long story short, I like my skin more and more everytime</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came as advertised with all necessary tools for the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;&amp; I loved it instantly.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day, every other day with my own face soap.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say its perfect.</li>
            <li> I had extremely flaky skin, no matter what kind of soap i used, nothing helped.</li>
            <li> I have fairly good skin (no acne, for example), but the Pro-X has made my complexion much brighter and my pores have gotten a little bit</li>
            <li> Just hold the device with your non-dominant hand at the top of the device (the top part near where the brush head is attached,) and put your dominant hand on the bottom part where you see the separation is, and just pull down.</li>
            <li> I love that this cleaning brush is softer and not stiff, as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I only use this a couple of times a week, but I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in how smooth my skin is, particularly on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Works good if you feel you need get an extra clean for your face using either your own exfoliate wash or the one provided in the package, just be careful you might get a little extra drying on your face, so just make sure you have lotion for your face.</li>
            <li> It makes blemishes heal and disappear quickly, and does prevent new ones from coming.</li>
            <li> This definitely beats a washcloth and it clears you up right quick!</li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle on your face; it feels like feathers on your skin, especially gentle on the sensitive skin around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Its not too rough and easy to clean....</li>
            <li> Kept my skin clear and clean while I was deployed to the sandbox.</li>
            <li> Previously, I wouldn&#x27;t even thoroughly clean my face every day(gross, I know), so I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a factor when considering the efficacy of the Olay cleansing system.</li>
            <li> It worked great; I am currently in Afghanistan with the military and used this every day.</li>
            <li> bought for my 12years old daughter and she loves it, she uses it everyday and it works and is great quality</li>
            <li> if your looking for something to clean your face with this is not it you can find a better cleaning system for less on amazon</li>
            <li> my skn is clean and clear.</li>
            <li> My face is clean and clear.</li>
            <li> Angling the device allows the bristles to clean more and damage less on the skin, or drying out sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it with a cream cleanser like clean and clear or neutrogena.</li>
            <li> It really makes my face soft and enjoy washing my face every night.</li>
            <li> I then used the pro-x machine with my own cleanser, which produced better results, but not great.</li>
            <li> For the cheap price this product really does the work of something nearly 10 times the cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how this simple gadget helped clear up my face.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try it with my clean and clear and</li>
            <li> I have used tons of exfoliates before and have owned the neutrogena brush and clean and clear ones</li>
            <li> It really helps clear up black head and feels your skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> It gets my face so clean and so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin was super soft and the next day my acne was noticeably better.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean after each use.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how clean it gets my face.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so clean and soft</li>

            <li> face has never felt so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> The brush is too soft and doesn&#x27;t even clean.  </li>
            <li> It does help clean my face and it feels really soft after</li>
            <li> I feel so clean and soft after washing my face with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a beauty expert but this does not seem to clean my face as well as a soft washcloth.  </li>
            <li> My face it soft and clean as ever.</li>
            <li> My face feels and looks so soft and clean when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> She now uses it and is also pleased with how soft her 54 year old skin feels.  </li>
            <li> Quiet motor and a nice soft brush.</li>
            <li> It really cleans my skin and makes it look better overall.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t try the sonic one, but the performance of this is good enough for your daily cleaning.</li>
            <li> For the price and what it does, I think it&#x27;s a good product, but I haven&#x27;t compared it to the more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to another reviewer (whose directions I printed out), I would have never been able to open battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> It definitely gets all my makeup off and has my skin feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> The person I gave this as a gift to absolutely loved it and told me how much smoother her skin was after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> Too much abrasion irritates the skin and actually incites more blemishes.</li>
            <li> it is a tiny tube only good for about 2 weeks use depending on how often you use it.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m still loving this facial brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does any more exfoliating than a regular washcloth, or a face scrub (without the brush) really.</li>
            <li> The ingredients and preservatives in the cheap products can irritate skin more or get trapped in your pores.</li>
            <li> The ingredients and preservatives in the cheap products can irritate skin more or get trapped in your pores.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that the Olay brush was really doing a lot, until I put it away for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> Really takes off makeup better than regular washing.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt and looked so good after only one use that I didn&#x27;t even wear makeup the next day!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 months straight without skipping a day (ok, maybe once or twice, but it&#x27;s now become part of my daily shower routine).</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t completely knock it because maybe some people just have better results, but it doesn&#x27;t nearly compare to the Clarisonic whatsoever in my opinion if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Feel like it really gets deep into your pores and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I love the Pro-X cleansing system because it really gets into my pores, I only use the cream that comes with it a couple times.</li>
            <li> is pretty fair still, not sure.</li>
            <li> I tried the expensive one from a friend and loved it better</li>
            <li> and I like it so much that I went back and bought some more.</li>
            <li> It was smaller, lighter and more gentle than the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I had expected the motor to be more powerful - it isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> , my opinion of this product is that it is a good alternative to the more expensive Clarisonic brand.  </li>
            <li> After almost 4 months of use I can honestly say my blackheads that reoccur in the same parts of my face since I was oh around 15 yrs old, (I&#x27;m 36 now), are diminished.  </li>
            <li> Really good alternative to more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it really gets deep into my pores and make my skin glow.</li>
            <li> It takes all of my makeup off, it exfoliates my skin gently, and cleanses deeply enough that my skin has a lovely glow and no blemishes.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and firm after and I am enjoying the product.  </li>
            <li> It really cleans your face better than just using a facial scrub.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It came in a set, with a small trial size bottle of the cleaner as well which was nice, because the full bottle is a bit pricey</li>
            <li> I would recommend using the faster speed only a couple days a week and use the lower speed mostly because I imagine it could really irritate your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really DIDN&#x27;T have to pay $100 or more for this type of facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> She still occasionally tells me how much she has enjoyed having it.</li>
            <li> Its fast enough for most peoples faces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works really well , gives a deep cleaning I love the way my face feels when I use it</li>
            <li> She told me, that the reason she wanted one was because she tried one of the more expensive ones from a department store that a friend of hers had purchased, and she loved how her face felt after using it.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d use one of these facial cleaning systems and didn&#x27;t really think I needed one, but I&#x27;m really glad I took a chance on this one.  </li>
            <li> After growing up with seemingly spontaneous acne and oily skin, I finally decided to invest in my face health as an adult.</li>
            <li> this so far is really nice and way cheaper than at the local store.</li>
            <li> I bought it because the reviews were as good as the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li> I had to have my husband do that because it requires a certain force (probably just for the first time).  </li>
            <li> The head doesn&#x27;t spin exactly centered so as you move the brush around your face, you have to do it in a certain direction.</li>
            <li> Great price, almost 15.00 less than major chain store.</li>
            <li> After looking at what purpose it serves and all the positive reviews that came along with it, I figured it may be a good exfoliator to try with my regular daily wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; 1.remove makeup with makeup removing cleanser dry face 2. add exfoliant to the brush dampen brush with warm water run along face on high setting 3.</li>
            <li> At first glance this scrubber doesn&#x27;t seem to spin so fast or seem so powerful, but it turns out it&#x27;s fast enough and a fairly strong, reliable motor.  </li>
            <li> This is very gentle on your face and cleans it very well.</li>
            <li> It works really well and very gently.  </li>
            <li> Less is More!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a deeper clean!</li>
            <li> So I definitely recommend this every night for a truly clean face!</li>
            <li> like deep clean!  </li>
            <li> I have tried a large range of facial cleansing brushes (low end to high end) and the Olay Pro-X is definitely the best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> so it makes me enjoy the whole process a little better.</li>
            <li> wish it would spin a little more aggressively but most people would like it esp if they have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also don’t feel like I am getting a deep down clean as I thought I would, but it does give a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I was taken in by all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try...</li>
            <li> I read some of the positive reviews for this product</li>
            <li> I feel like I was snowed by all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I ended up finding the Olay Pro-X Cleansing system and all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, on the positive.</li>
            <li> and I hope to do a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I saw immediate positive results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive that this helps get circulation going in the face as you will see the flush you get after it&#x27;s use, also known as the glow.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After seeing all the positive reviews here on Amazon, I thought I would try the Olay.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews about the Olay and got a positive recommendation from my daughter-in-law</li>
            <li> and  I just don&#x27;t see any positive difference</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-twenties though, and I didn&#x27;t notice any positive change.</li>
            <li> but I look at this positively;</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t see much of an improvement in my skin more than my typical use of an exfoliating wash alone, and while I don&#x27;t yet have anything to which I can compare it, it seems to be low quality.  </li>
            <li> I did have my face break out a little bit more, but it felt so clean.</li>
            <li> Your fingers and hands are not going to be able to clean inside little indentations inside your skin, which is wear oil, dirt, and makeup</li>
            <li> I wish it could have been a little more abrasive to clean my skin and clean it a little bit better.</li>
            <li> While I am unfamiliar with the exact features of the other more expensive brands, this is perfect for what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> My acne scars are becoming lighter and smaller.</li>
            <li> At 56, zits and clogged pores that just dodn&#x27;t want to go away are pretty much on the mend.  </li>
            <li> The first use proved how much residue is removed with the cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than other clear-a-sonic type products and just as effective</li>
            <li> It would be nice if Olay included at least one refill brush in the original package.</li>
            <li> My skin is much cleaner and the pores are finer even after the first couple of times.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty reasonable purchase for those that do not want to pay for the prestige version of this product.  </li>
            <li> I am finding it pretty gentle, not too abrasive for my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have problematic skin, but I am interested in taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m combining this with other Olay ProX and Regenerist products, and I&#x27;m really happy with the entire package.</li>
            <li> .........the end piece is very slippery and at first this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Really leaves your skin very refreshed!</li>
            <li> My only real complaints about this are finding replacement heads at a reasonable cost and that they don&#x27;t give you more of the face wash.</li>
            <li> My breakouts are pretty much non existent now and my skin tone has evened out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and my face felt so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t ready to sink the cash into that without trying a face brush first.</li>
            <li> I love this product and look forward to long use.</li>
            <li> I had a beard and was having a hard time getting things nice and clean through the hair.</li>
            <li> I have also used it using other facial cleansers with great results too.  </li>
            <li> I used it 3-4 times a day for the first week, just because it was very calming and relaxing.</li>
            <li> , this is the first review I&#x27;ve been absolutely compelled to write.  </li>
            <li> I use it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li> What I like most is that it&#x27;s really useful in opening up your pores, cleaning deep, and ultimately providing the best prep for any facial product that your may want to reach deep into your pores such as acne medication, moisturizer, or wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time and I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was worried first that it would be too much but not at all.</li>
            <li> Really cleans, on my first use -</li>
            <li> Great product especially for its value compared to other costly products in the market.</li>
            <li> great for price, I can not believe some of the other ones they are selling for double or triple the price with no refills with it!  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just the first time that can be a real pain.  </li>
            <li> My goal is to maintain a healthy glow as long as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I had a couple of breakouts but it depends on how much pressure I put on it.</li>
            <li> Really made a difference in my skin the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much waterproof so I can bring it into the shower with me during my morning routine.</li>
            <li> bought this a bit ago and I pretty much use all Olay products on my face.</li>
            <li> in fact my face didn&#x27;t feel like it was my face, my face has improved so much since I first started using it...</li>
            <li> I was very hesitate to buy this product at first.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I have ever bought and really like it.</li>
            <li> The way Olay describes the product you&#x27;d think a lab full of rocket scientists developed</li>
            <li> I have good clear skin, but at 62 I have had endless problems with flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty small and did not last long nor does it smell good or taste good if you get it in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I usually had good skin</li>
            <li> Throughout the past year I have LOVED this brush.</li>
            <li> Well, I am not sure what it is suppose to do, so I can&#x27;t give it anything but good.</li>
            <li> The tube sample you get in the box is extremely small, so it&#x27;s good that you can use it with any product you want.  </li>
            <li> the way, the tube of exfoliating stuff they give you is tiny, it looks bigger on the picture on the box than it really is, so don&#x27;t be fooled like I was expecting a good sized tube.</li>
            <li> I am really not sure how a good a job this does</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned both and this one is just as good, but at a small fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> Can b use to remove makeup, good for lazy ppl like me</li>
            <li> The jell inside is too small but the machine is good.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they have improved the product, or if it was just good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been keeping my eye on these types of products for the past year, waiting for a good chance (or rather, price) to try out one.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend the book for anyone who wants a little more info on easy, inventive natural beauty alternatives that will work wonders!</li>
            <li> this product can start winging some high velocity rogue droplets right into your eyeball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You face really felts soft and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> The Pro-X makes my skin super smooth and not only that, but I feel it deeply cleanses my skin, which is great, because dead skin is another contributor to pimples.</li>
            <li> I used the brush for a few weeks and did not feel like it gave me a better clean than using my hands.  </li>
            <li> so I grabbed an exfoliater from Clean and Clear that has worked really well with this!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily at night and it makes my face feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother with a bit less number of blackheads - but not so much less that I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s brush is an amazing deal and allows me to get my face clean without the negative vibrating annoyance.</li>
            <li> it is soft and clean my face gentle.</li>
            <li> it felt so fresh &amp; clean got all my daily makeup off.</li>
            <li> It really gets the skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer, more vibrant and the only change has been to add this to my regimen.</li>
            <li> Super happy with this purchase, it has two speeds, the brush rotates fast and cleans well but still gentle enough with the skin, I think this is something you can use everyday as part of your cleansing routine</li>
            <li> Be sure to also check for buildup of soap in the brush if you want the brush to last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the more expensive brands, but for the cheap price this is very worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of cringing at the idea of gradually tearing my face up with the abrasive cleanser and the brush.. not a pretty picture!</li>
            <li> The brush didn&#x27;t seem to lock in place very securely but it didn&#x27;t wobble or come loose with use.  </li>
            <li> Putting the brush onto the unit did not give a confident click or lock, so I repeated the action several times just to make sure it was actually in right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> low and medium-low  its gently and soft, batteries have been good so far</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to how well it will take care of my adult onset acne, but I don&#x27;t see that it will do any harm since it does such a great job of deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> It feels great, isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (and I have used it with several different cleansers so it doesn&#x27;t just work with the one it comes with), and my breakouts have reduced for sure.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing Brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Neither is the amount of scrubbing too much for my very sensitive skin and in fact, it really does not scrub so much as just gently clean.  </li>
            <li> Quite light and small, quite soft bush head, and I can feel my skin is more smoothy after using it~!</li>
            <li> had I spent more on the other type that is popular.  </li>
            <li> Works great and is very comparable to more expensive versions!</li>
            <li> Forked out just a little over 20 bucks &amp; LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Other brushes are too big, but this is a perfect smaller size!</li>
            <li> This item does scrub my face and give me the new fresh skin that I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult (mid-30s) with very acne-prone skin, so my experience might not be relevant for people with different skin issues who want or need a more aggressive scrubbing action.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this more than once a day because it tends to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels super soft after each time I use it.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a much higher quality product in look and feel, is available in different colors and patterns, and there are no replaceable batteries.</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft after using this.</li>
            <li> If you are not using it for make-up removal, the head would probably last longer and will definitely stay more clean.  </li>
            <li> In trying to stop the irritation, redness, dry patches and flaking, I was using too many products, and my skin was reacting to all these things.  </li>
            <li> The battery compartment is easy to work also the instructions are on the box and way simple it says wiggle and pull</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like (and this is easily remedied) is their included cleanser.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like (and this is easily remedied) is their included cleanser.</li>
            <li> The brush is super soft</li>
            <li> I find that I&#x27;m able to use the product once a day, and my skin doesn&#x27;t really dry out (although I always apply a moisturizer anyway).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to take apart and put back together.</li>
            <li> I had bought one for myself previously and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I have to say its been 2 weeks and my nose and chin ae clearing up fit the first time in my entire life!</li>
            <li> Exfoliating cleaners seem to just dry my skin even more.  </li>
            <li> Seriously one of the best facial cleansing system I have ever purchased, and I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to buy the clarasonic one now</li>
            <li> My face simply does not feel clean enough without it now :)  </li>
            <li> Had some problems with dry skin, much better now.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, my skin was dry and after use I could feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry skin and needed a bit firmer cleansing brush to do a better job of exfoliating my skin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not a fan of super duper scrubbing action</li>
            <li> However, if you need really, super soft bristles, this isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed b/c everyone has been hooting and hollering about what a great buy this is.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on this head are super soft.</li>
            <li> I bought Prosonic from groupon for $60 previously and liked it.  </li>
            <li> But, the spinning brush comes off entirely too easily.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel super soft and gets almost all the pores.</li>
            <li> It is totally bang for the buck; easy to use, cleans and declogs the skin, so my skin feels fresher, brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and cleavage and my skin is all soft and absorb moisturizer quick.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a Clarisonic, but honestly, this was so much less money.</li>
            <li> has helped my face clear up greatly, plus no more peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;hope</li>
            <li> but my skin feels super soft.</li>
            <li> and my skin is super soft with no break outs at all.</li>
            <li> nothing fantastic and its pretty big.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would help with the occasional breakouts and to clean the pores a bit...but did not notice any difference after using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;Spend some extra money on something better.</li>
            <li> Here lately more dry than oily.</li>
            <li> Seems to deep clean better than a washcloth or a standard complexion brush.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel super soft.</li>
            <li> But when I used it with this for the first time, I really was amazed how much smoother it made my skin.</li>
            <li> This product has made me realize that washing your face with your hands is not good enough this product cleans away the excess dirt, pores and in my case (makeup) around my face and hairline i&#x27;ve noticed a great change in the way my face looks with and without makeup since using this..best investment!</li>
            <li> After the first use, my skin was SO smooth and shiny, it looked 10 years younger!  </li>
            <li> Make sure to wash the brush clean enough or it will make the opposite effect!</li>
            <li> /&gt;25 years old, prone to clogged pores and mild acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gradually clearing up again though and my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li> and I strongly recommend this product to everyone (especially teenagers struggling with acne).</li>
            <li> Using a washcloth alone doesn&#x27;t help especially since I use strong drying out products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that often just because its strong enough that I dont want to make my skin sore.</li>
            <li> I like that the battery seems to last and stays consistently strong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am a very disorganized person and wont be able to log my opinions for that long.</li>
            <li> I do strongly suggest that after washing and drying your face that you always use a moisturizer, even if it just a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at least a good first step</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pretty bummed, and I thought my NutraSonic was still dead, so I had to look for another cheaper but still effective replacement.</li>
            <li> I do strongly recommend that prior to each use the brush be sterilized to avoid transmitting bacteria to your face and pores.</li>
            <li> This seems like it is built well, but it isn&#x27;t strong enough for my face to feel like it&#x27;s getting cleaned or exfoliated.</li>
            <li> The motor seems not that strong, however, it is very simple to use.</li>
            <li> bvut such a great price in comparison to the other brands!</li>
            <li> With such a great price I was worried it would work as well as the other&#x27;s out their!  </li>
            <li> The thing I don&#x27;t like is that I went to a certain store,</li>
            <li> Certainly you want to thoroughly remove your makeup, and a brush like this may help, but you have to remember that you&#x27;re going to reuse that brush.</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with large pores.</li>
            <li> I have large pores.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the system, but my pores have remained large.  </li>
            <li> My pores were so large that I began using a brush and foundation to fill them in.  </li>
            <li> I have large pores &amp; along with using pore minimizing products my face is feeling firmer &amp; the results are already noticable to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 and still suffer from acne and large pores.</li>
            <li> Well, it certainly did that.</li>
            <li> I also get flaky skin in certain areas.  </li>
            <li> I have the T-zone problem with large pores</li>
            <li> but it certainly can&#x27;t hurt to use it.</li>
            <li> I have large pores</li>
            <li> My budget doesn&#x27;t allow for an expense quite as large as that product</li>
            <li> large tube is about .1oz.</li>
            <li> At $20 for this product, I certainly cannot complain.</li>
            <li> And certainly could not complain about the price.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin smooth and clean, does wonders on blackheads and other debris.</li>
            <li> product works as advertised but be careful not to over use, can easily cause dry skin problems, would be great if Olay included some type of instructions as to Novato properly use.</li>
            <li> Because the Clairsonic was just very powerful, you felt like your face was getting a better cleaning, but battery went dead just out of warranty and it was pricey!</li>
            <li> and brand new in the box!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s new regimen!!</li>
            <li> She reports that is gentle on her skin (a plus due to her age) and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I sorta braced myself to use it for the first time, but it actually feels like a wonderful little facial massage.      </li>
            <li> My skin is softer and more clear after 2 weeks of using it pretty regularly.</li>
            <li> I use the low setting on my cheeks and they are the most sensitive and the higher setting on my forehead, nose and chin.</li>
            <li> I suggest buying the two pack of extra brushes as I did because my daughter and family use and love my new Pro-X.</li>
            <li> dead skin cells feed the good bacteria that NEEDS to live on your face.&lt;br /&gt;if</li>
            <li> It does leave your face a bit dry afterward, but if you use your moisturizer immediately after, it really sinks into your skin well and feels great.</li>
            <li> If your skin is super-sensitive, this might overdo it, so go easy and maybe use a different exfoliating product or just a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> Had problems with ingrown hairs for years---this really helped clear up my face and quickly.</li>
            <li> It does a great job rejuvenating my skin and making my dull skin look alive!</li>
            <li> Not only is it lightweight, portable and easy to store, the results from use is absolutely what a girl needs.  </li>
            <li> so far so good, within a week i have notice my skin looks healthier and i&#x27;m  also wearing less makeup.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - clear face - soft face- work with AA battery-</li>
            <li> product cleans much better than I thought it would, the brush is very soft but there are 2 speed settings so it depends on how deep you want to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (see my review) , which is, in my opinion, a better product, but not for the very young just learning how to properly care for their face as it would be too abrasive.</li>
            <li> Super smooth, not too rough, I really like the way it scrubs my skin.</li>
            <li> My Complexion is even and I&#x27;m starting to see the fine line DISAPPEAR.</li>
            <li> I have not used the much more expensive versions of this device but cannot imagaine how they could work any better!  </li>
            <li> After using this product, I saw results in my skin within the first week, especially after the second week; my skin was more radiant, clear, and free from pimples.</li>
            <li> I only used the cleanser that came w/ it once, it was fine.</li>
            <li> I put it back together and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t turn out fine then I&#x27;de just save up for the Clarisonic Mia for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off, I originally purchased a Pro-X at my local Walmart but then returned it after seeing the price of this one on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I think it worked fine, and I did end up looking better because of it, but there are other brushes on amazon, one of which I tried that is about $12 by Pixnor, that does the same exact thing, and</li>
            <li> After my very first use, my skin was incredibly soft and felt so much cleaner than it did just using a washcloth.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s water proof, but so far it is! :o)</li>
            <li> What had been some peeling/flaking turned into what I imagined to be a fine web of damaged looking skin that peeled and flaked constantly.</li>
            <li> It will work fine for you if you are just looking for a simple face cleanser.  </li>
            <li> My pours are smaller and my skin has such a better clarity!  </li>
            <li> I considered botox, since I have fine wrinkles on my forehead that people occasionally point out: &amp;#34;Stop wrinkling your forehead!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have to say that was my first time with that particular machine.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty decent skin to begin with...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think the brush and power are strong enough to do much to my skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, feels nice, although messy to use, thus I use it only in the shower.</li>
            <li> All in all, I think this is a pretty decent affordable version of the Clarisonic-type electronic cleansers.  </li>
            <li> but they are hesitant to buy because they think it&#x27;s for older women!</li>
            <li> I think for $21 it does a pretty decent job.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty decent.  </li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, outbreak-prone skin and struggle with large pores and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I really do miss the large pad for exfoliating the body and the scalp attachment.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and large pores.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed that I had really stubborn clogged pores in certain areas of my face that just would NOT go away no matter what I did.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with large pores.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li> This little gadget is amazing.</li>
            <li> This little cleanser system is amazing, nothing I was doing was getting rid of the blackheads, and mini pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size: a little shorter than my hand and just a bit wider than the width of two fingers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the $18 unit that isnt quite as nice, but has a little firmer brush head to do what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The cleanser that comes with it is nice as well with little microbeads.</li>
            <li> Nothing really serious, after a couple days without use, my skin returned to its normal dysfunction, lol.</li>
            <li> Even on the first day I could feel the deep clean happening.</li>
            <li> I like it for the small, portable size (which you can take with you easily for travel purposes) and easy to hold in hand in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my pores, my skin looked smoother cleaner and just plain better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products where I was able to use less of the product and get more exfoliation because this one contains less \\&quot;grit\\&quot; but again my skin can handle more grit whereas others who are more sensitive to abrasion will find this cleanser to be just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are interested in this type of product, I&#x27;d highly recommend saving up and buying the Clarisonic...</li>
            <li> Perhaps my expectations were too high for this product(especially at this price), but now I&#x27;ll be saving up to buy the real thing!</li>
            <li> This is a better system than the larger and more high powered cleansers, because you really don&#x27;t need to scrub so hard to gt the face clean.</li>
            <li> I like that this is more like microdermabrasion, as opposed to the exfoliators with large rough grains.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and the brush head lasted as expected for normal use.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little more powerful.</li>
            <li> and I wish it was a little more powerful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived so long without using this tool to clean my face!</li>
            <li> For me, I would prefer something a little more powerful.  </li>
            <li> would have given it 5 stars, but I had to pull back one, just for the sake of drawing a little attention to the review and to explain people that it is a great product, but might not be for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does it&#x27;s job to clean more thoroughly than the past routine.</li>
            <li> The design is good and the bristles aren&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li> Feels good without being hard on the wallet.</li>
            <li> Loved this so much I ordered a second for my son.his skin very dry and this has helped his complexion.</li>
            <li> OKAY, I DID FIND IT A LITTLE ROUGH, BUT TO BE HONEST</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and gentle, even with a little pressure, it just feels good.</li>
            <li> All the little flakes get brushed away and its nice to have a scale free surface to apply my makeup to.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush and am so glad I finally bought it.</li>
            <li> It was super cheap compared to the other one everyone raves about, I&#x27;m not about to spend $100 on a face brush when this one is working quite well for me.</li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s super cheap compared to other ones out there like this.</li>
            <li> There is a fair amount of heft to it and, in my opinion, the device is well-built and perfectly capable of surviving a tumble onto a hard shower floor.</li>
            <li> It was a very good price to deliver a similar effect that the expensive one does, and the reviews on Amazon pointing out the pros and cons are quite accurate.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I might consider spending the $$ for the big competitor at some point in the future, and the main reason for that is this product rotates, so it&#x27;s basically pulling your skin (don&#x27;t use it in eye area!).</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the overwhelming positive reviews from other customers.</li>
            <li> I was really torn between this and the Clarisonic, given the Clarisonic appears to be very sturdy and waterproof (this is water resistant), but this is just SOOO much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It was mentioned as being a good, cheap alternative to expensive salon treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well, has 2 different speeds and makes your feel so smooth when adding an exfoliator scrub to the brush.</li>
            <li> I also think the rotating action is not so great around the delicate skin areas.  </li>
            <li> It does work to scrub your face, but not enough to make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> My short hair gets caught in the spinning brush - HUGE concern for longer hair.</li>
            <li> I replaced the broken model with this one by Olay because it was reasonably priced and received great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Well, I definitely see a huge progress.</li>
            <li> I actually use this everyday and it leaves my skin looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li> I nice and affordable option to the more expensive alternatives.  </li>
            <li> This being only $20, and having amazing reviews (especially being compared to Clarisonics)</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels great after only using it a few days.</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels great after only using it a few days.</li>
            <li> Used it for a week and did not notice much of a difference between the brush and just using my hands and an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the expensive brushes but this this thing is incredible.  </li>
            <li> I would say to anyone who wants to try one of these cleansing system without spending alot of money on clearsonic, go ahead and try the Pro X</li>
            <li> really cleans your pores well</li>
            <li> The brush is gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> I will say, my face has started breaking out more, but my dermatologist said that is to be expected as my akin adjusts.</li>
            <li> your skin will feel much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The price is much lower than supermarkets.</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> Skip the high price cleansing units and go Olay!</li>
            <li> now I know I really overdid it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> I really like the cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> However the brush works very well with any cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really really do like this product.</li>
            <li> that said, BE GENTLE and use it on Low.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely a steal.</li>
            <li> and I cannot get over how much my skin has improved just from using it for one week.</li>
            <li> Overall I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Believe me, I read all the pointers about \\&quot;gently rocking it from side to side\\&quot; and even watched videos of how to install batteries in this thing...</li>
            <li> Thanks so much, Olay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using the system for about three weeks and really like it.  </li>
            <li> They were very helpful</li>
            <li> It really opened my pores allowing my acne cream to really work.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a chick you might really like this thing.</li>
            <li> Olay is spinning and really cleans your face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the clearsonic, but couldnt rationalize paying that much $ on something that cleans your face.</li>
            <li> but I really, really like this.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very foamy</li>
            <li> This time of year though my skin is very tempermental anyway</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product...</li>
            <li> I was debating on getting a Clarisonic but was hesitant to spend that much money</li>
            <li> I like it because it really does help exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I really like Olay&#x27;s Pro-X cleanser.</li>
            <li> gently vibrates and its brush is softer and finer.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s texture is much smoother</li>
            <li> Very plastic.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t really know about any long-term info yet.</li>
            <li> I can use it in the shower and that it is fairly gentle.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face very well.</li>
            <li> I didnt care much for the cleaner it comes with.</li>
            <li> This also feels very abrasive.</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone who wants the clarisonic but doesn&#x27;t want to splurge.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin which I try to control with blotting paper and powders.  </li>
            <li> I really like using it in the AM -</li>
            <li> It has 2 speeds, but I honestly can&#x27;t really tell a difference with it.</li>
            <li> very coarse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this Olay \\&quot;scrubber\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and it has helped with my scarring so much.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;cleansing system\\&quot; did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very leery, though.</li>
            <li> This REALLY WORKED for me</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and it is working for us.  </li>
            <li> I do have to say though, the hand-held cleansing brush seems cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really missed it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cleansing device.  </li>
            <li> Since using the clarisonic my face is much clearer.  </li>
            <li> My aestichian has said that since the clarisonic uses sonic motion it is gentle on the skin while cleansing</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t beleive it&#x27;d help with wrinkles</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t conpare to the clairsonic, but it works really well.  </li>
            <li> My face seemed shiny and polished, but it was also irritated despite the seemingly gentle rotation of the brush.</li>
            <li> My skin is much cleaner looking, much smoother</li>
            <li> All this at a much lower price than much of the competition.</li>
            <li> I was ready to return this thing.    </li>
            <li> Save up for the real thing and get a Clarisonic - I wish I had.</li>
            <li> It makes shaving much easier, and the results of my face: much smoother.  </li>
            <li> Have replaced brush twice which I think is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Not a microdermabrasion, but that would be expecting too much from a 26 dollar thing.</li>
            <li> I really like Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Pore Scrub (but it doesn&#x27;t get sudsy either).</li>
            <li> Whereas with the Clarisonic, I really notice a difference in my skin after using it.  </li>
            <li> , you can really tell the difference in the way it cleans your face.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m 66, and after one wash with the Olay system, my skin was very chapped - even after using a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Just tear off the papery K-cup top, pull out the filter and wet coffee grounds and wash the plastic cup out.  </li>
            <li> Very disapointed in the cleansing cream</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than getting it in store, used a couple of times per week for about two weeks, face is now peeling all over thus stopped using for now.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist where i go to work wearing so much makeup.</li>
            <li> So using the Pro-X once a day is not too much when used with a gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> no need to spend that much money since I&#x27;m getting the results I want from the Olay.    </li>
            <li> I have only use it sporadically at this point and every time I do, my skin is smooth and not flaky or irritated for days.</li>
            <li> Extremely gentle</li>
            <li> but it really did.  </li>
            <li> and it cleans really well.</li>
            <li> and I think it doesn&#x27;t matter so much</li>
            <li> I tried force, I tried gentle tension.</li>
            <li> because I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> but I do it on purpose since I really want to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> and I just wasnt ready to invest that much money into it</li>
            <li> that works and doesn&#x27;t cost much, and replacement brush head is not expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to wash my face.  </li>
            <li> Had a Clarisonic that died after a year (and I didn&#x27;t really use that much).</li>
            <li> Face feels much cleaner after using this one than the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> It really shakes up the dirt.</li>
            <li> so haha</li>
            <li> This product really works on getting the dirt off my face.</li>
            <li> I could really feel the Clarisonic working well.  </li>
            <li> I may not be using this correctly because it really made my face break out...</li>
            <li> and since there isn&#x27;t much chance of that, the Pro-X is just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Olay Pro-X, I really do.</li>
            <li> I was so glad when the Olay Professional came out with such a reasonable price that I bought it immediatly.</li>
            <li> IT ALSO FEELS MUCH SOFTER.  </li>
            <li> Just buy it, it&#x27;s cheap enough and your going to like it.</li>
            <li> My sister really wanted it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I think that the power is not that much</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, too.</li>
            <li> I think that the power is not all that much</li>
            <li> and also not as much blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice that when you use a foam cleanser it dosnt work as much - just a tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and just feel that it makes my skin feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really explain it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It really does do what they say</li>
            <li> and I feel like it has really made a difference in the texture and cleanliness of my skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It seemed to take forever to cover my whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I have had combination skin my whole life.  </li>
            <li> But after a month or so, I really notice a difference in the brightness and tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li> then I REALLY dont recommend getting this product.</li>
            <li> and now i have about 5 scratches on my face and its burning intensely.</li>
            <li> Just save your money over time and get the real deal.    </li>
            <li> 30 bucks for refills, haha</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really convenient to use in the shower while I let my conditioner set.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t imagine the $100 or $200</li>
            <li> I have not noticed much of an improvement in my wife&#x27;s skin, but she enjoys the product and that is what this rating is based upon.</li>
            <li> I bought is thanks to ksprite&#x27;s review on here.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it is really getting cleaned.  </li>
            <li> As I have not used the Sonic, I can&#x27;t compare, but the Pro-X brush and cleanser work very well for me.</li>
            <li> , that works very well at either of the two speeds and replacement heads are sold separately and under $10 for 2.  </li>
            <li> No gimmicks here,It has improved the texture of my skin and really cleans it, shipping was fast as well(:</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to,</li>
            <li> Really like this product, I use it once a day in the shower (completely waterproof) and my skin has a noticeably better texture with smaller pores!</li>
            <li> It exfoliates very well and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you really want to try it out, I say go for it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start out expecting much from the Olay device.</li>
            <li> This product has a gentle spinning brush.  </li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely incredible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is a real pain to find a product that will exfoliate without causing irritation.</li>
            <li> Really see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t figure out what they are doing with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle on your face and</li>
            <li> The Pretika brush is MUCH rougher on your face.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a couple of weeks and have not noticed much difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It really just speeds up the process.</li>
            <li> And what I thought was a hopeless case is now a glowing, supple, clear and fresh face.</li>
            <li> Just pop the brush in, install the included batteries, and it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect it would clear up my skin but after suffering for more than 15 years with recurrent acne, I finally seem to have it under control.  </li>
            <li> makeup goes on looking so much nicer.</li>
            <li> In just one week of using it, I can see an absolute difference in my skin clarity.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to save some $$ and get all the benefits of a thorough cleansing system.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li> I really think the brush helps.</li>
            <li> The scrubbing soap tends to be to much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I encourage anyone who wants a cleansing brush to try this product.  </li>
            <li> It really gets in there and cleanses pores.</li>
            <li> Really helps exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li> I came across this item and along with the $3 coupon the purchase was reasonable.</li>
            <li> and my face feels so much cleaner &amp; smoother.</li>
            <li> This has worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li> This is a very versatile way to cleanse your skin.  </li>
            <li> I only used it lightly and for 60 seconds at a time.  </li>
            <li> Amazon really cares about their customers.  </li>
            <li> Thanks and hopes this helps.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t really need it for wrinkles</li>
            <li> both she and my son say their face feels much cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if this will last, but it seems to be working great since December on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know that I would pay THAT much for it.</li>
            <li> and it seemed like a fast spinning brush would hurt.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin much smoother</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> Wash clothes are too rough and cause even more damage and irritation.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks much cleaner, softer, radiant.</li>
            <li> This really cleans my face well</li>
            <li> and I have much fewer breakouts on my chin.  </li>
            <li> I find it very soothing.</li>
            <li> The brush is really soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That went away fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve saved so much</li>
            <li> I think my husband wants one now.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> --Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> But this Olay brush has made my skin much smoother and gets all the remaining makeup off my skin (after i use a makeup remover towelette).</li>
            <li> The exfoliating cleanser included in the package works very well</li>
            <li> This thingy really does a god job at cleaning out pores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this over spending the money on the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> thank u so much</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy!&lt;br /&gt;(sorry</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and it has not broken yet regardless or the amount of water running.</li>
            <li> I figured I needed a spin brush to really get in there</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has been wanting a cleansing system like this but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on it, so if your sentiments are like hers, then this product is for</li>
            <li> but what I can tell you is that my wife absolutely loves this face cleaning gizmo and the cleanser that goes with it.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the packaging protects the item purchased .</li>
            <li> Works very well in getting make up off and cleaning face.  </li>
            <li> Get one, and they&#x27;ll send you some the gentle abrasive cleanser to use with it.</li>
            <li> It really helps your face to feel revitalized.  </li>
            <li> Makes your face seem so much cleaner than just washing.</li>
            <li> It really works and removed all my makeup gently.</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> This definitely does the job but in no way leaves the smooth and silky feeling like the Clarisonic does.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> Have use it for 3 days and it cleans my skin very well.</li>
            <li> It cleans face very well...</li>
            <li> I like it and highly recommend his product!</li>
            <li> Nothing really happened, but I could somehow feel my skin was at the verge of a breakout.  </li>
            <li> and I really did not use it.</li>
            <li> I recommend highly!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> My face has become much softer and fairer after using pro-x.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this to everyone because you have no idea how much gunk is in your skin unless you wash it out and pro-x helps you with that.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It evens my skin tone, my skin feels much softer and cleaner.</li>
            <li> My face felt so much smoother and cleaner</li>
            <li> , I cannot believe that I was just using my hands my whole life.</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to how the clarisonic operates, as I have never used one, but this is a much cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> However the cleansing cream it comes with smells really funky to me</li>
            <li> Not that much of a problem</li>
            <li> And it cleans my face very well.</li>
            <li> this product can really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> your budget can afford a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; tool, you may want to consider going for that instead because you can get much \\&quot;deeper\\</li>
            <li> your budget can afford a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; tool, you may want to consider going for that instead because you can get much \\&quot;deeper\\&quot; cleaning.</li>
            <li> I find that it exfoliates really well and leaves my skin feeling, and looking, radiant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks, olay</li>
            <li> I have taken mine in the shower and its very waterproof.</li>
            <li> Really cleans your face and helps whatever cleanser, moisturizer, or</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to spend too much time on your face with it.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleaning system --</li>
            <li> I have been using the sample of the Olay cleanser and really like that too.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It does take away make up without to much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot more from this product.</li>
            <li> Opening it was a bit of a trial, but thanks to youtube, is easily accomplished without breaking it.</li>
            <li> Really helps exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li> This is a well built brush and it works very well</li>
            <li> Also product slips in between bristles &amp; doesn&#x27;t scrub your face as much.</li>
            <li> has really kept my breakouts in check since I started using it.</li>
            <li> It really makes you feel freshened up after you wash</li>
            <li> and like it really washed your face.</li>
            <li> it is the ONLY thing that keeps my skin acne free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much happier with the results with that versus with the provided scrub.</li>
            <li> It really exfoliates the skin.</li>
            <li> Really cleans the pores of your skin.  </li>
            <li> After using this for over a year, I have noticed a difference in my skin - it is much softer.</li>
            <li> , really makes my skin feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to give one of these gadgets a try for some time, but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a go but didn&#x27;t think it would really do much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It got so much makeup off my skin that I didn&#x27;t even know was on there</li>
            <li> It exfoliates gently and evenly.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> I looked and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay 5 times as much for a vibrating face brush.</li>
            <li> brush has helped me soooooo much with controlling my blackheads.</li>
            <li> AND THIS COMBINATION REALLY</li>
            <li> This is so much better than expected.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do much to my skin but to my boyfriends.</li>
            <li> I really like this Olay Cleansing Brush ...</li>
            <li> It really leaves my skin feeling smoother after using.</li>
            <li> It really does scrub off all the gunk on your face and the cleanser that comes with</li>
            <li> The rotating brush was so gentle that I felt like I was massaging dirt and makeup into my face instead of scrubbing it off.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of really trying to like it, I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Within 1 week my face really started clearing up.</li>
            <li> My face is so much softer, way softer, and the hormonal break outs disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about the products I use, so</li>
            <li> I feel like it makes my face so much brighter &amp; smoother.</li>
            <li> FACE IS MUCH CLEARER SINCE I STARTED USING THIS.</li>
            <li> NOTHING MUCH ELSE TO SAY EXCEPT</li>
            <li> I really see no reason to buy the $100+ one.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I really feel like it does the job</li>
            <li> Really seems to keep my skin much cleaner and clearer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this 4 stars and not 5 as it didn&#x27;t come with any instructions stating how much application should be applied to the brush or face, setup, etc.</li>
            <li> then this is worth wild</li>
            <li> and my skin is much clearer now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt my face and is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> the product is very fragile.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also works very wellon your body too.  </li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> This pro really cleans my skin and exfoliates it really well too.  </li>
            <li> but that was too much for my skin to handle</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena oil free acne wash daily with the brush and once or twice a week, I&#x27;ll use the face cleanser that came with the brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;it can wash my face really clean!!now</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X cleanser has some exfoliating beads, but not too much since the system does some exfoliating as well.</li>
            <li> I cant tell much difference between the two speeds</li>
            <li> Plus you can do it in the shower making it very convenient.</li>
            <li> This really makes a difference to the smoothness of you</li>
            <li> As this product has been available for &amp;#62;3 years, it is only a question of when, not if, it will disappear from the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been BB cream and makeup free for a week  now since it finally cleared.</li>
            <li> but I wanted share my rave review all because I got results so fast</li>
            <li> have always been very strict with my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> If that is what your expectation is, then just spend the money in the real deal.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> once I&#x27;m done, and I followed the reviewers suggestion of not apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Despite others saying that it doesn&#x27;t really do anything, the point of it is to keep at it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this item.</li>
            <li> Very durable product.</li>
            <li> My face is much smoother.</li>
            <li> I like the brush for gentle non-abrasive cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Olay Pro-x  cleaning system for about 5 months now and really like it.  </li>
            <li> very quickly!&lt;br</li>
            <li> ProX is very efficient in cleaning up whatever my face wipes didn&#x27;t get off and</li>
            <li> Not as gentle as clarsonic but for the price</li>
            <li> She has oily skin and find this brush gets her face much cleaner than just washing it.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t seem like it would really do anything.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on the face and does the job well without irritation.</li>
            <li> I wanted a bit more deeper cleansing &amp; if you press harder it stops.</li>
            <li> Thanks Olay.</li>
            <li> I use an appropriately gentle touch to the skin so that I&#x27;m getting the tips buy not bending the bristles.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get any real skin problems anymore.</li>
            <li> Wearing makeup can feel really caked on and</li>
            <li> WORKS REALLY WELL</li>
            <li> Cleans so gentle.</li>
            <li> I still have three spare heads for it and it cleans very well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very convenient tool.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> It provides a much cleaner feeling that using hands alone.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, has two speed settings.</li>
            <li> I never tried a clarasonic, so I can&#x27;t compare the two, but I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel like it has really made a difference in the texture and cleanliness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a much easier time extracting my blackheads with a blackhead extractor thanks to Olay&#x27;s cleansing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would really recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> thanks olay for another affordable product</li>
            <li> One recommendation, batteries die fast</li>
            <li> The exfoliating cleanser included in the package works very well</li>
            <li> Gently rock the battery compartment side to side while pulling to release the battery cover.</li>
            <li> my face would feel much smoother than it does.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my Pro-X about 3 weeks ago from Costco (about $36 with the full-size cleanser), and it has really worked wonders on my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just really like using this cleaner.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend you buy this system!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but this brush removes it well.  </li>
            <li> In between, I use it with Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I can tell that it really cleans my face after use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and I have seen an improvement .</li>
            <li> My wife loves, works very well.</li>
            <li> Their customer service was really lacking.</li>
            <li> I grew to really like using the Pro-X during the 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> Refill brushes are much cheaper too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My face feels cleaner and softer and I really appreciated the face wash that was included in the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very grateful, it&#x27;s cleaning my face very well.</li>
            <li> Olay has two settings, a slower setting and a fast setting, but not so fast that you can&#x27;t detect movement of the bristles (like the Clarisonic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need to buy the whole Olay skin system</li>
            <li> Why is moving my hand with a washcloth so much effort when I exercise for an hour a day?</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think there was as much pulling.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It makes my face look so much brighter and feels so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> It is much softer and gentler than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle</li>
            <li> It is compact and battery operated; very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Fiddling with my skin isn&#x27;t really my thing; a drug-store cleanser and moisturizer</li>
            <li> It runs on two AA batteries and getting that organized was a challenge: you have to guess where the batteries go, and the directions say \\&quot;Gently rock the battery compartment side to side while pulling to release battery cover ...\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I decided to order this product because I heard so much about it from my co-workers and on blogs.  </li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really mind it</li>
            <li> not so much the cream you use.</li>
            <li> The whole box contained everything including the batteries.  </li>
            <li> I use it 4-5 times a week with a gentle face wash</li>
            <li> Got this for my g/f for christmas because she had a lot of cheapy face cleaner things to try and really exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> useful cleansing brush with soft bristles.</li>
            <li> My face became much cleaner after using it.</li>
            <li> think about those cheap simple machine (kids toy or mini fan) you can buy from street vendors or hardware store.</li>
            <li> It gets kind of oily in the summer and kind of dry in the winter but nothing serious.</li>
            <li> The brush has two speeds and does a very thorough job.</li>
            <li> This machine really delivered what it promises.</li>
            <li> I really do like the cleanser that it came with.</li>
            <li> Looking at it, I thought, \\&quot;Well, this isn&#x27;t going to be much, is it?\\&quot;   </li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES GET YOUR FACE AND PORES CLEANS FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE OF THE CLARISONIC.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both reasonable speeds and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> Friends recommended Clarisonic, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money.  </li>
            <li> This seemed to be a reasonable alternative.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This can&#x27;t really be compared to the Pretika because this one spins instead of vibrates.</li>
            <li> I doubt that it exfoliates much, if at all.</li>
            <li> I considered getting another Clarisonic, but really who wants to pay $200 for something to wash your face?  </li>
            <li> this system seems to really deliver.  </li>
            <li> The NutraSonic plugs into a regular outlet to charge up, not a battery powered brush like the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> have actually gone through two of these Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing Systems now</li>
            <li> which consisted of her turning on the brush and brushing my face with it gently (just the brush, no water or cleanser.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, back to Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> So, back to Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> Much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It is very well made.  </li>
            <li> but the humidity was too much for the inside of the machine.</li>
            <li> I do really, really like this system.</li>
            <li> Because my skin likes to medicate separately from my cleansers, I prefer Cetaphil or gentle, salicylic acid-free soaps.</li>
            <li> but he really likes it.</li>
            <li> My face has cleared up so fast and my blemishes have gone away.</li>
            <li> I really like the Olay brush.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not producting as much oil.  </li>
            <li> He really likes it and has helped a LOT with his skin.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li> a sponge or washcloth might not be able to, the con&#x27;s might be if it gets too wet</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter as an option instead of the Clarisonic, which she really was wanting.</li>
            <li> She was really wanting to use the foam scrub heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is much nicer to the skin, if anything it just feels like a gentle message.</li>
            <li> really cleans the face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was doing much.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I also really did not like the cleanser it came with.</li>
            <li> These products are so much cheaper from amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with batteries but butteries run out fast.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves the price on this item.</li>
            <li> the price in here is so much cheaper than in store price, not to mention their competitor.</li>
            <li> I found that it was too much for my skin every day</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t really ever have issues, period.</li>
            <li> No idea how much longer I have with them, but still.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- wipe face gently with cotton ball</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> , once it doesn&#x27;t deliver the sonic component what are you really getting... a rotating brush.</li>
            <li> and i really like it.  </li>
            <li> This cleansing brush is invigorating but gentle.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Another things is since I have really greasy skin</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> This cleansing system has given me back my smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I never been one for having much acne at all.</li>
            <li> The Pro-x works very well at cleasing my face.  </li>
            <li> It is very resonably priced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, and while it definitely is working I&#x27;m still not in the land of silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and didn&#x27;t have my hopes up very high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it matters as much what you use with the Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get acne very often</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much smoother and firmer after I use it</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to go without it.</li>
            <li> and this is gentle but invigorating</li>
            <li> But for my budget, and until I can spring for the pricier name-brand model, this absolutely satisfies me</li>
            <li> how well this works for how much it costs.</li>
            <li> It washed face gently and made my face smoother.</li>
            <li> I use it with the Neutrogena Oil Free Cleanser twice daily</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend the Olay Pro-X brush!</li>
            <li> Since everyone seems to be comparing it to the Clarsonic model that costs five times as much, I&#x27;ll weigh in.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a month..and dont see much difference in how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I have been using mine for three weeks now and really do see and feel a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Delivery through Amazon was fast...</li>
            <li> This should not be a problem if you gently press it against your skin and keep it moving around your face</li>
            <li> It looks much brighter and healthier too.</li>
            <li> That may have something to do with how much pressure I apply when using the system.  </li>
            <li> Around my chin not so much.</li>
            <li> Plus I wanted to use it in the shower without it feeling bulky and taking up too much space.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> have normal skin except for my t-zone, where it&#x27;s pretty oily.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper the Mio</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The scrubbing didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> Was very surprise of the result .</li>
            <li> It  really works.</li>
            <li> I really expected so much more based on all the 4 and 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> I was using the neutrogena grapefruit scrub and it did absolutely nothing for me</li>
            <li> I also periodically use the pro-x cleansing system with a gentle exfoliating lotion to eliminate flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> , you feel like you are really exfoliating with it.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels much cleaner and smoother than before when I was just hand-washing.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect because he can run it over his face and it does the dirty work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100 dollars, and I really didn&#x27;t want to shell out that much if it probably wouldn&#x27;t work for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product can over expose your skin if you use it to much.  </li>
            <li> So, I really do like that.  </li>
            <li> I just am very prone to breakouts and it seems to not help that.</li>
            <li> I really, really was looking forward to getting this.  </li>
            <li> Press it too much on your skin and it will stop spinning.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY do not waste your money on those brushes that cost over $100.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple of Tips: I used up the tube of cleaner that it came with really fast.</li>
            <li> The brush works better when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very inexpensive, and depending on how often you use it, it can do your skin wonders.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> , I was hesitant because its SO much cheaper than the clairsonic.  </li>
            <li> It is better than i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Instead of a rotating brush, the brush vibrates sending sonic waves (much like a sonicare) into your skin as you rotated it around your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to do with it now because who wants to use a used face-cleanser..</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was ready to head to Ulta to buy the Clarisonic for a lot of money when I came across this.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really seem to work.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend these for those looking to exfoliate and keeping their skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I would imagine it help keep skin looking youthful because it really exfoliates well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;cheers and thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Also, my makeup looks much smoother on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My daughter wants one.</li>
            <li> I wash with gentle products (Cetaphil type cleanser and Philosophy moisturizer).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this item.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune and it works really well.</li>
            <li> This is way too gentle.</li>
            <li> As a guy, that is probably an unusual thing to say.  </li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> It is gentle and helps with her taking care of her skin.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use as much</li>
            <li> I had a Clarisonic for years and was hoping this would be comparable at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I like that it smooths my skin and gets it ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product arrived as scheduled, packaging was really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I broke out so much.</li>
            <li> The Pro-X seemed like a lot of hoop-la for very merger cleansing experience.  </li>
            <li> bristles are much softer..</li>
            <li> it took off my makeup very well.</li>
            <li> It feels much cleaner than using a washcloth.</li>
            <li> and i really do see a difference.</li>
            <li> when I rolling on my face, it feels very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li> The massage feel is gentle but nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the gentle brush and the cleanser seemed to work well too.</li>
            <li> She really likes hers</li>
            <li> , I really like mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it so much.</li>
            <li> addition, the shipment has respected the time and it was fast,</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has really reduced any breakouts drastically.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> it really helps get all the make up off, even after soap and cleansers.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t going to pay that much.</li>
            <li> compared to some of the cleaning systems out there - this one is extremely reasonable.  </li>
            <li> You will be much happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for a couple of days now and my skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li> but that didn&#x27;t help much, and I had to resort to looking up a demonstration on YouTube before I had some idea how to get it done.  </li>
            <li> B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid</li>
            <li> combined with a gentle cleansing wash and used 3-4 times per week, I saw reduction of past acne scars within the first couple uses, and my skin has looked amazing ever since.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I suggest getting a gentle cleanser and a toner for added benefit.</li>
            <li> and i know its cleaning my skin really well</li>
            <li> but that was too much for my skin.</li>
            <li> but have been using this once daily, and already my face is smooth, glowing.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this every day and is convinced it has really improved her skin.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle</li>
            <li> I chose this product over the more expensive Clarisonic because I wasn&#x27;t sure that that one was worth the almost $200 price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find gentle ways to remove the peeling skin.</li>
            <li> My skin loves the gentle but thorough exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the whole \\&quot;cleaning with</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very lightweight product and as the product description says, there are 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> The free facial cleaner that came with the brush, does not impress me either.  </li>
            <li> I think it works really well.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and then every Sunday I exfoliate my skin with my 3 minute peel from Real Chemistry.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle and no harm your face.</li>
            <li> and i could really tell my face was 100x cleaner and softer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by this thing now.</li>
            <li> Between the brush, replacements, and my cleanser, toner, and benzoyl peroxide over the counter medicine, I&#x27;m STILL not paying as much as I did for just one month of the prescriptions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wish I had taken before pictures.</li>
            <li> so people don&#x27;t notice the imperfections as much.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s all thanks to this.sh, just</li>
            <li> I really wish I had taken before pictures.</li>
            <li> so people don&#x27;t notice the imperfections as much.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s all thanks to this.</li>
            <li> I think it would work on any type of skin if a person appreciates a gentle squeaking face and / or neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> You can really use this with any cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a whole week that I&#x27;ve gone without wearing foundation, and I owe it all to this</li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> All in all, it was cheap enough that I don&#x27;t mind having bought it.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this and don&#x27;t see much reason to spend so much money on the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I bought two for my daughters because I like mine so much.</li>
            <li> exfoliates and REALLY cleanses.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic Mia for some reason was very abrasive to my skin (and no I did not use an exfoliator with the brush, I used a gel).</li>
            <li> It cleans without having so much power that it hurts your skin.</li>
            <li> I just really wanted to brush.  </li>
            <li> Depends on you skin really</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the Pro X REALLY cleans my face...</li>
            <li> Still works very well.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin is much smoother now.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is gentle on the face as well as cleanses.</li>
            <li> It works very well and I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser test</li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay cleansing system and was using it at night with a very sparing amount of cleanser.</li>
            <li> use it about once a week, really cleans out your pours.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I think the cleanser really works and works well with brush</li>
            <li> but I wish it didnt cost so much.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t see an immediate difference, but over time I can see that my skin is smoother, and it always feels much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I  really like that this has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> It cleans gently, but thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This does not have a lot of power and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really doing anything beneficial to my face.</li>
            <li> It is just what I expected better price that the one in store</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for gentle cleansing, this is for you.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could try the Clarisonic to see if this really is a comparable product or not.  </li>
            <li> The brush is gentle and seems to gently exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> it is gentle and thorough.  </li>
            <li> It really claim what it does.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but I have difficulty keeping it in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position --</li>
            <li> afterward soaked in very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Although it has taken some getting used to, I find that I really like this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely ruined my skin</li>
            <li> A must have for sure--without having spend way too much money and</li>
            <li> And it really does what it promises.</li>
            <li> Also, the brush heads are 2 for $8 on Amazon, which is much cheaper than the $20 for 1 they charge at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Save your money, or really save your money for the cost of care.</li>
            <li> This produce is working very well.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wasn&#x27;t ready to fully invest $200 in the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> much.</li>
            <li> And she feels like her skin is much cleaner than just using her hands to wash her face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing some long-term results with this product.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a differance in my pores and my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I also really like that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> At first,I think it will not work well because the cleaning system is very simple.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> anyways it is so much cheaper than the clearsonic($100</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]] to open this machine so I can put the batteries in it!</li>
            <li> what it is, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Priced very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like Olay&#x27;s face wash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like doing reviews but decided to do so because I now read reviews BEFORE I order an item and have found it very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The discs that work with this product are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My face is absolutely glowing when I use it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> You really do get what you pay for</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t seem to be helping him that much, and costing us a lot of $$$.</li>
            <li> I tried again with a gentle creamy cleanser, no luck.</li>
            <li> I wanted a gentle cleansing system that would still do the job.</li>
            <li> and I can really FEEL the difference in my face</li>
            <li> It really had no effect whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t use much battery at all.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the surface area of the brush is smaller then the Claisonic, but it definitely cleans my face very well, and I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> check the quality and it is working very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have much power.  </li>
            <li> Really cleans your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product twice from Amazon because I like it so much.  </li>
            <li> We all know Olay is a fantastic company, so save yourself a ton by purchasing it here instead of at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have much of an exfoliating power to it and it didn&#x27;t suds up that well.</li>
            <li> Also, I really don&#x27;t notice a difference between the 2 settings, maybe mine was defective?</li>
            <li> I really like this system..</li>
            <li> I really wanted the clarisonic</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was in awe with how much makeup and impurities were off of my face after having used it for about 3 minutes (1 minute on each side of my face).</li>
            <li> Really helping her skin.</li>
            <li> For me, it really depends on what your skin type is and what you prefer.</li>
            <li> What I really wanted was a Clarisonic, but can&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li> This brush has helped so much.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the face and not abrasive.</li>
            <li> My mom even bought one and loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of my acne and it hasn&#x27;t helped too much with that in the month that I have had it</li>
            <li> The brush is gentle and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I was undecided between this product and the clarasonic but chose this one for the price and thought if I use it a lot or really like it</li>
            <li> , I look forward to using it and think I really notice a brighter, smoother complexion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite gentle as I use it on my face.  </li>
            <li> I tried to continue using it because I thought that the &amp;#34;toxins&amp;#34; under my skin might finally be breaking free, but I couldn&#x27;t continue using it because it never improved my complexion.</li>
            <li> The price is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> She loves makeup and reports that her primer and foundation go on much smoother after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for two weeks, seems it really works.</li>
            <li> I like it alot and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s my fault haha</li>
            <li> Really made a difference and cleared up my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH  </li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for a couple of days now and my skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> and she really likes it also.</li>
            <li> It really works for me and makes my skin softer than before.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> , however my pores still look like they are filled with dirt, especially on my nose.  </li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this product.  </li>
            <li> I cannot really conduct a scientific experiment here.  </li>
            <li> But, where I use it, my skin subjectively feels much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use as much moisturizer or foundation</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much, much gentler than using a washcloth on my face every day.</li>
            <li> It was a really reasonable price and fast shipping here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This really helped with blackheads</li>
            <li> my skin feels much smoother after I use this.</li>
            <li> This system removes so much dirt and oil, while massaging my skin.</li>
            <li> and I can really feel it cleaning.</li>
            <li> it can do whole body.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this cleans my face.</li>
            <li> Was a gift and really well received.</li>
            <li> well...check again and use the brush to really get into your pores</li>
            <li> WHILE I REALIZED THAT THE CLEARSONIC WAS REALLY</li>
            <li> The clarisonic used a sonic pulse much like the sonicare toothbrush .  </li>
            <li> I am 53, by the way, and need to work harder now on making my sun-damaged skin look better.</li>
            <li> She kept looking at the ones that cost over $100 at Dillard&#x27;s, and I just couldn&#x27;t afford to pay that much.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Clarisonic, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I do really like this</li>
            <li> I really cant believe anyone would compare the two.</li>
            <li> Otherwise save your money and get a gentle face scrubber and do it by hand.</li>
            <li> This cleans so well and yet the bristles are so gentle.  </li>
            <li> My face looks healthier and skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It really has made a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> The brush on this really doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even use much foundation.</li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s really not that many ways to get that gunk out of your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think, my face just looks much cleaner when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Really gets in there and cleans my face.</li>
            <li> Really like this,</li>
            <li> especially because, let&#x27;s face it, the price is cheap for this type of face</li>
            <li> I was not prepared to invest much money in another brush</li>
            <li> My face is much cleaner.</li>
            <li> i really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this faithfully twice per day since I received it (almost one month) and am overjoyed with how much my skin has improved.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped his face after he shaves.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in wrinkles and I still break out just as much.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be more</li>
            <li> It is thorough but gentle for my face.</li>
            <li> ; Haha.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid for it, I really can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Then when i felt how gentle it was, I thought &amp;#34;this can&#x27;t be doing anything&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li> The delivery was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I used it, my skin felt much cleaner than when I use my hands to wash my face.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for what it is.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel much cleaner and softer.</li>
            <li> Will recommend this product to friends and family, thank u so much.</li>
            <li> Gets make-up off, and moisturizers really seem to penetrate.</li>
            <li> the brush still spins just as fast as it did on day 1.</li>
            <li> Always leaves my face really</li>
            <li> The key to clear and healthy skin?</li>
            <li> Personally, just rubbing the soft brush with the power off across your face did a better job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in the hand, it has 2 speeds, and the brush feels just right-not too rough or too soft.</li>
            <li> The super soft rotating brush is way too wimpy to effectively remove dead skin cells or clean facial pores.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay Professional Pro-x Advanced cleasing system on Amazon.com after looking in retail stores and it was by far the cheepest.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but the rotating motion does a much better job of cleaning than just soap and a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I liked the CP because it came with a body brush, but then it occurred to me that I could just have an extra brush with the Pro-X that would serve basically the same purpose,</li>
            <li> It is not as nice as the Clarisonic but definitely does the job of deep cleaning her face.</li>
            <li> Good, but not for delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Regardless, just taking a regular washcloth and scrubbing my face with any old cleanser works better than this for cleaning AND exfoliating in one step.  </li>
            <li> Ok let me start by saying I am a 28 year old male and when this arrived at my doorstep</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old grand daughter to use because she has acne on her back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but either the brushes are too delicate that I don&#x27;t feel a thorough cleansing.</li>
            <li> This is NOT recommended if you actually want clear, problem free faces!</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft enough for all but perhaps the most sensitve.</li>
            <li> I am a 48 year old female; I take good care of my combination skin, exfoliate several times a week, use retinol products.</li>
            <li> Feels like I&#x27;m at least doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li> It may be that I&#x27;m in my &amp;#34;baby making&amp;#34; prime or the result of recently discovered food allergies, but either way I seemingly never had been able to maintain a clear complexion.</li>
            <li> last about a month each with daily use, and I just use my own St.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t use mine as often, I&#x27;m going on roughly six months on the same brush, and it&#x27;s still in good condition.</li>
            <li> My skin can absorb the products I use better, and the soft feeling I could only get twice a week</li>
            <li> Functional and effective in removing dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any of the more expensive brushes but honestly I find no need to.  </li>
            <li> Following up with my Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel Toner and Yes to Grapefruit Daily Scrub, my skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend using your own face wash because everyone has different skin types.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few years ago before it became wildly popular</li>
            <li> It feels good, though I have not honestly seen a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use my own cleanser for everyday use and their cleanser twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I tried many and so far Olay products have been the only product that is showing me results.  </li>
            <li> Never tried any of the more expensive kinds but it exfoliates my face and gives it a nice massage.</li>
            <li> I would go as far as saying this works as good as the more expensive alternatives.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a good product to try if you don&#x27;t want to spend near $100 on more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> If you are hoping this scrubber is as good as the professional ones then don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this for a week maybe a little more gentle but as it stands right now</li>
            <li> I think this could be good for those with dry skin as well, as the dead skin and gunk can be thoroughly cleansed away thereby creating no barrier to your moisturizer application, letting your skin drink it right up!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was looking for a brush that would clean without irritating and decided to try the Olay Prox and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> With more time, I will see if this acne-prevention is just pure coincidence or actually due to using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After using it just once, my skin feels tight, smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> I guess if you have super sensitive skin, this might work for you, but most people just have average skin.</li>
            <li> The Olay brush was just as effective, and less than a quarter of the price!</li>
            <li> Just because I rotate three toners, three cleansers, one exfoliator, three moisturizers and a night serum and use eye cream twice a day does NOT mean I have a problem!</li>
            <li> And it is SO SOFT!!!</li>
            <li> Makes your face soft!!!</li>
            <li> My pores are nice and clean now and have decreased in size by a large %.</li>
            <li> Its a very useful implement for getting deep into skin pores.</li>
            <li> I like that it is small and portable, makes it easy for travel and to fit into the bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> I went through the sample of exfoliator pretty quickly and use a Clinique facial cleanser with it and follow up with Clinique moisturizer</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use in the shower and at the sink, doesn&#x27;t make a mess</li>
            <li> I only use it two-three times a week due to my sensitive skin and it has made a great improvement on my complexion.</li>
            <li> I think it cleans just as well, but Clarisonic is really on to something with the other kind of brush action.</li>
            <li> , what this comes down to is, to me, is that it&#x27;s all just a trendy new beauty product.  </li>
            <li> This little thing makes my skin feel so smooth &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> It helped my face clear right up.</li>
            <li> but right now it&#x27;s as clear as it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> Cannot see the improvement clearly, even right after using.</li>
            <li> I also think it&#x27;s just the right amount of cleansing/exfoliating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin &amp; are not used to exfoliating, than this might be the right product for you.</li>
            <li> The brush&#x27; rotating action massages and cleans the face, right to its pores.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not very expensive to use.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees also makes great natural lotions that work well on sensitive, raw skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone, and seems gentle enough for the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the look of my skin when using the Pro-X, but it definitely gave me that deep clean feeling when I used it.</li>
            <li> Plus it takes too long and the head pops off easily.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much given how inexpensive it was, but I feel like it is doing what I want, which is to deep clean my face.</li>
            <li> The higher speed is gentle and not excessive for the task.</li>
            <li> I would say that the Pro-X is a good first step or alternative to more expensive facial cleansers since it worked well and in reasonably priced (believe me I did a tons of review research on cleansing systems before I purchased this one</li>
            <li> because it really does help when a product has the backing of so many other people.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice clear feeling even using other soaps..</li>
            <li> This is just as good as one of those more expensive products!</li>
            <li> Definitely a good value for your money compared with other similar systems (ie. Clarisonic),</li>
            <li> It works really well at cleaning my skin, much better than other scrubbers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> If you are wanting powerful and stiffer brush this is not for you HOWEVER for the money, it works fine for every few days of scrubbing your face.&lt;br /&gt;2 speeds, I just use the higher one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I looked at all the $200 facial brushes, and they were all too large for me to hold comfortably though I have a normal size 7 hand.  </li>
            <li> and although I can&#x27;t say how much of a difference I see (I&#x27;ve only used 2 times so far), what I can say is how soft and smooth my face is and the brush is super gentle.</li>
            <li> The only thing I was disappointed in was the strength/speed of the motor, but to be fair, I was hoping for something more like a sandblaster, where the Pro-X is more like a polisher.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t willing to give up my love of the occasional junk food and soft drinks in favour of veggies and water to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> It is very effective for cleaning behind my ears, and they have never been cleaner.</li>
            <li> It is very effective for cleaning behind my ears, and they have never been cleaner.</li>
            <li> I use my own facial cleanser, but the brush leaves my skin feeling remarkably soft, especially after the first usage.</li>
            <li> I also tried it with a gentle cleanser with no exfoliant and that too gave a deep clean.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted one of these thingy that claims to clean your skin very well and finally got this one from walmart.</li>
            <li> Really helps clean deep pores.</li>
            <li> It really seems like you get a deep clean after you&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Have had for a long time and still working fine and really helps complexion.  </li>
            <li> What I can say is this product works well, left my face super soft, less visible pores, and my face looks youthful &amp; clean. :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a decrease in the size of the pores on my nose, but it does help to keep them clean, and it has helped to restore the soft skin I had on my face 10 years ago when I was in my early 20s.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to replace with a new pad every single time I use it.</li>
            <li> It does make my face feel super clean and smooth, but I guess the creme is no good for someone like me.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $200 on the other brand when I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny because the bristles are quite soft and the speed it spins isn&#x27;t really that fast.  </li>
            <li> Love this, use it every other night</li>
            <li> Love this product - now looking at other Olay products.</li>
            <li> I have used it both with the original Olay pro X cleanser (included) and with my regular face washer</li>
            <li> I saw one in Sephora the other day and was able to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> I think I will be able to use this every other day with moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> The other Amazon reviews led me to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> That means is was getting to the skin under the surface layers better due to the Olay machine.  </li>
            <li> I originally tried the DDF Revolve 400X MicroPolishing System &amp; found my skin looking &amp; feeling the same before &amp; after.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried so many other products...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still using the original batteries with regular use.</li>
            <li> I think this would work better for other skin types.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product that will give out in due time...</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of money, you will have more in your purse if you purchase this cleaner to buy other things.  </li>
            <li> I also feel like my acne creams and moisturizers soak in so much better, like other reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> My skin was soft &amp; smooth, and it did have a \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, which can somewhat be attributed to the small sample of exfoliating scrub :)  </li>
            <li> Better thAn other brushes and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my face, mostly in the shower when the face has gotten a little steamed first, so</li>
            <li> Even anyone who has normal skin!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was amazed by how soft my skin was!</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and love it.</li>
            <li> The difference was significant enough for the touch of my fingers to notice.</li>
            <li> the price definitely makes it worth it!</li>
            <li> By the second use that evening I noticed a significant reduction in my pores.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any other benefits that others mention (like smoother make-up application or better skin absorbance of lotion), but I do believe that the others did experience those benefits.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t spend a hundred bucks on other brush cleanser devices.</li>
            <li> I do feel like my moisturizers work better due to the cleaning from the pro.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d read other reviews and many people said they had a problem with the batteries.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a product worth purchasing!</li>

            <li> I cannot imagine Clairsonic or any other cleansing systems doing a better job of cleaning than this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much more affordable than some other systems.  </li>
            <li> a look at the many reviews posted by other users.</li>
            <li> After two uses (Morning and night) I woke up the next day with a significant reduction in blackheads.</li>
            <li> I love washing my face now, it has never felt cleaner using any other cleansing method.</li>
            <li> at 57 I&#x27;ll take those compliments with a big smile!</li>
            <li> This product works a lot better than I expected!</li>
            <li> In fact I&#x27;d submit that most other cleansers are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I like one better than the other.  </li>
            <li> This may be due to pressing more while using it or using it rigorously</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as magical as other said.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle for the skin, it really exfoliates nicely without irritating.</li>
            <li> This cheaply made &amp; does not spin very quickly &amp; the brush is to soft to really make any impact on removing dead cells.</li>
            <li> Its great; just try to keep it out of as much water as possible, when you&#x27;re done, dry it off, will last longer.</li>
            <li> Olay has put out a terrific product here and it&#x27;s worth every penny of the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews that said this left their skin a little dry, but mine is just perfect.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed a significant decrease in dry skin and have noticed some of my dryness-caused redness disappearing.</li>
            <li> When I learned about this little gizmo, I thought I would give it a try as it was garnering such great reviews from the press and from actual users of a similar more costly product.</li>
            <li> Buy it when it&#x27;s cheap, not like it&#x27;s already cheap compared to other brands like the Clarisonic that is over $100!!!</li>
            <li> you really need it if you want to get your facial cleaning on the right way.&lt;br /&gt;it is not expensive as well.</li>
            <li> It works fine with me but compared to the mia2 it looks like the mia2 would put in so much more work just from the look of the brushes, but as far as the speed they look like they go about the same or if so not much of a dramtic difference.</li>
            <li> I NEVER felt a deep clean with it.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> I was using it a lot at first to see if it would clear my face but didnt seem to help much in that department.</li>
            <li> It did not, however, leave it feeling parched or overly dry--just extra clean.</li>
            <li> I thought I was cleaning it well, but after using this brush, I&#x27;m convinced  that I had to clean it in a different way.</li>
            <li> cleans well never had one of the more expensive brands but for the price its good and gives you some extra cleaning.also replacement heads available at local dept stores in town.</li>
            <li> feel it helps get dry skin cells off easy.</li>
            <li> It makes my moisturizer work even better and harder than it would normally.  </li>
            <li> I break out less, my pores are visibly smaller, and I even find that makeup goes on more smoothly.</li>
            <li> First of all I bought Olay Professional Pro-X just to see how to really use the brush.</li>
            <li> Works well to clean skin deeply.</li>
            <li> For an extra treat once a week I use about 3 drops of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Peppermint Liquid Soap on the brush head and clean my face with it.</li>
            <li> I am still using the same products I was using before the olay pro-x, but apparently my skin is cleaner and the products seem to do their job better.  </li>
            <li> I simply soak the brush in vinegar and water solution for a squeaky clean disinfectant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the device to clean my face, neck and upper chest.  </li>
            <li> All my teenage children are using it to clean their skin, and reduce pimples.  </li>
            <li> brush is too soft, and the two speeds are pretty much</li>
            <li> The first few days you might break out more than you&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li> This device is small, great for facial scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t shrink my pores, it does clean my face which is what I needed it for, since I workout a lot and hang around outside</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll keep using it for a deep clean.</li>
            <li> My pores are getting smaller by the day and my skin feels really clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember last time my face felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and my skin is left with a clean shine.</li>
            <li> I had been using apricot srubs to get my face clean, but they started hurting my facial skin</li>
            <li> Seems to help deep clean the face</li>
            <li> (neutrogena deep clean face wash) It may be the face product and not the cleansing system that bothered me.</li>
            <li> and I can definitely tell a difference on how clean my skin is.  </li>
            <li> we really too lazy to scrub your own face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is small but really works for a nice face cleaning.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so clean, and it makes such a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> It makes a big difference with how you clean your face</li>
            <li> My face feels clean - like that deep clean you feel after a facial.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t clean as deep with just your hands.</li>
            <li> With this product I am able to get soft and clean skin without having to drag a washcloth or bare hands across my face.</li>
            <li> Makes my pores smaller and my skin feel clean.  </li>
            <li> The rotating brush just doens&#x27;t seem to deep clean.  </li>
            <li> It does what its supposed to do which is clean out the pores and reduces acne, facial oil etc.</li>
            <li> Definitely gets a deeper clean than just washing with hands &amp; soap.</li>
            <li> A lot of people say that if you&#x27;re not going to go Clarisonic, don&#x27;t go at all, but I respectfully disagree--this product definitely improves the skin condition compared to my bare hands, and based on that alone</li>
            <li> For years I thought I was getting my face clean by just using my facial cleanser and my hands or a cloth</li>
            <li> and I needed something to clean deep into my pores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first couple of weeks, my skin still looked calm and break-outs were somewhat reduced, but not totally eliminated.</li>
            <li> - this definitely works to get the skin clean.</li>
            <li> but I work outside and keeping my face clean stops breakouts of acne and pimples</li>
            <li> I will say I had a few more brake outs for the first week</li>
            <li> but there always seems to be make up on the brush (which just shows you how clean and deep</li>
            <li> ) clean his face properly twice a day, and b) apply acne cream every night before bed.</li>
            <li> n clean with only one use, got rid of oil n dirt so well</li>
            <li> I spoke to an expert who said that I have &amp;#34;congested&amp;#34; pores and that I should use a facial brush to clean my face.</li>
            <li> i use it every 3 nights and it does feel deep clean after that.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day at night to help clean my skin from the daily impurities and my dermatologist approved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is the same principle, and as I mentioned as an exfoliator, all methods work as long as you are diligent, and know your skin type and how to exfoliate effectively without doing any damage.</li>
            <li> It does a good job for an average facial electronic cleaner</li>
            <li> A little instruction about how often to change the brush head would be nice, but I can live without it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a good moisturizer after you cleanse your face, because my face got a little dry when I didn&#x27;t moisturize right after using it.      </li>
            <li> its still a nice product--just wish it was a little rougher!</li>
            <li> done for a FRACTION of the cost of the other higher end brands!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut down my getting ready for work by 12 minted from being nit picky, making sure makeup is evenly spread etc.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve found that if you have a place that&#x27;s more acne/blackhead prone, if you hold it still in that spot, it really gets down in the pores and cleans all of that out.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve found that if you have a place that&#x27;s more acne/blackhead prone, if you hold it still in that spot, it really gets down in the pores and cleans all of that out.</li>
            <li> The brush has two speeds which is nice because at first you will want to use the low speed until your skin gets used to the brush then in time you can go to the other speed if you wish.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t exfoliate every single day, I get blackheads on my nose very quickly.</li>
            <li> leaves your skin fresh clean and regenerated you can use it also with ever other face soap cleanser</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are wanting a gentle electrical brush for your face.  </li>
            <li> I use the high speed, which isn&#x27;t all that fast and works well.</li>
            <li> As described, fast shipping, high quality.</li>
            <li> I really like it and highly recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Still too early to tell if it works, but is very gentle and as I said, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I have never used the Clairsonic and really debated buying it, but the price tag was just too high</li>
            <li> well honestly I think I prefer my hand-held facial brush to this because this brush is just too soft and doesn&#x27;t seem to really make a difference in my exfoliating routine.</li>
            <li> I wash my face, usually with Morning Burst from Clean and Clear, or if I feel like splurging, Bliss fave wash is my favorite.</li>
            <li> So I am very particular with the skincare products I use and thankfully it pays off, I have clear smooth skin - aside from that week of the month, just working on ridding myself of some scars from my younger days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but literally after the first use, my skin looked healthier, more vibrant/less dull, and my fine lines on my forehead were definitely minimized.  </li>
            <li> this product really works---i live in the caribbean and get too much sun</li>
            <li> only bought the product because there was a special deal at the time and it was a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always a little leery to try new face products, but I&#x27;ve had good luck with Olay in the past (their regenerist moisturizer is awesome - and for those wondering, I use the products at acne-dot-org usually.</li>
            <li> Like so many other people I have been toying with the idea of buying a Clarisonic, but was turned off by the high price tag.</li>
            <li> I just wish the brush bristles was a little harder and more of the cleaning soultion :-)</li>
            <li> If you want more foam on your face just wet the brush head a little more.</li>
            <li> Requires very little cleanser to be effective.  </li>
            <li> This little powerful, handy brush has totally changed the skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> Then, I used the brush quickly across my whole face to get the cleaner all over, then went back over each part of my face and took some time to let the brush scrub on each area.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find that Amazon offered it for several dollars less.</li>
            <li> Acne products over dry my skin and are only minimally effective on my blackheads and pimples.  </li>
            <li> This is nice for those looking to shed some dry skin (gross, I know) and polish up their face.</li>
            <li> This product may only be half as good( for all</li>
            <li> but when my skin starts to dry and peel, it completely gets rid of it, and it cleans my face much better than by hands alone.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my skin has changed a LOT over the past 4 years (since becoming pregnant with my son).</li>
            <li> My dermatologist had told me that with my aging, my pores do tend to get bigger, but since the bristles being so soft and with the soft circular motion of the product, it will clean the pores much better and they can get smaller as well</li>
            <li> I mean, it cleaned my skin ok, and it was pretty cool since it was a natural sponge, but I needed something with oomph that provided results.</li>
            <li> My skin has been very smooth and fewer black spots on the nose now.</li>
            <li> My pores are much smaller, my skin is very soft and my make up goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> price goes down a little more and more people will love.&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof function is very simple to use and a comfortable shower.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week, and I can already see positive changes in my skin that make this cleansing system worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got \\&quot;sucked into\\&quot; by a company&#x27;s  large marketing budget and the product doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> the device is good and the price is amazing, however watch out for some rash that may occur if used wrong or roughly.</li>
            <li> I coupled it with a benzoyl peroxide treatment, and for the first time in 15 years I have clear skin without the need for Accutane.</li>
            <li> Because my friend, it is exactly as pictured and I have also noticed my face getting clear.</li>
            <li> Beauty Alternatives You Need to Know]], which gave me extensive knowledge and insight as to why its so so important for your skin and body to be treated with gentle, all natural products.</li>
            <li> This product is small, lightweight, and fits nicely in your hand to operate.</li>
            <li> It does leave my face feeling soft and smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s too much abrasian for my facial skin.  </li>
            <li> $36 for the device, a full 6 oz. tube of the Olay Pro-X exfoliating cleanser, an extra brush head, and 2 batteries.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment was much easier to open than most reviewers reported, but that&#x27;s probably because I read all the way to the last paragraph of K. Sprite&#x27;s review, where she tells you how to do it.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to those who have sensitive skin and first time users.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I did my research and listened to about 20 reviews on youtube about this product and the clairsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that is normally very oily and prone to breakouts!  </li>
            <li> First, don&#x27;t use it every day if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but it came with extra brush heads and a full size cleansing gel.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at the reviews saying Clarisonic was better and this one was not worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is not the sort of product I would normally buy, but she is very into anti-aging, skin protection, night masks, etc.</li>
            <li> I had a really cheap Pretika brush that I bought at Rite Aid for only about $12 a few years ago, and even that one was better than this Olay brush.  </li>
            <li> It OK but not worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am 24 years old, Caucasian, and have always had pretty acne-free skin.</li>
            <li> Its small so it doesnt take up space, yet it does its job nicely.</li>
            <li> ive been using other cleansing products, and they hurt my skin, but this works great~ would recommend this for people with thin and sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li> only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars is the two modes it has.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin do not use the cream on your face first..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure because of this product or my own skin care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other facial cleansing brushes out there that work just as well or maybe better, but this is the only one I have tried and for $20 who can complain.</li>
            <li> Spend five minutes clearing everything, Rinse brush with hot water every 1-2 minutes till complete.  </li>
            <li> 2- Rinse brush thoroughly directly with hot water while on, takes 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> cleanser is okay, but not worth buying on</li>
            <li> But for me, I threw it away after it irritated my sensitive acne prone skin too much!</li>
            <li> I can use my Clarisonic brush on a daily basis, but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using this one more than a few times a week if I was using it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure if the Clarisonic cleansbetter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and portable which is nice.  </li>
            <li> I plan to buy it in full size when the generous \\&quot;trial size\\&quot; runs low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I have it and am not disappointed enough to try to return it, but am definitely eagerly waiting until Olay comes out with different brush heads.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see my skin texture show visible improvement after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> Just wishing it was slightly bigger so that I know if I want to buy the full size or not.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This system is truely the only one to have!</li>
            <li> Working full time, nursing school full time and having twin toddler Grandbabies living in our home , a simple product pampers me daily!  </li>
            <li> I fill up my skin with hot water, rinse my face, dunk the brush, and apply the soap/cleanser directly to the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will get better results from an average wash cloth.</li>
            <li> okay but not exactly powerful.</li>
            <li> At the moment, I&#x27;m a 24 year old male who&#x27;s looking to clear my face up the most affordable way I can.</li>
            <li> 6 weeks later my sample cleanser ran out and I ordered the full sized bottle.  </li>
            <li> so much better than just the average face cloth.</li>
            <li> Will probably be buying them their own facial brushes in the near future.</li>
            <li> I usually use my own scrub or face wash though.  </li>
            <li> It just does it no better than using an exfoliating cleanser on its own.</li>
            <li> This was no more effective than using a Buff Puff on my face.  </li>
            <li> For a low price, not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough on my face to use once a day at the end of the day and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I do not have major skin problems, I could see my results right away, but not everyonemight.</li>
            <li> i love olay products, and was hoping this one wouldn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> so pressing down on it as you go over your face will not do any more for your skin.  </li>
            <li> But I love this thing and would buy another if it broker down.</li>
            <li> seems to make my skin feel softer and more radiant and also is helping me keep down any problems I may have with acne</li>
            <li> and I can only assume they mean 6X better than just splashing water on your face because I&#x27;ve gotten much better exfoliation with a washcloth or nylon sponge than this weakling can provide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it cleaned it better than any other product ive used!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something that would have a little more kick to it, like other reviewers said this has more of a massaging effect as opposed to sort of a scrubbing effect like i hoped for</li>
            <li> Did a good job, price was right for the product advance cleaning system really works but is expensive combined with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> The unsightly skin pigment problems on both my right and left cheeks (they are huge) are actually getting lighter.</li>
            <li> My previous exfoliating scrub did not get stellar reviews from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep skincare safety database and I have been trying to find replacement cosmetics/products that are safer but still effective.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased the Pro-X as I really like this little cleaning tool.</li>
            <li> I am in my 20&#x27;s and have dry, fair, sensitive skin with a minor case of rosacea.</li>
            <li> I am a little dissapointed with the brushes because they are kind of soft.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean the face well, but if you move the brush around too quickly, it hurts a little.</li>
            <li> I wish it spun a little quicker and more intensely, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Just wish it had a little more power and didn&#x27;t go through batteries as fast as it seems to.</li>
            <li> Nice little face scrubber, except the sponges are really soft.  </li>
            <li> I let them know yesterday at around 10am, and by 12pm they had shipped me a new one!</li>
            <li> New fav face product!</li>
            <li> My face felt new!</li>
            <li> My new Must have product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a new page in my skin Bible!</li>
            <li> The Olay Cleansing System brought new meaning to cleansing!</li>
            <li> New world!</li>
            <li> Also, a great exfoliating scrub with good lotions (Arbonne again, folks) would prevent the need for a big old machine that goes into the shower to sand the skin as this product is being compared to--yikes that sounds like a lot of work and maybe even dangerous!</li>
            <li> just in the last month or so, even during hot, hot, hot AZ days, my skin hasn&#x27;t been nearly as oily as it had been before I started using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a soft, flat brush that rotates at two speeds, and it&#x27;s easy to turn on and off.  </li>
            <li> the bottom line for me is that I think it&#x27;s hard to beat a good old fashioned washcloth.</li>
            <li> I do not like it well enough to imagine that I would ever want to spend more on a better replacement down the road; but if I continue to like it, I&#x27;d probably purchase another Pro X when this one has spun its last spin.  </li>
            <li> I started using this on a every other day basis because sometimes my skin can get over-dry if I use a more powerful face wash, especially in the colder months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I did not spend more on the expensive \\&quot;other brand\\&quot; as I suspect I would see no difference with that one either.</li>
            <li> Works great, I also use it with my other facial routine and it works terrific.</li>
            <li> This brush takes care of the daily dead skin buildup and actually feels good as it does it!</li>
            <li> The whole point of exfoliating is to irritate the skin to turn over new cells and produce collagen.</li>
            <li> I really like my new Olay Cleansing System for it</li>
            <li> So, if your new to the whole brush thing.. I&#x27;d give this one a try before you overspend.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a cleansing system and had researched many from the high priced on down.</li>
            <li> In less than a week I noticed a huge difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing products help my dry patches but make my pores look huge and, of course, increase my acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews (good &amp; bad) I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews (good &amp; bad) I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Cheap copy of the real Olay, minimal uses, plan on returning this item .</li>
            <li> My traumatic experiences involve one huge pimple on the chin or around the nose every now and then, but overall my skin is clear of acne.  </li>
            <li> In combination with the microdermabrasion kit I have seen reduction in fine lines and brown spots as well although I think most of that is due to the microdermabrasion kit not the Pro-X. I have seen other people mention concerns about the battery compartment, but I did not have issues with the batteries to get started (have not had to change them yet).</li>
            <li> I would recommend more or less holding the product still and letting it do the work as you move it over your face (versus also moving your hand around, which I have an inclination to do).</li>
            <li> but it is easy to do so be careful while using because the brush spins and is abrasive.</li>
            <li> I found that less is more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had less breakouts, a brighter complexion, and better cleansing with this</li>
            <li> I tried difference pressures, and less is more.  </li>
            <li> I figure I&#x27;ll spend less time once my skin gets better.</li>
            <li> worked ok for less than 7 months.  </li>
            <li> Work your way up; less is more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to use less makeup now because I don&#x27;t have to worry about covering up blemishes.</li>
            <li> I love the way it works, but I use it in the shower (never fully submerged in water) and I have to replace it every year to a year and a half.</li>
            <li> I bought this product more in hopes of keeping my face cleaner and in hopes of getting rid of black heads.</li>
            <li> and I use Clean and Clear&#x27;s Truly Gentle Facial Wash in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In other words, you need this machine to clean your skin!</li>
            <li> Less is more with manual exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face better, so I am less oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and I love the slight flush it leaves on my skin</li>
            <li> Great for using once or twice a week, be careful not to over-exfoliate as it will exacerbate any trouble spots.</li>
            <li> Maybe it doesn&#x27;t have the power needed to make a difference in my particular case.</li>
            <li> I had considered buying a more expensive model, but glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I also use it with a mild facial soap.  </li>
            <li> Getting older is hell...</li>
            <li> I am a male a manly male and I always make sure to hide this thing in my shower when I have company over</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s main advantage over Clarisonic</li>
            <li> My skin is ultra smooth and soft, I am already seeing a difference after only one week of use.</li>
            <li> its been only a week, but i love it, my blackheads are gone, my pores are smaller</li>
            <li> The Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System product does not achieve any deep cleansing.  </li>
            <li> My skin was decent and had no acne, until I started using this cleansing system.</li>
            <li> Improvement in skin, particularly around areas without a bony palette underneath, like my cheeks.</li>
            <li> However, now that I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> Not as goot as the main brand</li>
            <li> It removes all dead, flakey skin and leaves my skin looking fresh and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase mainly for the brush.</li>
            <li> (I will also update my review if I see a decent improvement.)</li>
            <li> Its a nice soft brush that sloughs off any dead skin.</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality spinner-scrubber.</li>
            <li> I mainly want my skin to look healthier rather than oily-flaky in places.  </li>
            <li> Love it and saw a big difference in my skin shortly after I started using it.  </li>
            <li> The S. Lucci had a larger buffer and cleansing wheel, but this smaller one is better.  </li>
            <li> The main differences are: this system takes batteries (not rechargeable), does not include a case, brush head spins in a circle as opposed to back-and-forth.</li>
            <li> Okay, I just had a facial last week where they used the Clarisonic on my face.  </li>
            <li> While I have no comparison with the two, this for me, was a decent choice.</li>
            <li> I initially researched a Clarisonic, but saw this and figured it was better to spend $20 and possibly not like it, than take the risk of spending $150 on a Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any real facial problems but those aforementioned are making my skin look better</li>
            <li> After I did every part of my face, I rinsed my face and the brush, and then turned the brush on the low setting and went back over my face one more time and rinsed.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt smoother or cleaner, and I have tried so many different facial cleansers in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, when using be sure to get all the extra water out if you rinse before putting it back on your face.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned that the Olay device doesn&#x27;t do \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; (jittery) cleansing, but only spins (btw, be sure to pin your hair back or it can get caught in the spin!).</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has begun to have breakouts and flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> and it would take a lot more deep cleaning for them to appear smaller).</li>
            <li> I decided mainly because of the cost to go with Olay.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has begun to have breakouts and flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it with a harsher exfoliant and it had a similar result, but made my face a lot more red temporarily.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, although I would caution you to have realistic expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a useful product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this thing and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I finally just started using my own cream with crushed apricot seeds in it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m only a Italian girl :-) )</li>
            <li> but the unit quickly lost power and then would only work sporadically.</li>
            <li> they actually became so much more smaller!</li>
            <li> I have been keeping it in the shower for 3 weeks now and it has quickly become part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> but I suppose it&#x27;s decent for its price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also older.  </li>
            <li> and it worked well with him even though it was made for use for targeted older people for aging.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job.</li>
            <li> I use the sensitive Olay cleanser and success so far.  </li>
            <li> However, I bought myself just the regular CVS brand facial brush, and there are more speeds on it than this one.</li>
            <li> I think of these face brushes as giant sonic toothbrushes with softer bristles: You use the sonic toothbrushes because it cleans the plague off your teeth better than regular brushes!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the more expensive versions, but I can&#x27;t imagine they would work much better than this.</li>
            <li> This device is decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned the more expensive type to compare it to, but I love it.</li>
            <li> and if all else fails i will be more confident in the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I am a 32 year old woman with 3 kids who really has never had much of a regimen.</li>
            <li> I use the softer setting on my face and particularly the nose area, while the faster setting i use on my neck area.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Not much doesn&#x27;t affect it without having some kind of red sploshes coming up.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this product and decided to try it instead of purchasing the more expensive brand, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and also find that the makeup (I only put makeup on occasionally) actually stay on better.</li>
            <li> In the several weeks that I have been using this product, at least 5 or 6 people have commented on how great my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> but actually it does a good job at teasing awat dead skin and ingrained dirt.</li>
            <li> My main moisturizer is coconot oil.</li>
            <li> I love this face brush, I&#x27;m amazed I&#x27;ve had the same one for possibly five years.</li>
            <li> Glad I settled for this instead of a more expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going back to a Clarisonic - costs way too much, but at this point it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, it does do a decent job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels so soft and smooth after using this so overall</li>
            <li> My skin is getting older and this seems to keep it fresher looking.</li>
            <li> I wonder how much better the expensive versions can be (even though I love it, could never bring myself to spend $199 on &#x27;those&#x27;).</li>
            <li> I have never used the more expensive product, but why spend $100 when this product for $30 is getting the job done :)</li>
            <li> I think this is because the exfoliation allows my moisturizer to sink more deeply into my skin, so it&#x27;s overall moisture level has</li>
            <li> I love using it, but have now cut it back to using it only in the evenings when washing away my make-</li>
            <li> I got this brush because I figured as I was getting older</li>
            <li> : price, decent quality, waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> This product is a decent one for the price I paid, however I had some issues...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine getting any better results with the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> I thought this might be to harsh on my skin, but it seems more gentle than a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> give this review as a warning to others that it may not be what your particular skin</li>
            <li> and it was great, tingly almost irritatingly ticklish, but for the price this Pro-X is the clear winner.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman</li>
            <li> I mainly use the Olay Pro X to remove any makeup my makeup remover towelettes didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> Experiment with the amount your particular skin texture needs.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month now and really like the soft brush to exfoliate gently.  </li>
            <li> I use both in the shower daily and it is such a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> it is useful to clear your old skin.</li>
            <li> This device is better than the Clarisonic for several reasons (1) it&#x27;s smaller (2)</li>
            <li> For the cost, this seems to be a decent cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> uses this SUPER ULTRA BIG Box.</li>
            <li> The most effect I&#x27;ve seen is in my décollete, which definitely looks brighter and clearer than when I was using a basic shower pouf to cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i happen to be one of the litlle older gals around</li>
            <li> SO glad I didn&#x27;t fork over money for the more expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I figured I could replicate the same discipline by making sure my son did 2 simple things: a</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, I heard the much more expensive Clairsonic is a much better product.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this but do find that if I use it daily (as recommended) that I break out with big under the skin pimples in places that I never used to get them.</li>
            <li> Like that it is smaller than most chargeable facial brushes.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> It is so affordable and works better than the more expensive cleansing systems that are advertised.</li>
            <li> If one can get a knock-off, such as that sold at CVS/pharmacy, for a meaningfully different price, then that knock-off might be the better buy.  </li>
            <li> main reason for a 5-star review is that I paid $28 on Amazon, then saw it in Rite-Aid for $59.99.</li>
            <li> I did my research before purchasing and the main downsides to this product seem to be that it takes batteries instead of recharging-</li>
            <li> decent pricing.</li>
            <li> With the discount and coupon, I opted for this one recently - and I&#x27;m so glad I finally gave in!</li>
            <li> This particular product was recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> The exfoliation effect relies mainly on the grainy particles in the cleanser rather than an aggressive rotation of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came without cleanser,  which wouldn&#x27;t have been a super big deal, but the power of cleaning and flimsy brush head made me return it.</li>
            <li> But for $20 compared to $200 for the expensive product this is a good one, and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use a variety of different cleansers, some are foamy, some exfoliating (spelled?), and some are super moisturized.</li>
            <li> Considering the outstanding results and the cost, I would recommend this to ANY female for daily use.</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and the spinning is very light on your skin, I was looking for something a little rougher to really exfoliate</li>
            <li> I bought this thing because I have a major issue with white gunk accumulating in the pores of my nose, which over the years have increased in size and are easily clogged.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and gently on the skin.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and gently on the skin.</li>
            <li> As I said before the Clarisonic is very different and definitely feels like a high end luxury product, but I couldn&#x27;t stop wondering if it was really a better product than the Pro-X.</li>
            <li> I wish you could reverse the spin, and have a more customizable speed setting, the low and high is has just isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> Cleaning my face very softly, like it so much.</li>
            <li> Ten days of using this and there has been zero redness or irritation from its use, and my skin is smooth as silk and best of all,  no more flakes or dry rough patches.  </li>
            <li> Immediate positive results after two days (smoother skin), but took 2-3 weeks for the residual acne to clear up.</li>
            <li> I would recommend rinsing thoroughly after every use, don&#x27;t use it for too many minutes because it&#x27;ll make your face raw, and don&#x27;t use it more times daily than your skin can handle because that will also make your skin raw and when it gets raw it produces more oil which causes more acne.</li>
            <li> This is really helping clear up my face and it hasn&#x27;t even been a week of using it yet!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin pretty smooth, and flake-free (especially since I use the microderm and chemical peels at home), and I do think it has helped (along with the AHA products I&#x27;ve recently started using) with excess oil -</li>
            <li> The other product has more &#x27;stuff&#x27;, like a delicate brush for sensitive skin, which might be nice to have, but I&#x27;ve found that if you&#x27;re gentle with it</li>
            <li> Works great, wish the bristles were a little bit harsher but definitely helped my skin a ton and left it very exfoliated.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush - the little motor could be more powerful so that there is no drag on it when you apply it to your face.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the brush was a little wider, and had a timer for each area of the face like the other one I tried, but it&#x27;s a great option for the price.</li>
            <li> Overall very glad I purchased this instead of a much more expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> used the Clarsonic when it was first popular, a few years back.</li>
            <li> Motor has 2 speeds; not very fast, but gentle enough to use more frequently than the higher speed models.</li>
            <li> Just ordered a new one because the old one was getting pretty yucky with mold and it wasn&#x27;t cleaning up as it used to.</li>
            <li> Just gently rock the bottom part left and right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive enough that it tends to turn red and irritated with most scrubbing products, but using super gentle products (such as Cetaphil) doesn&#x27;t touch the oil.</li>
            <li> Such a gentle exfoliator that lifts that dirt right off of the skin.</li>
            <li> At 38 years old my skin obviously doesn&#x27;t look as fresh or bright as it one did, so I wanted this brush to help with my dull complexion.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd one, I really like it, I purchased the 3rd one for our home overseas since I was not able to find one like this there, its just perfect, not to harsh, its nice and soft  but its enough to brighten your skin every day in the shower.</li>
            <li> Not only do the bristles clean the face, but they help in removing dead skin cells and promoting circulation and the growth of healthy new cells.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I bought it about a year or so ago and used it on high and it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for this line.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> high recommend if you don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on a product like this.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m getting older, I discovered that I needed to do a little more to reduce signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> use it about 2 to 3 times a week, mainly because it takes a little more time in the shower when i use this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to give something 5 stars unless I absolute love it and it has changed my life in a million positive ways.</li>
            <li> Product is as effective as the other high price systems would definitely recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> I still have to go in and manually clean them out but not nearly as often as I did before the brush.</li>
            <li> The Olay cleanser has a strange smell and does not get my skin that clean.</li>
            <li> And I love that there&#x27;s literally no clean up.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this because it works great and was way less expensive.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers have said, do not use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is light and easy to pack for travel and really cleans my face without making it dry or tight.</li>
            <li> The high speed is what I keep it on, but it seems it could be a little better.</li>
            <li> Sure there are a few things you will get with a more expensive brand, but if you are looking for an inexpensive facial cleansing brush that does a great job-look no further.</li>
            <li> I do believe that the brush coupled with my cleanser and exfoliator really penetrate deep to allow for the most clean, blank canvas, enabling the other products to do their thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, in my experience, almost all the products I love and rely on get discontinued, or reappear as some new, improved version - at twice the price and half the capability.  </li>
            <li> I love this little machine.</li>
            <li> We both love this little cleaner.</li>
            <li> so I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews that said that it can cause more acne because it can irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li> The clogged pores are maybe a little better off, though it&#x27;s nothing</li>
            <li> As stated, I think this allows for a better skin cleansing than the little manually operated brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget.  </li>
            <li> I tried it immediately with the sample cleanser provided, and felt that it was a little better than washing with your fingers.</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than a little spinning brush head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest making the bristles a little more sturdy and the brush needs to rotate in both directions.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of all the little imperfections and my skin has never looked brighter or as healthy.  </li>
            <li> I think the product needs to have a little more speed to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 and a buff puff is much more exfoliating than this little gizmo.  </li>
            <li> Now on my fourth week of daily use, I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> The little manual brush does a better job.  </li>
            <li> I love this little brush.</li>
            <li> so i may be a little more picky,</li>
            <li> was expecting little more from O&#x27;lay.</li>
            <li> BUT, I can say that I love his little thing, and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need a clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I wanted a little more power.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling so soft afterwards!!</li>
            <li> This is the first battery powered facial brush I&#x27;ve owned, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other types,but I&#x27;m pleased with the way it cleans my face.  </li>
            <li> (A little history, my skin although not terrible is prone to cystic type pimples sometimes)  </li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little more than a month</li>
            <li> He needed something a little more for his acne.  </li>
            <li> But I love this little brush.  </li>
            <li> While I wish it was a little more abrasive, this allows for using it day and night.</li>
            <li> this little cleanser does and outstanding job at both cleansing and exfoliating.</li>
            <li> and WOW .. it&#x27;s like I never washed my face before !!</li>
            <li> A LITTLE MORE FRISKY - THE BRISTLES, THAT IS.  </li>
            <li> But all in all I love this little device.</li>
            <li> Thought it would have a little more power</li>
            <li> My face feels very clean after using, but sometimes a little dry, so I will apply a light moisturizer afterwards as needed.  </li>
            <li> I bought the cleansing system to help get my skin CLEAR and get that deep clean it suggests it does.  </li>
            <li> Those of you who want to actually scrub or clean your face should not waste your money.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and soft, I did not want to invest $200 on a facial brush and this one does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever had my facial skin so clean and so radiant and looking so young.  </li>
            <li> To me, that is ridiculous to spend that much on a cleansing brush, when you can get a nice one or $21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus the back of the sponge tore and opened up where I held it to clean my face (no mechanism to hold it, since it&#x27;s a natural sponge.)</li>
            <li> 360 Clean, Deep Exfoliating Scrub, Natural Apricot Beads.  </li>
            <li> but I love the clean feeling the brush leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I use it with different facial cleansers and it leaves my skin very clean and soft but hasn&#x27;t helped with acne too much yet.</li>
            <li> When I first got this, the bristles seemed totally weak and like they wouldn&#x27;t do much to deep clean at all, I&#x27;m so used to scrubbing my face with abrasive stuff, but it really cleans and exfoliates deeply and effectively while being really gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> I like how this has a normal and high speed button</li>
            <li> Very affordable compared to many other brands and work as good as expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to dry it</li>
            <li> My pores are visibly smaller, my skin is much clearer and the fine wrinkles that just recently started to develop on my lower cheeks have all but dissappeared.  </li>
            <li> The batteries are easy to get to and change despite other postings.</li>
            <li> The combs that vome with it is kind of hard</li>
            <li> so I used it a couple more times, but I am still highly dissatisfied and feel like I wasted my money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your face really does feel cleaner (I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;6 times&amp;#34; cleaner) and that makes me think that my other products just work better if they&#x27;re actually getting down more in my pores.  </li>
            <li> Nice to see that it really works, but gross to see how little is removed by using a cleanser and no brush.</li>
            <li> (at night) becoz i do find using it twice is a little too much for my own skin, but i guess everyone is different.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain, is gentle yet tough on makeup and cleans pores like nothing else.</li>
            <li> Since I am only using it half the time, I am really glad I did not pay a lot for it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for both young and old!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65; and this has cleaned my skin, left the live skin soft and clean enoughh to moisturize, and now beginning</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft which is probably good for me because I have a tendency to scrub my face very hard and causing dryness and what not.</li>
            <li> It refreshed my face, getting rid of old skin and made moisturizing much easier.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m almost 30) and so far my skin seems so much clearer.  </li>
            <li> these are great and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> It works very well, is quite soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin.  </li>
            <li> There is just something nice/luxurious about gently working the soft brush around your skin</li>
            <li> The cleanser is also gentle on my sensitiive, mature (47 yr.old)</li>
            <li> I felt the head lasted longer when kept clean and dry between use.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using the brush, I have noticed that my skin is considerably softer and much cleaner than before...</li>
            <li> This really made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> What I did not like was that the brush head was so extremely soft that I found it wasnt doing much exfoliation, even after a week of every day use.</li>
            <li> Your skin will hateyou for scrubbing it like a metal pot, rather than gently exfoliating it with a soft bristle brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are soft and not irritating to my skin</li>
            <li> I did not find it to be very helpful for my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I just need to be careful not to put pressure, just lightly buff the skin like scrub.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was very worried about trying it out because I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro X cleaning device offers a soft-bristle brush that rotates at two speeds offering gentle cleansing and exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are soft and is really gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not as intense as the Mia, my skin is every bit as soft and radiant with the ProX.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I still have to use an exfoliation pad occasionally to remove old rough skin, but this does an amazing job at deep-cleaning.  </li>
            <li> so my once soft skin is so much drier and flakier than it used to be</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and gentle also and does the motion for you.  </li>
            <li> The sample they sent cruds up the brush and doesn&#x27;t work very well to clear pores.</li>
            <li> works really well so far...</li>
            <li> 4- Pat face dry (preferably on fairly clean towel)  </li>
            <li> pat face dry with clean cloth</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too much for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product so far</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but the Clarisonic feels very aggressive.</li>
            <li> and I think the replacement brushes are not that cheap either - they go for roughly $5 a brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how much I like</li>
            <li> It has really helped clear up my acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Brush is so soft on the face..and it really cleans.  </li>
            <li> It removes everything but is still gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This brush rotates at two speed settings and the bristles are soft and gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy an expensive model, this one works great and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised at how much cleaner</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin is much smoother and brighter since I started using this brush.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that I don&#x27;t need to wear as much foundation because my skin is so clear and even.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and have frequent crusty patches on my face . . .</li>
            <li> There are two speeds, I don&#x27;t use the lower speed much because I feel it&#x27;s too soft for my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear, and my pores are so much unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear, and my pores are so much unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> I own the more expensive Clarisonic facial brush and swear by it.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I wish that it had a more powerful setting but that is probably not good for your skin.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel really clean and moisterized(considering that i have really dry skin).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wont go like wow fast its powered by 2 AA batteries</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it more than a few months and the spinning brush will not stay on the handle for more than a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I had a Nutrasonic (very similar to Clarisonic and cheaper at $89) that worked great before it quit a short few months after I bought it.</li>
            <li> It does feel really nice on the face and the brush is soft, I have never tried a Clarasonic so not sure how it stands up.</li>
            <li> i use it before going to bed and noticed my skin looking a lot better in just a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, it&#x27;s been almost a month, and long story short, I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin and have been using this Pro-X cleansing system for about a week.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin could handle something more harsh.  </li>
            <li> Even though I still own both, because the Conair&#x27;s brush is too rough, I  only use the Olay until I find one that has the Conair&#x27;s mechanics and a brush that&#x27;s NOT as soft as the Olay&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> For Normal to Oily Skin,</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s a big difference and worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> like I had narrowly escaped a hurricane &amp; was finally safe in my underground shelter.</li>
            <li> Probably better than my harsh rubbing of my face.</li>
            <li> I recently determined part of the problem is my skin just doesn&#x27;t slough off well enough, or quickly enough on its own.</li>
            <li> I tried the brush for about 2 months, at first it was doing good, but in the end it only enflammed my acne more and caused me to have painful breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day (in the mornings with my normal cleanser)</li>
            <li> My face is looking better then ever and after just a few times using this product, I can tell the difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Normal or oily maybe 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with the Olay Pro X though.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> one-third the size of the Clarisonic and not even powerful enough to use as a shoe polisher.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few months now, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> In the end, I will use it a few more times to see if the results are improving my texture or not.  </li>
            <li> deposit themselves after a normal day.</li>
            <li> Then I use the brush and a soap that contains sulfur to penetrate deep into my pores and kill the bacteria that cause acne, then lastly I use Olay&#x27;s pH balanced Pro-X cleanser which leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated and.... balanced :).</li>
            <li> What she has been doing is using the battery operated brush to apply her normal skin care regimen</li>
            <li> for a few $$$ more, but when I saw it featured here, I had to have it.  </li>
            <li> It brings  the blood to your skin for a healthy glow and exfoliates dead skin, all the while rejuvenating your skin.  </li>
            <li> I used my normal cleanser, not the Olay cleanser</li>
            <li> so worth it, everyone in my family with their different skin uses it and loves it.&lt;br /&gt;GET</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s normal or an exception.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I actually feel that the Olay does just as good a job if not a better job on my skin than the the Clarsonic did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, not bad, suggested to purchase the brush head replacement together, this old version only comes with one brush head.</li>
            <li> Directly after, the first time that I used the PROx (Olay Professional)</li>
            <li> the brush died a few days ago and I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to re-start.</li>
            <li> Using this system leaves your skin glowing and fresh from daily exfoliation.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic is a bit bulkier and more heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I like using it with my normal skin care products as well as the Olay wash</li>
            <li> I really love the device and use it everyday with another cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Wash first with a gentle non-foaming facial cleanser (without the brush).</li>
            <li> My skin has always had these bumps that were not pimples or allergies that were basically a normal thing for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it just for the normal cleaning</li>
            <li> I am near 40, have pretty clear skin, and have tried both the Clairsonic and the Olay product.  </li>
            <li> I use MAC Pro Longwear foundation, and it does not come off with normal makeup remover.</li>
            <li> and I like this product, cleans my face and removes flaky dead skin cells better than hand washing.</li>
            <li> There are two speeds, the low speed isn&#x27;t even worth using.</li>
            <li> This cleansing system is gentler than a wash cloth, but powerful like a facial.</li>
            <li> the sample provided a few times a week and my skin is looking much better.</li>
            <li> so I am using the product I normally use and it works just as well.  </li>
            <li> so my face looks fresh &amp; I only use this at night to take off my makeup</li>
            <li> As soon as you use it - especially the first time - you can really feel the blood circulating in your face.  </li>
            <li> If you have normal skin, I think you will like this product.</li>
            <li> I feel like it is also making my skin more firm.</li>
            <li> I would say it has only two speeds and neither are powerful.</li>
            <li> I used my normal cleanser, not the Olay cleanser</li>
            <li> the brush is soooo soft and the equipment so small and handy.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times, and I see it more as a novelty than a must have tool.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel any smoother with this than my normal routine.</li>
            <li> For several months I weighed buying a Clarisonic system; however, I was concerned about the costs and whether it was worth the splurge.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried the far more expensive Clarins brush, but I cannot imagine any better results.  </li>
            <li> and if you have normal skin, like myself, I don&#x27;t need to use the cleansing brush every night.</li>
            <li> I switch between using my normal face wash with it and using the olay exfoliator that came with it to prevent &amp;#34;overdoing it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> not as many breakouts i think it&#x27;s because i&#x27;m not touching my face as much to wash it.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wasn&#x27;t getting all of the makeup off of my face with just the normal face cloth and soap.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find that to be worth all that extra money.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it everyday before bed.</li>
            <li> It good to help with daily cleaning, I am not sure the durability of the brush.</li>
            <li> , I get one or two normal pimples when I use products that don&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
            <li> I found the Olay cleaning system to be a lot more harsh on the skin than the clairsonic.  </li>
            <li> The Clarisonic was so harsh that it seemed to irritate my skin more.</li>
            <li> but she has normal skin that is not prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I get more  dead skin with my finger tips than this brush ,  </li>
            <li> Normally use it once a day for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday and her complextion is getting much better.</li>
            <li> The faster speed may be two harsh on the face but is ok on the body.</li>
            <li> I washed my face like I normally do</li>
            <li> over your normal skin</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the Clarisonic one, but having normal skin</li>
            <li> My pores look so tiny, and I rarely have breakouts.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a more expensive brand that does scrub harder, but this unit does a good job and is affordable.</li>
            <li> They have quite a few interesting cleansers that I&#x27;m experimenting with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally get a lot of pimples...</li>
            <li> and you can use it with your normal face wash.</li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t waste $200+ on it.</li>
            <li> And the motor is nice and slow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally good at stuff like this (think lots of kid toys with batteries), but it took my about 15 frustrating minutes to get them in, plus using a kitchen knife!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 25, I have had pretty good skin my whole life, the last couple years it&#x27;s been getting progressively worse), so I got this</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the exfoliator that it comes with</li>
            <li> If you have young, oily, blackhead-prone skin or need major exfoliation, this probably isn&#x27;t strong enough for you.  </li>
            <li> I had been driving several hours in hot Texas with the top down on my convertible and, of course, came home to a peeling forehead.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to hold and comes with a sample size of Olay exfoliant, which is very gentle and has small beads.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as great as I expected, I mean it cleans my face, but I honestly don&#x27;t really feel the difference?</li>
            <li> Prior to using the Pro-X, I&#x27;ve vacillated between using my fingertips with a pricey cleaner (never seemed to really clean that deeply) and a washcloth with a cheaper facial cleaner (cheaper stuff because the washcloth soaks up a lot of cleaner), which feels like a deeper clean.    </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll give it a 9/10, if only because it&#x27;s super scrubby, far too much for my sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li> I now have nice soft skin that helps slow down the aging process &amp; all at a reasonable cost!!!!</li>
            <li> I also use the system on my arms because at 60 yrs old, I now have &amp;#34;crepe&amp;#34; skin - my arms are the only place that really shows my age right now.  </li>
            <li> With dead cells removed regularly and better utilization of the skin products, it should be right for my routine.  </li>
            <li> Any other cleanser is perfectly fine, as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> In addition, my skin looks brighter due to the fine exfoliation it provides.   </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and at times the first speed is a bit rough.</li>
            <li> Hardly no spin at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s not hard to find and follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this with the cleanser it comes with and my other one (clearasil) and both works fine with the device.</li>
            <li> the brush is not hard at all.</li>
            <li> (seriously, not remotely hard at all, was like changing batteries in anything else)  </li>
            <li> I like the brush a lot, and it&#x27;s not hard on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> I had a huge cluster of really small, microscopic pustule-like texture right under my lower lip that also seems to be disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with large pores, and as I get older my pores are getting bigger.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to not irritate my sensitive skin but it really seems to deep clean quite well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s better for me to use it longer on the T-zone and only superficial on the rest of my face; otherwise my face tends to get dry.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the best part: I&#x27;ve broken out less.</li>
            <li> It was easy to understand how to properly use and the batteries seem to last.</li>
            <li> I had gone to a dermatologist and all they ever recommend is Retin-A, a mild wash,  and to come in regularly to have them professionally removed which is by no means</li>
            <li> The entire Pro X line is hypoallergenic and I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> only made the dry skin stand out even more.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because of the low price, but after reading so many great reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Some of the other more powerful units out there are just to rough on skin that is</li>
            <li> Nice and soft bristles unlike other similar systems.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s still a nice product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and gentle on sensitive skin, but does a thorough job of cleansing.  </li>
            <li> Yes definitely as the price is right.</li>
            <li> I am trying two different products right now.</li>
            <li> The head is just about the right toughness, it&#x27;s simple to use.</li>
            <li> I will say that I purchased this several months ago and right off the bat</li>
            <li> To a certain degree it does feel a little on the cheaply constructed side.</li>
            <li> SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]]</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t rely on other reviews to choose products but when I was looking to buy something I had never used before, I read many reviews before deciding to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see a big difference in the texture of my skin the very first day.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how my skin will look in a few more weeks!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it&#x27;s going to last like my old one did, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The Olay Professional Pro-X is just as good-if not better-than the high priced and highly recommended Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I will say that I have normal to combination skin and don&#x27;t know how well this would work for someone with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive normal skin</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference between the low and high settings.</li>
            <li> My sister has a much more expensive one but this one works just as good as her more expensive one.  </li>
            <li> Tonight, before taking off ANY of my make up off, I used the pro x for the first time with my alpha hydrox foaming face wash (also used for the first time)and boy, my face was glowing after I patted it dry!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a need to but a more expensive one this is just fine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t moved to the more expensive ones because this one works just fine for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and the rotation of the spinning is just right, enough to give basically a massage with some exfoliation without overdoing</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use the Olay cleaner that came with this cleaning system ( I have sensitive acne prone skin), but I absolutely love the brush, its small, so its easier to clean near the nose, and the bristles are very soft, and the speed isn&#x27;t too massively high like with the Clarisonic, so I don&#x27;t feel its too abrasive for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying the cleaning product, but I will definitely be buying the brush replacements, I do wish they did sell the brush by itself, I am planning on buying this for Christmas for some people,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I did see a difference in my skin, probably due to the light exfoliating effect and the thorough cleansing.</li>
            <li> Really the only downside I find to this brush is that it would be nice to have a cover or case to keep the brush head protected, but since it is so small, I can use a makeup case.</li>
            <li> .. just wish it would fit other heads like the microderm one...</li>
            <li> If you are willing to make an investment and think a brush for your face is something worth springing for, go for the more expensive brand.p it just for that.  </li>
            <li> If you are willing to make an investment and think a brush for your face is something worth springing for, go for the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> But other than the sound, it works well.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap little brush by Olay that is very overpriced.  </li>
            <li> I recently was the recipient of a very generous gift - a full blown spa facial.</li>
            <li> My face has been break-out free in the couple months since I&#x27;ve started using this (every other day).</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is cheap than other shop.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a fantastic product</li>
            <li> I first bought this in January 2011, not long after they were released.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice little wake-up to scrub your face a bit with it (the same reason I sometimes like to use body scrub in the AM) and get the blood flowing.</li>
            <li> I liked this when I first bought it, but got lazy and didn&#x27;t use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it with a Neutrogena pore refining cream, to get something a little bit more natural.</li>
            <li> I thought the bottle of soap that came with it would be a little bigger, but I used my own soap anyways.</li>
            <li> and my pores are smaller and more clear than they&#x27;ve been in a long time.</li>
            <li> This cleansing system is great--the brush is soft, not abrasive, &amp; makes your skin feel slightly tingly &amp; very clean.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how this has so many high reviews.</li>
            <li> wear a full set of makeup (foundation, concealer, loose powder &amp; etc.)</li>
            <li> and the brush still looks new.</li>
            <li> I might just get a new one when the batteries die.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll purchase the new Clinique one and try that one out.  </li>
            <li> Instead of running out to buy a new Clarisonic I saw this at Walgreens and picked it up.</li>
            <li> Order on Amazon if you don&#x27;t live close to Walmart.</li>
            <li> My skin is peeling a bit from a new retinol product</li>
            <li> so I might get a new one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay another 100+ for a new one, so I decided to buy Olay.</li>
            <li> Also, I know new things can irritate the skin</li>
            <li> You can live without it, BUT it does make your life easier.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> In the meantime I still haven&#x27;t purchased a new brush and I&#x27;m waiting on the check.</li>
            <li> I live in Italy and...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new products.  </li>
            <li> A new must-have for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a forty-something with relatively new issues with acne, which was resistant to run-of-the-mill cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe the batteries had died, but new batteries didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Brand new batteries.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather spend $200 on some new shoes or clothes.  </li>
            <li> im new to this</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this cleansing system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it about a year though, and I need a new one</li>
            <li> replaced the two AA batteries with new ones.</li>
            <li> i cant live without it now..</li>
            <li> it prevented new acne from occurring and it helped cleaned my face in maximum of 2 days (using this product 3 times a day)1.Morning, 2.Evening, 3.before sleeping.</li>
            <li> Then with the new batteries it wouldn&#x27;t spin unless I spun it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to purchase any new cleansing cream yet, but I think I can use my Mary Kay cleanser since</li>
            <li> So while I&#x27;ll probably never use it on my face again, it has found a new life.</li>
            <li> After calling Olay, they said that it was not supposed to be there and sent me a voucher to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I also wear an SPF product under my moisturizer during the day to prevent sun damage to the new layer of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> new batteries did not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am just going to rush to the store and buy me a new one.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and it gets windy here</li>
            <li> (4 uses and it needed 2 new batts)</li>
            <li> I tried brand new batteries</li>
            <li> So now that is my new regiment...</li>
            <li> I can probably live without it and just stick to my exfoliator cleansers but for the price why not use it.</li>
            <li> got a get a new one soon.</li>
            <li> I tried new batteries but with no luck.</li>
            <li> (cost wise, with shipping, I&#x27;ll receive hardly anything back, but I would just throw it away otherwise).  </li>
            <li> Maybe I need to use it more, but like I said, with no directions, it&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s too much or too</li>
            <li> Other then that I like how soft the brush is, how easy it is to use, does not tear up my skin, and it has softened my forehead wrinkles</li>
            <li> 4 months n going strong), my old acne scars are quickly going away and it really does get out all the grime &amp; make up that normal face washing leaves behind.  </li>
            <li> The clarisonic is much more gentle and doesn&#x27;t rotate, it vibrates which cleans deep down without upsetting your skin.  </li>
            <li> comes with batteries, just as good as the super expensive ones!</li>
            <li> This is like sandpaper but much rougher which I know because I actually use sandpaper (a very fine grain) to buff dead skin and unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first skincare product where I&#x27;ve actually noticed a physical difference right away.</li>
            <li> have since ordered more than 30 sets of the same product due to highly demand by her friends.</li>
            <li> but it has helped clear my skin up at least 90% which is amazing.</li>
            <li> Seriously, just buy it, it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> Black head all removed easily and my T zone not as oily as before.</li>
            <li> In a short week I have seen such a huge difference in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it for one week 2 times daily I noticed a huge difference in the size of my pores and the overall texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> My huge pores on my nose have definitely gotten smaller using this.</li>
            <li> Of course, I don&#x27;t wet the unit and I turn away from the spray of the shower to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I don&#x27;t wet the unit and I turn away from the spray of the shower to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> The customer service number on the web site wasn&#x27;t at all interested in being of service and suggested I call back during normal working hours...</li>
            <li> Love that I can leave this in the shower and not worry about it possibly getting wet or having any place where I need to plug it in.</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t as good as the Clarisonic, because the head rotates rather than pulses, thus not cleaning as deep, but for less than $30, it does the job well enough.  </li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old guy with a very oily skin, I just wanted to buy something to get rid of that excess oil and old acne scars.</li>
            <li> For a middle aged woman it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly for my 12 year old daughter, but I have also used it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the product does a nice job if you use it for at least one minute.</li>
            <li> and I like it , gentle on my skin , but cleans very well, and seems like my pores are smaller  and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pro: waterproof, two modes to choose, light weight, bargain price&lt;br /&gt;Con: difficult in opening battery lid, an okay cleaning result to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday with my own facial cleaner.  </li>
            <li> It does make my face feel cleaner and get rid of all the dirt and oil and reduce my blackheads after a while, but at the same time it makes my skin feel kind of dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> This brush makes my face look vibrant and leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice that your make up goes on much smoother, that you don&#x27;t have to dab the excess oil off your face in the middle of the day, and your skin will feel so much lighter.</li>
            <li> The brush is a lil soft &amp; I want to be able to slough off some dead skin on my face....</li>
            <li> being the standard item but was the Clarisonic really that much better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have problems with adult achy and this produce has help clear up my face very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but finding rotating pads that fit well is difficult.</li>
            <li> Now, I use it everyday, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far</li>
            <li> As a person with excema, it&#x27;s super important to get all the dirt out of my pores at the end of the day and this really does the trick without drying or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer and it feels so much cleaner than just using a regular face wash.</li>
            <li> Skin was not left as smooth, has only 1 cleaning head, uses batteries with no charger, and has no case.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is of great quality, but the bristles are just too soft for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Simple facial cleanser and moisturizer and it does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> It has made putting on my makeup in the morning so much easier too as I have gotten rid of the dead skin the evening before and just lightly wash off the nights build up before applying my foundation.</li>
            <li> I really feel like this cleansing brush helps clean off all makeup residue and it exfoliates in half the time it used to take me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to turn it off, and have been extra careful ever since.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I turned it on and noticed the bristles were soft and there wasn&#x27;t much of a scrubbing action against my hand</li>
            <li> In morning only short time and lightly with just a dab or Pro X cleanser, and at night I use makeup remover and then give my skin a thorough scrub with the Pro X cleanser.  </li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my face is super clean, the black heads on my nose are clearing up</li>
            <li> I was using the same products before - the only change to my skin care regimen is using the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System twice per</li>
            <li> too slow and soft-wishing for a more intense scrub</li>
            <li> The fast speed does exfoliate noticeably, but it sure is slow.</li>
            <li> I just love this little gadget!</li>
            <li> I love this little brush!</li>
            <li> I love this little brush!  </li>
            <li> I love this little thing!</li>
            <li> She started using it the same day and after the second use her skin was very soft, shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating formula that comes with it helps it clean and doesn&#x27;t feel rough at all--and I even have very sensitive</li>
            <li> Well I went to that large bulk selling club and found the SAME thing for just a little bit more</li>
            <li> Also, you can only use microderm every other day so on the off days I was just using a wash cloth and my skin didn&#x27;t feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> Also while I understand that results may vary from person to person, I havn&#x27;t really noticed a major difference just yet...</li>
            <li> It cleans well and makes my skin look very clear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes me feel my skin very clear and my face</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t irritate me at all.</li>
            <li> I have never used one before and have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The brush head was VERY soft and provided NO exfoliation what so ever.</li>
            <li> The scrubby brush is VERY soft and not scratchy at all.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find that after I skipped using it for a day or two</li>
            <li> It has a very soft bristle head that snaps on a shaft attached to the motorized body and comes with a tube of exfoliating cleaner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, I had used clearsonic once, but my skin breakout day before the use.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to over drying and whatever is in that cleanser</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is prone to over drying and whatever is in that cleanser</li>
            <li> Very soft cleaning brush</li>
            <li> After one use this product leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and my skin was very soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> -- it makes your skin feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is very soft, not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Though the brush seems very soft, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues since beginning use.</li>
            <li> is very soft and also it take 2 AA battery&#x27;s and even with them in</li>
            <li> I also was surprised with the high speed.</li>
            <li> This is very gentle and works well; looks simple and neat.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this product and my skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on your face and it makes me feel refreshed by deep cleansing my face each night before bed...</li>
            <li> My skin can be very sensitive</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft</li>
            <li> and then skin is very soft to the touch afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and would prefer a deeper scrub.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to clear up their skin once and for all.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my doctor because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used it with the sample cleanser that was provided and was very surprised with my skin after one use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have very, very oily skin - especially if I am lax in my Retin-A use.</li>
            <li> tre brush hairs are very soft and they&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE HAIR BROSSE IS VERY SOFT.</li>
            <li> My face is very soft and still moist after using the Pro-x.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very soft.</li>
            <li> the bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Maybe it could be to often to use it every day if the skin- type is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft but still does the job.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mechanical cleanser for anyone who is on a budget and needs a at home professional system for skin care.  </li>
            <li> There are machines which cost a couple of hundred dollars, but for the very modest price, this system gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> very soft leaves my face.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> The spinning brush is very very soft . .</li>
            <li> the bristles are very soft</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin that reacts to almost anything with anti-aging ingredients in it, so I didn&#x27;t care for the sample Olay cleanser that this came with.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> My first reaction after taking it out of the box was that it doesn&#x27;t seem cheap at all (compared to the way more expensive Clarisonic)--it seems really solid.</li>
            <li> love that it uses plain old AA batteries and has no fancy chargers.</li>
            <li> After you cleanse your face, they also said you could use items right in your kitchen to keep your skin soft &amp; moist, such as olive oil, coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wake up the next day having amazing skin but the subtle improvements in the texture of my skin was enough for me to say that buying this product was well worth it!</li>
            <li> I wanted the Clairsonic, but I have super sensitive skin, compounded with new issues as I&#x27;m now over 40, and hated the idea of spending that kind of money and then not being able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this device for a little over 2 weeks, I think it is as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just use a little mild facial soap with it if I just want to clean.</li>
            <li> This little one does a good job of keeping my face baby smooth without irritating it or making me red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Olay Pro-X is a really lightweight, small brush, making it easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Works probably just as good as any other professional system while also saving a lot less.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t scrub hard enough to really do much.</li>
            <li> After the first use this worked wonders and left my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> My skin feels super soft and looks immediately brighter after each use, and I think the deep exfoliating is helping clear up my old acne scars.  </li>
            <li> The rotation of the brush is not very powerful and I just don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s getting my skin truly, deeply clean.  </li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and my pores are clear and SHRINKING!</li>
            <li> My pores were completely clear every time I used it!</li>
            <li> My face is now 95% clear!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and it helped clear up his acne!</li>
            <li> it still has the clear gel in the compartment!</li>
            <li> After a couple of days, my nose looked so clear!</li>
            <li> and my skin is clear!  </li>
            <li> After I use it I can see my pores are clear!</li>
            <li> Or anyone with problem skin for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your time, if you&#x27;ve read this far!</li>
            <li> will try and update this review in a few weeks/months to let you know how I&#x27;m doing when not overdoing it! :-)</li>
            <li> Try it - you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> but when you&#x27;re done, your face feels markedly smoother!  </li>
            <li> I normally wash my face in the shower by wetting a washcloth, rubbing some Dove sensitive bar soap on it, then adding a tablespoon or so of baking soda.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> It was my first ever exfoliating facial brush and is just a cheaper alternative I wanted to try out before saving up to buy myself a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> First, the brush head is TINY.</li>
            <li> Now my skin is much more like it used to be - some surface shine, but nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are soft, so your skin won&#x27;t look like you have been attacked by Brillo pads!</li>
            <li> I only use the higher speed.</li>
            <li> I used the exfoliating creme in the box first but then used some burts bees peach and willowbark deep pore scrub.</li>
            <li> a really cool young woman named Valerie has put up a great instructional video on youtube that includes a battery how-to:  [...]    </li>
            <li> I considered getting a more expensive facial scrubber but am glad I got this.</li>
            <li> Buying cheap is never worth it in the long-run.</li>
            <li> They look exactly the same before and after exfoliating.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought since the first one I bought a couple of years ago stopped working (not because of battery replacement).</li>
            <li> I wish the brush head had a higher speed, and that there were multiple brush heads, but it still does the job.</li>
            <li> But really, the difference in the two speeds is barely detectable if at all.  </li>
            <li> so the facial cleaner was something I was interested in.  </li>
            <li> Soft brush, makes skin tingle!</li>
            <li> A cotton ball took off more dead skin!</li>
            <li> Gets deep, I just wish it had another higher speed.</li>
            <li> When I turned it on I actually wondered if this was going to work well, because the two rotations are so gentle and the bristles on the brush head are so gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> and I used it last night for the first time.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for months now and only used it for the first two weeks.</li>
            <li> wow what a difference it makes!</li>
            <li> Also, when I am not lazy and use it in the morning and before bed, I have no blemishes and no break</li>
            <li> So glad I opted for this affordable model over more expensive ones that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> It has gotten rid of my acne, and I rarely have minor zits.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> When I first starting looking into cleansing systems, I was going to go with the Clarisonic Mia</li>
            <li> Definitely comparable to the Clarisonic and so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> i usually do not use Olay products.</li>
            <li> Skin gets veeeerrrry soft and it stimulates blood circulation!</li>
            <li> I think it does an OK job as a small travel cleaning option, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Not a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; system like higher priced products such as ClariSonic&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It is my first facial brush.</li>
            <li> So far I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and oily skin all at once, but this rotating brush doesnt irritate my skin at all!</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and was surprised immediately by the foul odor (all over my face!).  </li>
            <li> I would still be using it if I weren&#x27;t to lazy to buy more of the brushes.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft after washing!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I definitely saw a difference.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of using this every other day I have noticed my pores are smaller, blackheads are fewer, and a healthy glow on my face (not shiny).</li>
            <li> In the past, I tried many products that claimed to dissolve blackheads but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I never knew what it was like for a product to actually \\&quot;make my pores look smaller\\&quot; but that is exactly what this has done.  </li>
            <li> I can not compare this to the Clarisonic as far as cleaning but the price is 1/10th!  </li>
            <li> the biggest thing I&#x27;ve noticed is the blackheads I can never seem to conquer on my nose have almost completely disappeared!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I forgot that I was about to, so I had already done my regular face washing routine and washed my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but don&#x27;t normally have problems with breakouts.  </li>
            <li> My reaction when using the Pro-X for the first time was how different it is from the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day on my skin and the heaviness of makeup and oil completely disappears!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Olay Pro-X cleansing system I must have overdone it a bit because I had some irritation the next day.</li>
            <li> The combination of the cleanser + the brush makes my skin insanely soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it on a trans-Atlantic flight recently, just removing the head first.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product; but, after using it my face is left red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> so I would suggest buying this but be aware you may have to replace it sooner than later.</li>
            <li> It provides the same ease of use and results that I had found the first time around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alive!</li>
            <li> It provides the same ease of use and results that I had found the first time around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alive!</li>
            <li> So lesson learned and removed mascara and eyeshadow first the next day.</li>
            <li> well worth it and lasts long.</li>
            <li> It has worked wonders on my skin so far!</li>
            <li> first began using this shortly after purchasing it in November.</li>
            <li> I like it so far!</li>
            <li> I had wanted this (or a similar, more expensive version of this) for many months before I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I consulted with my dermatologist and she nearly freaked out that I had used this!  </li>
            <li> I can only imagine how the Clarisonic would feel after the first use.  </li>
            <li> First off, Amazon was definitely the cheapest place I could find this, and they allowed me to use a coupon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love how it&#x27;s small, can have it in your shower just like I do ...</li>
            <li> my skin went into a fit, pimples everywhere, blackheads everywhere,and dark marks from those blackheads.</li>
            <li> The brush is tiny and it feels funny when it rotates.</li>
            <li> the price as a first time owner/user of a facial exfoliating system</li>
            <li> criticism is that the brush is TOO SOFT!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for the price I just wish it came with an extra refill brush to use.</li>
            <li> However, men have to do skincare to maintain a studly, youthful appearance and this is a basic beginning regimen all men can benefit from just as much as women!</li>
            <li> It is much better than more the expensive (department store) brand!</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to see this product which had no results at all!..</li>
            <li> had my first facial and the lady discussed with me taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft after using this!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive and oily skin like me, DO NOT USE THIS!</li>
            <li> Was gifted a &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; facial cleaning system and this works the same without the ENORMOUS price</li>
            <li> I love this brush and would definitely recommend this to anyone, male or female!</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter loves the way it makes her skin feel afterwards and if it gets her to wash her face - I&#x27;m all for it!</li>
            <li> Although I must admit I was skeptical after lathering on much more expensive products with excellent reviews from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Just tried my Olay Pro - X for the first time last night and wow!</li>
            <li> Comparing the two they are pretty darn close to the same.  </li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with my Cetaphil daily cleanser and after a week on consistent use</li>
            <li> I actually bought another one when I accidentally left the original during a stay at a hotel.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and never have a problem!</li>
            <li> I use it pretty much daily now.  </li>
            <li> I am using a facial brush for the first time in my 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old and don&#x27;t have very problem skin, however I feel it is difficult to do a good job taking my makeup off at night.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> On tip: Use Facial wipes first to get off any excess make up you may still have on your skin.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this i noticed a big difference.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin after only the first use and have kept it up.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smoother after the first day, and visibly looks smoother on the third day.</li>
            <li> first, which deep cleanses my pores and followed it with the Olay Pro-X system.  </li>
            <li> Small price for a grand result.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This is the first battery powered facial cleanser I have used.</li>
            <li> The first time using it, with low speed, it already made wonder.</li>
            <li> The first one broke after the fourth time I dropped it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been so soft since I started using it!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> this brush come with 2 spinning speech; with the spinning it will help you to form a lot more bubble than usual which will save you on the usage of the cleansing form.  </li>
            <li> I love that this works the same as a device that is hundreds of dollars more expensive.</li>
            <li> (WOW)!</li>
            <li> Like I said I tried it the night I got it in the mail and after using it for the first time I could definitely notice the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!</li>
            <li> I actually feel that the speed is weak--even on the higher setting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first lasted over two years with daily use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it over my lips in the shower too, which was accidental, but worked out well - almost as well as my usual lip scrub. :)</li>
            <li> Better than some of the much more expensive ones!</li>
            <li> This is a personal favorite and an essential part of my daily skin cleansing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It deserves a five out of five because it definitely does exactly what it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a facial brush without trying it first.  </li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have had a soft and a firm bristle brush to interchange with according to ones personal needs.</li>
            <li> this is just another gimmick and the real secret to beautiful skin</li>
            <li> This brush is water-resistant, not water-proof, but I got a new shower rack and the new one will stay clear of the shower spray.  </li>
            <li> They strike a fine balance between being too gentle to do any effective cleaning and too harsh or irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> I normally have visible dry flaky skin but this seemed to buff it right off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably kill the little motor very quickly doing this, but that skin feels smoother, too, so I will continue.  </li>
            <li> Not too soft and absolutely not to hard...</li>
            <li> Main thing is that it really cleans my face and the reason I&#x27;ve been getting breakouts is because my face wasn&#x27;t cleaned enough.</li>
            <li> That is why I liekd this because it moved with greatness and yet did not feel rough, it went deep but left a face behind, and it is easy to use andyet great when it comes to results.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical if this product could clean my face better than just using your hands.    </li>
            <li> My face does feel less dry and it is a nice experience</li>
            <li> I also find that when I use it after washing off my makeup with my regular cleanser, I find that I still get make up on the brush, so I know this is a really deep clean.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and even though I&#x27;m an older woman I was suffering from constant breakouts of acne.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and also have mild rosacea.</li>
            <li> It definitely gives a deep clean and exfoliation.</li>
            <li> and i thought the Pro-X would really help get my face clean and buff away some of the dead skin.</li>
            <li> My oily skin needs extra work certain times of year and this boosted my normal cleanser to the point of noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> After just the very first use all the dry skin on my nose was gone!</li>
            <li> I preferred the stiffer bristles of the other model and felt like my face was squeaky clean and glowing after using it.  </li>
            <li> But other than that, this is a product that each person should buy if they want clean skin.</li>
            <li> I think my skin looks improved, which is important as my job requires daily makeup, the extra boost for deep cleaning without drying out is really helpful.</li>
            <li> Night: After I&#x27;m doing most of my eating and stuff  for the day( only reason is food particles get caught on your face even if you wipe and clean anything just from eating neatly etc, also because of dry skin, sweat, dead skin, pollutants in the air we can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> It takes just a few seconds more in the shower to go over your face, a few extra more to go over your neck.</li>
            <li> The Olay brush is gentle on my face whether I use it on regular or high speed.  </li>
            <li> I did notice right away that my skin was extremely soft and just felt deep down clean.</li>
            <li> I used regular facial cleansing products, nothing special.  </li>
            <li> For that much, I expected it to work better than other methods, but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve not used any other, I have  really liked using this Cleansing System for the last month, especially using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I get more breakouts along my jawline and near my ears and since using this daily to every other day</li>
            <li> When you exfoliate the old skin, you need to take care of the new skin coming up.  </li>
            <li> Do not mix old and new batteries as unit may be damaged.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and gentle on my skin; I actually wish it had a little more substance to it because it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing much cleaning - my skin feels cleaner when I use a rough wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> Now after using the brush and Origins for a month and a half I see a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I now use a light BBcream to cover up the minor blemishes left.  </li>
            <li> It may sound like an odd gift.</li>
            <li> I started using this again and remembered exactly why it&#x27;s worth the few minutes of time it takes to use each day.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth afterward, and I have less breakouts.</li>
            <li> The first, slightly slower speed might be better when using the exfoliating cleanser, and the faster one for just regular daily cleansers.</li>
            <li> This brush helps to exfoliate the upper dead layer of your skin leaving your skin fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> However, the Bristles are not firm enough for a deep clean.</li>
            <li> :) I just put facial cleanser or body wash on the pad and clean behind the ears.</li>
            <li> :) I just put facial cleanser or body wash on the pad and clean behind the ears.</li>
            <li> Size is small and handy even for people with big hands.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin (including rosacea spots on a fairly regular basis.</li>
            <li> I now think that may be true of all such facial cleansing system devices.  </li>
            <li> On the up side of this product, I found that given it&#x27;s small size, it is perfect for cleaning behind your ears.</li>
            <li> On the up side of this product, I found that given it&#x27;s small size, it is perfect for cleaning behind your ears.</li>
            <li> I initially washed my face with my tried and true face cleansing regimine, which left peeling skin on my face and on my toner.</li>
            <li> be careful around hair as it will grab it and tangle it quickly---</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spin as quickly as I had expected.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time today and it left my face feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff that came with it so much, I bought a big bottle and think it&#x27;ll last a couple of years (really) since the little tube is over 4 months old</li>
            <li> I want to explain that even as a teenager, I have never had major acne, and I only rarely get one or two pimples as an adult, but I have a lot of blackheads on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> I do use it daily, it does not tear up my skin as one reviewer mentioned, it has two speeds, is easy to work, does not need the recharger which cuts down on it&#x27;s size, can be left in the shower caddy, and was totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for a young person, or someone with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I cant imagine the more expensive ones doing much of a difference other than making more profit...</li>
            <li> There are always better things out there but don&#x27;t rate down just because you can afford the latter.</li>
            <li> but I certainly didn&#x27;t expect so much of flaking with single use.   </li>
            <li> It gets your skin soft clear and glowing will recommend to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> , I have pretty clear skin, and it is sensitive to boot (Asian skin).  </li>
            <li> I consider myself pretty low maintenance, but thought I&#x27;d try this cleaner to see if it could help shrink size of pores and clean out some black heads.</li>
            <li> My 45 year old skin is so soft now!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expected to work from the very first use.</li>
            <li> I do not know what took me so long to finally purchase one of these facial cleansing brushes, but I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Its way to abrasive for sensitive or somewhat sensitive skin, and using with the cleanser sample it comes with, forget about it!</li>
            <li> My skin has not felt so soft since I was a young girl!  </li>
            <li> It is a kind of weak</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not getting red from irritation but from blood-flow to my skin, which really helps kick-start new cells growing.    </li>
            <li> if your new to the whole facial exfoliating thing like I&#x27;am.</li>
            <li> You think the brush will be too soft and the little battery operated machine won&#x27;t be powerful enough to clean your face well, but after using it I was amazed at how smooth my skin felt and how much dead skin it removed.</li>
            <li> My pores are less prominent and appear smaller.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with my purchase and the fact the Amazon price is significantly less than the shelf price at the local, national pharmacy chain store.  </li>
            <li> The best part it is less expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and not too harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re fine with mediocre, then this is probably just fine.</li>
            <li> is a super simple brush however brings a deep cleansing of the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23-year-old woman with mild to moderate acne, and every pimple I get leaves a hyperpigmented mark that can last for upwards of 2 years!</li>
            <li> I use this daily with a mild facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I suppose it has to be a tight fit</li>
            <li> Second, if you have very sensitive skin, use a gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> guess if you have VERY sensitive skin and are looking for an affordable way to GENTLY massage your face OUTSIDE of the shower, this may be acceptable, but I saw ZERO results either visibly or in how my skin felt.</li>
            <li> The cleanser was gentle and it left my skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> is much more effective, much less expensive, and doesn&#x27;t require batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to be 41 next month and although my skin looks much younger than my age, I was starting to notice larger pores, sun spots, and very fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Probably not worth what I paid for it, but it does clean.</li>
            <li> And once it was open, the second and third time I tried opening and closing it, it opened up really easily with no problem at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s about the same, with one slight edge: the Pro-X is like a daily massage for your face and it does feel quite nice and relaxing as opposed to the scrubbing with the scratchy exfoliating pads.</li>
            <li> She feels this is a gadget she would not normally purchase and that she often does not want to take the time to achieve the results it is capable of providing if one wants to spend the time and money.</li>
            <li> It is pretty much like any of those other micro-bead scrubber fash washes.  </li>
            <li> Is working fine after a few months.</li>
            <li> Left my skin red and even more dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cleanser that comes with the Pro-X is pretty much on-par with other microdermabrasive cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush head are super soft and gentle but you do need to replace them every few weeks.</li>
            <li> After two failed attempts at trying to find a good, cheaper alternative to the results I desire, I finally broke down and came back to Amazon for this amazing system.</li>
            <li> After two failed attempts at trying to find a good, cheaper alternative to the results I desire, I finally broke down and came back to Amazon for this amazing system.</li>
            <li> I suffer with moderate chin acne, large pores and oily T zone area.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and purchased a large bottle of the same cleanser that comes with the brush.</li>
            <li> Since I began using this brush I&#x27;ve notice my skin is smoother and my pores (which have always been large, no matter what I do) are smaller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the box in which I bought the brush showed what seemed a much large bottle of exfoliating cleanser than actually came in the package.  </li>
            <li> I have large deep pores.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this little treat.  </li>
            <li> The majority of the people reviewing this item are correct, it&#x27;s a fantastic little skin exfoliator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made a little cheap</li>
            <li> Even after a few months, I&#x27;m still using the original batteries and brushes, so it&#x27;s pretty low maintenance.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot more, this weakly powered brush did nothing to improve my skin, I get better results using a Buf-Puf facial sponge.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve just been using the exfoliating scrub it comes with, which has large granules; however, I plan using it with the Neutrogena facial scrubs.</li>
            <li> My face was clean, my pores were tight and my skin was so soft!</li>
            <li> I just love this little facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Many of us often overlook the simple step of washing our face, when little do we know it can make all the difference.</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because although I love the pro-x, I wish the speed of it were a little faster.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it&#x27;s made my regular cleanser work a little better.</li>
            <li> Seems to work better when not pressed hard.  </li>
            <li> product itself works fine, but I&#x27;ve never expected that it would break down so soon.</li>
            <li> it is a nice gadget, especially for the price - but two things to think about, and I guess this goes for any beauty product: (1) Is it really that great, or would you get the same results from using anything other than your fingers to wash your face?  </li>
            <li> I love this little gadget!!</li>
            <li> For the normal price, I&#x27;d rate it lower just because it is overpriced generally for a little spinning bristle device that must be incredibly cheap to manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I use my Pro-x in the shower, but am a little more careful not to leave it under the water stream as much as I would with the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Make sure you keep it dry after every time your using it ,or it will stop working due to the circuit shortage from humidity.</li>
            <li> It really gets down deep into my pores to clean out all makeup, etc.</li>
            <li> clear up deep cystic acne but does seem to help surface acne &amp; black heads, and it creates a very clean palette for applying whatever else you put on</li>
            <li> I had a full face of makeup on and simply splashed my face with water, rubbed the exfoliating cleanser onto my skin and used the brush on low speed about 1 minute and then high speed for the second minute.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this product was just fine, but it was very harsh, so I could only use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment door can be a source of considerable frustration if, like many, you have a hard time prying it open, however I found that by using a wiggling motion and gripping with the heel of my hand, it comes off without too much trouble.    </li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t bad to start with but is really looking great.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely compelled to share the great results after a bad day under the sun.  </li>
            <li> I did skip a few days and could tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give an accurate review now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few months.</li>
            <li> It removes the makeup from my face clearly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always washed my skin carefully, but it has never felt this smooth and silky, I see a definite difference from using this.  </li>
            <li> MY FACE LOOKS SO HEALTHLY AND CLEAR.  </li>
            <li> and her face is finally clear</li>
            <li> Its such a great value that you almost can&#x27;t go wrong by trying it.</li>
            <li> but my old one had a much bigger brush and spun much faster</li>
            <li> can make u face really clean, but has no effect on black nose!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have clear skin.</li>
            <li> you can clearly feel the before and after difference......</li>
            <li> If you have extremely sensitive or perhaps acne prone skin, then this tool is gentle enough for you.  </li>
            <li> After a month, my face is softer and my skin is clear.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but still firm to scrub your face and my face is really smooth after it.</li>
            <li> You can clearly tell a difference in results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to say my skin got any clearer from acne since I&#x27;ve already had rather clear skin.</li>
            <li> AND THE BRUSH REALLY CLEANS DEEP TO RID MY SKIN OF DIRT, OIL, AND OLD MAKEUP.</li>
            <li> My skin has clearly improved since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m all clear again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen my skin this clear since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> It does the job, though it isn&#x27;t as powerful as some of the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> I have a problem with my t-zone being too dry or oily and finding products to scrub my face till I actually feel clean.</li>
            <li> just Yes to Cucumber Daily Gentle Cleanser because my face is sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic is clearly the luxury item with the Pro-X</li>
            <li> I feel my face gets clear using a wash</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t hurt just made it really red.</li>
            <li> The directions are clear.</li>
            <li> Got this for my teen aged son who has some keratosis pilaris on his face and he was hoping it would help that and smooth it a bit.  </li>
            <li> Let me be clear, this product hasn&#x27;t given me any issues.</li>
            <li> Figured I&#x27;d give this a try to get a deeper clear.</li>
            <li> but my face wouldn&#x27;t clear up.</li>
            <li> Whoa... This thing is tiny, and the bristles are too soft and the whole thing is like a toy...</li>
            <li> None of them have done anything to help clear up my face.</li>
            <li> This does the job and is gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin is clear than ever</li>
            <li> But, since I haven&#x27;t used Clarisonic yet, I&#x27;m not sure if this Olay one is generally on par with Clarisonic or just more</li>
            <li> It is soft and gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> It has helped clear up some acne and reduced my pores.</li>
            <li> Far less acne, my skin was smoother and clearer and felt truly clean and not irritated!&lt;br /&gt;I use this product once a day.....</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t say that I have completely clear skin, its not a miracle worker</li>
            <li> I am 65 and had a few lumps and bumps on my face but since using this cleansing system my face is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have notice both of my daughters skin had clear up.</li>
            <li> i moved on to using the AMBI EVEN &amp; CLEAR Foaming Cleanse, with the brush.</li>
            <li> and it took 3 weeks for my skin to clear after I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> Just give your skin time to clear.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth giving a try as an alternative to the more expensive brushes on the market.</li>
            <li> I use both the cleansing exfoliation cream that was included with the brush system as well as the Olay Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol cleansing cream and acne cream.</li>
            <li> this product would make it slightly easier to clean your face if you didn&#x27;t have say, a wash cloth around, or failing that, a paper towel with some</li>
            <li> I find the combination of the rotary brush and the gritty cleanser to be a bit much for my sensitive skin, so I use Cetaphil face wash on it.  </li>
            <li> My skin has always had breakouts my whole entire adult life</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the function and the actual piece of equipment is great.</li>
            <li> The brush is gentle enough for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product that compares equally with the expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I used the Olay exfoliator that came with it once and then stopped as I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It has two speeds and the brushes are surprisingly soft.  </li>
            <li> I researched this product before buying it, even to the point of watching several videos on you tube comparing it to the much pricier Clarisonic Mia 2.</li>
            <li> I ended up out of town unexpectedly, without my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> This really does make your pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> The cleansing brush for this is so soft.</li>
            <li> WOULD definitely recommend for anyone who wants cleaner skin.</li>
            <li> Both are young adults.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to a $200 one, but I have seen a complete difference in my complexion...</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I wash my face with Olay&#x27;s Sensitive skin foaming face wash to take off all my make-up and rinse everything off.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> When I put my make-up I feel like my face has a natural glow instead of the cakey face that I had before I started using the cleansing</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30s with oily skin.</li>
            <li> tried the brush with the sample cleanser provided and you really feel you&#x27;re getting a face massage or facial.</li>
            <li> Just when I was almost in tears and ready to give up, boom, it comes open.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only owned this for two month and my skin already looks much healthier then before.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> On the bottom of the instrument, below the gray off and on buttons and the line, are words Olay Professional.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s really changed anything about my overall skin tone or texture</li>
            <li> Olay-Olay&#x27;s is twice as soft as the SOFT toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> This product has a brush head that spins and cleans so much quicker than a standard brush.</li>
            <li> I am a 31-year old woman who has some adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I dab an exfoliator and cleanser on my face because I found that if I put them directly on the pad and then turned it on, the stuff immediately flew off all over the place.   </li>
            <li> It leaves skin feeling completely cleansed and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> but I really wanted something to wash my face differently.</li>
            <li> , just let the circular soft brush do</li>
            <li> So, just a warning ti keep it out of direct water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face felt so soft, but I feel like the luster is wearing out.</li>
            <li> I rinsed my face expecting to feel baby soft skin after the ordeal</li>
            <li> I wanted similar brush but didn&#x27;t want to spend as much money.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Now my skin is completely wretched.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the box say to gently rock the battery compartment cover from side to side while pulling with the same hand.  </li>
            <li> Then it died unexpectedly.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face feel the way it soft as a baby&#x27;s bum .</li>
            <li> I am mid 20s and have very congested but dry/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re only supposed to use it for 60 seconds, I think, but that goes by quite fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also since learned that skin problems -- at least of the oil/blackhead/zit variety -- have more to do with what&#x27;s going on in your skin than on your skin.</li>
            <li> The brushes for this thing are as soft as the brushes they sell for babies hair.</li>
            <li> I use Cetaphil (it&#x27;s for sensitive skin))</li>
            <li> and I immediately notice how soft my skin is after use.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try one of the Clarisonic systems, but I felt nervous about spending so much money on such a product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 years old and still wondering why I have acne.</li>
            <li> It clearly works, as far as cleansing goes -</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> but i wish the whole industry (not only Olay, but Neutrogena and Clarisonic too) would stop pushing this &amp;#34;daily cleansing&amp;#34; crap...&lt;br /&gt;your</li>
            <li> Deep cleansing with a gentle massage.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe the batteries were just old and decided to replace them.  </li>
            <li> The brush head did not irritate my sensitive skin  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft and the unit is durable.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it 5-6 times so far.</li>
            <li> do not waste your $.  </li>
            <li> The brush is amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li> The break out I had on my chin is completely cleared.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I started using the Pro-X system that I actually realized how much of my make-up and oils remained on my skin after my nightly cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> and I wish I had bought that with my initial order to be ready.</li>
            <li> It deep cleans, exfoliates, shrinks my pores and makes my skin creams go in much nicer.</li>
            <li> It has completely changed my skin, I had milia on my cheeks for yearsss and nothing could get rid of them.</li>
            <li> and I did not put it near my face out of fear of what it is.</li>
            <li> so I googled instructions which said \\&quot;gently rock\\&quot; the battery compartment and pull at the same time.</li>
            <li> The brushes are incredibly soft, by the way.  </li>
            <li> If they seem to go too fast, I may get the rechargeables recommended in an earlier review.    </li>
            <li> much cheaper than the similar product</li>
            <li> I have been using this Olay pro-x cleansing brush for about two months now and everything seems to work so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, so was surprised.  </li>
            <li> For me they are too soft.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was really surprised by how well this Olay Cleansing System works.</li>
            <li> So whoever said they needed a kitchen knife is probably an old fart with arthritis or something.  </li>
            <li> Scrubs away all the dirt, old skin, everything...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy (yes guy) and I am in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m way too old for pimples at this stage of my life.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft.  </li>
            <li> It has a soft brush</li>
            <li> I would say the results are very close with my traditional way of cleansing, and with my clogged pores I can literally see the difference after I&#x27;ve finished.</li>
            <li> No messy device that gets gunked up.</li>
            <li> Next I tried this and found it really works.</li>
            <li> I paid 28 bucks for mine and even then I cringed at the thought of paying that much on something like this, but I have to say that after regularly using it myself...</li>
            <li> it gently cleans deep into your pores.</li>
            <li> My cheeks, forehead, chin and nose are so soft, I can&#x27;t get over it.</li>
            <li> Brushes too soft.  </li>
            <li> Olay offers a guarantee so use it</li>
            <li> It has made our skin so soft and cleared up our blemishes.  </li>
            <li> My skin is acne prone and sensitive, but this keeps my skin clear and glowing.</li>
            <li> That proved to be too much for me and my skin got quite red.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after waiting for the price to drop as I thought they were asking too much for it initially.</li>
            <li> The brush head is fairly soft so it doesn&#x27;t make my skin act up</li>
            <li> I have priced others similar to this for as much as 3 times the cost.</li>
            <li> My skin is baby soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin that is naturally oily, but of course dries out with acne product usage.  </li>
            <li> the old fashion way but</li>
            <li> That was partly why my expectations were low, but I discovered I didn&#x27;t feel much qualitative difference</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product has, by far, exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it not a few months</li>
            <li> It leaves my 50-year-old skin feeling soft and brightens the complexion.  </li>
            <li> well the old fashioned way.</li>
            <li> I read in a magazine that gently exfoliating your face regularly would help this problem.</li>
            <li> After hearing Dr. Oz&#x27;s recommendation I began researching the Olay Professional Pro-X Cleansing System.  </li>
            <li> but I find that a few times a week keeps my face blackhead free.  </li>
            <li> Even &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; type moisturizing products will cause me to have breakouts and blisters on my face.  </li>
            <li> I find using it in the shower is very convenient because the casing is totally waterproof.  </li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> WOW WOW.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and this has helped my skin clear up like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li> After hearing Dr. Oz&#x27;s recommendation I began researching the Olay Professional Pro-X Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> Olay Professional Pro-X Anti-Aging Starter Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> :B001JQLNNW Olay Professional Pro-X Anti-Aging Starter Kit]]</li>
            <li> This had soft brushes to replaced every 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done microderm before and this scrubber is very comparable if used regularly.  </li>
            <li> I use Clarisil cleanser for sensitive skin and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I decided to use this brush for daily cleansing because of the soft, but powerful brush that provides a deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li> My face is so soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> , it is a bit too intense for daily use.  </li>
            <li> my skin was baby soft as it was years ago.  </li>
            <li> I walked out of the bathroom, and my husband asked if I had used the PROx, because he had noticed how refreshed and soft my skin was looking.  </li>
            <li> I get a natural glow that I having searching for&#x27; Got it on sale</li>
            <li> This purchase not only provided that but also a gentle electronic tool to deliver the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am presently surprised.</li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t do near what the Clarisonic does.</li>
            <li> buying $200 Clarisonics for their adult children.</li>
            <li> I went to bed, woke up this morning and WOW.  </li>
            <li> Id see how the $30 \\&quot;version\\&quot; worked for my sensitive, acne-prone, multi-textured skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough difference that for the fast setting I have to move the product around faster</li>
            <li> Pores are appearing smaller and much smoother.</li>
            <li> My skin is combination and not known to be sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> The brush seemed soft at the beginning</li>
            <li> Not a firm brush</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally know much about this</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and use this a couple times a week with no problem.  </li>
            <li> My skin is combination, leaning towards sensitive, and it doesn&#x27;t like being scrubbed with this twice a day</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft, so it doesn&#x27;t feel scratchy on your face at all, but it still feels like it&#x27;s exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It came with several attachments which over the years could be replaced for a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li> With this purchase I did not pay as much attention as I should have when reviewing different makes.  </li>
            <li> I do not remember the brand name of the old one and so do not know if it is still made.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be too abrasive, but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I store the unit in the shower so that it&#x27;s always ready to use, and the constant exposure to moisture hasn&#x27;t affected it in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me start out saying that I&#x27;m 57 years old.</li>
            <li> There is no reason to pay this much when it has the same effect as just hand exfoliating with baking soda or another type of scrub.</li>
            <li> Soft and relaxing</li>
            <li> Completely recommend.</li>
            <li> This unit uses an electric motor to spin a soft brush wheel in one direction.</li>
            <li> When used properly, it provides a gentle cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews complained of peeling and drying out.</li>
            <li> The next day, she told me her whole face started redness after using this product.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN FEELS BABY SOFT</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel complete if I don&#x27;t was my face with this,</li>
            <li> old)</li>
            <li> like the soft bristle</li>
            <li> sister bought the Clairsonic and it doesn&#x27;t do anything much for her, but in all fairness, she hasn&#x27;t been using it daily</li>
            <li> , I have moderately sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have slightly sensitive skin, comes w/ age</li>
            <li> Olay offers a money-back guarantee.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had an adult onset of acne that is driving me nuts, and being in my 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on a Clarisonic system.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the bristles are soft</li>
            <li> However im using it with a Natural face wash and it works great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after a while my skin became so sensitive to UV.</li>
            <li> A bit of an adjustment and takes longer to feel you have covered your whole face properly.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only two settings, fast and medium/slow.  </li>
            <li> There are no cons about this item as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> but I do like the product and have had no issues with function so far.</li>
            <li> I use it daily for gentle exfoliation</li>
            <li> It softly massages your face as it cleans.  </li>
            <li> whatever cleanser I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s holding up, works well and no complaints</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , I have noticed such a difference in my skin, it is so much clearer</li>
            <li> It makes my face so soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> The brush head feels so soft and works well on my face.</li>
            <li> I use this in my face regime, of late I have been using it more often</li>
            <li> This product is doing it&#x27;s job so far.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but deceiving in that they do the job.</li>
            <li> wanted a gentle scrubbing deep cleaning appliance</li>
            <li> I could use frequently</li>
            <li> offers 2 speeds  </li>
            <li> This is a bit too soft.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and takes care of any dryness without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a feeble-handed 3 year old child, suffering from muscle atrophy, aimlessly scrubbing your face with a soft toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are gentle and feel as if they are massaging my face.&lt;br /&gt;Since I often do facial peels, the brush helps me to exfoliate all the remaining peeling skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After only using this for a week, my skin began to really improve.  </li>
            <li> I still break out because my acne is stress related, but the brush helps get rid of my breakouts so much faster.</li>
            <li> The cleanser, however, must have been old or in some way tainted.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough for every day use and still leaves skin feeling cleaned and refreshed!</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li> Overall, I much preferred the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised by its efficiency</li>
            <li> Did not have any problems with batteries so far.</li>
            <li> The soft brushes cleaned my face softly, but thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The cleanser that is included is also an exfoliating cream, and if that is too much exfoliation, just use a regular facewash.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use twice a day!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect to see such a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Think this soft-</li>
            <li> then of course the teens years settle in, insecurity, stress and sensitive skin became my nightmare.</li>
            <li> Also, if you know for a face that your skin is extremely sensitive to exfoliating, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Also, if you know for a face that your skin is extremely sensitive to exfoliating, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> the bristles moved fast enough and were the texture to where it did remove all my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Brush head is soft and not overly abrasive.  </li>
            <li> I developed acne in my forehead.  </li>
            <li> It does leave my skin soft...</li>
            <li> I can actually feel the difference in my skin, my face feels so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> (use Albolene at night only because it is really greasy).</li>
            <li> Soft relaxing bristles.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily, I have sensitive areas and some rosacea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works wonders on my skin so much so that even my esthetician made a comment about my skin quality when she was doing my facial.</li>
            <li> really makes a difference in the overall texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> thousands of great reviews but ill add my own because im bored.</li>
            <li> This brush gets deep in the pores of my skin and really cleans.</li>
            <li> Skin feels much softer and smoother with regular use</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to a Clairsonic as I have never used one, but if you&#x27;re looking to start somewhere at a reasonable price, I would definitely choose this!</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I do not use the product that came with it.  </li>
            <li> scrubber heads are gentle enough but get the job done.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels as I am cleaning my face and have noticed a difference in my breakouts after only using it a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a college student in my really early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I wanted to begin my preventative care early on, 2.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I could also see that much of the gunk that has been clogged deep in my pores of  are also surfacing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21 year old college student with combination skin</li>
            <li> It truley works my face is so soft and my complextion is even.</li>
            <li> I started using this device a few weeks ago, and it has already become an indispensable part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Its a soft scrub - not irrating to the skin.</li>
            <li> I like this cleansing brush, it leaves my face feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> makes me feel like i really cleaned out my oily facial pores.</li>
            <li> and it really helps exfoliate and deep cleanse.  </li>
            <li> I have not had it a month, and the battery compartment is completely rusted.  </li>
            <li> My old one has a buffer as well as a face massager.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating lotion will leave your skin soft and youthful.</li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this 4 days ago along with the OZ Natural Vitamin C Serum and have used it approx.</li>
            <li> In fact, I use the sensitive brushes on my Clarisonic and they still feel somewhat abrasive.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old keeps &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My skin felt so smooth the few times I washed them.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 12 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, and it works, but I wonder what the Clarisonic is like because supposedly with the Clarisonic, the bristles move so fast that you can&#x27;t see them move with the human eye.  </li>
            <li> The makeup is completely gone within a matter of seconds.  </li>
            <li> and this makes my skin feel SO soft.</li>
            <li> The pads are too soft, too.  </li>
            <li> I am what you would call a naturally pizza faced programmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who really does any of that exfoiliating stuff -- when I was under the power of the red bumps I used to try everything to no avail</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use this near your eyes, but</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old woman with sensitive skin with a touch of Roseacea.</li>
            <li> It is so soft, dewey and glowing.</li>
            <li> One thing that really attracted me to this product--other than the low cost--was the fact that you can use it with any cleanser you like.</li>
            <li> old daughter.</li>
            <li> A lot of the damage caused from using Proactive is completely disappearing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft enough to not tug the skin, but powerful enough to do its job.  </li>
            <li> It was completely undamaged.  </li>
            <li> The brush head lasts a pretty long time, i replaced it after about 100 uses (2-3 months).  </li>
            <li> The low speed is useless to me, but I would use it if I was able to use the pumice stone attachment from the TEI Spa brush set (doesn&#x27;t fit....</li>
            <li> really needs to step up to the competition and offer different textures of brush heads.</li>
            <li> Completely exfoliates.  </li>
            <li> For me the Olay Professional brush is a downgrade so to speak.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, all you sensitive skin people out there, use caution.</li>
            <li> They get the job done well of deep cleaning (skin, pores, and blackheads,) and gently exfoliating the skin.  </li>
            <li> My parents are visiting, andI plugged in my old NutraSonic for my dad to take apart and see if it&#x27;s something he could fix for me.</li>
            <li> My parents are visiting, and I plugged in my old NutraSonic for my dad to take apartand</li>
            <li> Because your eye skin is so sensitive, I don&#x27;t use it around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Skin doesn&#x27;t really feel that different.</li>
            <li> And if you have delicate skin, I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the quality and pleasantly surprised with all it could do.</li>
            <li> Now I do not have a sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li> Build up between the bristles early on...</li>
            <li> But this get the job done if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used my mother&#x27;s Clarisonic before and it would irritate my sensitive sinuses.</li>
            <li> My face is so much smoother in this short time.</li>
            <li> I am a busy person</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin at all, but I do notice all day</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin, this probably won&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> The brush is too soft, had I known prier to purchasing, I would have not bought it.</li>
            <li> I had an old brush (not from Olay) that would pulsate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who finds the rotary action distracting -</li>
            <li> I no longer have any adult acne breakouts</li>
            <li> Olay offers refunds and (2)</li>
            <li> Does not actually have much strength.</li>
            <li> I figured this would be a reasonable stand in on a short term basis.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spin fast enough and the brush head is all wobbly.</li>
            <li> So far I&lt;br /&gt;am</li>
            <li> Cleans thoroughly but not harshly.  </li>
            <li> Using this 2x weekly for the last couple of months has really improved the look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> The breakouts have disappeared and my skin is soft and clear.</li>
            <li> Selo recminedo a cualuier persona que este interesado en tener una piel limpa y natural.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how soft this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I had a TIME of it setting the battery compartment free and was so scared I would destroy the device with all the pulling</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Twin granddaughters just turned 11 years old.  </li>
            <li> I really like this facial cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product with the hope of discovering cleaner feeling skin and along with this came unexpected smoothness and a healthier look to my skin.</li>
            <li> Not enough power in it to really do much.</li>
            <li> Do not use skin sensitive people.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li> That cleanser has charcoal (a natural exfoliant), so I figured that it would work well with the Pro-X.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> However i was pleasantly surprised by the pro x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> started off using the Olay Pro-X brush morning and evening and after 2 days I had phenomenal results, to the point that I received several compliments on the third day from both male and female colleagues on my &#x60;glowing skin&#x27; at work!</li>
            <li> The bristles are way too soft for my skin though.</li>
            <li> I really like the way these work so going to look for a different brand.</li>
            <li> May be it also depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne, and while I have had a few more breakouts lately, this brush also seems to help smooth the places over.  </li>
            <li> I still prefer a washcloth for the complete cleansing process</li>
            <li> soft bristles and water proof.</li>
            <li> Although, I did purchase the extra brush heads, so I&#x27;ll be ready when the time comes.</li>
            <li> and i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend this to every one who has sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This was not even close to being anywhere near comparable.</li>
            <li> and I find the brush to be soft and non-irritating</li>
            <li> I still use cleansers for sensitive skin with it because I need it but the scrub brush doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin as an adult and</li>
            <li> have sensitive, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> FYI, I have sensitive part-Asian skin and found no irritation from this system nor the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I already knew to be weary of installing the batteries as most people complained about in their reviews but got them installed with no problem at all.</li>
            <li> but I was surprised there were no instructions included with it.  </li>
            <li> It is an extremely soft brush  that will NOT hurt your face.  </li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all..</li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t wow&#x27;d me or helped improve my skin dramatically</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel so soft after using it.</li>
            <li> this product completely clogged my pores, and caused a breakout in the likes I have never had before.</li>
            <li> Once again, I have sensitive skin, however I have never had a face cleanser cause acne</li>
            <li> They are bigger so you can use them for your whole body, but consequently not as packable.</li>
            <li> I am amazed how well it worked for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do not have particularly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> She absolutely adores this brush and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> The bristle are soft and the cleaning is thorough.</li>
            <li> I would next time just buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> B0012J135O Olay Complete Night</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> This product has completely fixed my acne.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and no longer breaks out.</li>
            <li> cause I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> but it is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like it because his skin is too sensitive and it makes him break out.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to folks who have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and there is no such thing as too much exfoliation for my skin.</li>
            <li> ( I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> Just wish it had different brushes to add, but hey, that&#x27;s why u buy the high priced Clarisonic!  </li>
            <li> and it completely stop working.</li>
            <li> and my face is so soft.  </li>
            <li> It is soft, but yet, cleans away the dirt and oils not wanted on your skin.</li>
            <li> However, I DO NOT use the exfoliating cleanser as I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used my every day acne cleanser, Boscia clear complexion cleanser, which i would recommend to anyone with sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost completely gone with no use of scar reduction formula, just the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost completely gone with no use of scar reduction formula, just the brush.</li>
            <li> The olay system is no where near as soft on your skin and as I have very sensative skin it made it really red and irritable.  </li>
            <li> it helps make my skin so soft</li>
            <li> But, it works, does the job (as far as I can tell), &amp; is super-affordable.</li>
            <li> Esp for the price, using it daily really helps to tighten and decrease the size of pores as well as making my complexion smoother and healthier</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> only real criticism is that it requires batteries instead of being rechargeable.</li>
            <li> So far I do not have any complaints.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this one works just as well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use on mature skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily, yet sensitive in areas.</li>
            <li> or whatever ( sensitive , combination )</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> i do wish the cleanser had mroe natural ingridents.</li>
            <li> This facial scrubber gently cleans your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, it&#x27;s clear, it glows,</li>
            <li> i am a mother of a 26 year old and a 21 year old....</li>
            <li> I found that I really like Burts Bees Radiance Facial Cleanser, except that it is not an exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> This creates blood circulation like you get from a professional face massage.  </li>
            <li> Yet, would recommend for price sensitive buyers.</li>
            <li> My face is soooo soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> The speed is not efficient, it goes through batteries fast and the brush is tiny.</li>
            <li> Cleans off all dead tissue, and leaves your face smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> I had to search utube to put in the batteries, but no problems once this was complete.</li>
            <li> Seems to be very sturdy and replacement heads can be found at our local drug stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young adult with combination skin.</li>
            <li> i thought i would try this one, and i was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> my face feel so much cleaner then using a facial clothes.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for self conscious teenagers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to have that Professional cleaning and this product brings that to budget conscious people like me.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive and it seemed like I always had a problem with black-heads on my nose and chin</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin and this does not bother it at all.  </li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin baby soft</li>
            <li> I personally wouldn&#x27;t use it that much if you tend to have</li>
            <li> My sister does facials professionally</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 years old with no wrinkles showing yet, thank God...</li>
            <li> I bought one for my 12 year old daughter too.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t meant to be used by people with sensitive skin, it should clearly have stated that.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are gentle on both speeds, but cleans deep enough to really exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I use together with Cerave facial wash to avoid too much abrasive on my skins.</li>
            <li> But overall really like this product.</li>
            <li> But the brush was not as soft as I thought.</li>
            <li> I wanted the Clarisonic, but didn&#x27;t really have the cash to fork over for such a luxury.</li>
            <li> As a side note, my 3 year old daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter still loves it though...</li>
            <li> ...better than a washcloth by far.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s done both.</li>
            <li> The results are comparable to professional skin treatments that I have paid $120 for.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my young daughter to use</li>
            <li> Only spins one direction, and it uses the battery really fast.</li>
            <li> I had no idea it was going to be so professional.</li>
            <li> And its completely waterproof</li>
            <li> am elderly and it helps my skin to stay clear and soft.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and started to notice dryness in my skin around 28 years old.</li>
            <li> old....</li>
            <li> And its makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> It came with an exfoliating cleanser that so far has not bothered my skin.  </li>
            <li> For sensitive skin just use it on the lower speed.</li>
            <li> Not heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks of using this -- my complexion was much smoother and my pores smaller.</li>
            <li> The Olay ProX makes my skin feel so much cleaner and smoother than regular washing.  </li>
            <li> It developed a glow I hadn&#x27;t seen in years.</li>
            <li> Too soft for my taste .</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> My face definitely feels cleaner when I use this, and I don&#x27;t really have complaints.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft on my face</li>
            <li> It far surpassed my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I could not get used to the rotating action of the Pro-X</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wayyyy too soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30-years old and</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My old one died on my</li>
            <li> I hope this one will last much longer.  </li>
            <li> just like it used to do when I was in my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have used mine in the shower twice per day for about a month and have no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> plan to buy one for my 23 year old daughter and my sister-in-law</li>
            <li> I have used mine in the shower twice per day for about a month and have no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> plan to buy one for my 23 year old daughter and my sister-in-law</li>
            <li> the brushing head on the scrubber feel so so soft</li>
            <li> even in my adult years it&#x27;s never gone away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Throughout highschool and parts of my early adulthood</li>
            <li> suffer from Rosecea and my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> because while my skin is definitely softer and feels cleaner, it hasn&#x27;t really seemed to help with breakouts or blackheads.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and not harmful to face.</li>
            <li> But later doesn&#x27;t change my skin that much.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it nearly every night since I got it.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old son even gave it a go in the tub and said it was &amp;#34;cool, I guess, for something that just cleans you&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So far it is working well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and have combination skin.</li>
            <li> It buffs away dead skin and leaves my face SILKY smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin smooth and exfoliates the dead skin  and brings glow to your face.</li>
            <li> and it made my face so soft.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - I&#x27;ve gone back to apricot scrubs and get a much better result for pore cleansing.</li>
            <li> I actually thought it would be more gentle on my skin since the exfoliating beads are so tiny, but it felt harsh, so I choose not to use it.</li>
            <li> I find it only takes an extra minute of my time to get cleaner fresh results when washing my face &amp; using this product.</li>
            <li> The only time it is useful is if I use an actual salt scrub with it (not the wimpy scrub it comes with).  </li>
            <li> this facial cleanser states that it is safe for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only wish they would give three brush heads and charge us a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> She still uses it and has tried a few different Olay cleansers but hopes it would be better.  </li>
            <li> The exfolating beads are not too harsh and when my skin is properly exfoliated, my skin is much more receptive to any product that I use afterwards.</li>
            <li> It definitely cleans better than with just face wash alone and the brush is not abrasive or harsh.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I decided to start off with this cleansing system to determine whether the more expensive product was worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting the job done and was well worth the money spent on it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I ONLY use the brush twice a week to prevent any harsh side effects on my skin, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I personally feel my skin looking and feeling better with the brush exfoliating my skin everyday and probably helps absorbs the face wash and face creams.  </li>
            <li> battery does provide enough power, didn&#x27;t care for it&#x27;s cleaning; know you don&#x27;t want anything that is too powerful or that would hurt your skin, but still didn&#x27;t feel it cleaned properly</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help keep the dead skin removed, to exfoliate, to stimulate circulation for a better complexion, but in fact, it worked the opposite.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt work as good but it wasnt as expensive.</li>
            <li> I use the more vigorous speed at night while removing make-up and then use the gentle slow speed briefly in the morning before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It was working good but not perfect.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m out the money for this and now ill have to shell out the 100 for the good one.</li>
            <li> Works as good as the expensive items.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the expensive pro cleaning systems.  </li>
            <li> So needless to say, she loved the brush.</li>
            <li> slow spin... wanted something more.</li>
            <li> She loved it, but unfortunately after dropping it a number of times it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Good product but not awesome</li>
            <li> /&gt;While in the shower getting ready for work, OK I exfoliated/ used the Olay Pro-X for approximately 2 minutes give or take.  </li>
            <li> I would have preferred stiffer bristles - I don&#x27;t get that lovely deep down clean feeling that I&#x27;ve had with other similar products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, I have very dry, sensitive skin, so maybe this works better for other skin types.</li>
            <li> cleaning tool is a very soft brush that spins on two settings, either high or low.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, quiet, easy to use and it cleans my face really well.  </li>
            <li> I had a problem with constantly getting a blemish right around my eyebrow area (likely from using waxy eyebrow pencils to define my brows).  </li>
            <li> February 2013: I actually received a Clarisonic as a gift last year and didn&#x27;t feel right leaving this review as it was.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this in the future, but for right now I think I&#x27;ll stick to physical stores.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it compared to other higher priced cleansing brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush is small, soft , and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the shower too and it stays perfectly clean and is water tight.</li>
            <li> Some words of advice, make sure you place the scrubbing brush firmly against your skin BEFORE you turn the Pro-X on, or you will sling stuff everywhere!!</li>
            <li> I dont think i will ever go back to just normal face wash anymore this product worked wonders!</li>
            <li> so soft - Thought what the hell is this little head going to clean that I cant get out of my washcloth.</li>
            <li> I have been looking at the clarisonic mia but did not really want to spend that amount of money right now so decided to try this.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful, even with fresh batteries.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if its cleaning deep down in my pores either, but I guess for the price its pretty decent.</li>
            <li> The portability and small size make it easy to pack and travel.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and remove dead skin!</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling and looking clean and exfoliated, but it wasn&#x27;t any more difficult.  </li>
            <li> , I know that my face has to be the extreme end of the spectrum and many people won&#x27;t have the rough and beat up skin as I had</li>
            <li> The product mentioned that the brush is tiny enough to clean pores, I don&#x27;t agree (I have big pores).</li>
            <li> It definitely cleans better than my bare hands, but not as I expected or I maybe expected too much as I wished it could rotate both ways.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life my skin was extremely dry and flaking everywhere.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know you could get rid of small blackheads easily like this one would do.</li>
            <li> I love theirs Pro-X face cream, but this cleansing system is particularly a failure.</li>
            <li> This Olay cleaner works great and is priced more reasonably than that other common, expensive, major branded one.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product, as long as you use something hydrating after it to make up for the tight feeling</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked and felt so clean after using this little guy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more gentle, more inherently ergonomic, and the brush head is small enough to easily clean awkward spots like the very back of your jawline or the edges of your nostrils.</li>
            <li> I have long since run out of the little sample of Olay Regenerist Cleanser, but this brush is divine - super soft but efficient, my skin really noticed a difference when I visited my sister for a weekend and forgot it!</li>
            <li> I still break out a little, but now the acne goes away so quickly and without too many extra harsh chemicals used afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay Pro-x advanced cleaning system after seeing the facial scrubber that pro active offered.  </li>
            <li> This gentle cleansing brush gets my face clean without damaging my delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day and have seen decent results with keeping the pores on my nose clear of this unsightly white gunk.</li>
            <li> Since my skin is sensitive, I use it only once every two days and then particularly in the nose region.</li>
            <li> Great thing about this is that its portable, not as expensive as the rest of them out there!</li>
            <li> I love the sample cleanser in the box, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> + Clarisonic, especially if you are only bridging a minor gap to fabulous skin.  </li>
            <li> Just after my first use, the mechanical cleanser with it&#x27;s soft, gentle rotating brush cleaned out my pores, removed dead skins cells on the surface, and provided a relaxing massage to my face.  </li>
            <li> my nightly regimen,  I first wash as much makeup off as I can with my hands using an organic tea tree oil bar soap, then I use the Cure Natural Aqua Gel to remove dead skin followed by another run through cleanse using the Olay Cleansing system, I put on my moisturizer and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get a very small sample of the cleanser which I love and have been using.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure it scrubbed off a broken blood vessel that never came back.  </li>
            <li> but I can imagine that I am getting my money worth, vs. spending over $100 for some other product.</li>
            <li> Even this is so much cheaper, I generally do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> After cleansing I sometimes put a few drops of vitamin E oil and a touch of rich moisturizer and swirl that around my face for a minute.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness this is worth every penny I spent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the original batteries after a few months.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> Basically the bristles are so fine they do nothing except push everything you are trying to wash off your face even further down into your pores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product comes with one soft-bristle brush, strong enough to remove that built up skin, soft enough to leave you with skin-intact and minimal redness unless you are the aggressive type.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic is a bit more harsh (which may work for some people) but for me personally, it would dry my skin a bit too much.</li>
            <li> As one ages, exfoliation helps improve skin appearance and this little mild gentle scrubber, used daily, will do that</li>
            <li> All I can say is that after years of trying to fight off black heads with every exfoliating soap out there, this is the only product so far where the black heads have actually gone away, I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li> First of all, getting the cover off to put the batteries in this thing was ridiculously hard, but it was worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> This removes most of make up but provides very little exfoliation and leaves my face red.</li>
            <li> and I feel a little bit special each time I use it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soooo clean and soft right now its ridiculous!</li>
            <li> it gets soft when wet and does the job good with some facial cleanser or with plain old water in case you forgot to purchase the cleanser for the last two months.</li>
            <li> It does make my face feel extra-clean and soft, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my clogged pores or minor breakouts.</li>
            <li> I also have used a simple 99 cent hand brush from a pharmacy and the Conair facial brush and both of those options feel like they do a better job and cost less.  </li>
            <li> Also, for those of you on the edge about this brush because of some reviews bashing the brush quality, please believe me when I say you seriously don&#x27;t want anything more abrasive than this.</li>
            <li> I got a few pimples during the two week period and felt like my face wasn&#x27;t as clean during the trip.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s done anything dramatic for my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t harmed it that I can see, and it&#x27;s a nice bedtime ritual that makes me feel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how often I&#x27;m supposed to replace the brush head, but after using it for 2 months mine still seems to be holding up just fine.  </li>
            <li> No more foundation pooling in pores or caking in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day - morning and night - for about half of the recommended 60 seconds on the low setting (I&#x27;ve heard that it can be too abrasive if you use it daily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have been paying a lot more attention to my skin regime in the past year.  </li>
            <li> and I washed my face and neck for a lot longer than usual as it&#x27;s so soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it did anything above what I can do with a washcloth and a decent exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> and they said they liked the main product, which was a facial scrubber, but the Olay cleansing cream that came with the facial scrubber was not a good product.</li>
            <li> I now only use this after a night out when I&#x27;m wearing more makeup than usual that needs to be scrubbed off.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not actually sure if it&#x27;s any better than just a regular face wash without a scrubber.</li>
            <li> First off, it doesn&#x27;t provide nearly enough power for any actual results.</li>
            <li> I am aware that the box does not come with instructions for how often to use it or how to open the thing to replace batteries, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they cost more money than I am willing to pay.  </li>
            <li> Was thinking of ordering the much more expensive version of it, but figured I should give this a shot first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a facial cleansing brush before, and I must say even after my first use my skin was instantly softer after my shower.</li>
            <li> If used with a decent scrub it does the job, but with just regular soap, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have absolutely flawless skin, now it just looks tired, dry, oily, and just uneven.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of dead skin as much as I had hoped (and why I purchased it in the first place).</li>
            <li> The handheld device is on the smaller size, smaller than my NutraSonic brush, and it&#x27;s pretty lightweight, even with the two AA batteries in it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can use it in the shower, and it&#x27;s small enough to tote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it worked very well the first few weeks, but my skin may also be a result of my diet, etc.  </li>
            <li> The cream that comes with the system is just okay, and the tube is so small it is really only a sample.</li>
            <li> Try it first before spending the extra money on a similar product, I don&#x27;t think you will regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s any better than using a regular washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I only just changed the batteries for the first time last week.</li>
            <li> I am a 37 year old woman with occassional break outs and pretty rough textured skin and clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it has two different speeds to choose from and also comes with a small tube of the Olay face wash.</li>
            <li> I figured the main problem was that those products weren&#x27;t penetrating my pores, so I thought I can justify spending $20-30 to try this out (but I wasn&#x27;t about to spend $200 on a similar</li>
            <li> I first found something very similar on Sephora website, the price there for a similar product was around $200.</li>
            <li> I notice smaller pores, smoother skin, and less visible fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty gross, but the white bristles allow you to SEE the dirt that&#x27;s being cleaned away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed large patches of really dry skin under my noise that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and wearing foundation to cover the redness</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok &amp; only $20 , but it&#x27;s very soft &amp; slow.</li>
            <li> burning sensation when used for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;However, exfoliation is a certain effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush has a low and high setting, but I generally stick with the low and let the brush gently spin on my skin.</li>
            <li> I find this is a tad rough on my skin if I use it too long, but for short periods of time it works well, leaving my face very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order based on other reviews that the product was too weak to really work but after using it I love it!</li>
            <li> great little personal device and not as expensive as other ones, love the job it does</li>
            <li> with other physical exfoliators i have used in the past, I have found that it&#x27;s a good idea to wash (not just rinse)</li>
            <li> Not a bad brush, a little softer  than the ones I had before.  </li>
            <li> You can get plenty of other decent exfoliant scrubs for $3-8 that work much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it feels so mild like it&#x27;s hardly doing much.</li>
            <li> I was pretty exited about this, super cheap and 2,000 reviews, but unfortunalty it only comes in one size brush, no body brush no pumice brush no nothing the brush is really small not to mention the product is small as well.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and noticed an improvement in/on my face right away.</li>
            <li> The smaller sized head fits comfortably around my nose and is gentle enough to be used everyday.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a high and low speed.</li>
            <li> My skin felt less congested, less oily, my pores seemed less noticeable, and my makeup went on more smoothly.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this item if you are thinking of getting..best present ever!!</li>
            <li> and this product definitely deserves it&#x27;s high rating and ranking on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Has two settings, low and high.</li>
            <li> I have had blackheads on my nose for the last 8 years since high school that I have tried everything with.</li>
            <li> Everyone raves about their Clarisonics, but I just couldn&#x27;t justify the high price tag for essentially what is just a motorized brush.</li>
            <li> There is something about the high speed that helps create suds to carry the cleaning product around your entire face.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a face scrubber like this one.</li>
            <li> I read reviews for both high end moderately priced products.  </li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a replacement until I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the purchase especially</li>
            <li> It has a high &amp; low speed, came with batteries &amp; face wash!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
            <li> I suggest highly for middle age acne/oily skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product for daily use.</li>
            <li> A few blemishes that popped up prior to using it are shrinking away, the redness went away after a good nights sleep, and my nose barely has a dark speck in any of the pores.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for digging deep into your pores and for cleaning your skin, but after using it your face feels really raw, and not refreshing.</li>
            <li> only because my face is so sensitive, that if I use anything new on it I will break out.</li>
            <li> Right size for travel but feel it may not last long.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day usually with my own acne cleanser (it comes with a small tube of Olay cleanser which was fine too).</li>
            <li> My huge pores appear much smaller now and the oil is much less.</li>
            <li> The next day my skin had huge cystic acne all over the lower half of my face.</li>
            <li> I would not wanted to have spent more however, as it the spinning feature is not very strong and does not come with a variety of heads.</li>
            <li> I could maybe see this working really well for someone with oily skin or skin that is prone to breakouts, however, those of you with dry skin, steer far away from this one.</li>
            <li> My Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System arrived about a week/week and a half ago, and just from the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> The product came in a few days ago, although I thought it would be a lot bigger than it actually is, it is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It came super fast and the Amazon price is at least $10 cheaper than buying in store.</li>
            <li> I saw some people saying that the brush is too harsh for their face, but I felt it was super soft...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to cleanse well but not so harsh that you feel as though you are ripping your face off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I like the product and it is not very messy to use (I use it in the shower and at the sink at night).</li>
            <li> The brush has very soft bristles for my sensitive skin and it has two speeds which i could alternate.</li>
            <li> I rarely break out and when I do, its right there and usually causes no major problems.</li>
            <li> I was debating about Clarisonic but couldn&#x27;t get past the huge price tag.  </li>
            <li> It is an ok buy,just i was expecting a bigger brush ,my bad ,part ok for the price and functionally travel size</li>
            <li> It is small and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> So I primarily now use it at night when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face</li>
            <li> I enjoy the small size.</li>
            <li> I have tried the more expensive clairsonic product, but opted to buy the olay system, as I really like all the olay Pro X Clear products.  </li>
            <li> The included sample isn&#x27;t much but what you get lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> the brush feels gentle and it works well with Cetaphil cleanser, which I have been using for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She has wanted a cleansing system for a long time but the price of some of these can be a bit much.  </li>
            <li> skin is lighter, smooth, no more acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected higher speed.</li>
            <li> Also, my pores haven&#x27;t gotten smaller and my face doesn&#x27;t feel any cleaner after using this product than it does normally.</li>
            <li> If you are not used to using exfoliators like this, the brush head may seem a bit rough at first</li>
            <li> Now, The Clarisonic will have a few extras, such as more speeds and additional attachments for the body, but if all you need is a high-quality brush for the face, why spend all the extra cash?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> When it was working it was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I use the scrubber with my normal face wash and can see and feel a big difference.  </li>
            <li> I get it pretty wet too and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it yet.</li>
            <li> I chose this to try out a electric face brush, as the data published says that using such a device increases cleaning efficiency by 6 times over normal washing by hand.</li>
            <li> I have discontinued the Pro-x for about 2 weeks now and things are going back to normal.</li>
            <li> Once I stopped using it, my skin recovered and went back to normal.</li>
            <li> When I stopped, my face went back to normal.</li>
            <li> It is a little aggravating after using this thing and still seeing little blackheads everywhere, but for the makeup removal and price, I think it is deserving of 3 1/2 stars...</li>
            <li> arrived in mail on time just as advertised would buy again as this is exactly what I expected based on description</li>
            <li> the brush isn&#x27;t too rough even on the higher speed.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin with the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small face cleanser, which is nice as well (although extremely chemically in my opinion).</li>
            <li> But after using this device with the olay cleanser or back to my regular cleanser, the cotton ball barely have any brown color on it meaning my face has been really cleaned well!</li>
            <li> It literally takes a full week for the machine to work through the layers and layers of dead skin, dirt, and grime that you never knew you had.</li>
            <li> Something about the cleanser and my skin created a terrible reaction, which is now gone thanks to the healing love of my own products and a lot of water.</li>
            <li> You wet your face and the brush, use a bit of the cleanser that&#x27;s included (or, of course, your own), turn the brush on and \\&quot;gently move it around the face for approximately 60 seconds.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the full sized one - this can be used with any cleanser or soap.</li>
            <li> My skin type is all over the place, dry and flaky in certain areas, oily in others.</li>
            <li> And unlike with  my last facial brush, I don&#x27;t have to clean the whole countertop after I use it-no messy \\&quot;spraying\\&quot; of cleanser everywhere.</li>
            <li> The little motor inside turns plenty quickly to scrub my face and afterwords</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, my face has quit breaking out, my pores are smaller, and my fine lines are reduced.</li>
            <li> It was super-lightweight, very easy to hold and maneuver, and because of its smaller size and gentler action allowed me to use it in places I&#x27;d never successfully cleaned with the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s expected when first using a new facial cleanser or acne tx.</li>
            <li> After a certain amount of (unsuccessful) discussion, she said she could mail me a coupon within the next 2-3 weeks to buy another one locally.</li>
            <li> Costco has this same product for about the same price, but a large bottle of the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of a big daily face routine so this certainly helps out.</li>
            <li> The washing part took slightly longer because of the small brush head, but the time was more than made up by the much quicker rinse time.  </li>
            <li> This little brush is gentle yet cleanses very well.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this little machine and facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I am using the sample sized exfoliating face wash that came in the box, and find better results when I wet the brush, apply face wash on the brush, and then use it on my face, since the face wash is not easy to spread on the face directly.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what you expected to do; however, I have had powerful motor in my previous one.</li>
            <li> It takes a little more force than expected.  </li>
            <li> I love this little gadget, money well spent.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it had more power and would scrub a little harder</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite nice, but for my skin type,a little harsh.</li>
            <li> I truly believe or gives you that deep down clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Combination skin, break out prone.</li>
            <li> I did not get the deep  down clean that I strive for when cleansing my skin.    </li>
            <li> I occasionally use the included cleaner when I want something gentler, but usually I just use a tiny pea-sized amount of my Alba Acnedote scrub (which is all natural and my all-time favorite scrub) for about a minute before going to bed every day.  </li>
            <li> I love it, but it&#x27;s a little harsh for my older skin, so I use it maybe once every 2 or 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Extremely helpful in keeping dry parts of my face smooth and not flaky.  </li>
            <li> Although this is much cheaper than the $200 other brand, I have not seen any real improvement for the last week that I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking forward to what long term use of this brush will do for my skin!</li>
            <li> Definitely cheap enough to take a chance on, especially considering my wife just purchased the \\&quot;other one.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the little rotating brush did wonders on the very first use--I noticed a difference immediately.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin looks so clear and smoother than any other products, so I loved it until it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> Although the cleanser works well, I might use my regular cleanser instead of buying a new bottle of the Olay.</li>
            <li> I saw instant results, which is always a plus when you&#x27;re trying something new</li>
            <li> and she has put a new head on it only once as well.  </li>
            <li> The next morning, I didn&#x27;t have any new zits, which hadn&#x27;t happened for me in over a year.  </li>
            <li> but I simply needed new batteries.</li>
            <li> a facial exfoliator is a \\&quot;can&#x27;t live</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right now, I&#x27;m battling some new pimples that came up recently</li>
            <li> The batteries are inside the handle, which lacks a &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s hard to pull off without using your teeth (ouch!), but I love the feel of my skin after use.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable in comparison to other items or treatments on the market.  </li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable in comparison to other items or treatments on the market.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t until I added in this on a daily basis that it really became smoother and rough spots that would come on cold/dry days where I live are completely gone.</li>
            <li> I actually think the only reason it died was because I changed bathrooms and it was in near direct water in the new shower.  </li>
            <li> Love this little thing!!!</li>
            <li> I tend to have really oily skin on my cheeks and dry skin on my forehead.</li>
            <li> , my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out, and I use it on my neck too and it feels so much nicer.    </li>
            <li> I use it with Cetaphil and it works very well for my skin, which tends to be dry and</li>
            <li> I use it once a day before bed, on my face and neck, twice a day would dry my skin too much.</li>
            <li> It exfoliated gently with just water and seemed to contribute to her healing by removing the build up of dry skin.</li>
            <li> It probably does clean your skin to an extent, but If I had the chance, I would just save up and buy one of the sturdier ones that will last a long long time.</li>
            <li> so I have dry patches while some areas are very oily.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay Professional Advanced Cleansing System in order to help with exfoliating dry skin and getting rid of black heads.</li>
            <li> I had used a headband to hold back as much of my hair as possible at my hairline after reading in the instructions that you cannot use the brush too close to your hairline or it will twirl your hair into dreadlocks.</li>
            <li> I looked at the more expensive ones, but I felt they wanted too much for them.  </li>
            <li> There is only so much time in the day for extra beauty regimens.</li>
            <li> This works just enough to get the dirt,skin, and grime off but still be gentle enough for nightly use.  </li>
            <li> so I hadn&#x27;t even thought of getting something like this until i noticed white bumps and larger pores and no matter how much I scrubbed my face</li>
            <li> When it comes to facial brushes, you can spend up to $100 and over, or you can spend under $30-either way, as an esthetician, I can tell you-aside from price, they are  really all the same.</li>
            <li> and the battery seems to last pretty long in this.  </li>
            <li> It is worth 10x less.  </li>
            <li> For years I thought I was washing my face with a wash cloth and my very thorough \\&quot;routine.\\&quot; After using this, and seeing how much I had been missing...</li>
            <li> The battery compartment could have been designed much better so that it can at least be pried open!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t much care for the cleanser it came with, but I mix it with a cleanser I made with a basic soap with a couple drops of essential oils in it or with my dandruff shampoo,</li>
            <li> Based on conversations with several friends, young and old,  I went withe Olay Pro.  </li>
            <li> The sample scrub that comes with the unit is just enough for 2 uses, and the battery compartment is a real challenge to open.</li>
            <li> Has lessened the appearance of some old red spots from some old acne spots on my chin.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, fits in hand well without slipping out, waterproof/submersible, comes with two real (Duracell) batteries too, been using it almost every day for a month and no signs of power degeneration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your skin is breaking out more after using this, you may be using the wrong cleanser or using this product too much.</li>
            <li> If your skin is breaking out more after using this, you may be using the wrong cleanser or using this product too much.</li>
            <li> African American with very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But this product i feel is even worth less that 15$, if i talk about the cheep plastic quality.</li>
            <li> although when I was in a store and felt the Clarisonic brushes, wow, those things are INCREDIBLY soft, so that&#x27;s the only reason I took a star off-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, no dry patches anymore, and no impurities.</li>
            <li> This is the first facial cleaner I have tried and I wish I had done it long before now.</li>
            <li> Although I have been shopping with Amazon for several years, and really appreciate the product reviews when making a buying decision (whether or not I ultimately buy the product from Amazon)</li>
            <li> It along with the head is pretty small, therefore it takes a while to do your whole face.</li>
            <li> It seemed like such a simple concept and wondered if it would make that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels so smooth and it only takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li> the battery last a long time, I have not changed mine since I first started using it.</li>
            <li> I think a cream cleanser works really well with this product because the nature of the device is to exfoliate and the cream cleanser can keep the skin hydrated while that is happening, but that&#x27;s just a personal opinion, no medical evidence.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but using the brush in conjunction with my regular routine has left my skin much smoother than it ever was before.  </li>
            <li> I checked local stores and it&#x27;s at least 10 dollars more elsewhere.</li>
            <li> When I read the product&#x27;s ingredients, there didn&#x27;t seem to be any magic to it - just the same sort of common sense stuff you&#x27;d buy at the drug store to combat acne.</li>
            <li> My skin is exfoliated, soft, not dry, and is glowing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Of all of the beauty products that I have tried in the last ten years, this one is the very best.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but using the brush in conjunction with my regular routine has left my skin much smoother than it ever was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if one of these dies every two years, you would still have to buy 5 of these at Amazon&#x27;s present price to cost as much as one Clarisonic, which is ten years of use, and I guarantee one</li>
            <li> The Olay system really does work as well as the more expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Dont need to overdue on the time, just a quick few min in the shower and BAM - done.  </li>
            <li> This facial cleansing system does a really good, but unfortunately, the motor broke after a month.</li>
            <li> I love the brush and the replacement brushes are very affordable but the sample cleanser it comes with is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather spend more money and buy a high quality product such as the Clarisonic that has warranty and will last than waste money on something that will only work for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> now it is works just fine for me and has cut my morning routine down by a minute my skin is definitely smoother my pores seem smaller.</li>
            <li> sometimes the price on amazon waivers up and down, right now it&#x27;s $23.99</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and only use it about once a week with the exfoliating gel.</li>
            <li> I will now buy another brush for my teenage daughter, who has very sensitive skin, and tends to break out.</li>
            <li> my skin feels soother after using it, however i have very sensitive skin, so i can only use 2 to 3 times a week</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I use this with the Aveeno facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> but this happens sometimes only because i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> tried not pushing so hard, or using it so long, but in the end, my skin looks better when I use my old skincare regime.</li>
            <li> I alternate with Cetaphil, which is very gentle, and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li> so I substituted it for Aveeno&#x27;s cream based facial cleanser and it leaves my face so clear and radiant!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but I hope with continued use, my skin will stay clear!</li>
            <li> While it is not like a deep microdermabrasion, consistent use will definitely yield results that I could not get outside of a Dr’s office.</li>
            <li> It perfoms just as well as other brand priced much higher.</li>
            <li> I wish Olay will manufacture a small bag/box to store it so that I won&#x27;t need to use the original box.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I will go ahead and buy the more expensive version as I am totally satisfied with this.  </li>
            <li> It might not be the same exact thing but in my opinion its the same concept and your skin can only be so clean/cleaned/scrubbed.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a major improvement in my skin complexion.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical because this brush was so relatively inexpensive but have been very pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> I debated between buying the Olay brush or the expensive clarisonic brush, and I&#x27;m glad I bought the $20 version!</li>
            <li> but I apparently didn&#x27;t realize my face could be cleaner!</li>
            <li> The cleanser will last a lot longer than most do to the fact you only have to use a small amount for it to do its job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; cleaner like other offerings at much higher prices and should not be compared to those.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any major improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> Last night I was sitting on the couch watching TV and happen to touch my forehead and just kept rubbing it because it was SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> It makes you rethink regular old soap and water!  </li>
            <li> I started off with the low speed the first few weeks to get used to it, then I switched to the fast speed.</li>
            <li> I occasionally read that others considered it to be too cheap and poorly manufactured, but that was pretty rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple of times so far, but I like it!</li>
            <li> My usually thrifty mother has the clarsonic model, which is pretty much exactly the same except that it pulses instead of rotates.  </li>
            <li> So I bought the Pro-X to exfoliate to give my skin a major overhaul.</li>
            <li> I used many different cleansers in the past and I will never go back or stop using this one.</li>
            <li> I brought this brush 5 days ago and I can already tell a major difference in the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> May be a little more money then other products like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine for a few months now, and since the very first use I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have no regrets!</li>
            <li> Bristles are pretty soft and the rotation speed is fairly slow helping it do the job without too much abrasion.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the professional style that you have to spend 6x more on, this is not worth the money or the time wasted.  </li>
            <li> Price is right too compared to the ultra expensive brands available.  </li>
            <li> One round with this puppy fixed that right up, even on the gentler cycle.</li>
            <li> First of all - I am guy and bought the product as I felt my skin was blocked and have those occasional dry patches and bumps on my face.   </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t bother to read the back of the cleanser bottle (apply to wet/moist face) and I used it on dry skin.</li>
            <li> What you get in the box is the actual handheld device, a brush head that easily pops on and off the handheld device (they also sell brush heads separately so you can change those out when needed,) a small travel sized Olay cleanser, and 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> and I had to hold the button down continuously to get it to spin, then in the middle of the night, I&#x27;d suddenly start hearing a whirring sound from my bathroom</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t really have a set expectation but wanted to try this particular product before investing in something more expensive!</li>
            <li> /&gt;She said it took a few days to notice any real difference in the cleaning action but that ultimately she feels her skin is much cleaner after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve recently found another product for adult acne--Clearasil Adult Daily Clear, with resorcinol and sulfur--these two products seem to be doing what I hoped the Olay brush would do for me.</li>
            <li> He had a bout with acne and need just a little something extra to keep his skin clean.  </li>
            <li> The tube that comes with it contains an adequate source of cleansing, though I&#x27;m lead to believe that she also sometimes uses plain dove soap as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleans super deep down</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to pull the bottom off to place the batteries inside but other than that it made my face feel smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li> it seems quite fun to use at first but the interest dies down after a while as it is quite rough on my facial skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this in combination with the Olay microdermabrasion kit to address some skin issues I have been noticing lately including fine lines, brown spots, and breakouts.</li>
            <li> Other than that it really made my life easier in the mornings and have clear skin every day.</li>
            <li> Probably would be a great product if it worked, any amount of water and it stops working until fully dry again, although it says its made for use in the shower, its quite expensive for the product you actually get.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how all the expensive Cleansing systems work, but this is so great for the money I spent on it!</li>
            <li> I usually use the apricot scrubs to get my face clean</li>
            <li> really helps get rid of dry skin!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel velvety soft, which is fantastic in the winter months as I do get a few dry spots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I do not know how I lived so long without it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit rough if you press too hard, but with gentle use feels just fine.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t have any skin issues, for the price its so worth it to have this little luxury that is so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice system for the price, but if you are buying because you think you will have the same results as the more expensive clairsonic, you are wrong.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad for just cleaning your face although I would like a bit more pressure to clean my face.</li>
            <li> &quot; every few days for a deep clean.  </li>
            <li> My face feels clean and some dead skin is lifted and washed away at the same time.</li>
            <li> I did use it for longer than I probably will on a regular basis, but I imagine with regular usage it will do a decent job of exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> I may be the wrong candidate to try this product as it does seem more targeted for women much older</li>
            <li> What I really wanted was something to clean my skin and exfoliate without irritating my Roseacea.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you&#x27;re managing problem skin (frequent outbreaks, clogged pores, blackheads and blemishes) and you&#x27;ve got a few hundred bucks to burn, then the Mia is definitely the better pick.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting the clarasonic for a long time but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price for it.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t compare it to any other product, but if you want a gentle massage and exfoliation without getting into it in a big expensive way, this Olay Professionals product is a good entree.</li>
            <li> I wish that this device would have more than one speed, which is very slow.</li>
            <li> At first my face was a little sensitive to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used scrubbers and special cleansers but usually end up with irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used scrubbers and special cleansers but usually end up with irritated skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t spin very fast, well at least not as fast as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> The brush has a high and low speed and the unit is so simple to operate.  </li>
            <li> brush only has two settings- low and high.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive but high quality facial brush.</li>
            <li> For a basic daily cleansing system, I&#x27;d highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> The head also rotates much more slowly than any other brush I&#x27;ve used, even on its faster setting and with new batteries.  </li>
            <li> I try to use it consistently, but its hard when you don&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li> not only does it GENTLY clean your face from all the make-up, extra oil, and other things, but it definiely makes your skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> , this little system is definatley getting my face back on track and clear, I do believe that this cleanses 6x better than the average cleaner.</li>
            <li> The scrub head moves at a decent rotation speed on high setting, but once you press it against the facial skin with some pressure the speed dramatically reduced due to friction.</li>
            <li> There is a huge difference in quality to say the least.</li>
            <li> With those, you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about replacing batteries or changing the scrubby bit (you can buy replacements), because the scrubby is generally on the package when you buy it.</li>
            <li> I generally use it on the lower setting.</li>
            <li> general</li>
            <li> It did come with some facial cleanser which is nice but paying this much money for what I got was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot and have seen a pronounced improvement in my skin&#x27;s general texture and shine.</li>
            <li> And now I use it with Obagi Clenziderm, which works well with it too and definitely helped clear up the acne.  </li>
            <li> IF I USED IT LONG ENOUGH TO SEE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE,</li>
            <li> The brush has a three month life, but who wants to use the same brush that long?</li>
            <li> I noticed improvement after one use, and daily thereafter, until my skin was completely clear after one week.  </li>
            <li> and if I do have the occasional spot, this helps it to clear up</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t get this gentle touch with maximum exfoliation with a &amp;#34;rag.&amp;#34; Plus it would take a long time to get the number of passes over the skin that this machine will accomplish in a short time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of my skin starting to clear up, I tried using it again.</li>
            <li> After I managed to open the battery compartment on the brush, I noticed there was a sticky, clear gel that covered the metal contacts where the batteries were supposed to go.</li>
            <li> am a 46 year old African American Female and to receive such compliments from my co-workers that made me feel REALLY good,&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is a common reaction for me with most cleansers, so I was not surprised that this did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this product to friends and if you are reading this considering buying it, it&#x27;s cheap enough that if you are not satisfied, you&#x27;re not out hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> Together with PanOxyl, has already helped to clear up my face after only a week.  </li>
            <li> I have combination/oily skin, with a mixed race background, and am 30 years old.  </li>
            <li> You do need to be careful about using it too close to the under-eye area as it can feel like its tugging or pulling on that gentle</li>
            <li> I am only 12 years old</li>
            <li> Using this one was no harder than hand-washing my face.  </li>
            <li> Only one try so far, but I like it.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised how different my skin felt afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have battled with oily skin and acne througout the years but as you get a bit older acne products dry out a lot</li>
            <li> Perhaps I expected too much, but this device seems to make no difference at all to the way my face feels after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was worried that the CS or this one would leave me with very red, inflamed skin from the brushes and the cleansing action.  </li>
            <li> They do work differently, apparently.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve only used this 4 times so far</li>
            <li> The brush is soft enough and won&#x27;t hurt my skin, but I won&#x27;t recommend using this brush every day since it will thinner the skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and deep pores that often get clogged.</li>
            <li> so far i still can&#x27;t put in the battery, just can&#x27;t open it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the old fashioned exfoliating pads and gloves with my brand of choice for facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the Mia but didn&#x27;t want to drop that much money on it.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far about two day apart, been four days since the last time and I feel no need to use it again yet.</li>
            <li> The brush is just soft enough.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser gets rid of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; but does not rough up my skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the cleaning scrub that comes with it although my skin is extra sensitive</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier and nearly a year later, I still use the product.  </li>
            <li> The brush is too soft and short.</li>
            <li> just had any effect on cleaning my face and bringing it back to my old self.</li>
            <li> It works really well for what we expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 47 year old women with Asian olive skin tone.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this product it left my skin soft and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently online shopping for the professional version of their competitor.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I had was how soft the bristles on the cleansing brush were.</li>
            <li> This thing barely even spins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used generic, and I&#x27;m not a fan of how soft they are.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m careful to be gentle with the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m careful to be gentle with the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The batteries last 3 to 5 weeks - which surprised me....</li>

            <li> then why not provide a reasonable warranty on a product that I spent upwards of $200</li>
            <li> Why was my 30 year old skin reverting to my teenage years?  </li>
            <li> Fast and careful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the basic soft brush attachment, but all I need.</li>
            <li> but I do use the exfoliator every so often for extra action.</li>
            <li> I am a 26 year old AA female.</li>
            <li> So, being a guy I don&#x27;t particularly care for lots of products &amp; messing about with exfoliating, cleansing, &amp; dry skin issues</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;ve been working regularly outdoors for nearly 4 years.</li>
            <li> As a 26 year old, I would get an occasional pimple or whatnot, but since using the cleanser, I haven&#x27;t had any.</li>
            <li> It does not rough the skin up.  </li>
            <li> And I would have been severely upset if I spent that much on a brush that wrecked my skin.  </li>
            <li> Soft enough for the face</li>
            <li> It feels like it barely moves</li>
            <li> But first use usually wouldn&#x27;t show much effect, so will wait after a longer use to give final verdict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> The rotating bristle brush is soft and the exfoliating wash is terrific too.</li>
            <li> Would be cautious about using it daily if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If anyone has sensitive skin, this is definitely not the way to go&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice so far but thought I&#x27;d review it.</li>
            <li> I that I came across this after so much money spent on the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Apparently the circular spinning can create wrinkles?  </li>
            <li> I have no regrets buying this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be curious to try the Clarisonic to see if it makes a visible difference, but again, I can&#x27;t really justify the price tag so for me</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft enough that her &amp;#34;peaches and cream&amp;#34; skin is not irritated.</li>
            <li> Using the Olay ProX feels like tiny ninja&#x27;s are spinning around my face, hacking off excess oil and dead skin cells with their tiny throwing stars, leaving my skin feeling smooth and baby-soft.</li>
            <li> I would agree that using the cleanser that comes with it might be too abrasive for regular use on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The brush on the Olay is soft and it has a couple different speed settings for rotation.  </li>
            <li> Apparently it works as described and loves this.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, it doesn&#x27;t require a lot of pressure to cleanse thoroughly, and it&#x27;s battery powered - simple!</li>
            <li> I still didn&#x27;t learn my lesson and decided maybe i cant use it daily and put to the side for a week and let my face completely heal.</li>
            <li> it was totally &amp;#34;fluff &amp; stuff&amp;#34; for the short-time it lasted... the Clairsonic in my professional opinion is exemplary of the fact that ... &amp;#34;A fool &amp; their Money are Soon Parted.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use only natural products</li>
            <li> you can barely tell I ever had a problem-</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin I would not buy this or only use this once a month</li>
            <li> My combination skin is only sensitive to chemicals and has no problems with abrasion or breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The brush is also much softer than what I expected</li>
            <li> My skin is a bit too sensitive to use it every day, so three or four mornings a week is enough.</li>
            <li> Like some have said, the first week or so using this brush is rough, especially if you are acne prone.  </li>
            <li> but no, when I looked in the mirror I saw that they became smaller and actually looked normally sized and not jurrasic-ending-meteor-craters.</li>
            <li> Now I use my normal facial cleansing product to wash my face of makeup, but I use the Olay pro-x cleansing system with my cleanser at the end to help with deep pore cleansing.  </li>
            <li> When I used my regular cleanser from Mario Badescu, everything went back to normal.</li>
            <li> it went back to normal speed the next day!  </li>
            <li> This product is useful to remove the dead skin in the face.</li>
            <li> , is the Pro-X better or worse than \\&quot;manual\\</li>
            <li> that it takes much longer and is more difficult to achieve the same results.</li>
            <li> Also the cream separately is kind of expensive</li>
            <li> I feel like it gets worse, then gets better.  </li>
            <li> It is so useful at getting rid of all the heavy makeup that I wear.</li>
            <li> You might have to go through a time of looking worse before you look better.</li>
            <li> This thing does make my skin feel really nice after using it in the morning, but by the evening, I&#x27;ve noticed that I always end up with a few small breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, and I also wear a CPAP machine so I can&#x27;t use a lot of harsh products on my face.  </li>
            <li> cream itself is a small tube as you will no doubt need to purchase a full size after about a month or two of using this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ok for cleaning but not a great exfoliator.</li>
            <li> When I saw this product, and all of its enthusiastic reviews, I was still skeptical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been let down so many times and not to mention the money wasted.</li>
            <li> I love how it works, but using it every day kinda makes my face feel raw and burning, so I do it like every other day or something like that.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, as long as you don&#x27;t put pressure on it or leave it on one spot for too long, it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any special products, just a plain facial scrub from St. Ives and the Olay Exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> First of all although I appreciated the instructions in other reviews it wasn&#x27;t clear to me that the part that comes off is the little end piece that says \\&quot;OLAY</li>
            <li> Battery seems to last awhile, but if you are worried that the compartment is hard to take off, just put on some dishwasher gloves or latex gloves on and it opens easily.</li>
            <li> this little guy gets the job done and leaves me with lots of extra money for makeup and other goodies :)</li>
            <li> Its a little bit smaller than the other brands but its ok since its just for the face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that has dry or acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Less break outs and fades away scars very gently.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish this came was the other attachments (if I would have read the description more closely, I would have spent the extra 5 dollars and purchased the toilettree brand because it not only comes with over 5 diff attachments</li>
            <li> My only critic is the amount of cleanser it came with was small but a quick trip to the pharmacy fixed that.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought them too soft, but the effect is less redness on my skin and a polished look that looks like I had a facial at the spa.</li>
            <li> And of course Amazon is taking it back and sending out a new one instantly.</li>
            <li> Usually go for about a minute and the higher speed and my face feels like new after.</li>
            <li> I have stress/hormonal acne since starting medical school and this system (along with some new products)</li>
            <li> I had been on two new topical prescriptions from my dermatologist (Retin-a Micro and Finacea) for about 1.5 months, and figured those would have purged my skin enough to not experience purging with this</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months and probably am about ready for a new brush head...</li>
            <li> so much I tend to wash a little longer in certain places where the pores are bigger (especially in the summer because of oily skin)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product due the soft bristles that do not irritate my skin and the simplicity of using it.</li>
            <li> And even with two people using them so much, the batteries last very long.</li>
            <li> It really cleans deep uses little battery power and you can reuse the head for a decent time.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and some articles comparing this to the Mia Clarisonic, I am happy I purchased this much less expensive but comparative option.</li>
            <li> I am using less produce (toner especially)to clean my skin, which in turn means I&#x27;m having fewer difficulties with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It is much softer and it seems as if my breakouts occur less frequently.</li>
            <li> A washcloth can do a better job cleaning and exfoliating your face than the Pro-X can, and it is certainly less messy &amp; traumatic.</li>
            <li> Slightly stiffer bristles could be more helpful to slough off dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> Just gentle enough and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday now but with mild facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> The only issue is the brushes get funky really quick and are not cheap to replace.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s gentle enough to use once a day, but for sensitive skin I&#x27;d advise every other day or once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews that said it will take the place of that higher-priced unit, and owning both, I would say that I disagree - further, I think I could PROBABLY have used the other unit with a sensitive or gentle brush and saved my money on this one.  </li>
            <li> So when I use the Pro X, I move it up, down, left, right all the while...rather than holding it in place.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and only use it once a week, but I have seen a big improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> What I did not like what that there was not any specific instructions, especially of what you should and should not do since the skin on your face is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I must say i was very exceptical about this product, i mean i got it for 19 dollars and it has more than 1,200 reviews rating like if it was just plain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine a long time and the bristles are like new.</li>
            <li> I think this works fine and am not sure I would invest in a more expensive version.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin and everytime I use it</li>
            <li> but they are pretty much half the price of the product itself</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted for alot less than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin and read about the cleansing brush</li>
            <li> After unboxing the Pro-X I was disappointed by how chinsey it felt in my hand even for an $18 item, I was still excited nevertheless to try it out and reveal my magically lovely skin.</li>
            <li> I would like it to be a little rougher on my face to feel like it cleans a little better but</li>
            <li> But now I use it no less than 2 times daily.</li>
            <li> Although I am not sure that the change in my skin is completely due to using this product, I am sure it has helped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this device for the past 2 weeks and see a significant difference in how my skin is acting.</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin, and the device itself causes no long lasting irritation.</li>
            <li> I did some research and found that the other products that were in the $125 dollar range did exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> SORRY, I WAS HOPING FOR MORE ACTION!  </li>
            <li> so here&#x27;s an alternative for some who are willing to try: if you bought this product but are still wishing/wanting for an more expensive product such as the mia2 EVEN though i think they do the SAME thing, try different cleansers with this.</li>
            <li> the current subscribe-and-save price, this little baby is unbeatable and the negatives are pretty much completely forgotten about.</li>
            <li> FIrst of all, I was little bit surprised that it was smaller than I thought at first.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The sample size of the cleanser is also a nice tester, but I was a little disappointed as to the size, of course the more the merrier.  </li>
            <li> My face is acne-prone and I use an acne prescription, Differin, which regenerates the skin with new skin cells, so I can&#x27;t exfoliate everyday since it would be too harsh, although I wish I could because it makes my face feel amazingly clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is even with the 2 speed settings it doesn&#x27;t go fast enough to really get rid of dead skin sometimes.</li>
            <li> It is slow, even on high speed and brushes are too soft to get much done.  </li>
            <li> and now my skin is raw, full of acne that is emerging, red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> In less than two weeks, my skin is cleaner, clearer, smoother and just plain better looking.  </li>
            <li> I get a few pimples from time to time, and I have normal skin (perhaps a little more on the dry side).</li>
            <li> There are two speeds, high and low, but I typically use the high speed setting.</li>
            <li> Or, if you have very dry skin and want to massage a moisturizing mask on, then I think this would be a gentle enough utensil for you.  </li>
            <li> This product really does the work, I have been using it every other day for a week now</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d probably get jut as much out of the non-battery powered scrubby tools that some other cleansers come with.</li>
            <li> I like this one so much that I&#x27;m not interested in trying any others yet.</li>
            <li> Having used this, I am now going to buy a Clarisonic plus System, which I had thought about in the beginning, but having never used this type of product before, was not willing to spend so much money on something I might not like.</li>
            <li> Installing the batteries was a breeze thanks to the help of other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m keeping it, but it&#x27;s just little bit too soft to really do much exfoliating.</li>
            <li> The flakes are hard to clean from the brushes.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and other products made my skin feel like a greased paper towel.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the Pro-X had a gentler brush which I really like.</li>
            <li> Battery charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough to give any real scrub.</li>
            <li> So much that due to her hair and my hair being tangled around the part where the brush head attaches to the handheld device, that eventually, the brush died.</li>
            <li> I have not used any other products like this, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I am not willing to pay that much again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference other than my skin did feel softer afterwards.</li>
            <li> (the other time I wash my face during the day I use a washcloth) and my skin is so much softer and smoother now.</li>
            <li> I first cleansed my face with Pond&#x27;s Cold cream, rinse that off, and put a tiny bit more of the cream on my damp face.</li>
            <li> My skin was drying out due to too much glycolic acid use, so I had to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always seemed to be very cystic acne prone with extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Surprisingly, due to its price, it really works well.  </li>
            <li> It is very small and light weight and can be used every day.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other cleansing systems, but I&#x27;m not going to be so fast in spending $150</li>
            <li> I have owned a Clarisonic Mia for a few years and only wish I had tried this first and saved a LOT of money!</li>
            <li> Only change I would make would be to make the head a little bigger like the original youthful essence product and offer different attachments.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this everyday because it is a little bit too time consuming, but after using it for 3-4 a week, my skin has a glow that I love.</li>
            <li> After the third week of use and immediately putting on my normal facial moisturizer after the shower use, I would wake up the next day with a sore spot on my chin and around mouth.  </li>
            <li> etc.)tend to get my skin kind of overexcited if used too often, so that it gets rough from trying (apparently) to overcome the loss of cells or protective layers.  </li>
            <li> There was not a single difference I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> Did not notice that it has only the facial brush and for a few dollars more, the other brands come with a variety of attachments.  </li>
            <li> My cheeks and nose are always dry (live in the Northeast) but my chin is oily and tends to break out.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it about every other day and feel that it gets my face very clean.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using them because the skin on my face would peel off leaving ugly red blotches even after using a great moisturizer from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> I was completely amazed at how much of a difference I saw in just a few days.</li>
            <li> It really does help clear away dead skin cells from the face.</li>
            <li> Been to dermatologists multiple times and the only thing to ever clear it up was Accutane, which I&#x27;ve been through twice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and it really has helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> For personal reasons,my skin is very thin,after I used,my face is always red and dry.</li>
            <li> My forehead is completely clear and my chin only gets the occasional blemish every once in a while.</li>
            <li> I use to only remove makeup with remover wipes and then use my fingers to wash my face but after using this I will never go back to my old regimen.</li>
            <li> so if you have sensitive skin, use it on low speed and low pressure, it wont irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> Brush is much rougher on my skin than I had expected, I stopped using it after a month when I noticed my skin was getting too irritated, just washing my face with a washcloth works well enough for me</li>
            <li> It was very affordable although not as big of a brush as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not as big or as fast as I expected.</li>
            <li> But I don´t feel the need to use it everyday because it really takes all the natural oils from the skin.</li>
            <li> I use one regularly at home, and as I travel fairly frequently and do not wish to pack the brush I use at home, I bought a second brush and gave myself the indulgent pleasure of brush I use exclusively for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike</li>
            <li> The blue design ones are soft and I don&#x27;t feel that they exfoliate enough.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a simple idea of a rotating brush, but it is soft enough not to irritate.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt almost the same as it does after a professional facial and just for $20.  </li>
            <li> Only thing that concerns me is the fact that it spins in a complete circle opposed to spinning back and forth like the Clarisonic, which helps with wear and tear on the skin.</li>
            <li> I thought that I could get the same exfoliation benefits from an old fashioned face brush or a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> This did not dry my cheeks and took care of the blackheads immediately.</li>
            <li> This is just as good in my opinion and does everything I expected the expensive system to do.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve never really been one to spend a lot of time on a skincare regimen, as I get older, and as winter turns my skin drier, I am working on trying to resolve some issues with my skin.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to buy the expensive different brand but thought I should see if i liked using a device before putting out the cash.  </li>
            <li> Although I do not use the Pro-X cleanser (product shy because of sensitive skin), the took works fabulously with my cleanser!</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised how small it was, but I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised how small it was, but I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> This didnt work as well as I had hoped and actually ended up irritating my skin more than anything.</li>
            <li> I pre-wash my face first and try the product, and it still did not clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I got mine at [...] and just love how deep it peels my face and neck without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the brush portion would be a little more stiff- almost like a toothbrush-</li>
            <li> I did not find anything special about it, and I hardly use it now.</li>
            <li> My skin used to get extremely dry and very flakey in the winter, to the point where I was using heavy night-creams and oils with limited success.  </li>
            <li> The product works just fine but was a little smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks in this very dry winter and have noticed a couple dry spots that feel a little better.</li>
            <li> I think the brisles are right on, not too hard, not too soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little drying at first</li>
            <li> the first time i used it it broke me out just one little pimple in my chin, but I didnt mind becuz</li>
            <li> major problem with this product is that the motor only spins in one direction.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have major acne or anything, but enough to annoy me.</li>
            <li> know the improvement in my skin is not due to the serum because I have been using the serum since last year.</li>
            <li> I have even tried washing my face first with a facial sponge or other method and then following up with this</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already seen a major different!</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s less gentle than an ordinary washcloth -- which also happens to be a lot less expensive and more effective.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but just can&#x27;t deal with the rotary spinning that makes you work harder.  </li>
            <li> I shall use this brush as long as I can and would recommend it to all who need a clean face without trating the tender facial skin harshly.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, my terrible experience with the Pro-X sent me right out to purchase a Clarisonic which I have been using for several months now and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Cons: It slows down after a few months and the brushes wear out a bit, I&#x27;m sure that you can add a few batteries in though and it will be fast cleansing again.</li>
            <li> , after my first use I figured I might at least have a new laundry stain scrubber...</li>
            <li> I thought the Pro-X would work well, but would be more time-consuming and inconvenient than my normal routine, and I was only half right.  </li>
            <li> You do have to put a little pressure on it if you are trying to clear blackheads because the gentle brush doesn&#x27;t do enough without that bit of pressure.</li>
            <li> I am a little upset though as two days after I got it one of the big warehouse stores I shop at had it on sale for a few dollars more</li>
            <li> I rarely use it with the exfoliating cream that came with it but do occasionally for a little extra scrub.</li>
            <li> Takes three years off your age the 1st time you use it, Not rough, but soft and still works to remove dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was not rough or dry before, it has always had a tendency to be soft, but never like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the first three uses my pores appear smaller and blackheads are less visible if not gone.</li>
            <li> The first time i used it, bubbles from my facial wash turned a slightly greyish</li>
            <li> I have had only 2-3 small zits since buying this and the cleansing brush clears them up quickly.</li>
            <li> At first I was worried about the bristles being hard, but they are really soft!</li>
            <li> and has dealt with mild to moderate acne for the past years, stating from when I was 12 and now 20.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if it makes a difference, but for the very small price, I FEEL like I am getting my face, neck and décolleté cleaner and exfoliated, so I think it is a good value.</li>
            <li> My acne is going away from my face finally, clean and small pores!</li>
            <li> I quickly found that my makeup looked better, it wasn&#x27;t sitting on dead, flaky skin (sorry, I know, gross).</li>
            <li> so I spent a long time looking for an affordable option with largely positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This was a plus, but the brush head went bad pretty fast and it would have been even better if it came with other types of non-brush heads.</li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s a great product, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Plus a clean face shows the wrinkles less, or a dirty face shows the wrinkles a lot more.  </li>
            <li> I would have expected a bit more or extra brush head at least for price.  </li>
            <li> I had one side of my face that was really scarred and had dark marks everywhere from acne.</li>
            <li> I had one side of my face that was really scarred and had dark marks everywhere from acne.</li>
            <li> but in general  my pores  look the same , and I feel like  </li>
            <li> The brush is quite gentle, but it really does remove rough, dead skin.</li>
            <li> The other thing I use is Origins facial micordermabrasion scrub, Modern Friction.</li>
            <li> Package doesn&#x27;t come with extra brush heads  Hard to clean brush head</li>
            <li> I think it might be because I&#x27;ve already been exfoliating regularly (Aveda&#x27;s tourmaline scrub), and so there might not be as much of a difference due to that.</li>
            <li> The most common complaints I read from other reviewers were as follows:</li>
            <li> I cut back to using it every other day because it felt like it was drying out my skin too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products and they always left me feeling like I still had the whole day on my face.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for a long time, and now into my adult years, I was sometimes embarrassed because of how my face looked.</li>
            <li> but I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying one of these because it is not remotely close to the same thing.</li>
            <li> and I use it on the lower speed for daily cleansing, it is not rough on my skin even using it every day.</li>
            <li> I still get minor adult acne, and my skin didn&#x27;t feel cleaner than before.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets, only that I did not get it sooner.  </li>
            <li> This product surprised me especially for such a low price.</li>
            <li> but I could feel a difference after the first few times using it.</li>
            <li> It did make a few blemishes surface the first week</li>
            <li> The cleansing cream that came in a tube with the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System was a total rip-off.</li>
            <li> I say don&#x27;t waste money on this one though unless you&#x27;re looking for a tester to see if you would be interested in a pricier one.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought this type of brush, so just have few thoughts about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not quite sold that it&#x27;s cleaning my face as well as it claims because I still see marks on the cotton wool when I use my toner.&lt;br /&gt;The first few times</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a face cleaner just spend the money and go with clairsonic, i did and wish i wouldnt have wasted the money on this one first.</li>
            <li> the first few days of using this, some of the blackheads formed into pimples, because the dirt was being lifted out of the pore, basically.</li>
            <li> I wanted a higher speed to exfoliate my dead skin.</li>
            <li> After the first few days, I immediately bought one for my mom too.</li>
            <li> The product is small and yet powerful.</li>
            <li> it is a small tool,i dont know if it is useful.</li>
            <li> I experience breakouts on my t-zone when I use this, and the bristles are pretty harsh imho.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rough, and I felt like it made my skin redder than it normally is.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the other expensive brand like Clarisonic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because I live in an extremely dry climate, it is necessary to exfoliate to allow maximumize my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will help to make my rough facial hair a bit looser and easier to shave, hence the main reason I purchased this</li>
            <li> My skin, which was getting rough patches as I get older, has smoothed out and my skin looks radiant and significantly younger than my</li>
            <li> Just hold the device horizontally (with the brush facing away from you) and then gently wiggle the battery compartment up and down</li>
            <li> Great for travelling too because it is not too heavy, I am hoping that after another few weeks of usage that my acne can be a thing of the past, fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> After having made it through my teens and early early adolescence pretty much pimple free -- at 28 years old my skin started to take a turn for the worst.</li>
            <li> I am 33 (woman) and the skin on my face is mixed, normal to oily on the T-zone and very dry for the rest.</li>
            <li> My face was definitely smoother and had less breakouts after the initial breakthrough period (your skin may break out when first using it because of dirt and impurities rising to the surface of the skin).  </li>
            <li> This product works the same, if not better, then many other more expensive competing versions.</li>
            <li> I mean, even saying how it is better than that other $300 product....</li>
            <li> it was probably due to oil and dirt and getting older, since I have never had issues before.</li>
            <li> It does not have the power of the clarisonic or the other tools, but it does a decent job if you use a granular type exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> my fine lines are slowly disappearing!  </li>
            <li> I am often told I look young for my age (48 years old) and I have spent decades merely using a mild cleanser and rich moisturizing cream (both less than $10 each)</li>
            <li> super soft brush, clearer skin~ smaller pores, less black heads.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft, so I&#x27;m not sure how much exfoliating is actually happening.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use, it&#x27;s very gentle, yet abrasive enough to remove dead skin and unclog pores.</li>
            <li> I had dry patches around my nose and chin that got red and irritated after I washed my face which wouldn&#x27;t calm down until after an hour.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty soft and stops spinning if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s very little difference between the high and low modes that she just uses it on high all the time.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to my little mini facial massage at night, my face looks a lot better, and it&#x27;s at least as convenient as my old wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I have no complaints and no need at the moment to spend 5x as much on the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> I am using my usual face wash (Aveeno Ultra Calming in the morning and Aveeno Essentials Detoxifying Scrub in the evening) and right off the bat</li>
            <li> I will be surprised if it holds up very long.</li>
            <li> They look like the dirt is being scrubbed out of them, and I can only hope that the pores will get smaller if I continue to use this brush, since one week is not really long enough to show major results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clarisonic is gentle on sensitive skin, and has even-ed out my skin tone, instead of leaving it raw and red.</li>
            <li> In the past I have had great results with glycolic peels but they can be expensive and I was looking for a cheaper exfoliating alternative.</li>
            <li> I suffer from sensitive, acne-prone, dry skin</li>
            <li> my skin has become extremely dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> The whole half of my eye was blood covered....</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes for this are less than $10 on Amazon, whereas the replacement heads for the Clarisonic can be up to four times that much.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, fairly dry, but deal with frequent break outs on my chin.</li>
            <li> It really is helping my skin, diminishing black heads and exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I can already see my skin appears much smoother and pores also are less noticeable .</li>
            <li> My peeling dry skin is under control and my skin is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> It seems like my skin is too dry &amp; the brush head is too soft</li>
            <li> I have hormonal adult acne with lots of dry patches</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive, over 50 skin.  </li>
            <li> When using my hands (gently) with my face wash I get a slight rosacea flare up, but with using this brush, I get no flare up</li>
            <li> I also use the St. Ives apricot scrub once a week with the brush and its has really diminished the black heads.</li>
            <li> It does exfoliate, but I still had black heads on the tip of my nose after using this for about a week straight now, morning and night.</li>
            <li> Do you have sensitive dry skin?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly exfoliating and even works to exfoliate the lips, but gently.  </li>
            <li> I use this every night and my skin is much clearer and breaks out so much less.</li>
            <li> I have a dry mature completion</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, so I have an oily t-zone, and dry and sensitive cheeks.</li>
            <li> My pores are less visible and my skin seems much smoother.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still keeping my skin much clearer than in the past and my skin has developed a healthier looking glow to it.</li>
            <li> battery is not powerful enough for the real polishing and cell renewal I am looking for.</li>
            <li> It is small, light, and can get wet with no malfunctioning.  </li>
            <li> .Batteries don&#x27;t last long so the scrubbing action is lacking .I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Its been over 6 months and so far I can only count 2 minor blemishes.</li>
            <li> the small tube of exfoliant that comes with the brush: It is probably too harsh for most people.</li>
            <li> I went to the dermatologist, got RX to try to tame the bumps, but nothing really worked until I started using this brush to wash!</li>
            <li> Be aware that scrubbing your face intensely can make the pores worse.</li>
            <li> Over the past few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed the my skin is not a flaky for dryness as it has been and my skin tone looks better.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a total waste;-)</li>
            <li> I replaced the batteries, but it did nothing to change the now super slow speed.  </li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin, so using a washcloth and also using the exfoliating cleansers so often in my attempts to control dry patches left me with red, irritated skin...and still flaky.  </li>
            <li> It really forces the cleanser to get deep down into my pores and fight any acne/scars that I have and really make the acne either less noticeable/go away.</li>
            <li> I think the key is using it daily, but it adds very little time to my regimen and is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a smart little product.  </li>
            <li> -- Additionally the speeds/modes offered are not long enough</li>
            <li> The brush is gentle, it doesnt feel harsh at all, the 2-speed setting seems adecuate to start with the slow one and after a while go to the full speed.</li>
            <li> It will be rough and cause irritation and lots of dry skin and peeling if used with too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I have really acne-prone skin, especially on my cheeks, and I have a ton of black heads everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I have desert dry skin, and no matter how much I exfoliate or how rough the product, I still suffer from scaly patches of skin.</li>
            <li> -- I only know that the Olay causes a lot less injury to my face while still getting the makeup really off, either it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; or uses a softer brush head, or both.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, which has caused black heads, and white heads.</li>
            <li> just what i expected for the price - not super powerful though has two speeds</li>
            <li> Although the brush was super soft, it still irritated my skin and made my face worse.</li>
            <li> , it has a seal that keeps it tight so you can use it in the shower, but the design of the handle doesn&#x27;t give you much to grip when trying to remove the battery cover.</li>
            <li> But after using this product the first time, my face felt scratched and raw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s marked on the device which side is positive up and which side is negative up.</li>
            <li> My facial cleansing foam is always gentle so the facial scrub slightly but visibly improve my skin condition.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to use an extreme aveeno moisturizer just to get my face back to normal.</li>
            <li> This is coming from a 53 year old woman who has had hard cored, large pores all of her life.  </li>
            <li> I also got a few compliments from friends that I have a certain \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am CERTAIN that I can provide a very similar cleansing experience with a face brush (which I am about to buy next) and a little elbow grease.</li>
            <li> As I age, my facial skin has developed a very specific dry T-zone and I could never moisturize enough.</li>
            <li> I really like this little</li>
            <li> It comes with a little beaded wash thingie, like the st ives apricot scrub that I gently massaged into my face and neck,  </li>
            <li> For me, it may be a little too gentle.</li>
            <li> I noticed if I applied too much pressure and concentrated on one area and did not move in circular motions as the bush rotated, then it would feel a little abrasive on that area.  </li>
            <li> When I first used this product I was completely shocked that my pores were actually empty clean!!</li>
            <li> I use my Olay PRO-X Advanced Cleasing System everyday!!!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, flakey skin in my T-Zone in the winter and am recently dealing with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> (I was a little afraid it would be like an electric toothbrush and droplets would fly everywhere), and her skin is brighter.  </li>
            <li> This little device really amps up the facial experience.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels silky smooth immediately after using, I have little to none dead skin, which was a problem I had from just using a washcloth.</li>
            <li> They have about a sentence on it, and it doesn&#x27;t do justice to what a pain it really is, which is why I think this little gasket will actually wear out from the pressure</li>
            <li> Even slight pressure really slows down the spinning brush, even with new batteries.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product as opposed to the more expensive Clairsonic to see if these little machines really worked.  </li>
            <li> I had the full size clarasonic at one point, so when I received this, I was a little surprised it was so small.</li>
            <li> Hard core top of pores soften and then are gone after a few days.  </li>
            <li> The device works really, hands down!</li>
            <li> Great product for a lot less money than other expensive products</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think that this cheaper brand deserves to be rated bad for still doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear lotion on my face because I&#x27;m afraid of breaking out, but don&#x27;t feel like I need it with how amazing my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Feel stupid for paying $22 and believing all those great reviews.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is smaller than the Clarisonic, that is both good and bad.</li>
            <li> I knew a drugstore brand couldn&#x27;t be as nice as a $200 one, but I&#x27;m surprised at just how bad this product is--</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning feel of my skin after using it every day as i am getting less and less black heads on my tzone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will post an update after a few week of usage, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll clear, and keep clear some pores that seem to stay clogged and therefore look larger.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve since been able to avoid pimples like the plague (which I suppose is a far worse fate than a few red bumps).</li>
            <li> At first your face seems a little dry</li>
            <li> The Olay brush bristles are very soft and are not available in a \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; option (although the higher speed DOES get a little deeper into the skin).</li>
            <li> a thick coat of aloe vera to calm it down, went to Walgreens to bring the product back, with a side trip to the health clinic to see if they could give me something else to calm my skin down.</li>
            <li> and I was having a hard time getting the button to hit the right spot before it would turn on.</li>
            <li> My initial problem was my skin looking dry and dull, but have noticed additional benefits since using this like breakouts clearing up quicker and some of the few fine lines I had becoming less and less visible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d thought a long time about purchasing one of the expensive models, but I seriously doubt it would clean better than this does.</li>
            <li> My T-zone is always very oily, and everything else is dry, dry, dry!</li>
            <li> for half the price, anyway, started seeing a difference in skin at first but not really after initial uses</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I expected and its much less of an investment.</li>
            <li> Great product and not super expensive like the other brands!</li>
            <li> I actually had an expensive face scrubber in my shopping cart ready to buy, but I couldn&#x27;t justify paying such a large price!</li>
            <li> duh pops right off</li>
            <li> Too much scrubbing can hurt and that is not good for oily or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I agree with other comments that the cleanser that comes with it is much too rough for any skin type.</li>
            <li> I would recommend only using every other day or three times a week if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday with my regular cleanser and have seriously fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> It comes with a very small tube of cleaner, so plan on buying more within just a few days.  </li>
            <li> and there isn&#x27;t a big difference between the low and high settings), I do notice a difference in my skin after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> But after I switched to high speed and used it for a few days, I finally noticed that my pores got significantly larger.</li>
            <li> I was so bummed because I had gotten such good results with it, but I did not want to throw it out since it was pretty expensive (not as expensive as the Clarisonic, I don&#x27;t think,)</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m addicted now and will probably buy a new one, although might be too much, if you have to buy a new one every other month.</li>
            <li> Kind of gross, had a weird consistency that was not right</li>
            <li> Most products dry out my skin, which is bad because I have sensitive skin and most moisturizers make it worse.</li>
            <li> I guess if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and really need some serious exfoliation</li>
            <li> I now use it to clean tough spots on my tub</li>
            <li> I generally use a make-up wipe before using the Olay Pro-X brush; however, I did a little test early on and used the brush (on a fully made-up face) BEFORE using the make-up wipe.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put the cleanser directly on the brush head and other times</li>
            <li> As an alternative to other costly face brush cleansing systems which I was not willing to spend the money on, every penny spent on the Olay brush it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to spend $200 on the other Professional Cleansing system that all of my friends have.  </li>
            <li> Start using it every other day depending how sensitive your skin is and add or lessen the days you use it.</li>
            <li> Skin is soft, I do it every day or every other day.  </li>
            <li> I occasionally use the Olay cleanser that comes with it, but usually use Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser.</li>
            <li> Due to the fact that I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I just have start off by saying that I am an 18 year old guy who has had extremely stubborn acne for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised it didn&#x27;t work due to all the hype</li>
            <li> The brush has gone over some long hair hanging down by my ears in particular, but the hair hasn&#x27;t gotten tangled in the brush.  </li>
            <li> Brush head fits onto the unit rather loosely allowing for the brush to fall off during use if not careful.</li>
            <li> I was only cleansing the surface of my skin and not deep down into the pores; since using this system my acne has cleared up drastically and my pores are clear after about 3 use.</li>
            <li> When I use this, I press pretty hard, and I can see my face getting red.  </li>
            <li> I thought at first it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;hard&#x27; enough on my face but</li>
            <li> However, given the modest price compared to other similar products this is worth purchasing especially if you have other than ordinary skin issues.</li>
            <li> but afterwards my skin felt rather raw - even when being gentle with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really isn&#x27;t the right word for it, but flake off dead skin and it&#x27;ll stay partially attached if I don&#x27;t scrub my nose vigorously (not the same as simply washing my face every night) at least once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> It cleans without irritating your skin and leaves your skin feeling clean and squeaky.  </li>
            <li> It is also soft enough to use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with the less expensive facial cleanser brush to see if I liked it -- which I do.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out your skin or leave it felling dry.</li>
            <li> Skin feels much softer especially around the nose area and forehead which are usually my problem areas.</li>
            <li> I usually get acne from not properly taking off all of my make-up, but this really helped.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an exfoliating brush for a long time and most of them are really expensive.</li>
            <li> Its small (I have small hands and this fits easily in one hand), lightweight and its quiet.</li>
            <li> Not only am I out in the middle of nowhere, but I&#x27;m not going to be out of town that long.</li>
            <li> They are hard enough to clean your skin well but soft enough that it won&#x27;t rub your skin too hard and make it red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a month and wonder how long it will last since I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, so it hasn&#x27;t been long enough yet to determine if it will help with that area.  </li>
            <li> I was going back and for about getting this the last time there was a $5 coupon, and waited too long</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to purchase any particular cleanser for results, but I would not recommend anything harsh.  </li>
            <li> that swear by the big brand version of this cleansing system, but there was no way I was going to shell out the money for one, so I decided to try this one, its almost the same as the fancy, expensive rotary brush I use in my professional treatments (part of an 8-in1, not a cheap piece of equipment, that&#x27;s for sure).</li>
            <li> I called Clarisonic and waited over 30 minutes on hold before speaking to a Customer Service rep. Clarisonic replaced it but would only issue a new 90-day warranty, which was a little upsetting to me.</li>
            <li> I have been breaking out my whole life and have tried every single thing on the planet to balance my facial skin and make my pores smaller, from just plain water or a rag with soap all the way to an acne system.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for young and lazy girls!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a little background from me - I&#x27;m a 21 year old African American male, never been to a spa.</li>
            <li> my skin is not very sensitive but this product did the opposite of why I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to live with my face looking and feeling a mess.</li>
            <li> head is too weak even on the highest power, does not clean anything, give product away to goodwill, better use your fingers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously shocked by how such a low cost product can do such an amazing job.</li>
            <li> Starting to form but switched back to my usual wash and everything went back to normal.</li>
            <li> this is high priced and its junk dont waste ur money</li>
            <li> I use the high speed and it is not overly harsh at all...</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I either don&#x27;t use the brush or I use it very gently on the slow setting.</li>
            <li> My combination skin is now very tame, doesn&#x27;t grease up in the middle of the day, pores look smaller, skin looks clearer, and my skin feels so much lighter.</li>
            <li> I have to say that based on the way the product is constructed it was not hard for me to figure out that the bottom was removable, however, it did require a little bit of force to get it off.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed Major improvements in skin texture and way fewer breakouts since using this twice a day, and keeping all other products the same.</li>
            <li> : I use it WAY longer than the recommended time and push pretty hard</li>
            <li> The first time I used the ProX on my face, there was hardly any redness or irritation on my nose or chin.</li>
            <li> This is messy to use, sprays all over the mirror if you don&#x27;t use it just right, and is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> know this will sound cheesy, but this little thing has absolutely changed my life.</li>
            <li> Before I deployed to Afghanistan I had decent skin, no pimple breakouts unless I was under serious stress and my face was clear.</li>
            <li> Run it on the fast speed for few seconds to shake off excess water and prop in an upright position to help it air dry.</li>
            <li> (As far as the battery installation issue, I found it took me less than 2 seconds after glancing at the instructions printed on the outside of the box.)</li>
            <li> Prior to use, I had blackheads on my nose and chin that wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what I tried in addition to occasional pimples and some dry, flaky patches of skin.  </li>
            <li> Spent half as much on this product as I did on my MK brush and can&#x27;t tell a difference.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use &amp; isn&#x27;t loud, cumbersome, or awkward to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li> Compared to the MIA this one feels cheap and the battery compartment mechanism is in a super annoying spot.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the bristles would be too hard, but they&#x27;re soft and this does a good job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li> The sample of cleanser is a decent sized sample and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t help clear up dark spots though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first set of batteries too, and it&#x27;s been at least a month.</li>
            <li> but it just feels much lighter than usual.</li>
            <li> Not sure if too much pulling and rubbing would do that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After getting the outer shell of dead skin professionally removed from my face, this product (or the more expensive Clairsonic) was recommended to me.</li>
            <li> getting the battery cover off was an exercise.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and very compact which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> not sure I see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel softer and cleaner, but still not sure it&#x27;s doing much for my acne.</li>
            <li> I tried different cheap and expensive face cleaning supply and none of them cleaned my face from acne, they are even didn&#x27;t make them smaller.</li>
            <li> This past winter really took a toll on my face.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my make-up goes on much smoother than it did in the past.</li>
            <li> It really helps exfoliate your skin and get all the dead skin off!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I believe the whole thing about making pores tinier and whatnot, we shall see.</li>
            <li> Not sure it really makes a difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It has adjustable speed, spins in circular motion and has long lasting batteries.</li>
            <li> Its battery powered and doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> I definitely plan to stick with it to see if there is any long term differences.  </li>
            <li> and I think that in the long run it will help me stay younger looking.  </li>
            <li> last a long time.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, I thought, as long as it feels softer and the texture improves over time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long this will last, that remains to be seen.</li>
            <li> have to say that the deep cleaning kick has not been one I hung with for a long time, but it is one I like.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on how long the batteries last yet.  </li>
            <li> Batteries and brush last for a really long time.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually even come shopping on Amazon for this product, but when I looked at the beauty bestsellers and saw this one had been the #1 seller for so long, I wanted to see what it was and what the hype was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long story short I ended up returning it because it irritated my face, and made me break out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell how long the brush last.</li>
            <li> Batteries are lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> Aside from these minor issues, the product itself is terrific.</li>
            <li> But I had to deduct one star, because I do not know how long will it last</li>
            <li> Long battery life, uses 2 standard AA batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It did catch my hair a time or two because the head spins around, but have learned to keep my long curly hair back.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to my hand,i packed it off to my mum in the town next to my city junst now。</li>
            <li> It comes with batteries and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> use mine with low environmental long life rechargeable batteries in it.  </li>
            <li> My combination skin usually only has minor breakouts every now and then.</li>
            <li> I use this nearly daily in the shower but not for as long as I probably should.  </li>
            <li> Another dermatologist suggested the Pro-X line, but after going so long spending next to nothing on skin care, I balked at the prices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one of these facial cleansers for a long while.</li>
            <li> Battery last a long time.</li>
            <li> will last that long.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone as long as you can take the 10-15 minutes to actually use it.</li>
            <li> It works in the shower, batteries last long.</li>
            <li> Either way, later that night and for the next few days my skin has felt so soft.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking of purchasing one of the more expensive versions of the microderm cleansers, and after reading other reviews decided to start with this one because it was relatively inexpensive and supposedly similar in performance.  </li>
            <li> , it works wonders on my face, at last i can see the glow i long dreamed of..</li>
            <li> This product did not clear my 12 yo daughter&#x27;s acne, but i think it helped, and it definitely gave her skin a dewier, glowy appearance.  </li>
            <li> I felt the normal aveeno face wash I was using was too harsh</li>
            <li> I normally use a heavy duty ex-foliating  </li>
            <li> Be careful, these brushes can be harsh and should only really be used once or twice weekly (and should not be used with abrasive cleansers or you risk skin damage).</li>
            <li> Face is softer, true, but it might be irritating.</li>
            <li> It does the job but goes pretty slow</li>
            <li> However , I wish the bristles were a little more tough.</li>
            <li> favorite thing about this little gadget is that it&#x27;s tough-</li>
            <li> While I wish the Olay Pro-X Cleansing System was a little bit stronger (brand new battery</li>
            <li> Years and years of acne left really large and visible pores on my cheeks and in just 10 days, I can hardly notice any of them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the brush head is super small also, I was expecting it to be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t in poor shape but it&#x27;s not that great either, no &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; other than the oily, slightly bumpy T zone, and a few dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small oval rubber pad with a place on the back to hold it while you&#x27;re cleansing the face, and it has short, little rubber nubs (like short bristles) over most of the surface with a small section at the bottom of raised circular things.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small oval rubber pad with a place on the back to hold it while you&#x27;re cleansing the face, and it has short, little rubber nubs (like short bristles) over most of the surface with a small section at the bottom of raised circular things.</li>
            <li> I did break out a little after the first few uses only because it was doing its job by pulling dirt out deep within my skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t press down too hard--just softly let it roll over my face.  </li>
            <li> I think it is a good alternative for those who find the other skin brush (you know which I am talking about) a little expensive for their budget.  </li>
            <li> The brush is a little soft, but I actually wash my face now that I use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit surprised that the brush suddenly stopped working, I only had to change the batteries maybe 3 times in the past year with daily use of the brush</li>
            <li> Much less money than other products but very functional.</li>
            <li> So, I figured that if what the Clarisonic boils down to is a facial cleansing brush, well, why not just go with the Olay for a whole lot less.</li>
            <li> I am not one to throw down that much money when I know I can find a similar product for less</li>
            <li> It would be an incredibly huge disappointment to spend so much money on something, only to have it let you down because it doesn&#x27;t do as it claims.</li>
            <li> Have not used the more expensive counterpart, so cannot compare this to other similar items.</li>
            <li> There are numerous other options that are more expensive.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no major breakouts since.</li>
            <li> I mean, if I were willing to spend over $100 on a cleansing brush I&#x27;d probably get the Clarisonic, but I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> I looked at the more expensive ones, and boy are they MORE Expensive!</li>
            <li> Thought the batteries might be dead but bought new batteries and the item still did not turn on.</li>
            <li> It was still dead when I tried new batteries.</li>
            <li> The batteries don&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long, so</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was realistic for someone on a very tight budget.</li>
            <li> I am using it to try and clear up black heads.</li>
            <li> My pores on my nose are clear and my face seems to have less blemishes and has a brighter appearance.</li>
            <li> I only use this to help get dry skin off my face every once in a while since it doesn&#x27;t do what it used to.</li>
            <li> I was surprised the brushes are not crazy expensive, but there is no detail on how often they suggest you to replace them.</li>
            <li> I think I will pass it along to my teenage son who will like to use the rotating brush to clean his skin for the novelty of it, but I suspect he will get bored with it after a short time.</li>
            <li> Not only that but my forehead and temples are so dry they&#x27;re peeling.</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin and an occasional break out.  </li>
            <li> I use the Pro-X every evening, and occasionally in the morning on a dry spot here or there if I detect any sign of flakes anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I have had no trouble with the brush draining/drying, as I set it on the edge of the sink with the brush part slightly off the edge.</li>
            <li> made my face dry up and flake with only one use.</li>
            <li> made my face dry up and flake with only one use.</li>
            <li> After I shower, I dry the scrubber off and rinse off the head one last time, and then I place both on a towel on a shelf in my bedroom where the air is dryer than in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did experience a &#x27;flush&#x27; of small blemishes at first, but that was just bringing up what I was unable to clean before this product.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and by the way, the battery case isn&#x27;t as difficult to open as some reviews have made it sound.</li>
            <li> The battery has lasted half a year so far with no signs of stopping.</li>
            <li> Using this product really has changed my skin making breakouts less often, less severe and giving my skin an overall glow.  </li>
            <li> and I have a mixed skin (oily T-zone and dry cheeks).</li>
            <li> We both suffer from exceptionally dry skin and keratosis pilaris, and in the winter, the redness and tiny bumps on my son hurt my heart.  </li>
            <li> I found that there is less residue in the bristles when you apply the face wash directly to your face than to the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I let it dry out and then put it back together.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m flaky, dry, and red.</li>
            <li> I purchased this instead of the clarisonic because there were far less reports of the pro x causing acne.</li>
            <li> The gel adhesive they used caused a reaction and I ended up with extremely dry, red patches.</li>
            <li> I also noticed my skin became a lot dry and had break outs in the following days of using it.</li>
            <li> so, for a considerable less amount...this works great!&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from adult acne and black heads for years and years.</li>
            <li> No power and extremely soft bristles make for a less the invigorating experience.</li>
            <li> My skin has recently been peeling and dry.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use for kids and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> The brush gets really gross after you washing it out and dry it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my skin, but then again the only issue I have is dry skin...</li>
            <li> I had an old Beauticontrol one and it didn&#x27;t work half as well as this.  </li>
            <li> My skin before using this product was dry with occasional outbreaks.</li>
            <li> After numerous tries, and using all my strength, I finally pried it off.</li>
            <li> I spent the last twenty minutes trying to open the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> This product has really help to take all the flakey dead skin off of my face with out leaving the redness from a rough wash clothe.  </li>
            <li> I started noticing  blotchy skin larger pores, so I added my Origins (Dr. Weil) skin correcting serum back to my rotation, hmmm, not really helping.  </li>
            <li> it apparently comes with however, and it&#x27;s not worth sending it back just to get it.</li>
            <li> I started with the sample of the exfoliant that was provided before I spent money on the big tube, but after using it for two weeks, ordered the big tube.  </li>
            <li> Has two speeds, the brush is soft while firm enough to exfoliate and massage face without pain</li>
            <li> have used this product daily now for several weeks and see absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s hard to say whether it&#x27;s this product, or the fact that it makes me cleanse daily by being there that has helped my skin, but it&#x27;s definitely been better as of late!</li>
            <li> Alas, the bristles became misshapen quickly too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe controlling common acne has to be complicated, and this tool is a good weapon to have in the arsenal.</li>
            <li> The same for the deeper lines on my forehead and between my brows - they are shorter, not as deep and barely noticeable with a little foundation.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use it with Aveeno Positively Ageless after the sample runs out since it&#x27;s less than half the price of the product that came with this system.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s doing anything positive or negative to my skin.</li>
            <li> High marks from a little boy!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used this facial brush with my usual cleanser.</li>
            <li> I had a professional facial recently and the esthitician used a small brush which worked just like the Olay.</li>
            <li> and after trying it a few more times not sure I&#x27;d even use it for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even tried fresh batteries and it was still weak.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about purchasing this because I&#x27;m usually not a huge skin care product fan, but using the cleansing system is like a trip to the spa (without the expense), and it is definitely worth the value.</li>
            <li> a loose one.&lt;br /&gt;**I bought this for $22 with amazon prime and noticed that the price has increased since I purchased it, even with the current clip coupon feature.</li>
            <li> my facial products loose</li>
            <li> As I use primer, foundation and loose powder, even with cleaning oil and gel cleanser some residue is left but not after using pro x</li>
            <li> The extra exfoliation helps my medicine reach further down in my pores, and I do notice an improvement in skin tone over the last two months.</li>
            <li> If you use it at least once a day, it really makes breakouts less frequent (in my experience anyway).</li>
            <li> The tube could have been half the size, which was small in the first place, there was a lot of air in the tube, not only did it not feel like it was cleaning the face</li>
            <li> Have periods of time when I get \\&quot;You&#x27;re glowing\\&quot; and other times when its sallow and lifeless or extra greasy with open pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My entire face started to break out, grow a lot of black heads and white heads, and turn as red as a tomato.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this product, some how I got the batteries stuck in my original one and it became useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than other systems similar such as the one sephora sells but works just as well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like the Olay exfoliating cleanser (I&#x27;ve tried some of their other cleansers which were too harsh), but I really like this one...</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in skin texture last week after that was used, but it could also have been the other products used on my face from the facial too.  </li>
            <li> I had low expectations due to the low cost of this item.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product, but unfortunately when I received my package I only received the Toner and Cleanser that I ordered in conjunction.  </li>
            <li> I only wish it came with different attachments like other brands</li>
            <li> They literally put them against each other and said they both work equally the same</li>
            <li> no need to buy other, more expensive cleaning brush....</li>
            <li> I would buy this product over any other type of similar facial brush in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I do not always use the Pro-X cleanser, and have tried different facial cleansers (other brands as well)</li>
            <li> This system does the same thing that the more expensive ones do, but costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shopped around at Macy&#x27;s and various other department stores for this type of facial cleaning product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after my other more expensive brush stopped working just after the warranty period ended.</li>
            <li> If it abraded or was harsh I would have been a rashy mess and it didn&#x27;t do that to me, even from the first use.  </li>
            <li> we use it a lot, we put exfoliator on it once a week and use and regular facial wash other nights or mornings.</li>
            <li> It is gel like, no foam action and did not clean well.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very, very soft and flexible so it&#x27;s not like a stiff brush.</li>
            <li> I could only use it twice a week, but even then, my skin felt very dry and flaky (I have combination skin).&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this to try to see if I could clear my face up a little.</li>
            <li> and my skin was sensitive for a little bit after that.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when the cleaner lathered up a little bit.</li>
            <li> the brush is soft, but I still feel a little bit hurt.  </li>
            <li> I started using this a little over a month ago because I&#x27;ve been dealing with stubborn adult acne for a while</li>
            <li> The little bumps and congestions are gone (or nearly so), and discolorations are reduced.</li>
            <li> maybe a little too soft, but you can change that with the pressure you apply it with.  </li>
            <li> became too busy with life and let this little gem sit on the edge of the counter for a while.</li>
            <li> brush a little too soft.</li>
            <li> THE BRISTLES ARE A LITTLE SOFT - HAVEN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> week+: After a little while, getting a little doubtful as to whether this is the best product for my acne.</li>
            <li> And there is a high and low setting if I don&#x27;t feel like scrubbing too hard.    </li>
            <li> The Pro-X gives me tthe ability to clean all areas, especially the difficult ones.ie:  Around the nose,mouth,and chin area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not by any means a powerful motor, but regardless it&#x27;s annoying trying to clean your skin when the one direction is pulling your hand each time you make contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this back in 2011 - when I really wanted a Clarisonic but just couldn&#x27;t justify the ridiculous price tag of the Clarisonic and bought this instead.</li>
            <li> The first time i used it i thought the bristles were a little too soft to do anything at all, but after a few uses it seemed to stiffen up a little bit</li>
            <li> When I first started using the brush, for a couple days my skin felt a little dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about my long hair getting tangled in it, but so far that hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  </li>
            <li> In order to not dry out my skin, I use this every other day with my Eminence cleanser.</li>
            <li> on fast mode it hardly goes...</li>
            <li> I really thought it would help my skin, which has a hard time exfoliating itself now that I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties.  </li>
            <li> The two power levels are really well adjusted and it works for those days that you feel your skin sensible so you don&#x27;t go hard on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same battery in it for nearly three months and have been using this 2-3 times a week, so the battery lasts a while, and the fact that the brush heads only come in one type, but for less than half the price I&#x27;m not going to complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day - morning on the low setting and before going to be on the high and then layer on a thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin was softer, my pores appeared smaller, and those little rough spots on both sides of my nose (in the fold) were completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I can see these tiny little white things (finer than salt) hanging out of my pores, which is gross.  </li>
            <li> Then use a sharp scissors tip to puncture the middle of the bottom and then cut-cut-cut round and round to get the right size hole.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my pores have reduced dramatically, my face is now clearer more often than having breakouts, and my skin throughout the day is less oily (probably due to the decrease in poor size).</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any spectacular results but nothing bad either.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t too sure about this product since skin poducts has dried out my skin badly.</li>
            <li> I am probably responsible for the selling of at least 5 of these to my friends, as I cannot stop raving about this product.</li>
            <li> I rather use Ponds cold cream with the machine and it works like a charm :)</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how it compares with a Clarisonic though I would be interested in finding out, but after my disappointing results with this I don&#x27;t plan on forking out over 150 dollars any time soon without knowing that it will work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a week of using the Pro-X at least once a day, it really started to grow on me.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it just didn&#x27;t enjoy the feeling.</li>
            <li> I can understand wanting to err on the side of being too gentle for the masses, but it sucks for people who are already used to using a face brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a desperate attempt to feel better about my skin</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my face, and they have faded to the point where minimal make up covers them up completely.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have whiteheads, however, I am prone to frequent blackheads and occasional cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have grown used to the gentle sonic action of the Clarisonic as well as the deep pore cleansing brush head.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that sometimes it gives me small rashes on the apples of my cheeks and near the nose.</li>
            <li> Smaller that expected</li>
            <li> It  was too rough for my face, I sill use wash rag to properly wash my face.</li>
            <li> i even found this strange residue like oil in the battery compartment</li>
            <li> Do be careful if using a differnt facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I dab both in several spots all over the face, wet the brush pad, and wash with the spinner all over, from forehead to neck.</li>
            <li> I wish i bought this long ago.</li>
            <li> I swear my makeup was never completely taken off before after seeing the stuff that shows up on the bristles even after wiping makeup off before cleansing.</li>
            <li> Because this cleansing system is not harsh, you can use it everyday - but once a day.  </li>
            <li> I opted not to use the Olay cleaner and swapped it for my regular exfoliator since the texture and odor were not amenable to me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with minor to severe acne to help balance out your skin.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but it did not  take that long for this to break so WARNING...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals, dyes, or sulfates for those with sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li> Wow those were harsh even for a scrubber like me.  </li>
            <li> It takes too long to use this brush for no benefit.</li>
            <li> Someone said it didn&#x27;t say how long to use it....</li>
            <li> so see if I like it before I spent $100s on a similar product.</li>
            <li> I finally got it though (after googling it) and I am really not looking forward to the day the batteries need replacing.</li>
            <li> wish I didn&#x27;t wait so long to get it.</li>
            <li> when I read how others have spent over 200 bucks on another product to get similar results.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued with blackheads for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> I expected a larger product !</li>
            <li> I do like the product, but worry it may be too abrasive for long term use.</li>
            <li> I use a tiny bit liquid hand soap with water to wet my face, then go over with the brush.  </li>
            <li> I have to be extremely careful with anything that touches my facial skin.  </li>
            <li> I only used about 5-6 times and followed the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> (it is described as having micro crystals in them That seems a bit rough to me for a facial scrubber.</li>
            <li> One thing that I was worried about was that it would be too rough on my skin, but nothing could be further from reality.</li>
            <li> It came as expected and was the quality I wanted .I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Be extra careful to keep your hair out of the way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for just about a week and at 42 my face gets rough (especially during a Pittsburgh winter!).  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using the cleanser or exfoliation lotion with it after the sample is empty because i&#x27;ve found a simple apricot scrub works just as well.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive, but is aging  and oily.</li>
            <li> I use this along with some st Ives scrub and it completely removes all makeup all dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> and I take long</li>
            <li> I use which is really not a dedicated \\&quot;facial cream\\</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to invest in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learnt that lingering on one spot irritates the skin and the area becomes rough the following days.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ll be sticking with this tool for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> But overall, money well spent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the stuff I used for acne when I was younger or my entire face gets itchy, red and dried out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product all that long</li>
            <li> battery also comes for a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin was glowing, felt firm and soft.</li>
            <li> so I have to leave it cleaning my face for a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, if you are careful to store the device so that nothing touches the brushhead -- the head will last a loooong time.</li>
            <li> have now ordered the replacement brush, and hope that I can keep using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Clariosonic, which I still have and use for rest of body, but I thought it was too big and too rough for my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued with blackheads for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive, but is aging (sigh) and oily.</li>
            <li> So far I have had it a few months, it is used alot and we have had no problems with it.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not loud.</li>
            <li> brush isn&#x27;t too harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Since it was rotating, it got caught in her long hair and made some of her hair come out</li>
            <li> It is a kinda microdermabrasion type product and along with the brush is WAY TO HARSH - and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Yet, I was curious about these facial cleansing brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time</li>
            <li> I suffered from severe acne for a long time.</li>
            <li> Unit is defective, but the its packaging for return is long gone.  </li>
            <li> It took about 2 seconds to pull it apart properly, with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> It worked well in terms of cleansing off makeup, but it is so HARSH on my skin (maybe because I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> Product came in earlier than expected and in mint condition.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if the battery container harder been easier to open!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to order this</li>
            <li> I  wish I had had not waiting so long.  </li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;m still not completely sold yet,</li>
            <li> I have looked at these things for a long time.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to wash off all the foams if you are using a foaming cleanser, and it leaves your skin kinda of not completely washed...</li>
            <li> I had acne for a long time.  </li>
            <li> am a long time fan of the Olay products and I bought this because I heard it was comparable to the clarisonic</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for a long time, but some of them are pricey.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I only wished there was an additional Harder Bristle/Brush and a (3) THREE SPEED instead of a (2) two speeder.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts....</li>
            <li> Is not too rough and can be used daily.</li>
            <li> advise anyone who is looking to buy facial cleanser, or a cleansing system, to be extremely careful of what they put on their skin.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small tube of Olay cleanser, but I have substituted that for my normal cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was curious and tempted to purchase until I saw the price ($100+ for the basic).</li>
            <li> I had been wanting this for a long time since I can&#x27;t afford the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, so the Olay scrub it comes with was too harsh.</li>
            <li> I spent 30 bucks on this and it only lasted 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been so long since my skin felt like this.</li>
            <li> I will def be buying replacement heads for this and using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t use it long.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with adult acne on my chin and my forehead for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I must confess I expected it to be bigger but</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for a long time but never got around to buying one till now.</li>
            <li> I HAVE MINOR BREAK OUTS AND BLACKHEADS GLORY.</li>
            <li> Works a long time on a set of batteries, can be kept in the shower with no problem.</li>
            <li> I have been debating about a Clarisonic for a long time and was deterred by the price.</li>
            <li> Will have to see the long term results before the jury is in though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a Clarisonic for a long time, but the price always bugged me.</li>
            <li> i certainly expected this to last longer than 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> For a long time, I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase the Clearasonic.</li>
            <li> Wish I had one a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using it everyday because it&#x27;s a bit rough for a skin especially if you have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed, but happily surprised so many times.</li>
            <li> first I was confused on how to open the battery compartment</li>
            <li> After purchasing this ans trying it for the first time, I found a few things i disliked about it.</li>
            <li> It has made my average skin look better then ever, and has not caused any weird breakouts or redness.  </li>
            <li> but since getting the Olay I have actually gone out a few times with bare skin...</li>
            <li> You can switch between two speeds (fast and slow) but the difference isn&#x27;t as noticeable.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, using this little machine, you can really tell what kinds of things are hidden in your pores.</li>
            <li> I imagine i will need to buy a new bristle brush after about 6-12 months of use because the bristles are starting to tilt/lay down a little bit.</li>
            <li> which I think it actually is .. but ended up breaking down 2 months later &amp; the battery was leaking on the inside.</li>
            <li> my skin feels smoother and i can feel my facial cleanser tingling deep down in my pores</li>
            <li> I see now the major difference between this and the previous $100 one I bought at the spa.  </li>
            <li> Me on the other hand, I had such high hopes but it made my sensitive skin much worse.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about it actually irritating my skin, but that won&#x27;t happen as long as you apply the right amount of pressure and don&#x27;t take too long to use it.</li>
            <li> The low speed is too weak, the high speed made my face turning red.</li>
            <li> The only negative was trying to get the bottom off to put new batteries in.</li>
            <li> I have pale and sensitive skin but am not prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This is better, less expensive, and you don&#x27;t have to sign up for automatic delivery.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is really dry or sensitive don&#x27;t use this everyday...</li>
            <li> I had the more expensive Clarisonic, I think the Olay cleanser works just as well for a LOT less money.</li>
            <li> I use it almost daily with african black soap (which helps control my acne).</li>
            <li> I try not getting it wet when washing my face in the sink, and always dry it off if even a tiny drop of water lands on it (by inside, I&#x27;m referring to where the battery goes..</li>
            <li> found it odd that there was no product insert, only the rather brief instructions on the box.</li>
            <li> Black head and white head lesser, can see my skin is improving.</li>
            <li> The more expensive options pulsate, and [in theory] less damaging to your skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t too harsh on my sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> I mean really if the power isn&#x27;t to drive something that I can&#x27;t recreate (sonic)</li>
            <li> I usually have to buy her a new one every couple of years, but she cleans her face with this twice a day, and loves them.</li>
            <li> Usually when I try new &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; things like cleansers with abrasives</li>
            <li> But at the first you have to pull the battery part out really hard!</li>
            <li> Reduced dry skin from the cold or dry air, reduced skin irritation and pimples from a more thorough cleansing and exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Day One, i used this brush to take my makeup off, and when I woke up the next morning, I was shocked to see that my face was still as soft and clean as it had been the night before.</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s the Olay brush, but I&#x27;m not NEAR as oily, in fact I&#x27;m dry in some areas.</li>
            <li> My skin also gets a little red (but goes away) after using the Mia, much like when I have gotten facials in the past (because of your skin being stimulated and the blood rushing to the skin to heal).</li>
            <li> I previously used a HomeMedics version of the same thing and had to keep sending it to back on warranty because after limited use it would stop working.</li>
            <li> I really love Olay products, so I was disappointed, especially because the price is so good. :(</li>
            <li> , I was a little skeptical about trying this product but after reading multiple positive reviews online I purchased it with high expectations.</li>
            <li> i left my clarisonic at my other house</li>
            <li> Never used other facial brushes, so cannot compared to them.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to invest in a cleansing tool and unlike other reviewers, I found both speeds helpful.</li>
            <li> This really works - I&#x27;ve used it for a few days 1-2X with the scrub included and my usual facial soap</li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d give this little gizmo a try when I realized that apart from the occasional actual scrub, I don&#x27;t ever scrub my face when I wash it.</li>
            <li> I only use it every other day as I don&#x27;t want to overexfoliate my skin</li>
            <li> You can use the exfoliating cream that comes with it or use any other cream or facial cleanser you choose.  </li>
            <li> I debated endlessly about the Clairsonic, but the price held me back.  </li>
            <li> I use the Olay Cleanser or occasionally some other liquid cleansers and am always amazed at how well it removes every trace of makeup and leaves my skin and pores looking spotless.</li>
            <li> While smaller than other brushes it seems to do a satisfactory job.  </li>
            <li> I only wish that the brushhead could turn in the other direction, too, but whatever.</li>
            <li> I like the facial cleaning brush, but wish the head were a little bit larger.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised at how small this is...don&#x27;t know why, but I expected it to be bigger.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s much smaller than the other two).</li>
            <li> I was little skeptical before, but after using it I surely can recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have only used it 3 times and other people have noticed it too.</li>
            <li> Actually I&#x27;m still not sure about the vibrations hype of the more expensive brushes...</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about rotating cleansing brushes, and definitely didn&#x27;t want to spend the exorbitant amounts of other brands.  </li>
            <li> I only use the cleanser that comes with it once a week due to it</li>
            <li> While this proved a little too harsh for my skin, it worked very well on our toddler&#x27;s cheeks during an eczema flare up.</li>
            <li> My face feels just like it does after I get an $80 facial at the salon, and this is whether I use the Olay cleanser or any other cleanser...</li>
            <li> Keep in mind other products only vibrate vs rotating.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference instantly and so did other people.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily/acne prone skin and occasionally have cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I use other cleansers including soap with the brush, occasionally use the Olay scrub.  </li>
            <li> Having never had an ongoing skin care regimen and heading into my 45th year on this earth, I thought maybe I would give my face some attention, so I bought this brush along with several other skin care items.  </li>
            <li> Works well but not much different than other ones out there.</li>
            <li> I am a sufferer of deep cystic acne, so when breakouts do happen (often due to a systemic issue) ...</li>
            <li> My only concern is in the exfoliating gel, I believe u can replace it with any other.</li>
            <li> Other similar units are $100.00&lt;</li>
            <li> I got this instead of the Clarsonic due to the prices being astronomically different and the reviews being comparable.</li>
            <li> spend a lot of money on other similar products.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers noted there are no instructions as to where to insert the batteries or how to open the compartment (end of handle) once you&#x27;ve found it (just keep pulling until it opens).  </li>
            <li> When I added the Pro X Cleanser to the brush after using a different cleanser, I saw that it removed make-up that the other face wash missed.</li>
            <li> I think the effectiveness is due in part equally to the cream and the brush combined.</li>
            <li> but I think it works just as well with other face washes such as Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s mostly due to use of hair removal products from upper lip area and also acne scarring around my chin area.</li>
            <li> Recommend it especially for impure skin, but also for other types of skin, to keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I am now using it every other night, and still use a lower dose of benzoyl peroxide but only on the nights I don&#x27;t use the brush,</li>
            <li> I use the exfoliator every other day and my regular face wash between.  </li>
            <li> I have used it with other cleansers from different brands like Neutrogena and it works well.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t wash it, I think that the bacteria and little skin bits stay on the brush, as I have definitely noticed that if i don&#x27;t wash the brushead, next time I use it I will get a breakout.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a victim of adult acne, slight, and blackheads, but so far, after 3 days of use, there is a noticeable difference in my black heads and my moisturizer is going on easier and am using less.</li>
            <li> In fairness, I&#x27;m not exactly a girly-girl so facial care lasts about 26 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have also noted from reading other low star reviews herein that they have jobbers bashing this Olay Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve gone so long without this!</li>
            <li> I, of course, originally considered getting a Clarisonic, but they are quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush about 2 weeks ago, I don&#x27;t use it daily maybe every other day.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using this product as long as Olay keeps making the replacement heads!</li>
            <li> use it only once or twice a week (because the other days I like to scrub with my microderm vitamin C from the body shop and also Ocean Salt from</li>
            <li> the brush does well with my other cleansing facial soaps or gels.</li>
            <li> do wish the brush head was a little bit bigger, but that&#x27;s only to save time in my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I am using various cleansers that I already have, some are exfoliating and other just cleansers</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little tube of exfoliant product seemed to work well enough, but was a very tiny amount  . . .</li>
            <li> giving only 2 stars due to defective product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also adopted using the brush with other facial cleaners that I prefer to use.  </li>
            <li> My skin never feels dry since using this product every other day for the last three weeks!</li>
            <li> *battery compartment hard to open but thanks to previous posts</li>
            <li> I realized that I wasn&#x27;t using it for very long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at this product for a very long time and told myself to not take the chance of breaking out in hives and burning of the skin.</li>
            <li> ,my fave is too sensitive for this though, makes my skin sore to touch and raw.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft, so it&#x27;s not like your scrubbing your face raw...</li>
            <li> I was surprised my skin felt raw.</li>
            <li> Its hard getting refills; they&#x27;re even too damn high $$$, or always add on items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily and noticed slightly more dryness post-shower, but nothing bad.</li>
            <li> and I wanted something to help buff off that dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin during winter</li>
            <li> I wash it by hand, splash dry, and then pat dry with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that flakes.</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer blotchy and covered in dry patches.  </li>
            <li> At home I&#x27;ll just let it dry in place with the Pro-X on its side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I was looking for:  an end to dry patches of flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> It gets rid of all the dry, flaky skin that was plaguing me.</li>
            <li> My makeup seems to go on smoother after using it and it also helps keeps away the flakiness of dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Used this for 2 days and my skin was so irritated and dry</li>
            <li> seriously, this was basically like holding an electric toothbrush (with much softer bristles) up to my face.  </li>
            <li> Not too dry, not too oily.</li>
            <li> I am 49, with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The dry patches of skin are gone.  </li>
            <li> I have a severe dry skin problem so just washing my face doesn&#x27;t get all that grossness up.</li>
            <li> but my skin was getting really dry in patches from it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest using this twice a day as it may dry out skin.</li>
            <li> it did dry my face up quite a bit so</li>
            <li> Before I used this my skin was so dry</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that was not too expensive to clean my face.  </li>
            <li> she has a lot of dry skin on her nose that was making her makeup flake.</li>
            <li> Then I seperate the brush head from the handle and dry with a towl.</li>
            <li> I used it dry.</li>
            <li> I did find the product to cause dry patches in my skin</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to have dry skin come spring/summer, so this was my saving grace this year.</li>
            <li> Smooths dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin felt really dry.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t getting rid of the dry skin I sometimes develop.  </li>
            <li> I also have dry spots on my face and some oily spots - this cream has evened it all out.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> 3- Dab brush dry, wipe and put away brush.</li>
            <li> wipe dry.  </li>
            <li> After dreamily looking at images of the Clarisonic for a few weeks and then sadly looking at my bank statement, I started my search for a more affordable alternative that could still get the job done.</li>
            <li> It is oily and dry.  </li>
            <li> and I still felt that it was cleaning my skin and removing any dry or flaky skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it with the Olay definity Illuminating cleanser as my skin tends to be dry sometimes.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t slough off all the dry skin.</li>
            <li> I may consider using another cleanser as the Olay cleanser tends to dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I have dry skin that flakes</li>
            <li> Have used this product just a couple of times and didn&#x27;t seem to dry my face out.</li>
            <li> Using this got rid of my dry flaky skin, but I plan on buying the clarosonic</li>
            <li> My skin is dry skin, and when I use it, my skin gets clearer, brighter and softer.</li>
            <li> and then it was dry and blotchy.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a purge, it was dry, blotchy-ness.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Getting rid of the flaking dry skin makes the skin look healthier and even clearer.</li>
            <li> It did not get rid of my blackheads, nothing will, but it does help removed dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have skin that is not oily or dry, but acne prone.</li>
            <li> I used to get dry patches of skin on my cheeks</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t dry out, but I didn&#x27;t see any change in my complexion.</li>
            <li> Face becomes Dry, if you have dry skin problem dont purchase this&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s oily and others is dry.</li>
            <li> (I have dry skin).</li>
            <li> I just rinse it out every night and allow it to air dry.</li>
            <li> With dry winter weather upon us, it&#x27;s the time of year</li>
            <li> I have some hormonal cystic acne and combination skin that tends to dry out in the winter.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to clean my nose.  </li>
            <li> Good-bye break outs and dry</li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> Oily t-zone, dry cheeks and chin &amp; cycystic acne on jawline.</li>
            <li> Remember to moisturize after you use it though -- exfoliating will always dry your skin up.</li>
            <li> Both my breakouts and dry, flaky skin areas have reduced significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It gets all of the make up off of my face and gets rid of the dry skin.</li>
            <li> Yes to Blueberries cleanser for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I then dry it with my towel and put it in the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then dry it with my towel and put it in the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this helps me get the dry skin off</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s (29), and out of no where I started breaking out on my face, mainly my forehead.</li>
            <li> I edged in as carefully as I could in an attempt to bridge this gap, and surely enough I ended up with wet facewash frothy hair twirls -admittedly</li>
            <li> After comparing a few different facial cleaning devices, I decided I would give this one a try.</li>
            <li> you might want to get a big one after you finish using the sample!  and pick up a few extra brushes as well.</li>
            <li> I too was skeptical considering the enormous difference in price between the two; however, for a fraction of the cost, it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Yes the battery compartment is difficult to open, but it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li> Having purchased the Clarsonic and then having given it to my daughter who was having skin issues a few months back, I knew I could not afford to buy a second one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times with 2 different exfoliant creams but, regardless, the end result is not the &amp;#34;baby bottom&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It has just enough abrasives to slough off residual dead skin and, if you wear makeup daily at my age, removed ALL traces of makeup.  </li>
            <li> It could use a few improvements, but that may make it more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month and have noticeably less breakouts and my skin is not nearly as dry....</li>
            <li> i use it every morning and my face is starting to clear up slowly.</li>
            <li> I only use it a few times a week, but I feel like that&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> In only a few days, my skin was actually tighter, brighter.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU USE IT EVERYDAY AND DO IT CORRECTLY- you can achieve similar results as doing the professional thing for so much less).  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product to use on a daily base.</li>
            <li> I have had no new pimples.  </li>
            <li> Also, I feel I need to mention it was pretty tough for me to figure out how to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have very dull skin as all the scrubs I have tried (and believe me there are MANY) aggravated my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> K so I have had skin issues on and off since high school but lately have been suffering from persistent cystic acne breakouts that would not go away....</li>
            <li> This thing is so slow turning, even on high,</li>
            <li> The cleanser that comes with this set is also a little more expensive than Olay products typically are - currently $15 for 6 ounces -- if you decide to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay</li>
            <li> I use it every single night.</li>
            <li> I have had the Pro-X a month now and have not had a single blemish since I started using it...</li>
            <li> I know all of the skin specialists cringe when they see people tearing up their skin with this, but this is the single product that keeps acne at bay.</li>
            <li> Use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower every single day and this product has proved itself to be as waterproof as the makers claim.</li>
            <li> Since I have started using it, I have not had a single pimple.</li>
            <li> I use this brush every single day for over a year now</li>
            <li> and now i am ordering the limited addition virsion of it</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and short, which translates to a firm press with little give when applied to the face.</li>
            <li> Bristles were too soft for me, very little exfoliation.</li>
            <li> My skin feels cleaner and less weighed down but not dried out immediately after I use it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would help clear up the small blackheads around my lips, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, but it is no good to me if it keeps breaking.  </li>
            <li> Brush is too soft and a bit small, I upgraded to a Clarisonic Mia.  </li>
            <li> I also wondered why they did not offer me a replacement instead of a refund if this was not normal.  </li>
            <li> I was in the Marines for 4 years and after two deployments my face maybe due to the water and dirt that soaked my face left it always feeling rough</li>
            <li> I was surprised how small and lightweight this cleansing machine was when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> Ehh just by a soft brush and scrub your face with exfoliating face wash... this is for lazy people</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve been using once a day, usually in the morning but sometimes at night as well, &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed a softer smoother skin on my forehead, nose, &amp; around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and noticed an improvement in my skin after one week especially where I had dark spots.</li>
            <li> I used to be one of those people who didn&#x27;t even think past using my hands to do the job--this completely changed my mind.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that it only has two speeds--high and low.</li>
            <li> The dual speed is a bonus, sometimes I use the deeper one, especially after a heavy make-up day.&lt;br /&gt;I found the sample cleanser that came with the device somewhat harsh, and my face is not even sensitive.</li>
            <li> Apparently the foam heads offered on their products do not fit this one.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and have been using it nearly everyday with a pump foaming natural face wash from a local store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a bit irritating to my skin at first</li>
            <li> When you use the product the first few times when the bristles are still new, you do feel a difference in the slow and high speeds; but now that I&#x27;ve worn the bristles out I am unable to tell the difference with the two speeds of the brush.</li>
            <li> I figured I had nothing to loose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using concealer and foundation(something I&#x27;ve NEVER done!), and now just use a tinted moisturizer and loose powder.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll come loose eventually.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was getting the back off to put the batteries in... its very tight to avoid moisture seeping inside but apart from that I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in how often I break out or how bad breakouts are, but it isn&#x27;t making anything worse and is very fun to use.</li>
            <li> My skin appears younger and less dry.</li>
            <li> I finally tracked one down and have been using it for about one week.  </li>
            <li> I had troubles identifying where the mechanism opens up to insert the batteries; there is not button to push it open, you just have to force down the bottom part of the handle.</li>
            <li> So I finally broke down and bought the Olay Pro-X today and tried it out.  </li>
            <li> Then drop the Pro-X brush head down into the K-Cup and let the tip go through the hole you made and then stick it back on the Pro-X.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like I could justify plunking down that much on a facial</li>
            <li> There is no recommendation on how often to change the bristle head, but we have had our for about 1 month and the bristles are not starting to break down or curl yet, so I haven&#x27;t changed it.  </li>
            <li> u can feel it scrubbing down deep</li>
            <li> The only down side I can see is that it runs on batteries versus having a charger.</li>
            <li> It gets all the dirt deep down in your skin that a washcloth just cant reach.</li>
            <li> If you press down the bristles bend and you are getting the sides of the bristles and the only thing you accomplish is wearing the head</li>
            <li> and  I applied the pressure to get deep down into my pores.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see how this can get deep down into your pores and exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I was a call away from going in for microdermabrasion treatment at my local dermatologist when I decided to break down and by this for $25.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the Pro-X four stars, though, because it could quite possibly simply come down to preference.</li>
            <li> And although a $200 power brush was being promoted in that little article, I wasn&#x27;t about to blow that much cash on something I&#x27;m not sure would work.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliating cleanser will last for quite a while as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> That night my face was red for a couple hours probably because I used both products a little too long, but balance comes with experience.  </li>
            <li> It actually made the dry patches and redness clearer and after the second use, I literally have no more dry patches!</li>
            <li> The brush was very limp and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a high priority item, so I started to look for alternatives.</li>
            <li> However, just know that it is a flimsier product, much less powerful, and slow!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely mild with very tiny granules in a creamy base, but thus far I&#x27;m using it only every few days, no need to use it daily.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that the bristles on this would be sharp like some of the cheap, handheld facial brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to getting expensive facials and getting other expensive cleaning systems.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on the Mia or other expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> I live in Houston and the air is humid and thick here.  </li>
            <li> It spins so slowly, even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> just keep it dry!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne but have always had issues with small bumps along my jawline and more recently, randomly on my forehead.</li>
            <li> how difficult it is to get that thing to open for the first time.</li>
            <li> I debated on buying the expensive facial cleansing brushes but tried this first in attempt to save money while planning my wedding and going to school.</li>
            <li> smaller pores and less blackheads.  </li>
            <li> seeing as how the replacement heads are less than $10 that&#x27;s not a big issue for me.      </li>
            <li> Olay brush removed almost 100% of my milia in less than a month of 1x daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only been using this thing for about a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> i use it with African black soap</li>
            <li> And while I can&#x27;t say I have small pores after using this product, I do think it helped smooth out my skin slightly and it slightly decreased how obvious my pores are.  </li>
            <li> After using every night for two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks smoother all around, and definitely have noticed less breakouts and a clearer complexion.</li>
            <li> But then after I use my toner, I still have slight residue left over as well.</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose for a small travel version, and if you&#x27;ve never used it&#x27;s much more expensive cousin, you&#x27;ll probably like it.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels softer, less oily, and my pores appear smaller.  </li>
            <li> My skin is less shiny and my pores are smaller since using this</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily for about a year and a half now</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve already gone through my third one in about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a battery-powered facial brush for one-half the price of the Olay model, and it broke within three weeks.  </li>
            <li> Works like a charm and the black heads on my nose are finally gone!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure it cleans deep enough.  </li>
            <li> The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is that I am not sure how well the product will last.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t typically experiment a lot with facial cleansing systems like scrubs or exfoliators or even cleansers - afterall</li>
            <li> I had some scarring from previous acne and it is starting to fade.  </li>
            <li> Depending on the day and my skin (or how lazy I am), I alternate the Pro-X with my AcneFree (generic Pro-Activ), the Pro-X cleanser, Cetaphil, or just my bath soap.  </li>
            <li> the first i used it i can see the difference, it made my face a lot smoother and not many acne appears as they usually do.</li>
            <li> facial wrinkles are less noticeable on my forehead and around my mouth and between my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the Dermatouch/g maher/TEI Spa rotating brush, this one is smaller and less abrasive.</li>
            <li> She also uses it on her chest and back in the shower, which is helping the less severe breakouts she would get in those places.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the supplies Olay cleanser but have just purchased the Naturgo Men&#x27;s Clay Face (Black Label)</li>
            <li> My skin looks less congested the next day</li>
            <li> I actually saw black heads lifted after doing it this way.</li>
            <li> Caused me to break out into small red spots and caused white heads.</li>
            <li> So......it&#x27;s guaranteed to last less than 60 days?  </li>
            <li> I still get an occasional small break out, but the zits are much smaller and last for a day or less.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks younger and less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> and only once a day, even less if you start feeling irritated.  </li>
            <li> My skin was actually softer and looked less lizard like.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely feel like I have less blackheads or any irritations on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think using it longer I will notice less of the facial areas</li>
            <li> My washcloth does the same thing for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> I have not suffered breakouts to-date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: I have the odd zit which only glycolic acid seemed to prevent (until I got this product).</li>
            <li> Less breakouts, softer, yet younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it only lasted LESS</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little tube of exfoliator that comes with the brush won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling a little dry with the included facial scrub</li>
            <li> the bristles are very soft and it runs slow to where it does not remove my make up all the way.  </li>
            <li> The cleansing brush operates as expected and (after limited use at this time)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand all the previous reviews talking about how hard the batteries are to put in.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my nose.  </li>
            <li> and I tend to get very dry skin, but</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I stopped getting painful acne but still had some minor breakouts, I turned to the clarisonic with the recent holiday box sale for $119 at sephora which includes a bunch of cleansing goodies free with the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> : small (the brush head could be bigger), slow (does not spin as fast as I expected).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Big improvement across my checks and nose with regard to black heads and little white head.</li>
            <li> Also, I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple in two weeks!</li>
            <li> entire .... cleansing system ... is supposedly shower-proof, which is why the battery compartment is sealed so tightly.</li>
            <li> It is specifically made for the face, so for those wanting something larger they can use on other body areas, this is probably not right for them.</li>
            <li> This made my beautiful clear skin break out worse then my worst breakout from my teen years.  </li>
            <li> I am also prone to black and white heads in my chin area and nose really bad, but those are even getting better.</li>
            <li> Immediate dramatic results with first use.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I never have break outs, but its far less than previously!  </li>
            <li> After 61 years of daily cleansing with with a cloth, I never realized that my face was never really clean until I used this brush.</li>
            <li> my skin got worse and worse, luckily I&#x27;m in my 20s now and hormones have settled and my sensitive skin went away.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the results, although continuing to push the button to turn it back on was very inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> Read the reviews and decided to give it a try because for the low price, I had little to lose.</li>
            <li> but I get occasional pimples on my forehead that aren&#x27;t visible but can be felt (like little bumps everywhere).</li>
            <li> There is relatively little actual cleaning.</li>
            <li> The heads last about a month or a little longer (with twice-a-day usage), before the bristles begin to flatten some.</li>
            <li> I also want to add that I do get little bumps on the back of my arms and that I use this product on my arms as well</li>
            <li> (I thought my drain was haunted), but it was just this little brush suddenly on and spinning by itself.</li>
            <li> A little over a year later, it stopped working</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this little brush enough.</li>
            <li> I recommend keeping the little tube of cleansing solution for travel, and then going to the store to purchase the bigger container of solution for home use.</li>
            <li> I bought this little facial machine for my grandson who is fighting problem skin.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it definitely improved the appearance of my skin a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this little gadget only 5 days ago, and I cant believe the difference in my skin already!</li>
            <li> I could use a little extra exfoliation, I wish there was another brush head with stiffer bristles for areas like elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t like it, give it to your little sister and your only out 20 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had lots of break outs for the past month though,nothing major.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> My only con is I wish the brush was a little wider.</li>
            <li> I put a little st ives facial scrub on it and use it 2 or 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a little while</li>
            <li> Probably, I will do as I&#x27;ve read that several others recommend, and will limit my use of the Pro X to three or four times a week--after I&#x27;ve used it every day for a just a little while.  </li>
            <li> This little thing cleans off all your facial dirt.  </li>
            <li> I still have a little around the brow area, but I have only been using it 1 week.</li>
            <li> I have rendered the cleansing system useless on my first use!</li>
            <li> I probably had about 50 teeny tiny little whiteheads ALL OVER my cheeks the day after using this.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the regular size in the store, but it&#x27;s a little expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little brush was a terrific investment.</li>
            <li> It just takes a little pressure to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little machine has made such a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> i do wish the brush was just a little bigger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, the device other than perhaps the brush-head itself is pretty simple and would probably not have been expensive to manufacture.  </li>
            <li> Again, because of my skin type, I&#x27;d rather  use something different like Proactiv to remove the oil and go a little deeper.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who needs a little extra something</li>
            <li> For people with skin that tends to be on the dry side (like me!), I recommend using the brush only at night, before applying a heavy moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Definitely helping improve my skin and keeping the dead dry skin away!</li>
            <li> Of course acne never completely clears up until one gets past those teen years (at least from my experience), but his breakouts are much fewer and less severe.</li>
            <li> It really is very very hard to open, but if you keep wiggling it back and forth and side to side, it WILL open up.</li>
            <li> and I wish it came with different attachments (a little harder brush for spot-cleaning?)</li>
            <li> After my shower and scrubbing my face with this (with Cetaphil, was afraid to use the gritty stuff), there is still a fine fuzz of dried skin on the surface.</li>
            <li> I try to use it 1-2 times per week because it does dry your skin (as I&#x27;d read on other reviews).</li>
            <li> I was surprised to read reviews from people who thought this was too hard for their skin.</li>
            <li> DEPENDS OF YOUR SKIN, IF YOU NEED HARD HAIR BROSSE OR SOFT ONE;</li>
            <li> Also tell young girls not to press to hard against the face.</li>
            <li> I favor this method far above those because I can no longer feel those bumpy, tough whitehead areas</li>
            <li> The only negative part is that I noticed the soft brush head is already fraying a little and bending at some spots.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this product because it was a less expensive option than some others.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought, I never felt like it did it hard enough or took enough off.</li>
            <li> Hard to imagine the expensive one doing much better.  </li>
            <li> I started off using this to wash my face every night, but found it was a little harsh on my sensitive skin, so I only use it a few times a week with Cetaphil cleanser.</li>
            <li> One minor warning: keep your hair well controlled and away from your face!!!</li>
            <li> In the long run it&#x27;s definitely cheaper than the other brands!!!</li>
            <li> Among other things, you need only the smallest amount of the exfoliating cream on the bristles of the brush; a little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> The included Olay cleanser isn&#x27;t bad, but I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is a bad product, it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products and became frustrated; however, nothing has worked better than this product.</li>
            <li> it helps, I am 27 years old with combo skin and have been using this brush for at least 3 months now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have delicate or sensitive skin at all.  </li>
            <li> However, it takes forever to actually open it to install the batteries, and that&#x27;s the only complaint I have about</li>
            <li> I will say the only complaint I have is with the facial wash that comes with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- less dry patches (provided that you also moisturize)&lt;br /&gt;- less white heads &amp; acnes</li>
            <li> fact that you can take it in the shower leads me to my only negative, which is the difficulty in getting the battery compartment open.  </li>
            <li> People with sensitive skin you need to at least try this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using an old electric toothbrush as recommended by a doctor and this is at least faster and gentler-</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of these face brushes but after reading tons of back up that they really work</li>
            <li> Not much exfoliating from what I can see.</li>
            <li> Never really paid attention to the lotion/soap/whatever as the item I wanted was the brush.</li>
            <li> ( I have rough spots from acne).</li>
            <li> TThe Clarisonic vibrates and I feel like I get to have a 1-minute facial EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever spent my allowance on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a rough feel to it.</li>
            <li> word of warning...be careful using this thing.</li>
            <li> Once things start getting lathered up and juicy wet on your face</li>
            <li> try and keep your eyes closed if your getting close to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is minimal splashing.  </li>
            <li> My pores are smaller after a few uses and my skin looks a hell of a lot smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> Using the minimally abrasive Olay cleanser sample with the rotating brush on this product felt like I was trying to scrub my face with a soggy noodle.  </li>
            <li> My wife got a brand name one as a gift (not mentioning names here), but the cost is over $130, and I feel absolutely no difference in the two.  </li>
            <li> I may think about purchasing that when it is empty.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X is everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I feel that after a few weeks I can definitely see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> well spent my skin</li>
            <li> I bought the Olay Pro X system a few months back.</li>
            <li> I once used a similar system that had a sponge brush, which I didn&#x27;t like because it was messy and seemed to use up a lot of cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected...</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than expected, was looking durable.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money verses the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> While waiting for my Pro-X to arrive, I read alot of comments regarding the brush head getting bent, flattened, or otherwise crushed during travel.  </li>
            <li> and it stopped working after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> absolutely NOT SO.  </li>
            <li> Did not really notice a difference</li>
            <li> I would say a pad can last a few weeks if used once maybe twice a day.</li>
            <li> The brush is firm enough for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever spent on a skin care product.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t imagine using anything rougher or harder.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with acne, rough skin, and redness for 15 years.</li>
            <li> I still have a few pimples here and there, but I&#x27;m not breaking out daily like I used to.    </li>
            <li> Not only does it get rid of the dead skin cells, it stimulates your face which helps with regeneration.  </li>
            <li> I was careful with it, it never stayed in the shower</li>
            <li> They offered me a refund and said this was not normal, however after reading other reviews I am beginning to think it is.  </li>
            <li> Used this product for 2 -3 weeks and saw absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> am 27, have occasional breakouts, and have semi-oily skin with a few pesky blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> I was expected a stiffer brush and faster rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got in the shower, I wet my face, and wet the brush, then I squeezed some of the Olay exfoliating cleaner in stripes across the brush head.</li>
            <li> Just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> (they used to be rough), so my makeup application is easier and smoother.  </li>
            <li> ever since I saw my mom&#x27;s pink bottle on her dressing table.</li>
            <li> Delivered timely and product was as expected and described</li>
            <li> no thanks.  </li>
            <li> and this was too rough for it.  </li>
            <li> I am in my forties and I have been using those rough \\&quot;buff\\&quot;ing and \\&quot;puff\\&quot;y type sponges since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too big or heavy</li>
            <li> I no longer have the flaky skin and have minimal breakouts.</li>
            <li> like a mini facial everyday.</li>
            <li> I no longer have the flaky skin and have minimal breakouts.</li>
            <li> no problems getting it wet</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no need to pay for the Clarsonic.</li>
            <li> I was careful and still managed to get my chin-length hair tangled one time.</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of weeks, and have noticed absolutely no change in the tone or texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I also had trouble with getting the battery compartment open.  </li>
            <li> I recently got this and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> No real frills but no real downfalls either.</li>
            <li> Because of this reaction, I&#x27;m only using the cleansing system every few days.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a careful mix between the brush and the soap that comes with it, but this product truly changed my complexion</li>
            <li> Pores almost empty.</li>
            <li> So after spending all that money, in a few years, you need to replace the entire thing.</li>
            <li> Things I did not like: the missing extra cleaning brush, the brush that does come with it hardens after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> It finally gave out a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now, I took a break from it for a week and noticed that my skin was different.  </li>
            <li> That extra bit of dead skin that I could always feel on my face even after I have cleaned it is gone.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, I kept this in the shower because I assumed it was waterproof,</li>
            <li> I was careful not to get water inside the unit and replaced the batteries (twice).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go through a whole dermatologist regimen, since I feel it to be unnecessary; so I got this cleansing system.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too rough on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few different ones</li>
            <li> It works just the way I expected it too.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT ITS GOING TO BE TO ROUGH FOR MY SKIN....</li>
            <li> The facial cleanser it came with is rather harsh with the brush</li>
            <li> i got this few days back.</li>
            <li> I have even dropped it a few time and it remains the same.</li>
            <li> I started getting lots of whiteheads and had a few red acne bumps, but I kept using it and the zits went away</li>
            <li> Brush head does not secure on properly.</li>
            <li> Overall I think I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t recommend the exfoliating cream that comes with this to the younger ones either as I think it would be to harsh also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the ridiculously deep ones, and it removing dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you are going to do any face peeling treatments.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Not really convinced.</li>
            <li> clogged pours and rough skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this to exfoliate for the last few months.  </li>
            <li> Not a real scrubbing feel like I expected but still</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this everyday for he last week.</li>
            <li> Not much power in this machine, but</li>
            <li> I have not really used the cleanser it came with</li>
            <li> I use it also at the hairline (but be careful, hair can get tangled up in it) and jaw/neck area.</li>
            <li> I use it in the am with my neutrogena pink grapefruit face wash and at night with the pro-x cleanser.</li>
            <li> and it seemed a bit rough.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can use it in the shower and not have to worry about it getting wet.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not really a fan of the cleanser that came with it, hence the 4 out of 5</li>
            <li> This item is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> like I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Shamefully, I must admit that while I&#x27;m bordering on fanatical about the skin on my face, I don&#x27;t pay much attention to cleaning behind my ears.</li>
            <li> I guess it had to be dead for awhile, charge all the way back up, then it would work again.</li>
            <li> Shamefully, I must admit that while I&#x27;m bordering on fanatical about the skin on my face, I don&#x27;t pay much attention to cleaning behind my ears.</li>
            <li> I guess it had to be dead for awhile, charge all the way back up, then it would work again.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really cleans my face without irritating it or being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month and it works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I had to purchase a replacement only because I was changing the battery after a few years use, while I was taking a shower, which I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> In addition to sloughing off dead skin cells and daily buildup, it seems to also stimulate circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and only my time was wasted.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the particulars or what she considered as alternates, but this has apparently worked out for her.</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate difference in my skin after only a few uses-much softer.</li>
            <li> and this was too rough for it.</li>
            <li> except I always wished I could get rid of the oil buildup that made my nose area look rough from clogged pores, and of course the dreaded monthly menstrual zit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro-X exfoliates all of that away</li>
            <li> Have used it only a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 and was starting to have a really uneven texture to my skin.  </li>
            <li> The Clarisonic scrubs a lot harder but is like 5x the price.  </li>
            <li> hey I only wasted around $20 for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product just to try how I would like cleaning my face with an oscillating brush, didn&#x27;t want to pay $200, and then possibly finding it too harsh.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the feel of the cleanser, not very lathery, so</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using Olay&#x27;s I had rough skin that was breaking out.  </li>
            <li> No matter how carefully I cleanse my face of makeup, my pores are susceptible to blockage.</li>
            <li> He was using my clarisonic, but he was too rough on it.  </li>
            <li> I get soft glowing skin that is very similar to what happens post expensive facial but without the cash drain.  </li>
            <li> The power is minimal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been only a few weeks</li>
            <li> No problems getting it soaking wet.  </li>
            <li> You can get it wet</li>
            <li> This is not even remotely close to the clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say about it besides that</li>
            <li> I use this product three times a week and find the results just as I expected them to be.  </li>
            <li> but I have not really had to deal with this before (I&#x27;m 39)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know what to do with it now because it feels like the ultimate waste of money to throw it away after one use.</li>
            <li> I used it for two days and got a lot of zits, so be careful.</li>
            <li> The brush however was as expected.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit in the rough side however.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, and my skin already feels softer, smoother and cleaner.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to overdo.</li>
            <li> Be Careful your hair doesn&#x27;t get caught.</li>
            <li> , I get it totally wet</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how my skin would feel using this type of exfoliator before I spent a lot of money on one.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit rough on skin though.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected date, every thing intact &amp; working.</li>
            <li> total waste of money.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it daily, but I use it a few times a week or on days where I feel like my skin needs a heavier cleaning.</li>
            <li> I recommend this a lot to my friends, perhaps I would be careful if I had acne-prone skin, or check with my dermathologyst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband made fun of me because I was so obsessed with it, so I made him try it</li>
            <li> I brought this a year ago and finally used it a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I have since purchased the Clarisonic pro, and there is absolutely no comparison between the two.  </li>
            <li> This item is nothing or does nothing remotely close to what they advertise it to do.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks of using it, I think that my skin looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I find the circular rotating motion is just a bit too rough on my skin, even on the slowest setting.  </li>
            <li> Its not really a cleanser.</li>
            <li> That should be the easier thing to do but it is the harder for these maker.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying everyone will experience what I have, but be careful if your skin is anything like mine.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck with tomato face for the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother trying to do this with wet hands, you have to pinch and pull away from the handle to remove the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would only be out a few bucks,  </li>
            <li> Yes, the delivery and packaging was as expected.</li>
            <li> This caused a lot of &#x27;drag&#x27; on my skin.</li>
            <li> I had my husband feel my face after using it for a few days and his reaction was sheer amazement.  </li>
            <li> I was worried this might be too harsh but nothing could be further from the truth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> B002XURD32 Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System, Pink]]</li>
            <li> Skin is not very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item works so well that I saw a different in my skin within a few days.  </li>
            <li> EVERYTHING GOES WELL,ONE PITY THING IS CAN NOT CHARGE</li>
            <li> The battery issues are not important to me, only how the device works</li>
            <li> This was expected since it is not a Sonic brush ...</li>
            <li> We have only had it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it is a bit too rough for my skin.</li>
            <li> Using this actually sloughs off the dead skin that sits on the surface.</li>
            <li> The speed of the brush seems too slow and maybe the bristles are too soft.  </li>
            <li> It comes with the base unit, 1 regular brush head attachment (They recommend you change the brush head every three months), x2 AA batteries and a 20ml sample of their exfoliating renewal cleanser, which I am yet to try (I love my skincare regimen as it stands and I don&#x27;t want to deviate from what works for me!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would recommend the slow setting for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The rotating brush does not do much as far as exfoliation &amp; runs on the slow side.</li>
            <li> later decided that I kind of hated it.  </li>
            <li> battery only lasted 6 months dead - non-replaceable it and your spent money on</li>
            <li> i think that is not very useful, but it&#x27;s ok , not too bad, it will hurt your skin, be careful when you use it</li>
            <li> I use this every evening in the shower and my skin has been clearer, pores smaller, less blackheads!</li>
            <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve been suffering from moderate acne due to hard water in my house.</li>
            <li> I would regularly have breakouts but after putting it in my daily regimen--I noticed that my skin felt a lot cleaner and had no more breakouts!</li>
            <li> I have paired this scrubber with my regular face wash (the scrub soap it comes with is a little rough to be using in conjunction with the scrubber for me) and a night cream and my flaky issues are solved!</li>
            <li> I have no more pimples, which I had new ones everyday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blackheads on my nose are noticeably less dark in only one week.</li>
            <li> I mean honestly - it&#x27;s a soft, spinning brush.</li>
            <li> I mean honestly - it&#x27;s a soft, spinning brush.</li>
            <li> I am going to stick to using plain white organic paper towels, in a circular motion on my face.</li>
            <li> is plain and simple...</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is I wish it was a little bigger.  </li>
            <li> It scrubs just enough to get dead skin off but not enough that your face feels raw or over-scrubbed.</li>
            <li> THIS MACHINE IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH POWER  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s not strong enough to scrub shoulders.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does need the battery changed here and there; which is not easy -- the only design flaw of this hand cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel as dried out as several other products.  </li>
            <li> It did not clear my black heads or anything either.</li>
            <li> I find that the brush head is irritating to clean out, not saying that it&#x27;s hard, but I just wish it was easier to wash the scrub</li>
            <li> and they either are big red bumps that don&#x27;t have heads to pop (such as a lot of crap coming up from way underneath the skin) or a lot of little ones that can be quickly taken care of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but no better or worse than the regular old own-two-hands method, which can cover a much larger area making the face-washing process a lot quicker.</li>
            <li> guess I abused this in the sense that I did keep it in my shower,  and I did not wipe it down and keep it dry, after 4 month&#x27;s it died and after opening it up the batteries were corroded and</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and notice that it is nicer that I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small compared to my old one</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone, especially if you have acne prone skin but the usual facial scrub soaps are too harsh for your skin.</li>
            <li> I got 2 little knots near my ears from where the brush must have picked up a few strands!</li>
            <li> I initially had a few isolated breakouts because the brush brought impurities to the surface (similar to but less harsh than using a prescribed dermatological cream).  </li>
            <li> She had been using Origins for a month before buying this, with no positive results.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but not very useful or&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li> It is not very powerful, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> Its not very powerful.</li>
            <li> My hands are raw and red.  </li>
            <li> you remove the dead skin cells daily, you will break out, and you will thin out your skin, and then you will go and buy new products to reverse the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item is small enough for the hand but lacks a stiff enough brush for what I want to use it for .It</li>
            <li> Gets my face crazy clean.</li>
            <li> this brush, it seems easy to tear my face up, and with the Clarisonic it seems nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> I have congested, dry skin prone to black heads and spots and</li>
            <li> So I took off one star, only because my skin looked crazy for the first week of use.</li>
            <li> Having dry flaky skin is difficult enough, but add sensitive in the mix</li>
            <li> the battery compartment cover off, and I finally managed to shove a pair of scissors in the little space, which I do not recomend!</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing less break-outs (actually no new break-outs since using this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After some research, ultimately i decided that i would prefer to pay a little less to test something out &amp; call it a loss if it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I do feel like my face is a little smoother, and I may have less acne over all, but I stil get the occasional pimple</li>
            <li> Plus a little bit of product goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little cleanser goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money on expensive cleansers and moisturizers, and they never gave the results that this system gave after using it only a few days.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable with this price compared to other expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I just came to the realization that all my life my face has been dirty (literally) I struggled with acne all my life; I&#x27;ve used countless products both over-the-counter and prescription and still had little success with either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harsh on my sensitive skin, not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I only use it a few times a week as I find the bristles a little rough for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have complex skin which can be both dry and oily at the same time.</li>
            <li> It works well to exfoliate, but the head pops off a bit too easily, which can be annoying in the middle of cleaning your face.  </li>
            <li> If you get white heads, black heads, or have trouble with dirty/clogged pores</li>
            <li> When I explained to my eye doctor what happened, he emphatically told me never to use such a product again and throw it away!&lt;br /&gt;So a half day is wasted in a lot of pain, I&#x27;m out $180.00 for doctor and prescription and vow to never use this thing again.</li>
            <li> Its brush was very soft, and it didn&#x27;t seem like it would be in the least bit harsh.  </li>
            <li> bristles of the brush are very soft and not at all harsh, at least not for my skin.</li>
            <li> so I could use it on other areas of the body.  </li>
            <li> I  just  wish  it came with other attachments  </li>
            <li> The first week I used this my face got worse!</li>
            <li> OTHER ONES DOESN&#x27;T WORK</li>
            <li> I used it every other day or so.</li>
            <li> is how much other products improve when I use them as treatments, moisturizers, ect.</li>
            <li> the other reviewers said - the battery compartment and</li>
            <li> The other 2 days I use the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Seeing the Pro X Cleansing Brush in an add in one of my magazines, I came on-line to see if it was anything like it&#x27;s other counterparts.</li>
            <li> the other in her 30&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> Not sure if I was putting a lot of pressure or not enough.</li>
            <li> Thank you to all the other reviews that help me make my purchase</li>
            <li> On the other side of the coin, I have no idea if this does anything.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used other battery-operated exfoliation tools</li>
            <li> $20ish buck is a steal compared to the $100plus other ones on the market.</li>
            <li> so I can try to sell this hyped up product to some other unsuspecting consumer and recoup some of my money.    </li>
            <li> Not sure whether it is the brush or cleanser that I recently switched to.</li>
            <li> i am using olay cleanser and want to try it with some other cleansers</li>
            <li> (which is every other day because I don&#x27;t want to over-exfoliate)</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty silly.</li>
            <li> I have not used other cleansing systems before</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine buying that other product that everyone is talking about.</li>
            <li> but maybe every other day...  </li>
            <li> This is with no change in my other acne products at all.</li>
            <li> You can also use this brush with other cleansers of your choice.</li>
            <li> well, I have some acne issues due to hormones and this is helping alot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any other time of spinner cleaner</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re extremely busy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model is quite a bit cheaper than other brands and amazon</li>
            <li> I think this was due to the irritation the brush causes.  </li>
            <li> It has gotten my face cleaner than facial washes and scrubs that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I did get a recommendation from an aesthetician to avoid using a cleansing brush with an exfoliating cleanser since it might harm the device, so I just use it with one of the other Olay foaming cleansers.</li>
            <li> Other stores were selling it for over $30.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would use it with an exfoliator other than the recommended Olay product as theirs</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much other than my wife loves this thing.  </li>
            <li> Trusted the other glowing reviews</li>
            <li> and my husband and I both use it about every other night.  </li>
            <li> I washed one side of my face with the Olay PRO X and the other side with just my hands.  </li>
            <li> It brightens my face in a way other face washes don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I never wear any makeup other than mascara.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day in the shower with the Body Shop tea tree face wash.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any other product offer that size of brush.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the cleanser that came with it, but instead used my usual creamy Olay foaming facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it religiously for the past years and have had a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> i am extremely P&#x27;d off.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, I&#x27;m just not willing to pay for the Mia, so this will do for now.</li>
            <li> Now I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> (side note, the cleanser claims to be \\&quot;exfoliating\\&quot; but it has no feeling of crystals or scrubbing properties like other exfoliators I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> It removes all traces of makeup and the brush head is small enough to get under my eyes.</li>
            <li> any* skincare products other than using the Olay device.</li>
            <li> I use this brush every other day and can tell a hug difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try the other one.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m acne prone and usually only see small pimples before my cycle.  </li>
            <li> This brush is small enough for the medicine cabinet, and it takes about 1 minute to use!  </li>
            <li> I was honestly skeptical about this product at first, and I hesitated to spend the $30.</li>
            <li> ; I use it about every other day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use any other cleanser, but I was thinking about trying the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> It is not the other brand that costs a $100, but it does what it was intended to do.</li>
            <li> &quot; on it...........use a ruberized bottle opener to improve your grip and rock that small end piece back and forth (like taking a cork out of a wine bottle)</li>
            <li> have some discoloration due to my extreme picking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this product for a while and other products like it at 5 times the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the gen 1 proactive brush for the past couple of years, and I decided to try this since its only $20.</li>
            <li> My youngest child wanted this for Christmas due to the fact</li>
            <li> Came with an extremely small amount of cleanser and only one brush.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 years and now and having blemishes and other skin issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other people&#x27;s reviews saying the same thing, so not sure...</li>
            <li> I started getting rashes all over my face due to the irritations it was causing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s due to products like this along with my Olay moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li> It has been relegated for the husband&#x27;s use, along with hordes of other rejected beauty products that I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers have said this works just as well as the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> I have no qualms with this product other than it stopped working a month after I bought it.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser I applied didn&#x27;t go well on my skin but other than that the electronic scrubber does its job</li>
            <li> I searched around and looked at several brands before I received this one for Christmas this past year.</li>
            <li> I also use it other places besides my face to exfoliate too.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, but for the price, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming this is the \\&quot;purging\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve read about on other reviews from the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> The trial cleanser on the other hand ...</li>
            <li> I use other cleansers with this.  </li>
            <li> Bought this after reading reviews from other customers.</li>
            <li> I can spare the money for Clarisonic for other stuff on my list.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years at the other brands that cost $200+.</li>
            <li> overall, i am not sure if helped with my skin or not....</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just one use, I could see improvement in my complexion, especially across my forehead, where my face is usually quite oily.</li>
            <li> I cannot compare it to other competitors, but this works just as it should for me.</li>
            <li> The brush spins, it doesn&#x27;t vibrate like other brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars, but for the first week of use, it seemed like it was making my skin worse!</li>
            <li> I recommend using it every other day</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it cleans as well as the other brushes that uses sonic tech.  </li>
            <li> I am peeling due to some prescribed acne medication.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product before by other</li>
            <li> The tube of cleanser it came with lasted me a while, but after I emptied that I&#x27;ve been using other exfoliating cleanser brands.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its the cleanser that was included or the actual tool that makes my face feel &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; after use.  </li>
            <li> So I just opted for some other cleanser.</li>
            <li> Works in the shower and anywhere else you can wet your face.&lt;br /&gt;!Olay!</li>
            <li> Not soft not to harsh.</li>
            <li> Only thing annoying about it is that is you put the cream directly on the brush (or have too much on your face)</li>
            <li> - I saw that they have a microdermabrasion set too to go with this, and other skin creams and serums.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried using it on my back since it&#x27;s really small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my other brush for 2 years.</li>
            <li> After using the first one for a couple months, the on/off button does not respond as well and can be difficult to turn off.</li>
            <li> I use this with other face wash products that I use also.  </li>
            <li> I use this in the shower every other day on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Pro-X works extremely well with 1/6 of what you pay Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I also think you could use it with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week, using the pads on the other days.  </li>
            <li> SO I HAVE NO NEED FOR THE OTHER ONE.  </li>
            <li> Maybe use it every other day?</li>
            <li> Its a salon facial everyday!</li>
            <li> (I usually just wash it off all at the same time)...</li>
            <li> it was due to this device</li>
            <li> Absolutely NOT!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re exfoliating cream works well, but any other cleanser works too.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the rest of the face is as good/easy in all other parts but the circular rotation of the ProX</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading other reviews that it was comparable to the Clarsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is okay to use on your face. :(  </li>
            <li> No overdrying, but I use it like every other day or 3 days since I have sensitive/oily skin.</li>
            <li> I started at every other day for the 1st week and now do it every 2 days.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day as an exfoliator and then as a massager.</li>
            <li> But, if this gets you to wash your face every night, then use it, it doesn&#x27;t seem like its too harsh to cause any long term damage to your skin.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BROUGHT OTHER PRODUCTS LIKE THIS ONE</li>
            <li> address some other users concerns with no instructions</li>
            <li> I follow with a basic face moisturizer (usually whatever I have</li>
            <li> I like the concept, but I think I&#x27;ll save up for another product other than this one.</li>
            <li> use the oil of olay cleanser one day which is a cream and the other day</li>
            <li> It has been preventing my chronic breakouts AND this can be used in the shower because the batteries don&#x27;t become wet!</li>
            <li> I used this every other day but didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> When I discontinued use, my skin went back to its usual state of a blemish or two now</li>
            <li> Also, you can use other exfoliating products instead of the Olay brand to save some money.</li>
            <li> Use it every other day while in the shower.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is all related to this scrubber,</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t justify the hefty price tag on some of the other versions of this product.</li>
            <li> know that the Clarisonic is the Holy Grail of all scubby brush systems, and I may consider purchasing it after using this, but this works extremely well for my face and decolletage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only change I have made in my usual skin routine</li>
            <li> should other customers know when considering this product?</li>
            <li> Therefore, having NOT tried Clarisonic or other brands, can&#x27;t compare to them.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, my grandmother loves it</li>
            <li> I like this cleaning brush the reason why I gave it four stars is because this product doesn&#x27;t make other brush heads like the Revlon cleansing system does.</li>
            <li> Last night, it flung a small amount of the PRO X exfoliating cleanser into my eye.</li>
            <li> My eye teared extremely, I tried flushing and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Also works well with cleansers other than the Olay that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I have used other cleansers with it, but works just as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably on par with a wash cloth, making it extremely overpriced for the results.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> before spending the $259.00 for one of the other cleansing systems on the market</li>
            <li> and I noticed a change in the small lines the next morning!</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get your sideburns caught in the rotation stem because it will pull your hair out!.  </li>
            <li> DUE TO STRESS ETC</li>
            <li> In the meantime I have been trying to add things to my beauty routine that would add a lot of bang for not a lot of buck, and this brush kept coming up on sites like makeupally and other beauty blogs.  </li>
            <li> I use it maybe every other day to help exfoliate but thats about it.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel so refreshed and its not being to rough!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to buy this product, I have used it a few times now</li>
            <li> (see other reviews)  </li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin and have noticed a big difference just in the past 5 days.</li>
            <li> Compare to other P &amp; G were the cheapest.</li>
            <li> Even comes with a small sample of the Pro X product even though I bought a different cleaner to use with it.  </li>
            <li> Like others, I was unwilling to pay $200+ for other versions of a face cleanser.</li>
            <li> Maybe the company has been listening to the complaints on the other reviews because it now says on the side of the box when they recommend changing the brush head and there were also instructions on accessing the batteries.</li>
            <li> Maybe every other day or one in the morning and one at night.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for a gift then discovered it was for aging skin and not appropriate for a teen.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the enclosed sample of the facial scrub (icky!) and substituted my regular, cheaper brand of scrub.</li>
            <li> I usually use it with extra virgin coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Read about this happening to other people- namely with their Clarisonics-</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am using other Olay products (cleansers and moisturizers) with this product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit of a commitment for something you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;ll use regularly.</li>
            <li> and Olay&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day.  </li>
            <li> I was at first skeptical about the benefits of this rather inexpensive tool.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t expect a miracle when you buy it, and don&#x27;t expect it to magically erase 20 years off your face overnight, then you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the results you get.</li>
            <li> I use it every day to every other day  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day and find my skin brighter than before.</li>
            <li> Not really hot about the cleanser that comes with it</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day.</li>
            <li> The brush head itself could be made softer as other reviewers have noted.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews, I do not use this in the shower</li>
            <li> I use the brush with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> You do not push the brushes into your skin; rather, you just let them barely touch the skin and slowly move the brush around.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty casual when it comes to skin care.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it might dry out my skin a little, even though the system itself exfoliates.</li>
            <li> You wash the little brush after and let it sit to dry.</li>
            <li> In combination with the enclosed cleanser (which I also recommend), this little machine took care of the dry patches.  </li>
            <li> I do apply a moisturizer because it does makes the skin dry a little bit.</li>
            <li> It did make my skin a little dry, but I solved that with Bio Oil</li>
            <li> Make my skin a little bit dry.</li>
            <li> Overall a very worth wild product if you do not like creams you leave on then wash or feel that hand scrubbing is inefficient (did the comparison could literally see dirt and grim on the) brush)</li>
            <li> If you dont, the bristles eventually become harder and a little too rough for washing your face.</li>
            <li> This might sound a little crazy</li>
            <li> I notice that while using it, it kind of splashes the face wash all over my face and the mirror, which can be a little annoying.</li>
            <li> A merry go round of skin products later still no significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> I might use a cleansing cream with no abrasives in it, as it might be a little too harsh for my skin to use an abrasive, but I do like the overall results!</li>
            <li> Be very careful when using this.</li>
            <li> except the brush bristles should be removed from very center.</li>
            <li> I have the Ulta rotating brush, but it&#x27;s very rough on my skin</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I was skeptical that it would get my face that much cleaner than a rough wash cloth or cleansing pad</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use (every other day), I have decreased blackheads and improved my skin&#x27;s overall appearance and feel.  </li>
            <li> Can say this small vacuum machine for my face !!</li>
            <li> The installation of the batteries is REALLY tough, it took me nearly 20 minutes to figure it out!</li>
            <li> My pores have shrunken a considerable amount to where you can hardly even see them!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery door design is extremely poor, very hard to remove door or even know how to do such the first time.  </li>
            <li> I tried for at least 10 minutes on my own and eventually had to ask someone else to help because I was too frustrated.</li>
            <li> So... I ordered this product at the beginning of the year and it was expected to come about a week and a half ago...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh for my Norman to dry skin.</li>
            <li> it takes off any makeup left behind by your regular cleanser.</li>
            <li> the brush only turns round and round and does not vibrate via sonic.  </li>
            <li> I have rather dry skin and like to exfoliate a few times a week</li>
            <li> Was skeptical to try this product but after having a professional facial with the brush being used I was sold.  </li>
            <li> was shocked to find that after a week of using it twice a day that my skin was softer and more firm then it has ever been.  </li>
            <li> Seems like it works well for everyday use, and it doesnt leave red marks or seem like its too harsh for your skin.  </li>
            <li> but I was hoping that the Olay Pro-X would help with blackheads and removing dead dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Seems really odd that they wouldn&#x27;t make a device that is supposed to get wet, waterproof.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and i usually dry  out on the sides of my face and cheeks, but this product prevents that as it buffs away all the dead skin.</li>
            <li> my face would get dry and after a few hours it&#x27;d get oily again...</li>
            <li> The batteries are a little difficult to insert because the cavity is a little difficult to open, but I&#x27;m sure that is to keep the battery area dry.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I should use it every day or not as I also use Retin-A, but using it has definitely cut down on my acne.  </li>
            <li> , it already doesn&#x27;t start when I push a button, I have to try a few times and hold the button down for a long time, or otherwise it just stops.</li>
            <li> A waste of my limited funds, even with the $3 coupon online....</li>
            <li> The box has limited waste, and you can get everything out in a shake (literally).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the positive changes that others have from using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far too weak</li>
            <li> is just far too weak..</li>
            <li> Weak and too soft for my taste.</li>
            <li> I am plagued with small regular breakouts and clogged pores even though I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s, and now I&#x27;m seeing a vast improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work so well, as I have tried other cleansers with no success, but this thing is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is too soft and the power is too weak.  </li>
            <li> I use it, on average, every other day, although I hope to use it every day at some point.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily combination, and I live in a city with extreme weather ( above 100F on summer and cold and icy at winter),</li>
            <li> I have been using the Clarisonic for a few years now with great results but, after it took really nasty spill down the stairs while I was packing for a business trip</li>
            <li> Pores are smaller and I have no more black heads.</li>
            <li> I read in some other reviews that it was hard to open.</li>
            <li> Hold the brush part down with one hand and pull with the other hand.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know you need to buy replacement brushes for it which is a let down but other than that</li>
            <li> I have never felt like my skin was getting raw unless I used it for too long or pressed too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face broke out in a rash, my cheeks are red, irritated and have tons of blisters (small little ones that are obviously due to irritation).</li>
            <li> I use this bad boy in the shower to exfoliate in the mornings, and it does just fine.  </li>
            <li> The battery is difficult to change almost impossible to open, multi speeds is a nice feature</li>
            <li> The battery compartment was near impossible to open, thank goodness for my husband or I never would have gotten it open.</li>
            <li> If i were to buy a less expensive one again and couldn&#x27;t afford the Clarisonic I would get one a little more expensive than this or try a different brand.</li>
            <li> so why not, right?</li>
            <li> It is probably too harsh for anyone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It accomplishes what is expected I just wish the motor was just a little bit stronger</li>
            <li> This little brush is what i expected.</li>
            <li> It does have a &amp;#34;plasticky&amp;#34; feel to it and can get a little slippery when wet, but I have yet to drop it.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a little rough</li>
            <li> It was little too rough for my skin.</li>
            <li> Anyone serious about skincare, whether you&#x27;re 15 or 65, should really consider at least trying this Olay brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too soft or too tough.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it is a bit on the slow side, even with the two different speeds, compared to other brushes.</li>
            <li> I said to myself, this looks like a toy, the brush looks very delicate and it feels too soft to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I have tough Italian skin that&#x27;s oily in some places and dry in other places.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe its due to the demand of the holiday season, but I paid less than $22 in November 2014.  </li>
            <li> But I will say you can not use with with other face washes, I tried to use a black head scrubber.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first when I bought it.   </li>
            <li> battery compartment is EXTREMELY hard to open.</li>
            <li> The pieces will eventually come apart if you pull hard enough!</li>
            <li> in those hard red cysts.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment is hard to open..</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t scrub hard enough for my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> thing I do like is that you can use the Pro-X in the shower; however, the payoff is that the battery compartment is so incredibly hard to open.  </li>
            <li> No more small red patches where the dry skin is, and even though the cream has oils in it, my break outs are less.  </li>
            <li> and although my face (more so my cheek area) can be a little sensitive at times, this brush irritated my cheeks and forehead horribly!</li>
            <li> The only negative I have seen is the battery case is rather hard to open.</li>
            <li> It was either to harsh, leaving my skin tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> this is a bad thing blackheads didn&#x27;t remove by Olay Pro-X- advanced cleansing system &amp;</li>
            <li> First one had a switch go bad, second time rust got into the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> I tried to keep the brush away from my hairline, but that results in a 1 inch perimeter around my face that is impossible to clean.</li>
            <li> A lot of people might not like the whole battery thing, and I was a bit iffy about it too, but it&#x27;s really not too bad if it means no docking, that&#x27;s just extra clutter</li>
            <li> only complaint with this kit is - like</li>
            <li> in all the device is garbage, the user experience is horrendous, and it is not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I usually have a lot of dead skin lurking on my face after I get out of the shower, but I started using this in the shower almost every day (big points for being waterproof!).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it at least once daily.  </li>
            <li> Average performance.</li>
            <li> totally not worth the money or time.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cover for the batteries is a bear to get on and off, but for something that is used in the shower, I&#x27;d rather have it that way than</li>
            <li> The cleanser included was average.  </li>
            <li> I use this product along with the pro-x daily moisturizer, the wrinkle smoothing cream, and the eye-restoration complex.</li>
            <li> (at least it was for me) to open the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> even the dark spots are fading.  </li>
            <li> This cleansing cream and brush are not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Obviously you would just have to use common sense.</li>
            <li> Purchased a gift and the recipient likes the system so giving at least 4 stars since results are not known in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product merely as a cleaning tool for my face because I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that the rotation is strictly one direction meaning you&#x27;re constantly fighting the brush to remain on your face.  </li>
            <li> Not powerful at all.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of dark spots from years of smoking.  </li>
            <li> very content with the product I have not heard anything wrong about it</li>
            <li> I would say you could use it every day without it really having any ill effects that exfoliating every day wouldn&#x27;t have given you</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I wish it could stand up by itself on the counter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is worth the $$ if it is leaving my face still dirty.</li>
            <li> only negative I see is that because it is battery powered and it gets a lot of use, after a month I&#x27;ve already had to change the batteries twice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, in the meantime I wanted to go a cheaper route and hopefully at least get some of the same benefits as the NutraSonic.</li>
            <li> Only negative, the face cleanser that comes with</li>
            <li> Also, thankfully the replacement heads are so reasonable that I won&#x27;t continually feel guilty about the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I looked at the Clarisonic and after deciding it was too expensive to just see if it might fix my problem, I found this reasonably priced alternative.  </li>
            <li> The facial cleanser it comes with at least seems to work well. 2</li>
            <li> I use it at least once daily with the Olay cleanser that came with it</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Cons: chews up batteries, lack of different type brush heads, icky cleanser comes with it</li>
            <li> yeahhhh not really useful.</li>
            <li> Not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> after considering buying the Clarisonic cleaning brush i read it&#x27;s not really worth the cost.</li>
            <li> this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you feel it&#x27;s not worth the price</li>
            <li> not sure what the long term effects will be on acne prevention</li>
            <li> Definitely not as powerful as some brands but does the job</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I made it so long wthout one of these.</li>
            <li> All these changes have made my skin look and feel at least 15 years younger!  </li>
            <li> The few small red areas and breakouts that I had attributed to hormonal changes disappeared and have never returned.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you have to have it on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; to feel like you are getting a result.</li>
            <li> does all that the expensive ones do-- but very affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clumsy and have a small bathroom, and I&#x27;ve dropped it several times, left it in the shower a few times, etc.</li>
            <li> Ok for the few people who have had horrible reactions to this brush, you must have some seriously sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Now  - even dark brown age spots have diminished.</li>
            <li> The cleansing System takes off all the dead skin cells and makes your skin act like an empty canvas.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try this because I knew my rough, dead skin played a part in the formation of acne.</li>
            <li> I have an oily T-Zone and when my face starts getting oily they start to slowly come back.</li>
            <li> Unit has two speeds, slow &amp; medium, but spins well enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> hate that getting more of the Pro-X exfoliate cream is so pricey.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> skin looks much worse now, so I am going back to using facial cleanser, exfoliator a few days a week, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Poor rotation, doesn&#x27;t stand up like clarisonic, gave to my 9 year old</li>
            <li> After a month of using I have minimal breakouts and my skin looks glowing despite the harsh Minnesota winter that lasts for 5+ months.</li>
            <li> In fact, if anything I noticed that it overly dried out my skin even with minimal use.</li>
            <li> like it because it does not irritate my face and you can press harder and stay longer in one spot without worries of being to harsh on your face.  </li>
            <li> My only small complaint is that it is not completely waterproof</li>
            <li> I would get dark discoloration (eczema) down the sides of my mouth, giving the appearence of a beard.  </li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that it&#x27;s not rechargeable, but I hope olay will release a new rechargeable version soon.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in my skin right away, I have a really bad habit of not completely removing all of my eye makeup before falling asleep</li>
            <li> The pro-x is definitely not as nice as the clarisonic, but it does, basically, the same job for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling with the Knock offs on the market they may come down in price.</li>
            <li> I tried bogging it down some</li>
            <li> So after my fave calmed down and reading the reviews on the Olay brush</li>
            <li> Thumbs down, way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I have to hold the button down to keep it turned down.</li>
            <li> I had some annoying spots on my nose and lucky enough to (borrow) the product and cream.</li>
            <li> (just pull down the bottom piece) and it takes two AAs.</li>
            <li> I have to hold it down to get it to run.</li>
            <li> but i came down between the Olay PROx &amp; Clairsonics (Mia, aria,</li>
            <li> But, when this was on a deal of the deal I broke down.</li>
            <li> I have gone down to using it about once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> god sent this down to earth</li>
            <li> This led me down the Olay path of skin care</li>
            <li> , just an FYI, my Pro-x started slowing down</li>
            <li> I have to hold down the power button in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> So I broke down and went to walmart.</li>
            <li> Been waiting for the price to come down.  </li>
            <li> If you apply any pressure, the motor slows way down.</li>
            <li> I noticed it slowing down</li>
            <li> I have to hold down the button in order for it to work.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my skins is a little smoother, but other than that cant tell any difference.  </li>
            <li> I would obviously love the very expensive one that it&#x27;s imitating but for a fraction of the cost I&#x27;ll take this!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money on any other cleanser!</li>
            <li> especially if your feeling lazy!</li>
            <li> , so I may be a little biased, but the people who think this is comparable may not have used the other brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basically the combination of the pro x and alpha hydrox clarifying cleanser has replaced my St. Ives (which I&#x27;ve heard tears skin) and all my other cleansers!</li>
            <li> Also, when using around your nose, due to incomplete contact, you may want to close your eyes, as cleanser will go flying!  </li>
            <li> Basically this product cleans your face so well that other products, creams you use after it do what they are suppose to!</li>
            <li> I mean $30 instead of paying almost $150 for something almost the same?  </li>
            <li> Because of that, after only a few weeks of use my poor little brush is all worn in the middle.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it was much harder to know which parts of my face I had passed over with the device already, due to both the small surface area of the brush and the lack of feedback for my hands.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic is a little heavier, so you can get a little rough on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what those are, but I get dry skin at the junction of my eyebrows and nose area.</li>
            <li> But still never completely satisfied with the amount of dry skin always hanging around.</li>
            <li> I use it all over for no more than a minute because my skin has dry spots.</li>
            <li> When I asked them why my warranty wasn&#x27;t 1 year on the replacement device they told me that was because they only have a 1% failure rate.</li>
            <li> If they claim their failure rate is so low</li>
            <li> I saw comments where people believed the brush was too rough on their face - not true at all!</li>
            <li> Makeup will not cover all these little active pustules.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cleanser that this kit includes, but even my usual face product (Philosophy&#x27;s Purity, if you&#x27;re curious) works extra hard with this brush.</li>
            <li> She came by last week and said she doesn&#x27;t know how she lived this long without it (so dramatic at age 20).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only con that I see is the tube of the cleanser is very small.</li>
            <li> no damage other than a few dents in the bathtub.</li>
            <li> but I get that from other face exfoliators I use, so this was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it is harsh like other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have nearly as much trouble inserting them as other people either.</li>
            <li> All the little blackheads and blocked pores are really diminished and I have fewer random acne spots too.  </li>
            <li> This basically means that the Olay can accidently get a little wet but, has to be dried off immediately.</li>
            <li> It dried me out and left my skin looking dull.</li>
            <li> It has even cut down amount of foundation I use, just a little on dark circles &amp; age spots, or a sweep of powder &amp; that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> soon became clear that the reason for my bad skin was that I hadn&#x27;t been removing my makeup completely at the end of day.</li>
            <li> I was shocked with how clean my face was.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do half the functions described.</li>
            <li> since i started using, i&#x27;m having much less black heads.</li>
            <li> Imbedded black heads have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I recently got a facial where the woman used the expensive, sonic version of this product.  </li>
            <li> This device is a step up from the previous Olay scrubber which used something akin to a brillo pad.  </li>
            <li> The Pro-X costs way less than a Clarisonic,</li>
            <li> After reviewing the comments from previous users, i decided to purchase the olay cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> and yes, my pores are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> My pores are definitely less clogged, although I still suffer from hormonal acne and my search for a miracle continues.    </li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t work out, oh well, less than $30 lost.</li>
            <li> To my delight, Olay makes a cleansing brush 75% less than clarasonic.</li>
            <li> much less blackheads.</li>
            <li> I did by the store brand cleaner after the sample ran out for half the price, and I like the store brand</li>
            <li> Within 3 days my sin was softer and my bumps are less..</li>
            <li> A bonus of using it is that you will need less moisturizer, which is also a savings.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try since I had much less downside.  </li>
            <li> the front of the handle has a black smudge, and inside where the battery is supposed to go i noticed some clear/thick liquid.</li>
            <li> Pores minimized *slightly* after use.</li>
            <li> And so much less oily...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Pro X for less than 1 month</li>
            <li> These, however, have since cleared up and I am now experiencing less spots than ever before.  </li>
            <li> Works well and the price was significantly less than in the stores.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still shocked at how much is still left on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> It has an odd odor to it that makes me hesitant to use it.</li>
            <li> Just scrub scrub in less than a minute and done.  </li>
            <li> After I use this for less than a week.</li>
            <li> paid less on Amazon that I would have at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I used LESS product on my face because it is clearer</li>
            <li> I have owned/been using this guy for 3 weeks now and have noticed that my oily/sensitive skin has become smoother, less irritated, and less oily</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted something similar, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the ridiculous amount that others like this cost.</li>
            <li> were slightly rougher but for the price</li>
            <li> You can tell it cost less than the Clarisonic and</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smoother and less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I just bought it less than one moth.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife (at her suggestion) a year and a half ago.  </li>
            <li> I would get less break outs.</li>
            <li> For someone like me with black heads and combination skin, this product worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Waterproof allows for use in the shower where I typically wash my face.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a brush before, expect a lot of giggles, because the feeling is a bit odd, and watching yourself brush-wash</li>
            <li> pulse.&lt;br /&gt;You have to replace the brush heads in both, and the Olay ones are about half the price of the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I use it along with my proactive xout and those stubborn black heads that I&#x27;ve been fighting with for years</li>
            <li> the black spot in the noise not remove</li>
            <li> im spending that much less $150 for a clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I am finding I have less break outs and a bonus...</li>
            <li> And while one could (and should!) choose rechargable batteries to use in their Olay brush, the battery compartment can be difficult to open (obviously intentional</li>
            <li> I have had a clarisonic previously</li>
            <li> Yes, I paid less on Amazon:  </li>
            <li> But my unit worked for less than 30 days.  </li>
            <li> looked around and found Amazon had the cheapest price compared to Target, Walmart, and typical drugstores like Walgreens and CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have half a brain, I promise, you can figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price was less then I could find in any store</li>
            <li> and I feel like it&#x27;s minimizing the size of them even though it&#x27;s been less than a month.  </li>
            <li> and I get less acne.</li>
            <li> I replaced the batteries that were sent with the product and put in some Lithium batteries; this, I fee, improved the performance and should make you less a slave to replacing batteries.</li>
            <li> It caused serious problems and I intend on calling the manufacturer, Oil of Olay to get my money back.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is less oily, does not break out as often,</li>
            <li> It worked less than 2 months &amp; just quit.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner works well but has a slightly &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this item is that the brush is a bit too ruff for my skin, so it&#x27;s too uncomfortable for me to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> A slight improvement in the hyper pigmentation around my mouth</li>
            <li> ever has, at half her age.</li>
            <li> Seriously guys, I can&#x27;t be the only one!!</li>
            <li> Or at least use it a few times when you don&#x27;t have plans for the next day.</li>
            <li> My pores are cleaner and less defined, my skin seams tighter.</li>
            <li> I would not take it into the shower b/c of the battery unless I could store it somewhere less humid</li>
            <li> I bought a 3 pack for less then this brush.  </li>
            <li> However, instead of using the lotiony stuff that comes with the system, I typically use it with face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was \\&quot;slight scarring\\&quot; on my eye</li>
            <li> And after a week and a half, my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have &#x27;flare ups&#x27; like typical rosacea patients so it may irritate others&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered the Olay ProX from Amazon, received it in less then a week</li>
            <li> and then about 10 days later, I began to have seriously improved skin texture, color, smoothness and even color.</li>
            <li> And acnes on face are less than before.</li>
            <li> I worked with the Pro-X for about a week, but I ended up purchasing a Clarisonic Mia 2 which is roughly half the price of the Plus, but still has the sonic cleansing I have grown used to.</li>
            <li> the less, i have noticed clearer, happier skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe I use less pressure, who knows.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed clearer, healthier skin as a result, and I&#x27;ve had to use less moisturizer after using the brush.</li>
            <li> However I do wish the bristles were slightly softer.</li>
            <li> and i feel like i am less shiny.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my skin was smoother and less oily.</li>
            <li> Battery life typically lasts me about 5-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> set up was less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Well this brush has solved both problems in less than a month.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have and have never used the brand that is three times as expensive but have a hard time believing the expensive brand does a better job!  </li>
            <li> Having lifelong problems with blackheads, whiteheads and nasty \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; on my face, I was looking for an effective way to remove makeup and exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers said that they thought the brush was a little harsh for their skin.</li>
            <li> I mean, risk management says I should avoid walking wet and barefoot across any wet tiled surface...</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t come with a case so you&#x27;ll need to purchase a hard (not soft) case if you travel, as I learned the bristles bend.</li>
            <li> The clarsonic also has a self-timed shut off, but again, how hard is it to estimate how long one minute is?  </li>
            <li> I know the unit will stop, which means if I bear down a little, the motor is straining, which will eventually wear it out.</li>
            <li> In just a few days, dead skin started building back up, oiliness increased, my complexion appeared dull and muddy.  </li>
            <li> I do wash my makeup with a salicylic acid cleanser first because otherwise it feels like you&#x27;re pushing dirty makeup around.</li>
            <li> I use AM (slow setting) in the morning since my skin is not that dirty and PM for deep cleaning (fast setting).</li>
            <li> it can make a bit of a mess as it gets flung everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected with this item.  </li>
            <li> so we do not leave a mess on the bathroom vanities.  </li>
            <li> Just not good enough for an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a small handheld one attachable brush with no real power for scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this was money well spent when it  comes to the brush.</li>
            <li> I put about 5 small dabs of the exfoliator around my wet face and used the device for about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It actually thins you skin which is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> It comes with a trial size Olay Exfoliating Scrub, the normal sized tube costs about $20 which is a bit expensive</li>
            <li> The first time i used it I hadn&#x27;t put make up on for days and when I got the brush away from my face it was gunky and dirty looking.  </li>
            <li> I had an expensive one, but it finally died after a few years of daily use.</li>
            <li> sealed shut tightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made to be waterproof so it needs to be tight, so just put some strength into it</li>
            <li> My face was shiny (not from oil) and tight.</li>
            <li> I usually have breakouts and large pores, therefore it is difficult to find products that help my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was dull, blotchy, and so dry that it was flaky in areas.</li>
            <li> It felt dry and looked dull.</li>
            <li> I never realized how dry and dull my skin looked before until after I used this.</li>
            <li> This product comes with no instructions inside at all and teeeny-weeeny lame instructions on the side of the box, which I didn&#x27;t even see, though I looked pretty hard.</li>
            <li> The  pores on my cheeks, chin and forehead are small enough that when I use makeup they can hardly be seen.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The head is also much smaller than any other brand I&#x27;ve used, so it takes a much longer period of time just to wash my face, which is really annoying when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> Cut long, dramatic story short - I did my usual rooting around and found the Olay Pro-X Cleansing System alternative....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with a lot of breakouts and dry skin on my nose and cheeks lately.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a few dollars less than Wal-Mart for both the unit and replacements heads</li>
            <li> If I dont use it, my face feels not completely clean.</li>
            <li> I did not think it was harsh on my face in regards to the feeling, because it did not hurt, but obviously it was not good for me.</li>
            <li> For me, the Clarisonic, even on the gentlest setting with the sensitive brush head, made things worse not better.</li>
            <li> but I like being lazy especially when it has been a late night.</li>
            <li> The slow speed is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> All my life I have had trouble with black heads</li>
            <li> He is a typical teenager who has a few skin problems.  </li>
            <li> My breakout are less and it remove heavy makeup in a breeze .</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed that it only spins one direction and how fast I had to change the battery.</li>
            <li> Not clean or radiant.  </li>
            <li> I am only sorry I waited so long.</li>
            <li> Some people say not to use this product every day as it is harsh on your skin, so I did cut down on using it everyday, but still use this product about 4-5 times a week.</li>
            <li> The battery casing is horribly tight and very hard to open for battery (re)placement and is the reason I would not give this cleansing system 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;think&#x27; they look a little bit smoothed out.  </li>
            <li> Just helps out a little.</li>
            <li> Just helps out a little.</li>
            <li> If you tend to be a little obsessive, you risk damaging your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I understand that it needs to be waterproof but there has got to be an easier way to have a waterproof battery part and still be a little bit easier for the consumer to get it</li>
            <li> It was a little wobbly.</li>
            <li> Sometimes i get a little paranoid when a product claims to help the skin.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this temporary fix will do until I use up a little plastic container of mineral face powder.  </li>
            <li> I feel the exfoliating scrub could be a little stronger or the brush should be a little stiffer.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t over exfoliate and irritate my skin which I have been known to do in the past with other face exfoliaters.</li>
            <li> speed switch are a little touchy.</li>
            <li> I used the little tube of olay that came with the machine</li>
            <li> I put it back on and it stayed there (at least through that one usage!).    </li>
            <li> My skin did tingle a little when I was done</li>
            <li> I even use it on my d&amp;eacute;colletage for little sun damage bumps.</li>
            <li> I just put my cleanings cream on with a little water &amp; run this little cleanser  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a weak girl with tiny hands</li>
            <li> The brush head is exfoliating, so I just use a little Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I will say that I wish the bristles were a little stronger</li>
            <li> Little white-heads?</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling a little irritated and in need of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s appearance has  improved since I started using this little device two months ago.</li>
            <li> The little problem bumps and things are gone and discolorations are reduced.</li>
            <li> Work s just as well as any other I have had in past.</li>
            <li> I have been using a little over a week</li>
            <li> Now, the little gadget has been laying in my shower untouched for a year.  </li>
            <li> Also, the acne formation on my skin has reduced a little bit.</li>
            <li> LITTLE TO MY SURPRISE</li>
            <li> It comes with a little face wash too that I like.</li>
            <li> it for my little one</li>
            <li> I tried using on other parts of my body but gave up as it is kinda small.</li>
            <li> This little gizmo is a life changer.</li>
            <li> Neat little product.</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s appearance has radically improved since I started using this little device two months ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a little over a month</li>
            <li> and I just think that&#x27;s a little over charge thinking that the product I bought for $21.99.</li>
            <li> but I thought the “head” would move a little faster.  </li>
            <li> , this brush is lightweight and requires little space in my luggage.</li>
            <li> Wish it rotated a little faster, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little overpriced..</li>
            <li> I have had this little gadget for about 2 months now.  </li>
            <li> Weak motor, only two batteries,&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a little nervous about that</li>
            <li> also got one for my little brother.</li>
            <li> BUT the cleanser enclosed is a little too moisturizing for me for the summer.  </li>
            <li> I had a little bit of the Olay sample cleanser remaining, so I tried that with the pro-x machine and the results were A-mazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a skeptic but based on other reviews I tried it</li>
            <li> Any little complexion issues I had have disappeared.</li>
            <li> The item itself feels a bit cheap-the little motor sounds overly-taxed as you run it across your skin, as if it doesn&#x27;t have quite the energy to keep working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that it is still just working through the mess of dead skin and stuff.</li>
            <li> This little gadget works</li>
            <li> but I think this helps tighten it a little bit too.</li>
            <li> The brush is interchangeable, so you can replace it once it gets a little grimy like how you would replace your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I saw a little improvement, I caved in and bought a Clarisonic Mia, which I have been using for two days now.</li>
            <li> We like the fact that it is a sturdy little machine that can be kept in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Wish it rotated a little faster.</li>
            <li> I decided to do something about it and after a little bit of research I decided to get this cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it would be a little faster.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the bristles are a little softer than the Clarisonic, as the Clarisonic bristles are a little the ruff for my skin.</li>
            <li> but I noticed a little bit of sensitivity and dryness after using it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was a little worried.</li>
            <li> It feels a little on the slimy side.</li>
            <li> To insert the batteries pull off the bottom of the device, it&#x27;s a little tricky to pull off.  </li>
            <li> the little button just doesn&#x27;t want to stay in so that the brush keeps revolving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try the Olay brush with the little sample of included cleanser, but instead use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I keep a little spray bottle with rubbing alcohol in it to spritz the head after I&#x27;m done using it as a disinfectant.</li>
            <li> Due to some medications Inow take, and having received 33 Radiation treatments for Breast Cancer this has taken a toll on my skiN over the past 3 yrs.</li>
            <li> I use this little brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little under a week</li>
            <li> once the little trial one runs out.</li>
            <li> little brush truly makes a difference.</li>
            <li> and I think a little water got into it</li>
            <li> I am 21, and this little brush reminds me to wash my face (even at 3am).</li>
            <li> For a fraction of the cost this is the little cleaner that could.  </li>
            <li> and it should do its thing just as well for you if you just need a little boost in your skincare routine.  </li>
            <li> This product does what it says it just seems a little flimsy</li>
            <li> do wish that it would come with a little stand or something to set it on or in when I&#x27;m not using it though.</li>
            <li> I like this little machine.</li>
            <li> and I decided to try this since it was far less expensive</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for anything that removes dry dead skin so of course I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> That thing is very hard to open up, but the battery has lasted to this day (7 months and still working).</li>
            <li> I am always very careful to stay away from my eye area and use just a small amount of cleanser to avoid a problem like this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have what would be classified as mild acne, but I&#x27;m 28 and sick of it.  </li>
            <li> but I have had serious acne for a long time.</li>
            <li> Even the little soap that they give you with the product I would not want to use everyday as it has little microbeads in it</li>
            <li> Olay isn&#x27;t too bad, but the brush head can be little harsh on dry sensitive skin, and the rotating motion makes it harder to reach sides of nose.&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic</li>
            <li> a baby hairbrush, and the spinning action is weak enough that if you apply a little pressure, it merely grinds to a halt.  </li>
            <li> It was a little harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> I found it that if you use a night cream, which is a little heavy than day cream, it works wonders.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it a few times a week with an over the counter acne wash and his little pimples are in check.  </li>
            <li> I had a little bit of trouble getting the batteries in, but persistence won</li>
            <li> The pretika is too tough and does not spin, returned the second day.</li>
            <li> What a let down!  </li>
            <li> Olay has never let me down!</li>
            <li> I tested it with a long-wear foundation (which, by design, is particularly hard to remove), and started out by wiping my face with both sides of a wet \\&quot;facial\\&quot; towelette.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of pushing too hard and it ripped my face to shreds so be careful.  </li>
            <li> but I guess that is done on purpose to not really scrub your face too hard.</li>
            <li> I use it an average of 5 nights a week, need to use very little of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Few weeks ago my mother commented that the skin around my mouth and chin was looking very dark.</li>
            <li> I have to say those little black dots that I can see in my magnified mirror are 90 percent gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and struggle with dull skin and a depressing onslaught of tiny wrinkles popping through, and so far Olay has helped with those issues.</li>
            <li> No different that any other less expensive cleanser on the market.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be normal/dry and sensitive, but personally I have not had any bad reactions to the Pro-X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was afraid this would be another way to overstimulate and irritate my very reactive tender face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen subtle differences in complexion &amp; mainly dry skin</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product was after the return window for amazon to accept it back, at this point I am out $20+ dollars I spent on it.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was in desperate need of exfoliation and it worked very well within two days of just using it in the shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> I started to hear a lot about the Clarisonic, but I just don&#x27;t feel like paying that much for something that I don&#x27;t desperately want/need.</li>
            <li> Nothing has happened since, and it cleared up in a few days.</li>
            <li> but i have been using everyday for a month now</li>
            <li> The soaps get stuck on the cleaner and the brush is harsh on my face.</li>
            <li> Too abbrassive to use everyday.</li>
            <li> really a waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> That being said I have been using this product 2-3x per week for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> for everyday cleansing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Conair&#x27;s is like those FIRM toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> i have used this about everyday since i got it 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> Waste of money..</li>
            <li> I feel that my face was fresher looking within a few days</li>
            <li> what a waste of money</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower a few times a week</li>
            <li> using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I used it for travel and it was sufficient for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The micro dermabrason kit is fantastic, but the cleanser brush is worthless.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I used an astringent after cleansing my face and found that the Olay Pro-X left a lot of grime behind.  </li>
            <li> all the dead skin cells are gone.</li>
            <li> But it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Within a few days use I could see a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would provide cleansing but also remove the dead skin cells that accumulate and cause lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I did not have trouble with the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> the bristles are firm but not abrasive</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time.</li>
            <li> When spinning, the center bristles create a thick point that feels like its in the way.</li>
            <li> A few things</li>
            <li> Maybe the cleanser was too harsh for my skin.  </li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t feel harsh nor tickle my face.</li>
            <li> but so far all I can say is absolutely useless design</li>
            <li> I bought and returned a Clarisonic a few years ago because it irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday..</li>
            <li> but i never noticed any appreciable difference in my skin quality after a few months of using it.  </li>
            <li> it seems like it might be too harsh</li>
            <li> , I use it with Olay exfoliating cleanser at night and in the morning I just use my St. Ives Green Tea cleanser (I&#x27;m not made of money)</li>
            <li> It helps slough off dead skin and keeps me from having skin problems.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t dried out after using it and I already see a difference with my skin and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now</li>
            <li> I use this face brush everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> I used this product quite a few times</li>
            <li> I dried it off after each use.  </li>
            <li> The included face wash though is a bit too harsh for my liking</li>
            <li> I dried off, I looked in the mirror, and my face was GLOWING.</li>
            <li> Instead I got this machine and some sloughing gloves for my body that were a few dollars.</li>
            <li> A few complaints:  1)  </li>
            <li> It broke after 4 months of everyday use.</li>
            <li> I have used my friend&#x27;s clarisonic a few times to try it out, and decided i wanted to get one for myself.</li>
            <li> I must pick it up a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> then every 2 days for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After a few days I saw a visible difference in clarity -- without changing or adding *</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a few months now</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it probably still works after a few months of not using it.</li>
            <li> and I break out and have an uneven skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t want to dish out a few hundred bucks for a FACE BRUSH.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always done home facials, but they are messy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months and have not had to change the batteries yet</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> After even a few days, the difference was noticeable.</li>
            <li> but you will need to exfoliate every few days with something a bit rougher.  </li>
            <li> Batteries included were dead.  </li>
            <li> I like this brush a lot,but found that if used everyday it causes some flaking on my oily face.  </li>
            <li> but this was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone who has difficult break outs and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> my skin in winter gets some small dark dots and this cleaning system helped me to get rid of them</li>
            <li> The brushes are not too harsh, however, if you want to use it as a exfoliating use the sample of Olay that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> That dead skin is the stuff preventing the oil from getting through.</li>
            <li> The missing link!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i wanted something to exfloiate without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it on my face after a few uses for fear of a breakout.  </li>
            <li> I do apply make up everyday and use this at the end of the day to wash off any residue.</li>
            <li> The thing i dislike is that it collect dirt and loses it&#x27;s whiteness overtime, but that is minimal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as heavy duty</li>
            <li> Just recently I have been breaking out worse than ever</li>
            <li> There was no amazing overnight miracle for me, not that I expected one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to a heavy exfoliating skin pad from another brand.</li>
            <li> and I had put it away for a few months after a move.</li>
            <li> Everyday I use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily (in the evening) with the microderm scrub and it has improved by skin tone and decreased oil production through the day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> but this was a waste.</li>
            <li> I use this with a dermatologist roller thing and some Benzo Peroxide and it seems to get rid of my acne, in just a few uses</li>
            <li> Exfoliates her skin and removes makeup with a few minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s broken, I didn&#x27;t  do anyting about it except using it regularly.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday to ensure my skin is cleared before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> but I try not to use it everyday because it tends to over-exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Is it weird that I think the bristles are TOO soft?</li>
            <li> but isn&#x27;t too harsh.</li>
            <li> This product may work for some but not for me I used it everyday for 2 months with no results</li>
            <li> Waste of money, wish I&#x27;d never seen it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t expensive, the brush is soft and has two settings.</li>
            <li> If you do decide to buy another cleanser brand, try to find one that isn&#x27;t too harsh.</li>
            <li> If they came out with another version that did not lose power, I would be all over it for the price, but without power, it was sadly a waste of money and landfill space..</li>
            <li> A few of the blackheads on my cheeks became bumps too, but they went away within a couple days, because I did not pop them and just continued to use the brush.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times, then switched to my Neutrogena face wash.  </li>
            <li> I do use it everyday with the Pro-X cleansing wash which is not a foaming cleanser</li>
            <li> I know some exfoliating products recommend to NOT use everyday but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everyday for about 2 weeks and like how refreshed my skin feels.</li>
            <li> almost everyday</li>
            <li> results I see after a few weeks of using ProX:&lt;br /&gt;- tightened pores</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times  week</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week</li>
            <li> I ve used the Pro-x for a few weeks now, and have gotten excellant results.</li>
            <li> The Pro-X system works to remove dead skin cells and hopefully will help to reduce signs of aging as I continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really tired of using oral medications to manage it, so have used topical</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Finally got tired of manually spinning something that&#x27;s supposed to work automatically</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but I like this.</li>
            <li> but it is actually getting worse.  </li>
            <li> Doing it everyday...</li>
            <li> everyday use would be too harsh on it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday</li>
            <li> However not suggested to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> ,as well as skin tightening preparations round my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have also been using a few drops of Bio oil as a night moisturizer and it has worked quite well.</li>
            <li> So I tried a few of their cheaper offerings.</li>
            <li> Washcloths that I used to use would pull my skin and not get all the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> To use everyday.</li>
            <li> Maybe the bristles are too harsh or there is something in them that breaks out my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday in the shower.</li>
            <li> After my skin continued to get worse I finally stopped using this brush.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money.</li>
            <li> Broke after few times of use...  </li>
            <li> used this everyday, should have bought it sooner</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have totally wasted &amp;</li>
            <li> to a few days ago when I decided, after a few months of giving my skin a break, I&#x27;d try this again.</li>
            <li> I can only assume it&#x27;s too irritating for my skin.</li>
            <li> Unless customer service can give me the secret code for opening the battery case, this product goes back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin glowing and it gets rid of all dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> It was just a bit too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t remove dead skin and irritates my face.  </li>
            <li> This helps scrub off all those stubborn dead skin cells clinging to the surface.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few days, once a day, my face broke out quite a bit from it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> I found it to be too harsh and abrasive.</li>
            <li> I read in a lot of reviews that people were having trouble figuring out that they could remove the bottom of the device to insert that batteries.  </li>
            <li> then it should not be too harsh against your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it few times a week.</li>
            <li> I use a few times a week</li>
            <li> My wife uses this everyday and just loves the feeling her skin has afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have used an exfoliating cleanser for a few years</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday and apply salicylic acid once a week (30%).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Pro-X system for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> Its not too harsh on my face at all.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but this shit</li>
            <li> It takes away the dried, dead skin you dont even realize is on your face to help rectify inflammation and discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this a few times, I ordered another one for my son, and a package of replacement brushes.  </li>
            <li> might not like the battery operated, you need to replace&lt;br /&gt;the batteries every few weeks to keep it running at</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> A waste of money if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, For those people like me with sensitive skin, this is something to avoid like the plague.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Then a few weeks ago I added a variety of Olay products to do battle.  </li>
            <li> I have prescription meds for oily skin and needed a cleanser that wasn&#x27;t harsh.  </li>
            <li> However, on some spots on my face it feels a bit too harsh (might be</li>
            <li> As for the Olay cleanser I have used it a few times within the area around my nose to shrink the pores .</li>
            <li> I use it with Neutrogena face wash every day and the exfoliating cleanser every few days.</li>
            <li> used it a few times and stopped.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday</li>
            <li> I can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but you might find that it can be to harsh with your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rotating after few months</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating cream that comes with it is not too grainy or harsh.  </li>
            <li> This is helping to exfoliate the dead skin created by the prescription cream for my rosacea.  </li>
            <li> My mom had hers for a few months</li>
            <li> Finally, I can get a deep-clean without irritating my skin...</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to do a review on this to see how it worked on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a few usage, my pores are visibly unclogged and there aren&#x27;t any bumps(When</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday</li>
            <li> I use with the Olay cleaner everyday and don&#x27;t have any problem.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup everyday and even with thorough cleansing, I would have the breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> what a waste of $$$.</li>
            <li> The bristles are also coarse and irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> Even after just a few uses I can already feel and see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> &amp; I know the cleansing factor has improved all lotions, make up which may have been left unknowingly behind.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> You can use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> the way it feels and when it is in use it seems harsh.</li>
            <li> but i felt like it dried out my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I used with a limp hand and no longer than 10 seconds on each cheek.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> I used it twice and had skin trouble</li>
            <li> I gave up on this brush a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel like i&#x27;m missing anything at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday since Dec 26, 2014</li>
            <li> this is absolutely waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to help exfoliate my skin rather than using creams that are too harsh.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the others use the brand that is trusted.</li>
            <li> everyday</li>
            <li> so it removes dead skin and don&#x27;t let acne to form.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m using it everyday morning</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I have told a few of my friends about it already.</li>
            <li> I just threw another $20 away, waste of money.</li>
            <li> It can be used with any face wash or exfoliating scrub, and assists in getting rid of built-up dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday since it&#x27;s arrival</li>
            <li> The product that comes with it is too harsh too use on my face...maybe as a foot scrub.</li>
            <li> Another dead end.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times, but not wasting my time with it any longer.</li>
            <li> I washed my face and dried it...</li>
            <li> This product just dried the face.</li>
            <li> and I also abused my skin as a habitual tanner, felt I had to be tan year round.</li>
            <li> otherwise your just accumulating dead skin and material from pores and reapplying them to your face.</li>
            <li> it only irritates my skin and makes it break out worse, so</li>
            <li> do not buy this waste of money</li>
            <li> I like the brush its not too harsh on my skin, 4 stars for not rinsing my makeup off well with water i have to add soap to the brush</li>
            <li> , now it&#x27;s broken, but I put it back together and the thing kept working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months, and it&#x27;s made a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend to use everyday.</li>
            <li> What I did not like it that it was sent to me with dead batteries.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize what&#x27;s left behind, after a face wash, until you use the cleaning system</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out as much anymore except for when I get this pesky &amp;#34;time-of-the-month&amp;#34; pimples and even those aren&#x27;t as worse anymore either.</li>
            <li> However, I found the brush being a little too stiff and harsh to the skin.</li>
            <li> For example, when using this product below your eyes it will pull your bottom eyelid down and is pretty painful in that retrospect.</li>
            <li> When i come upon a small fortune or when the price goes down, I&#x27;d like to invest in a Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li> I was concerned I would break it and finally used a very small screw driver very slowly and carefully.  </li>
            <li> The head also seems to slow down a bit when slight pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> but is 90% less!</li>
            <li> but what did I expect at less than $20 vs. her $100 unit!  </li>
            <li> I can even see small impurities, black dots and all.</li>
            <li> plus i find i am less lazy about washing my face at night.  </li>
            <li> Like a lot of other people, I get those pesky blackheads on my nose that are hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Some other cleaning systems like this are so hard on my face</li>
            <li> mediocre results comparable to other similar</li>
            <li> I was hesitant due to a few negative reviews, but thought I would try it before the plunge of the clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super disappointed and wouldn&#x27;t thing it would within a month.</li>
            <li> No fine line reduction</li>
            <li> One brush should be a hard one and the other like the one that  comes with it.</li>
            <li> Would this item pale in comparison the the Clarisonic?  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that ridiculous battery compartment.</li>
            <li> but this is a common side effect due to my skin not used to being thoroughly cleaned and massaged like this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it in there, because other people gave negative reviews saying how water got into the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> I still put it in the original box after each use, and it is annoying cuz the box is</li>
            <li> nothing special about the brush, it&#x27;s simply a rotating machine operated by AA batteries with a horrible smell</li>
            <li> The brush heads are not too stiff.</li>
            <li> Does not appear to do the work, not a strong device.</li>
            <li> so can go anywhere easily, no wires to haul along.</li>
            <li> Has helped to tame my oily/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what I expected; but the brush seemed to turn so slowly that I doubted its effectiveness immediately.</li>
            <li> I watched a review that said that it was not easy to wash off</li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed in this product, so I gave it to my 11 year old granddaughter starting with acne,</li>
            <li> Poor design, too heavy and not shaped for comfortability in long term holding to cleanse ...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it broke down after only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The brush head is a little small</li>
            <li> The spinning bristles are a little slower than I thought they would be, not sure if it&#x27;s because I got a bad/defected one or</li>
            <li> It works well with the little tube of exfoliating cleanser that comes with it, or with my usual Neutrogena cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I think the head is a little small and under powered, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> it smells quite bad, though (very, very plastic-y smell).</li>
            <li> So although I was forewarned from previous reviews, I too found the battery compartment VERRRRY difficult to open.</li>
            <li> Of course, ten years ago it was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in a couple of weeks, as some of the other reviewers saw such dramatic results!</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin cause all the reviews complain about how harsh it is are crazy.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to push the brush down hard against your face to get results.</li>
            <li> If I bear down too hard</li>
            <li> I would think the rotating brushes would pull too hard on the skin, abrading it and breaking down the elasticity of the skin.  </li>
            <li> (thanks Arbonne too!), but the bad thing is enlarging pores and ongoing battles with clogged pores.</li>
            <li> But then after 2 weeks of consistently using this, my skin got really bad.</li>
            <li> i used to have pretty bad acne</li>
            <li> Wet batteries are not a good thing.</li>
            <li> Normally, when i wipe on my astringent after washing my face, the cotton ball will still be dirty.</li>
            <li> anyways I use it for 15-20 min a session everyday a bit excessive</li>
            <li> I usually use it a few times a week and seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> i have been using this for the past few days</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit is probably easier on the skin than rubbing with a washcloth, but I&#x27;m just not sure that I&#x27;ll bother using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> There are two speeds for the brush so that you can quicken or slow down the brush revolving speed to your preference.</li>
            <li> Water doesn&#x27;t slow it down</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothers me is that to replace the brush heads, it gets a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints about this product except that it was a little difficult to open the place where the batteries go.</li>
            <li> Initially I was skeptical about this little rotating brush thingie.  </li>
            <li> I previously had the Clairsonic brush, so hard to compare the two.</li>
            <li> I will warn that you don&#x27;t want to use it longer then a couple of minutes because it can leave your skin feeling raw.  </li>
            <li> and I would feel raw after using it</li>
            <li> , the combination of the two products made my face really raw.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this because I have had such bad skin all of my teenage years throughout my 23rd year.</li>
            <li> --ill still get a few zits but nothing like the giant, impacted ones caused by the ingrowns before.</li>
            <li> He did, after all, bring an expensive hairdryer back from the dead for me before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it made me break out within a few days of starting to use it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a real good microdermabrasion brush.</li>
            <li> it works wonders to a dry and tired gray skin</li>
            <li> but the motor will slowly die in 2 years or less</li>
            <li> Black head are slowly going away.</li>
            <li> and I do MEAN anything on my face without having anxiety and being let down.</li>
            <li> I came in here looking to check out Olay&#x27;s Va Va Voom cleansing system, and instead found this little gem!</li>
            <li> This little gem does all it says!</li>
            <li> but I carry this little guy practically everywhere with me!</li>
            <li> AT ALLEVIATING DARK SPOTS AND ACNE !!</li>
            <li> I am thankful I purchased this little gadget!</li>
            <li> I have always been afraid to try something like this since I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was afraid this type of brush would be harmful for my skin.</li>
            <li> but because I have very sensitive skin I was afraid of brush abrasions.  </li>
            <li> I hate having to post a negative review of something I had such high hopes for.  </li>
            <li> , however, this one is weak in strength and the brush is too rough for my skin, it made it welt.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t be afraid to give this item a try if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I recieved my product only to have a hard time opening it to put the batteries in and then to find some nasty clear fluid in the section where the batteries go and some hair as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bit  hard for my face..</li>
            <li> However, please note - this product comes with absolutely no instructions - i.e. doesnt say when to buy replacement brushes so I&#x27;m guessing every month or so?), and it is VERY hard to put in the batteries.  </li>
            <li> (I can only use the sensitive brush for the Clarisonic), but this just didn&#x27;t do much for me :( :(</li>
            <li> I notice absolutely no difference after using this product, other than my skin feeling tighter in an uncomfortable way.</li>
            <li> I do experience a little sensitivity/dryness, but I can handle the Clarisonic (at least I think I can).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has two speeds (one slow and one a little bit faster).</li>
            <li> (that can be bought anywhere for very little $$$)</li>
            <li> The device has two speeds, slow, and a little slower.</li>
            <li> but I do have a few areas that get the start of blackheads and get dull.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have bad skin days anymore</li>
            <li> My sister had really bad acne problem and had tried everything before and this cleaned her skin so fast.</li>
            <li> I am shocked how much of a difference</li>
            <li> The head was small and rotated without vibrating.</li>
            <li> The Olay doesn&#x27;t vibrate but spins (duh) and removes dead skin...</li>
            <li> I am not sure if my skin is brighter like the box stated.</li>
            <li> I first opened up the kit, I was kinda disappointed that the brush head bristles were</li>
            <li> Not sure why I bought this...</li>
            <li> The cleaning head is small.</li>
            <li> No more going after my pores causing redness and scarring.</li>
            <li> I have to add that the exfoliating cleanser sample that os supplied is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my mom and she uses it everyday!</li>
            <li> Product is not available in Singapore thus after searching for quite awhile, managed to find it on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> blackheads usually - just clogged pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just somewhat difficult to get the battery compartment open.  </li>
            <li> Also, the motor seems small.</li>
            <li> I have psorisis on my face so after I would wash my face, I would get small flakes here and there.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a small fortune on a brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too small - about</li>
            <li> The brush surface area is too small.</li>
            <li> I have used the $200 cleansing system in the past.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> For $30 I decided that even if it was a piece of crap, it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I stay out of the sun, no acne, small pores, so</li>
            <li> The machine is small</li>
            <li> The box comes with one brush and a small tube of Olay face wash, but I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> I read numerous reviews before I bought this, and I was really skeptical about it, even with this being the number one selling beauty product on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have never felt the need to wear foundation, and when I have tried it in the past, it bugged me having it on my skin</li>
            <li> For the past six months, I have been using it a couple times a week in the shower and no more than that.</li>
            <li> I used to be too lazy.</li>
            <li> and I was only making it worse by covering it up with foundation, even at the gym!</li>
            <li> and it comes with a small tube of Olay face wash just for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like how it uses batteries and how difficult it is to get the battery section to open up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think of it..</li>
            <li> Sadly, it&#x27;s not been helping with my acne. :(</li>
            <li> I like to use a few drops of Complex 15 Therapeutic Moisturizing face cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen results within just a few weeks  and will continue to use this and recommend it to my family and friends!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact for traveling.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the cleansing system (with the Olay cleanser) every day for the past 8 months.  </li>
            <li> It brought on hundreds of small pustules all over my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the cleansing system (with the Olay cleanser) every day for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> I used it with the small tube of exfoliant that came with it</li>
            <li> When i bought it was not sure can i compare with the sonic.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s extremely difficult</li>
            <li> NOT SURE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid of the cleanser that came with it since my skin in so sensitive.</li>
            <li> to travel with, small size, portable.</li>
            <li> And for only $29.99 YOU CANNOT GO WRONG.  </li>
            <li> Though the system comes with a sample cleanser, I&#x27;m using my usual cleanser</li>
            <li> but I think it was to harsh, after two weeks of using it my face broke out!</li>
            <li> Not sure why people say this scratches their face /</li>
            <li> I do like that it is portable and small though.</li>
            <li> It works no better than any method of exfoliation that doesn&#x27;t require a $25 tool.</li>
            <li> Not sure why but could be the type of face wash I am using.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this..especially for being male.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the small brush because I want to use this all over my body.</li>
            <li> I will say I am usually oily T zone type</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small tube of exfoliating scrub as well.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small tube of cleanser and batteries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and also water resistant which allows it to be used in the shower without any problems.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the pro-x</li>
            <li> Not sure it does anything</li>
            <li> AND IT HAS CLEARED UP MY SKIN AND EVEN THE SMALL ROSACEA SPOT</li>
            <li> I use this cleansing brush everyday!</li>
            <li> The cleansing soap that comes with it is small, and I would recommend buying an additional tube of the soap separately.</li>
            <li> also cleaned a few blackheads I had so bonus there!</li>
            <li> I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of thie instrument of the cleansing system for Olay.</li>
            <li> We have put the batteries in each way, none work, and it is extremely difficult to open to insert the batteries.  </li>
            <li> she uses it like almost everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done it , life sucks always worrying about food destroying my skin.</li>
            <li> Usually, when I break out, it is one of these blackheads on my chin that has manifested itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure it does anything.</li>
            <li> it fits in all the small crevices of my face.</li>
            <li> This is a small device.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses my face was softer and smoother!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s not a magic bullet.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but decided to try the facial brush anyway.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have $250 to spend on something so small.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with my usual cleaner, and applied the Serum.  </li>
            <li> If it stops working after 90 days I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
            <li> because I used this everyday to help work in my facewash!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too small.</li>
            <li> but not sure about relying on it for weekly use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it&#x27;s not magic.</li>
            <li> I have used St. Ives Timeless Skin moisturizer for a few years and I can&#x27;t give it up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not sure that I would  buy this again.</li>
            <li> of these reviews force me to imagine them ripping open the package, throwing the box behind them, pulling out the item and smashing it against the counter, grunting (unga-bunga!).</li>
            <li> I have arthritis, but usually I can do anything I need to with my hands.</li>
            <li> How difficult would it be to design the brush with a simple release mechanism for the battery cover?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact.</li>
            <li> (Not sure why anyone would use the slowest speed--feels like a tickle against the skin)</li>
            <li> Ive been using it everyday!</li>
            <li> It also gives you a small sample size of exfoliating cleanser</li>
            <li> is an advantage in the small areas around the nose.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a small exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser sample you get is small and it was gone within one week</li>
            <li> Not sure if it does all it says it does.</li>
            <li> I am not giving it 5 stars only because the battery installation should not be that difficult (thank you to all who wrote on how to do that) and because it does not come with even one replacement head, seems like there ought to be one thrown in with purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this about 3-4 times every week because if used everyday, you WILL over exfoliate your face!</li>
            <li> is SO small.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I usually use it at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I usually use an exfoliator scrub</li>
            <li> I got pimples in weird places, like just above my lip and between my eyes.  </li>
            <li> My skin was tighter and my pores small.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a small mirror that suctions to the wall</li>
            <li> Waking up the next morning, I found that I had acne worse than I had ever had it before!</li>
            <li> I like the small handle</li>
            <li> And it comes with a small bottle of the cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> After owning the Clairsonic &amp; having to throw it out because the batteries were not able to be replaced, I ordered this system.  </li>
            <li> but with this it scrubs off all the dead skin that was clogging my pours!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical still, but am totally a believer.</li>
            <li> It is not a top of the line product like The Clarisonic Brush, but for the money it is built well and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Not sure why you would spend $100 plus when this product works so well and is a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> These usually cause breakouts on my skin.</li>
            <li> The price for this is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> It small and usefull.</li>
            <li> I have used just about EVERY product on the market including a combination of 2-3 antibiotics a day and a prescription strength topical gel which did work, but bleached EVERYTHING and was really expensive.</li>
            <li> Came with a spare brush head and small soap</li>
            <li> comes with one brush head and a small sample tube of  proX cleanser.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the brush or the vitamins.</li>
            <li> I like how small it is</li>
            <li> and you can usually find one on sale- either on Amazon or at Target.</li>
            <li> I keep rinsing the brush and cleansing again til no more make-up comes off on the brush.</li>
            <li> Id been struggling with the idea of buying a Clarisonic after all the hype thats been out there, but it feels too expensive for a person that had tried to use face brushes before, but left them because they caused breakouts.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product not sure if it would work.</li>
            <li> SENSITIVE PEOPLE - don&#x27;t be afraid to try this.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and was afraid this system would aggravate it and make it redder than it already is.  </li>
            <li> I used a small amount of the exfoliating cleanser that the brush came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> and I did give the Clairsonic a try... what an over-rated waste of money!  </li>
            <li> so not sure how this would help that anyways.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with severe acne breakouts as a result of hormonal problems for the past 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I use the Olay Pro-X in the shower 2-3 times weekly with my usual benzoyl peroxide cleanser.</li>
            <li> a small exfoliating product Olay did not know him</li>
            <li> It had angry red patches all over, the texture was not improved</li>
            <li> The battery compartment is ridiculously difficult to open</li>
            <li> The small lines seemed to fade (not altogether, as nothing does that).</li>
            <li> What I wanted face wash is small though</li>
            <li> It also comes with a small tube of  exfoliation cleanser to try.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small product, but it does what its meant to, which is just as well.</li>
            <li> However, the brush is really small.</li>
            <li> Small in size.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic seems a bit excessive to me.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve always been afraid to try a scrubber like this because my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser with the package is small.  </li>
            <li> the bottle that comes in the box is fairly small</li>
            <li> Using it seemed to apply no more pressure than a feather wisp across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had terrible acne, but it&#x27;s so much better now.</li>
            <li> I figured it was because I was scrubbing up some nasty dirt and exfoliating better than I ever had before.</li>
            <li> I do like this product, however, I am not sure the quality is what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I knew I had to stop being lazy and do something about my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a small tube of an Olay cleanser that came with it that you can try.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I use the cleanser that comes with it or substitute my usual cleanser (Noxzema) without any problem.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is a result of just using the brush nightly or if it is a combination of the foam and cream she has prescribed</li>
            <li> the battery cover was a little difficult to get off but other than those few complaints</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weak, smells unpleasant, and very expenseive ($15?!).  </li>
            <li> has very few granules in it, and</li>
            <li> I have very few wrinkle at all</li>
            <li> product have very few cons.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with acne and have found very few products that help.</li>
            <li> but...this seems quite pricey ($26.00) for such a meager little piece of machinery.</li>
            <li> (so mad because it was not that old)</li>
            <li> I use in conjunction with other olay products, but this has been the game changer....</li>
            <li> I think it might be impossible for some people to open if they have arthritis or any other condition that affects hand strength.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint, the difficultly installing the battery.</li>
            <li> It felt awkward to hold, heavy and big.  </li>
            <li> but it does cost very less!</li>
            <li> Even the \\&quot;hormonal\\&quot; oil that surfaces twice a month - before I started using this, during those times, my skin would feel thick, slick and rubbery, like a seal&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> After debating between this and the very costly Clarisonic, I chose the Pro-X and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Too small and too slow.</li>
            <li> It really cleans the skin, gets rid of those awful blackheads that I so hate - mostly.</li>
            <li> A pretty worthless cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> Maybe the cleansing system is not suitable for me.</li>
            <li> I understand that a harsh exfoliator on skin that is prone to breaking out is not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Usually I have to scrub my face at least three times just to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> It works well and hasn&#x27;t broken down on me yet.</li>
            <li> and it seems a little weak</li>
            <li> It seemes a little weak</li>
            <li> I have been on long term steroid therapy combined with winter&#x27;s harsh wind and cold made my facdrier than the Sahara Desert.</li>
            <li> Normally, no matter how well I cleaned my face with a wash cloth, and no matter how expensive the cleanser,  I always wake up with an oily face, so seeing myself in the mirror without any grease at all in the morning feels</li>
            <li> The batteries are a little tough to get out, but there is insturctions on the side of the box.</li>
            <li> Proof you don&#x27;t have to scrub your face raw to get results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet, but it may be helping with the serious wrinkles I have around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Not too hard of bristles</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how hard the brush is until I used the Olay&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The battery cover was hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I work hard</li>
            <li> The battery case was ridiculously hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, it is hard to argue with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The batteries were SO HARD to put in.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s hardly rocket science, so I can&#x27;t complain.     </li>
            <li> downside is: it&#x27;s hard to figure out how to install the batteries</li>
            <li> Mind you, I still have SOME acne breakout every now and then, but hardly any at all since using this skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li> There are no instructions with the product and it is hard to tell whether the batteries go under the gray controls compartment or whether they go in the bottom compartment.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about what a little motorized brush could even do for my skin-</li>
            <li> Using this product too often or pressing too hard with it will probably damage your skin</li>
            <li> Using this product too often or pressing too hard with it will probably damage your skin</li>
            <li> It looses a star for the hard to access battery area and the brush size.</li>
            <li> Finding the battery campartment and actully opening it was th eonly hard part about it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sometimes hard to remove it all.</li>
            <li> When you change it you realize how hard the bristles got after three months.  </li>
            <li> It has a gasket on the inside that makes it hard to replace the batteries, and over repeated battery replacements you would kill the gasket.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people complain the battery gasket will wear out or they&#x27;re hard to replace.</li>
            <li> Then because that hard core is gone, the cleaning can begin.  </li>
            <li> There is no \\&quot;gently\\&quot; about it, you have to work hard to get it</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my skin was looking rather dull and even using salicylic peels and glycolic peels weren&#x27;t helping to exfoliate my skin.  </li>
            <li> you have to try hard to keep this thing</li>
            <li> The brush moves in a circular motion and this seems to aid in cleansing but, for me, in no way makes it hard to control.</li>
            <li> Not a message we see too often in the media, as it&#x27;s hard to make a buck advocating that someone refrain from using a product.  </li>
            <li> Save your hard earned money and purchase this product.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too hard to figure it out.</li>
            <li> It was hard to install batteries in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I no longer have dull leather like skin.</li>
            <li> + gal went from dull to glow in about 1 week.</li>
            <li> I never saw something so hard.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE I PRESS SO HARD.</li>
            <li> , the battery plate is not that hard to remove.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d think it would be hard to avoid your eyes.</li>
            <li> I like this little brush, it does wonders!!</li>
            <li> got this for my little grandaughter and she loves it!!</li>
            <li> it burns a little and is slightly irritating.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this...but ended up disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get something like this product for awhile because I very dry, flaky skin on my face and no matter how much I moisturize, it still flakes and makes my foundation look horrible when applied.</li>
            <li> Bad, because it runs on batteries (you can use rechargeable ones) and the brush head is smaller and a little wobbly.</li>
            <li> I think you need to be a little rough with it - don&#x27;t be afraid its gon</li>
            <li> I have not had any negative side effects from it.  </li>
            <li> At least it cleans well for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> Because of the spinning motion of the brush, it propels itself in unruly spirals around your face that are rather difficult to redirect which gives a similar feeling to being dragged behind a dog on a leash.</li>
            <li> these disposable pads (BAD for enviro &amp; waste of our cash!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my hair totally caught in the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference in my black heads, blemishes, and pores.  </li>
            <li> I will be 40 in August and people still guess me for my late 20s</li>
            <li> The mini exfoliating cleanser sample sucks...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s lasted at least a month.</li>
            <li> I called the # on the box and told them my problem and that I was going to return the product and post a negative review.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and it seems to be a common issue.</li>
            <li> LEAST TWICE A WEEK</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from acne/oily skin.</li>
            <li> One change I made, was to use the brush for at least 1 minute.  </li>
            <li> I just apply some soap to the brush when in the shower and turn this sucker on.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply a lot of pressure when using it, at least that&#x27;s what my dermatologist advised me.</li>
            <li> I think it was bringing up some of the nasty old dirt my face was harboring, despite me washing my face twice daily.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least five of these.  </li>
            <li> Two weeks after using this product two coworkers asked me what i am doing lately on my face - &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m apparently a sucker for marketing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be a sucker for marketing.  </li>
            <li> I found it here for $20, it sells for at least $30 at target &amp; walmart.</li>
            <li> but it totally sucks this happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or at least I was until college</li>
            <li> The disappointment is my lack of experience with these brushed</li>
            <li> I found it a cheaper and comparable (at least, in my opinion) alternative to the Clarisonics.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t wanna splurge on the Clarisonic version before at least testing out this style of cleansing.</li>
            <li> Now, I used this ONCE per day at night, and after EVERY USE I soaked the head in hydrogen peroxide for at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li> (For me at least).</li>
            <li> after the shower so at least I don&#x27;t look like a reanimated mummy or something.</li>
            <li> I do not own a Clarisonic</li>
            <li> (At least a year ago)</li>
            <li> I do not have one negative comment in regards to this device.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews about the speed of the brush; however, I haven&#x27;t had a problem with either speed and use them both.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating my review for this item since I&#x27;ve had it for at least a year now.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this at least 2 yrs ago</li>
            <li> I often find myself confusing the speed button with the power button, but that just may be because I&#x27;m not used to it.</li>
            <li> Design sucks..</li>
            <li> I thought, hey, at least give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> ofr at least 3 years and still going strong,just needed to change batteries once.</li>
            <li> Their warranty sucks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush speed is not spectacular.</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, my skin was not so awful that measuring improvements would have been practicable.  </li>
            <li> Just not effective.</li>
            <li> The product should come with at least 2 brushes.  </li>
            <li> the speeds are slow and turtle</li>
            <li> The speed seems slow even on turbo but after a while, I got used to it.</li>
            <li> It has two speeds, neither of which are too harsh or irritating.  </li>
            <li> Removes dead skin without damaging or irritating your skin.</li>
            <li> machine too slow.</li>
            <li> It has two speeds or you can choose to not turn it on and just manually move it in slow circles on your skin</li>
            <li> This is a medium to slow, rotating brush.</li>
            <li> Just slowly guide it over your face.  </li>
            <li> It was so slow</li>
            <li> but I feel like it moves a bit too slowly</li>
            <li> My acne is slowly drying up and falling off.</li>
            <li> It has two settings slow and one that is a bit faster.</li>
            <li> I thought the speed of the brushes were slow.</li>
            <li> It has two speeds and the highest one is still slow.</li>
            <li> The product  falls apart when you use it and it is too slow.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was broken because I dropped it on the ground a few times.</li>
            <li> I was using one from Avon Cosmetics, but I found it was too harsh for my face &amp; caused broken cappillaries.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have allot of power, battery operated runs a bit slow.</li>
            <li> IT RUNS SLOW</li>
            <li> The worse part was the washing, because it was messy and a lot of work.</li>
            <li> It goes from slow to even slower.</li>
            <li> No, the motor is just designed to be slow.</li>
            <li> My advice would be to start slowly and build up over time.</li>
            <li> it splashes on everything, and keep it from your eyes unless you have them closed really tight, But for the price and convenience one can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Spending a ridiculous amount of money on my disappointing quest to find something, anything that did what it promised and actually WORKED.</li>
            <li> I have used similar products by a different manufactures in the past and have been disappointed in the size, shape, and functionality; but not this one!!</li>
            <li> (I know, I shouldn&#x27;t sleep in my makeup, but I&#x27;m Lazy!)</li>
            <li> At night, I use it in conjunction with my usual cleanser and it WORKS!</li>
            <li> some people who maybe work for this expensive other face brush company are trying to bash olay because it&#x27;s a steal of a price.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;ve used cleansing systems, like proactive and Neutragena,but not one with a battery operated brush.</li>
            <li> So does that mean it&#x27;s like Baby Bear&#x27;s porridge -</li>
            <li> I mean I just got done washing it</li>
            <li> Biggest plus: No more dermatitis!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I was shocked!</li>
            <li> Smells like it is past its expiration date!</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m a little disappointed but only because its not what i was looking for.....</li>
            <li> the device is so small!  </li>
            <li> ......or even a small sponge !</li>
            <li> The difference between this cheaper brand vs the expensive brand is the head on this one rotates and the other ones vibrate.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell NutraSonic, but they have all kinds of Clarisonics and other expensive options.</li>
            <li> it does not have dead skin remover brush!!</li>
            <li> , I mean it&#x27;s passed its 30 day return window...</li>
            <li> They include a small tube of Olay cleanser AND the batteries!  </li>
            <li> No more flakes!</li>
            <li> No more facials needed!</li>
            <li> Was anxiously waiting for it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it will help with acne, but it has eliminated the dullness I would get on my forehead!</li>
            <li> Although I usually like Oil of Olay I did not like this!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now, and have seen a dramatic improvement in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I live in apartment complex and they sent to the wrong building.was very mad about that and hoping it doesn&#x27;t happen with my other things.</li>
            <li> At least it was less expensive than what it&#x27;s priced at the pharmacies.</li>
            <li> it is very small.</li>
            <li> I have been using a very small amount each time.  </li>
            <li> Comes with a very small tube of exfoliating cleanser</li>
            <li> and my face is generally clear :(</li>
            <li> Olay product that you get with the brush kit is very, very small.</li>
            <li> I use a very expensive facial care system twice a day.</li>
            <li> Installing the batteries was a test of patience, but the side of the box, in very small print, gave instructions on how to do so.</li>
            <li> I read countless reviews about different products before purchasing this one and i&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m also a very, very, lazy person.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cleanser is included but very small tube</li>
            <li> One very small brush head</li>
            <li> Is too small wash up tired.</li>
            <li> I used to miss washing my face at night on occasion (lazy, too tired, etc.)</li>
            <li> I used to miss washing my face at night on occasion (lazy, too tired, etc.)</li>
            <li> I later learned that all this stupid thing does is push the dirt down deeper into your skin!  </li>
            <li> I bought it because my face has been extremely dry and flaky because of the cold weather</li>
            <li> when I ordered this - I can feel my face needs some serious exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> I seriously feel like I bought a shake and weight.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything seriously .</li>
            <li> I read reviews of this vs the Sonic and decided to try this less expensive item</li>
            <li> Actually it seems impossible to release the battery cover by hand.</li>
            <li> At the time I was experiencing some serious sinus problems, and found the motion offered by this system helped to relieve some of the pain and pressure.  </li>
            <li> It seriously has changed my face and I wish I had tried this sooner.</li>
            <li> Why spend ridiculous ammount&#x27;s of money when you have</li>
            <li> however I&#x27;m left with acne impossible to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this thing is just pushing dirt around your face.  </li>
            <li> This products works just as well as the expensive model and costs so much less.  </li>
            <li> This product seriously did wonders to my skin</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 minutes, my face felt soooo ridiculously skin.</li>
            <li> so I looked for a less expensive replacement.</li>
            <li> Yes this is less expensive, NO this is not a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a ridiculous scam</li>
            <li> Not sure if the Clairsonic would do the same thing :(</li>
            <li> And the price is ridiculous when you compare it to the Clarion, which is close to 10x</li>
            <li> /&gt;First week, my face got crazy dry and started breaking out.  </li>
            <li> I was seriously considering getting the Clairisonic and opted for this instead.</li>
            <li> I knew I had to get serious and wash my face morning and night then apply my skin care regimens.</li>
            <li> I read all kinds of reviews warning that it would be nearly impossible to get the batteries in and out, but it was very simple and I got the plate off with one try.</li>
            <li> Seriously, we&#x27;re talking about face exfoliating...</li>
            <li> I just knew that device was much less expensive to produce  than $100-plus.</li>
            <li> The device has two speeds slow and just to tad faster than slow!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Changing batteries is difficult because the cap is TOO tight (makes sense tho</li>
            <li> When I did eventually get it off, it was so difficult to pull the batteries out,  they were so tightly wedged in, I was tempted to throw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> This product is waterproof so its understandable that the bottom which contains the batteries would be sealed tight and be slightly difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just found out that I&#x27;ve been using hard water for the past 7 months!!</li>
            <li> I wish the brush twisted a little faster.  </li>
            <li> It seems a little feeble.</li>
            <li> its as simple as using this bad boy once to twice a week</li>
            <li> My bad skin kept coming back.</li>
            <li> This ended up costing something like $17 after the $5 coupon!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been suffering through lots of bad breakouts since I went off and then back on the pill, all in all like 3 years of incessant picking and popping.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the head needs to be replaced every couple months.</li>
            <li> I do not think it is bad product because it is just facial brush</li>
            <li> Within two days of starting to use this product again, I began breaking out badly.</li>
            <li> This product not only removes all my makeup, but has helped reduce the amount of break outs that I get (still have acne, just not quite as bad).</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I could say is that i think should be a cap on the bristles to avoid contact with the bacteria in the environment, why not give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> The actual facewash isn&#x27;t too bad though.</li>
            <li> So not a good solution.  </li>
            <li> evil laugh</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t think the water-tight seal would fail after so few openings.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive ones when you can get this one.</li>
            <li> And no, I wasn&#x27;t using it wrong or too harsh or anything.</li>
            <li> Cream is not good either.</li>
            <li> I just immediately packed it for a trip I was taking and was unable to get batteries for a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 yrs old, hate to admit it too, and I believe this is helping my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and am in between the equally annoying &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;first signs of wrinkles&amp;#34; stages.</li>
            <li> month, my face started breaking out super bad and it made me feel really bad about myself and over time,</li>
            <li> Waste of money ,very poor product .Reaction</li>
            <li> It really sucked and the cleansing pads were just horrible and hard to find to replace.</li>
            <li> The brissels hardly moved!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard to please!</li>
            <li> Product is weak.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to open the battery compartment until I got mad and threw it across the room and it loosened up when it hit the granite countertop.</li>
            <li> Weak in power.</li>
            <li> Motor is too weak.</li>
            <li> I had also tried it on my body but found it too weak.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed, decided to not try a third time.</li>
            <li> My three star rating is here because the product is weak.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so weak.  </li>
            <li> For those people saying that it doesn&#x27;t compare to a Clarisonic…well, duh!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I can find replacement brushes and if I can&#x27;t the item will be useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s weak</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to go to the ridiculously expensive brand, but I&#x27;m not sure what else to do.</li>
            <li> This product works no better than merely using a pair of facial-scrub gloves at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> The motor on the device is too weak.</li>
            <li> i heard some dumb girls saying they spend like $200</li>
            <li> Just use the slow setting to start!</li>
            <li> It is a very slow, weak motor powered by batteries with a flimsy brush.  </li>
            <li> Not very impressive but does sort of work</li>
            <li> Not very impressive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough but it will come off.</li>
            <li> battery compartment is a bit tough.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s not too tough on your skin and it has 2 speeds for your desire.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to try one of these devices as I have very delicate, and aging skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotations of the spinning is just also very slow</li>
            <li> It stops working or starts works very slowly.</li>
            <li> And I admit, it&#x27;s not half bad!</li>
            <li> This works just as well and the batteries are replaceable which is a dirty little secret about the Mia they don&#x27;t tell you.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was having a hard time with random acne</li>
            <li> I, sadly, have clogged pores and work hard to fight them.</li>
            <li> The only body brushes that are reviewed are either quite expensive, Clairsonic or woefully unreliable Nutrisonic--too bad.  </li>
            <li> I have never really had bad skin and not the type to break out all over the face.  </li>
            <li> , the olay pro x  brush however, is too rough on the skin and brushes are not supposed to rotate because it is too agressive and creates micro-tears in your skin where bacteria can form..which explains my painful breakouts.</li>
            <li> my face started looking worse and worse..</li>
            <li> and Im not happy.</li>
            <li> and I think this is the secret, along with the loreal skin genesis serum.   </li>
            <li> I finally used a butter knife to separate the compartment from the base.  </li>
            <li> My skin has visibly improved and breakouts have definitely decreased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become quite addicted to this face cleanser.</li>
            <li> It even gone worse.</li>
            <li> it gets all the dirt that everything else leaves behind.</li>
            <li> and I brush it as per (without irritating it).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This item buffs the skin without irritating it.</li>
            <li> The quantity of my pimples has definitely decreased except I may get 1 or 2.</li>
            <li> The low setting is basically worthless.</li>
            <li> just a poor product.  </li>
            <li> and I found the batteries corroded and item permanently broken...</li>
            <li> so I ignored the poor reviews and ordered the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> so I absolutely looked terrible after a week of use.</li>
            <li> bought the Pro-X because I had to return my broken Clarisonic (they paid postage) and was waiting for them to mail me the replacement.</li>
            <li> I could use it every day without irritating my skin</li>
            <li> Then I noticed my skin was getting worse.  </li>
            <li> so I was confused.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously broken</li>
            <li> I am tired at night with kids, husband, house and job.</li>
            <li> I keep mine in the shower, hooked behind the grip hand</li>
            <li> Meaning you can brush and cleanse your face to your hearts desire without getting a tired arm.</li>
            <li> It just had a thin string looped through it</li>
            <li> My skin broke out again and this time worse than before.</li>
            <li> I felt like an idiot when I realized how simple it was.</li>
            <li> Combined with the brush made it irritating on my skin.</li>
            <li> but i lost a chunk of hair from behind my ear, put up all hair before using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it almost every day since then and my skin looks worse.</li>
            <li> This hurt my face and made my acne worse.  </li>
            <li> I think my daughter is addicted to it.</li>
            <li> To make it worse, I had a test done where I had probes adhered to my face.</li>
            <li> I looked tired all the time.</li>
            <li> and he told me that in 60% of cases, washing makes acne worse.  </li>
            <li> I felt my skin got WORSE.</li>
            <li> Use it about 3 times a day, and &amp;#34;my secret&#x27; I use it once a week with a clay mask, WOW!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive Never experienced  cleansing like this before.</li>
            <li> My imperfections are significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> My issue is time, and money; I am looking for the least expensive way to look like a million bucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It is now broken (even after replacing the batteries).</li>
            <li> i was so confused when i got it.</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced breakouts like others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> This time worse.</li>
            <li> but it worked so well and exfoliated so throughly that it was irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to get this because of the poor reviews I&#x27;ve read on these sorts of scrubber brushes (with the exception of te Clairsonic which is beyond what I can afford) but decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> No matter what batteries you put in it, it still operates poorly.</li>
            <li> I AM ADDICTED TO CLEANING MY FACE NOW.</li>
            <li> I was never happy with how my skin looked with just a washcloth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE POOR BOYS CLEARASONIC.</li>
            <li> but if not, I&#x27;m totally happy with the Olay.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out in years, but this made my skin horrible for approximately 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Just a heads up, this pictures for this product are false.  </li>
            <li> false alarm and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on the expensive ones!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive ones, this one works just as well!</li>
            <li> I was shocked because i exfoliate my face every other day.  </li>
            <li> the things we buy and try because people talk them up is ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> but it seriously feels like a massage for your face!</li>
            <li> That said, the cleanser is really terrible for my particular skin</li>
            <li> I encourage any one with blemishes, acne, dull and tired looking skin, or just dirty pores to try this.</li>
            <li> Seems to loosen up the hairs a bit so that my shaves a slightly less painful.</li>
            <li> Seems to loosen up the hairs a bit so that my shaves a slightly less painful.</li>
            <li> After two months of use I can tell a dramatic difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> So bad that I lived behind cover-ups and foundations everyday.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t a dramatic change.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a dramatic difference in my skin,  </li>
            <li> The round bottom makes that impossible.</li>
            <li> Almost immediately after using this I developed horrible cystic acne worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD!)</li>
            <li> Not good!</li>
            <li> I did get a little frustrated trying to pry</li>
            <li> works well but makes the face a little bit painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not go crazy with this thing and use it every day or press really hard on your skin with the brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not go crazy with this thing and use it every day or press really hard on your skin with the brush.</li>
            <li> feel like some of the negative reviews I have read were by people who used the brush once or twice and seeing no difference stopped using it and threw it away with a scathing review here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it might stop working altogether, like a lot of reviewers complained...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for me, it made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> wet it before use and then sand all the crap outta your face.</li>
            <li> I also am not really enamored with the way the brush sits apart from the base (maybe I received a defective model?).  </li>
            <li> By far the worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember to not use exfoliaters with tiny plastic micro beads, these are very bad for the environment.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this little gizmo.  </li>
            <li> Very weak.</li>
            <li> The spining/movement is very weak</li>
            <li> Very weak power.</li>
            <li> Very weak but still works I guess.</li>
            <li> Very weak, any pressure, at all, will make the brush stop.</li>
            <li> I read about overexfoliating online (after the fact unfortunately) and</li>
            <li> I feel like weird admitting this,</li>
            <li> I considered purchasing an expensive time of cleansing brush but didnt like the thought of spending $100 plus on it, so i decided to go with this one</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to throw anymore money away on expensive face scrubs.</li>
            <li> and boy was I sorry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy the expensive gel that goes with it.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with the Olay Pro-X</li>
            <li> This was way cheaper than all the expensive brands out there, including the ones at the mall.</li>
            <li> but I remember it was EXTREMELY difficult to put the batteries in when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m sorry I bothered with this product.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this product at all.  </li>
            <li> Was not impressed with machine</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong if you choose this item.</li>
            <li> I bought anothe expensive cleaning brush before I got this product.</li>
            <li> WTF</li>
            <li> to the expensive fancy rip off brand.  </li>
            <li> They have not added a ton of features to it and made it annoyingly complicated.</li>
            <li> No need for the expensive brushes to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it till it fails.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Hope someone would correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been tempted by an expensive cleansing system, but decided to try the Olay Pro-X.  </li>
            <li> Now that being said Ill say what this has done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am sorry</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> I like this face scrubber, but I wonder what the really expensive one would be like.  </li>
            <li> I was going to try that one if the Olay failed me.</li>
            <li> But it still works just as well as any of the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> (sorry</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was wary of the exfoliant that came with this cleansing system because it did not list the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Difficult opening to insert batteries,</li>
            <li> but sadly it doesn&#x27;t compare to the Clarisonic for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an unfair review in the sense that I&#x27;ve never had or tried a clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Always wanted one of these brushes, but they were always so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Almost useless?</li>
            <li> This one is useless comparatively.  </li>
            <li> the Clairsonic is way to expensive.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not perfect but let&#x27;s face it</li>
            <li> gory sounding</li>
            <li> but they were either too expensive or not in stock.</li>
            <li> I bought the expensive nose blackhead strips and even did at-home DIY remedies, and</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t like how it was sent to the wrong address.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> I tried to wash my face traditionally and was plagued with awful breakouts for months.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I have troubled skin and always have.</li>
            <li> they are deep &amp; they erupt as horrible looking spots that take a while to heal.</li>
            <li> For under $30, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Boy, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical buying one of these.  </li>
            <li> afford the expensive one.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about my face would feel uncomfortable, but thats not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> and it got twisted around the part where the brush head attaches to the handheld device.</li>
            <li> So sadly, I threw it</li>
            <li> Sadly, I found that it also did nothing for my skin, pores, and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I found that it also did nothing for my skin, pores, and blackheads.</li>
            <li> reviews indicate it is difficult to get the batteries in.</li>
            <li> makes me sorry</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay skin care.</li>
            <li> Just try it for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I read a gazillion reviews comparing this to the expensive Mia one before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the Olay one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was not  wonderful</li>
            <li> To start off, I do not have awful skin besides the occasional zit here</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when looking at the item.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after talking to someone at the Mac counter about their expensive option.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to get one of these but was skeptical .</li>
            <li> I was going to get the expensive one but came across this</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this cleansing brush at all.  </li>
            <li> but the clarisonic is sooooo expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried all sorts of expensive face creams and treatments, and I got no results.  </li>
            <li> so thats weird</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> What is wrong with you people?  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> but, there soo expensive</li>
            <li> I was going to buy an expensive cleansing system and then I read the reviews for this one</li>
            <li> my Mom has the expensive one.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s an absorbable cost if you don&#x27;t like it, but I find that unlikely.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating scrub is expensive as well.</li>
            <li> I had the Clarisonic Mia but was unable to use it and did not want to continue buying brushes.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to buy an expensive face cleaning bush.</li>
            <li> I do think this product is a bit on the expensive side because of its brand name.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> My break-outs seem to be slowed substantially, and I haven&#x27;t had any random skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Or it was to oily leaving me vulnerable to acne whiteheads.</li>
            <li> This made my ance worse!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately cannot afford to buy products like the clarisonic</li>
            <li> It does exfoliate and help remove makeup but its just not excellent.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I fall into the \\&quot;discontinue use\\&quot; category, sadly.</li>
            <li> but it is really expensive.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds silly</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so expensive</li>
            <li> I had one but returned as I felt guilty spending the $ .</li>
            <li> It works just fine-there is nothing wrong with it-I should have added money to the 25.00 gift card I received and bought the cheapest Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> however, the brush heads can be quite expensive to replace every 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical</li>
            <li> Shop for replacement heads online and don&#x27;t buy in store -too expensive.  </li>
            <li> expensive imitations.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I had weird pimples in places that I didn&#x27;t know would surface on my face.  </li>
            <li> i have very tough skin that can take a lot</li>
            <li> I mean bad.</li>
            <li> It is not a good buy or a bad one.  </li>
            <li> what I didn&#x27;t like is, you will get a very small sample of the cleanser which disappointed me.</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t irritated at all after using it -- though I can&#x27;t say I noticed a dramatic transformation either!  </li>
            <li> I did not expect the results to be so dramatic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say I find it quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated I was seriously considering returning it to the store!</li>
            <li> but for some reason my brush head wouldn&#x27;t stay on, which became very annoying but other than that</li>
            <li> So two years ago I saw this really expensive brush that I couldn&#x27;t afford, it like made me mad</li>
            <li> Disappointed by the price cut after i bought it..so not happy..</li>
            <li> Nothing worked and I just accepted that trying to cover those nasty little things up was just going to be a way of life.</li>
            <li> I unfairly gave this a bad one-star review</li>
            <li> even if I washed my face, it still felt dirty and oily.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD AWFUL BREAKOUTS AND STARTED USING THIS EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> I was afraid of anything scrubbing my face</li>
            <li> but the skin on my forehead is peeling crazily since 2 days.</li>
            <li> a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was too weak.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> and my face gets oily, sweaty and dirty.</li>
            <li> the cleanser that comes with it is also made in China and I am afraid to use on my skin.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re crazy.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be scratchy on my skin</li>
            <li> It just scrubs and doesn&#x27;t scratch like I was afraid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a crazy amount for something that I may not care for.  </li>
            <li> I even purchased the brand name replacement heads thinking that maybe I was just using dirty heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted one but afraid to spend the money on it.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Nutrogena Wave and was really unhappy with that.</li>
            <li> Ehh, not too crazy about this product.</li>
            <li> and wow,I didn&#x27;t knw my face was soooo dirty</li>
            <li> Then finish it all off with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> My acne seemed to be deteriorating and I became so frustrated and sad until i used this.</li>
            <li> I have not used the cleaning sample that comes with it yet because I am afraid to use something I have not tried yet.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so I don&#x27;t have a dirty face, so</li>
            <li> skin started to break out like crazy, and I knew I had to do something about</li>
            <li> It always feels awkward.</li>
            <li> i am unhappy about</li>
            <li> Not that crazy about this thing.  </li>
            <li> And I do all sorts of crazy things to my skin with no problems (peels, scrubs,</li>
            <li> Crazy.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m afraid to over use it -</li>
            <li> Nothing to go crazy over,</li>
            <li> Why on earth would anyone buy one of the crazy expensive versions?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of hype surrounding Clarisonic, which is soooo expensive!</li>
            <li> , I, unfortunately was not one of them :(</li>
            <li> I was so sad that it broke :(  </li>
            <li> Sad thing is, I looked today and Amazon is now selling it for under $20 when I bought mine for $25 :(</li>
            <li> I was thinking about getting the expensive cleansing system (I forget the name) but its upwards of $150!  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong fellas!</li>
            <li> It is convenient for traveling, but the full-size bottle is almost as expensive as the brush kit itself!</li>
            <li> Even if any thing goes wrong with the product I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Oh ya and its ridiculously expensive!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I now want to buy the Mia just to see...feel the difference for myself!  </li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> But I hate, hated, hate when I forget to put it back</li>
            <li> but I was so wrong!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> so so so sad :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the cleanser didn&#x27;t agree with me coz after 3 days of using it twice a day, i got pimples popping out all over my face!</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s unpleasant and a bit scary!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical of these kinds of electronics</li>
            <li> Do not hesitate buying this item and saving your money on the very expensive model.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to install batteries.</li>
            <li> I too used another product like this that was VERY expensive.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product after years of wasting money on the Wave where you had to replace face pads each time you cleaned your face, it ended up being wasteful and very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I had a very expensive system and I have to say this Olay cleansing system works just as well.</li>
            <li> The Olay cleaning scrub is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t write a review because the batteries are impossible to install.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying things for around two-three years now because I felt the way my skin feels when it is refreshed and, luckily, it is nt an impossible feeling to obtain.</li>
            <li> Decided to change the batteries, it was almost impossible to get the cover off.</li>
            <li> Also if your hair gets stuck in it it&#x27;ll tangle it up and hurts so bad.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s bad for your skin).</li>
            <li> My face is noticeably clearer and cleaner and it wasn&#x27;t that bad to begin with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad -</li>
            <li> My pores don&#x27;t look too bad either after one use.</li>
            <li> Been looking around to find out if its the brush head that is bad or the device cant hold a brush head.</li>
            <li> My daughter who had bad acne breakouts started using it with her acne cleanser</li>
            <li> My plan is to just watch the bristles and  when they look bad, I will change it.      </li>
            <li> I have not had acne this bad since college.  </li>
            <li> It made me break out badly</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just bad luck.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> and she said my acne was not that bad.</li>
            <li> This is not too bad as you can use rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve got bad skin</li>
            <li> this  badly.</li>
            <li> Not too bad for a cheaper version of the Clearsonic.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t bad either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had acne under my lips on my chin before and after using this, I&#x27;ve gotten acne and redness really bad there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bad as before, so there is improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin was softer, and my breakouts weren&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> I had really bad cystic acne and almost every product broke me out.</li>
            <li> I used the cleanser that came with it,which wasn&#x27;t bad, but once that ran out...</li>
            <li> I bought this to deal with some bad acne problems on my lower face and chin.</li>
            <li> The box says to replace the head in about 3 months which isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> I will give it 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t do anything bad.</li>
            <li> wear makeup religiously--I know, so bad for acne prone skin-</li>
            <li> SO BAD</li>
            <li> MAYBE I got a bad unit, but still, it shouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I have noticed since using this product my break outs aren&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> I am shocked to see that some people did not like this item.</li>
            <li> I was SHOCKED.</li>
            <li> My skin was horrible, irritated and broken out.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t shocked by the results or anything</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends Ivory soap and a baby washcloth which seems to be working just as well without the painful side effects.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked to see my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> and I got those painful cysts.</li>
            <li> and I am shocked at the improvement.  </li>
            <li> I hate a dirty face and have tried all sorts of scrubs and facials.  </li>
            <li> For an Olay product I was shocked....</li>
            <li> so I hated the tedious process of having to remove it all at the end of the day without the guarantee of leaving almost no makeup residue.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> :-(((  </li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> I disappointedly rinsed the brush head &amp; gave the device a shake to release some water from the brush when what else..</li>
            <li> but it got stolen a couple weeks ago while on vacation :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the directions don&#x27;t specifically mention whether you should use this once or twice a day.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Im disappointed.</li>
            <li> and they were disappointed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I feel like this thing is like a glorified spin brush. :(</li>

            <li> Bought this on impulse and I am disappointed.</li>

            <li> Switched them and it still does not turn on.&lt;br /&gt;Majorly disappointed</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the Olay system to be a cheaper alternative to the Clarisonic, you will be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the bristles had a brown tinge to them :( .</li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I think I could get a cleaner face by using a wash cloth and cleanser :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed however.</li>
            <li> BUT i feel it is aggravating my skill and making me break out &#x3D;(.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> So  at this moment I&#x27;m disappointed ,  but I&#x27;ll give it  </li>
            <li> I was not &amp;#34;blown away&amp;#34; with this item, but then, neither was I blatantly disappointed with it, either.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I was severely disappointed.</li>
            <li> My face still feels dirty!  </li>
            <li> disappointed in Olay for this product.</li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed in the size of the tube of cleanser.</li>
            <li> so I was highly disappointed when it did not work like everyone said it would.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this Pro-X brush.</li>
            <li> I told the customer rep that at the very least they should have a label on the box pointing to where the battery compartment is so that you know what you&#x27;re trying to get off!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> That having been said, it was a poor choice on my part!!!  </li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t broken out since!!!</li>
            <li> I feel stupid for buying this.</li>
            <li> It was really annoying.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I don&#x27;t like having to recharge my Clarisonic, I hate power cords hanging all over.  </li>
            <li> I anticipate that unless you were to violently press this against your skin, the motor will not stall.    </li>
            <li> (I hate waiting to see fabulouslness emerge).</li>
            <li> I hate this.</li>
            <li> I hate washing my face</li>
            <li> hate that this product is being compared to the clarisonic</li>
            <li> I feel like this is nearly worthless</li>
            <li> It always tends to pull and tug on the skin in an annoying way when brushing in a circular fashion, almost like it catches the skin.</li>
            <li> I guess this may have been because it was digging out all the crap that had been in my skin</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate this product</li>
            <li> hate to admit it</li>
            <li> However, I hated Sirius Sonic Skin Care System.</li>
            <li> even if I hated it/it broke/</li>
            <li> But my skin hated this tool.</li>
            <li> I hated this.</li>
            <li> When I turned it on though, I felt somewhat fearful that this may not work out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Thank you, because washing my face with my hands wasn&#x27;t cutting it, I was leaving a lot of makeup and dirt stuck in my pours!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed.    </li>
            <li> Received item but did not work very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this item.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> My sister also tried this product and she too got terrible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin is still problematic but I do not experience the awful flakiness that perpetuated my problem skin!</li>
            <li> I am a terrible skeptic.</li>
            <li> It helped me get over one of the worst breakouts I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It made my face break out terribly.</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t use it for a while, and then when I picked it up again, it appeared to have two colors of mold on the brush section, at the base of the bristles!  </li>
            <li> I got the worst case of Acne Mechanica from this rotating brush.  </li>
            <li> im not laughing very disgusting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful!  </li>
            <li> My face broke out horribly</li>
            <li> and I hate the pores on my nose!  </li>
            <li> and I miss it terribly if I go somewhere and don&#x27;t bring it.</li>
            <li> Before, I was suffering from horrible cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> I was having awful acne on my chest , cheeks, forehead....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see them, but I can feel them and it drives me insane.</li>
            <li> Well, my face is horrible!</li>
            <li> I look horrible!</li>
            <li> Take this from someone who has horribly oily skin:?</li>
            <li> The face wash that comes with this is equally awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this! My skin has cleared up in only a week thanks to this handy tool.</li>
            <li> Great scrubber...soft, but cleans deep into your pores.</li>
            <li> Works well. Received in Avery timely fashion!</li>
            <li> This is really good product</li>
            <li> I love it, but it&#x27;s a little harsh for my older skin, so I use it maybe once every 2 or 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great for using once or twice a week, be careful not to over-exfoliate as it will exacerbate any trouble spots. Overall very glad I purchased this instead of a much more expensive Clarisonic. For the record, I bought this over a year ago and it is still holding up.</li>
            <li> Used it for a week and did not notice much of a difference between the brush and just using my hands and an exfoliant. It does feel really nice on the face and the brush is soft, I have never tried a Clarasonic so not sure how it stands up. I used the Olay exfoliator that came with it once and then stopped as I have really sensitive skin and it seemed a bit drying. I just used my Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant with it and it seemed okay, but no better or worse than the regular old own-two-hands method, which can cover a much larger area making the face-washing process a lot quicker. Maybe you need to stick with it longer to see any noticeable results? I don&#x27;t have acne but have always had issues with small bumps along my jawline and more recently, randomly on my forehead. In the past I have had great results with glycolic peels but they can be expensive and I was looking for a cheaper exfoliating alternative. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t have the power needed to make a difference in my particular case. For the price it was worth a try, maybe it will work for you.</li>
            <li> good for its price, if it is provided with a lithium battery it would have been better</li>
            <li> sux specially if you have the clarisonic like i do. i bought this bc i left my clarisonic at my other house and I just needed something to hold me over until then. Also if your hair gets stuck in it it&#x27;ll tangle it up and hurts so bad.</li>
            <li> Tried multiple batteries and did not turn on. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> We bought one in a store and after 3 years it finally died.  I haven&#x27;t tried the expensive brushes but this this thing is incredible.  It has two speeds and the brushes are surprisingly soft.  Best thing to have in the shower after a long day.</li>
            <li> Really nice feeling!! Since it is much cheaper than other similar products, it is really a good deal!</li>
            <li> I researched this product before buying it, even to the point of watching several videos on you tube comparing it to the much pricier Clarisonic Mia 2. This product is small, lightweight, and fits nicely in your hand to operate. It is extremely gentle on your face; it feels like feathers on your skin, especially gentle on the sensitive skin around your eyes.  I don&#x27;t care for the Olay Cleanser that was enclosed, so I have been using it with a drop of anti-aging body wash or even Noxema for a gentle massage and clean.  I wish the unit was even bigger so I could use it on other areas of the body.  This is a well designed product that I like so much I am thinking of getting one for my daughter and another for her mother-in-law! I saw the same unit on sale at CVS for $29.99, so getting it from Amazon for $18.99 (after applying a $3.00 coupon which they provided!) was a steal. This product was definitely worth the price and I highly recommend it.  It did cause a breakout on my chin the 2nd week of use (haven&#x27;t had a pimple in many years! ) but this is a common side effect due to my skin not used to being thoroughly cleaned and massaged like this. Nothing has happened since, and it cleared up in a few days.</li>
            <li> Love this. For the price, it does everything I need it to do.</li>
            <li> This works ok,my fave is too sensitive for this though, makes my skin sore to touch and raw.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to tey the clearsonic,  because so many people rave about the product.  But i always thought olay catered to more gentle youthful skin, so i came across the pro x and decided to five it a try........LOVE IT!!!!!! Good thing i tried it. Cleans my face like nothing else. I would say to anyone who wants to try one of these cleansing system without spending alot of money on clearsonic, go ahead and try the Pro X</li>
            <li> It was fine. I expected higher speed.</li>
            <li> I actually liked the way this worked on my skin, but it died after 6 weeks of use. Junk. I will invest in something that will last longer this time (but just in case . . .  I&#x27;m keeping the box &amp; all the packing).</li>
            <li> I ended up out of town unexpectedly, without my Clarisonic. I order this one on Amazon as a stop gap, and being a Prime member, it arrived promptly in two days. Batteries went in easily (contrary to another review), BUT I couldn&#x27;t get the brush head to snap on. I called the company, and the representative was very nice. Still, she couldn&#x27;t do much more than read the directions. After a certain amount of (unsuccessful) discussion, she said she could mail me a coupon within the next 2-3 weeks to buy another one locally. Not only am I out in the middle of nowhere, but I&#x27;m not going to be out of town that long. So not a good solution.  I did get this brush to work, though the brush head wasn&#x27;t totally snapped on. If it works like this when snapped on properly (and I expect it does, it could just come off more easily), then I would say it doesn&#x27;t do any more than a soft face brush that you could use manually. Get yourself a Clarisonic already. Its only problem, imo, is that the brush heads have to be replaced every 3 months, unless you figure out a way to keep them disinfected--there are some diy tips about that on the web, btw.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skins is a little smoother, but other than that cant tell any difference.  Not much exfoliating from what I can see.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fantastic!  I love this product.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said it is too rough to use and really isn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> I love this product the first time I used it my face was brighter and smoother. I&#x27;m 4 days in and see a huge difference. Not to mention I just feel cleaner after I use it. I truly believe or gives you that deep down clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Combination skin, break out prone.</li>
            <li> This really does make your pores look smaller. Your face looks so clean after you use it and it actually tingles.</li>
            <li> Love this facial brush!</li>
            <li> Grandson happy so I am also a happy camper</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I wanted to have something that would help to clean my skin better-a deeper cleaning.  With this product, I was able to get that!</li>
            <li> Love this brush I use it with my favorite gel or foaming cleanser...really cleans your pores well</li>
            <li> I love this product. While it is not like a deep microdermabrasion, consistent use will definitely yield results that I could not get outside of a Dr’s office. I use it every day, then I put on my moisturizer and Vitamin C serum [[ASIN:B00VXE0EEY Skingenixx VITAMIN C SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]], and my skin is flawless.</li>
            <li> I  love  the  brush and  that  it has more  than  one  speed. I  just  wish  it came with other attachments  like  a  body  brush  and  pumice  brush. I  recommend  this  product.</li>
            <li> Good price for a name-brand facial brush that is gentle on the face and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Smaller that expected but it&#x27;s okay... It works great!</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and decided to give it a try because for the low price, I had little to lose. Product arrived on time. Never really paid attention to the lotion/soap/whatever as the item I wanted was the brush.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought Sirius Sonic Skin Care System, because I wanted blows and whistles at a cheaper than Clarisonic price. However, I hated Sirius Sonic Skin Care System. It doesn&#x27;t do half the functions described. I bought this one instead; it does only one function - cleanses, and it does it nicely, rotating at 2 speeds. That&#x27;s all I need from a cleansing brush. Great product at a very modest price.</li>
            <li> This product works well for me.  I have combination/oily skin, with a mixed race background, and am 30 years old.  I have been breaking out my whole life and have tried every single thing on the planet to balance my facial skin and make my pores smaller, from just plain water or a rag with soap all the way to an acne system.  I just think that our skin is advancing with our diversity and so should the way we wash and handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Olay brush for two months now, once a day before bed with an acne wash, and I can say that my skin has not felt this good since before puberty hit.  I still break out a little, but now the acne goes away so quickly and without too many extra harsh chemicals used afterwards.  My pores are visibly smaller.  My mother, a natural redhead with bright green eyes, was sitting next to me and told me how beautiful the pores on the side of my face looked, and immediately demanded I buy her a brush.  She now uses it and is also pleased with how soft her 54 year old skin feels.  I recommended this brush to my cousin who has similar genetic makeup as I, recently.  She came by last week and said she doesn&#x27;t know how she lived this long without it (so dramatic at age 20).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like some of the negative reviews I have read were by people who used the brush once or twice and seeing no difference stopped using it and threw it away with a scathing review here.  It urged me to add my success story to the growing list.  You have to use the brush everyday, for a period of time to really see a difference. It doesn&#x27;t magically make your skin over in one or two uses, but it does cleanse deeper than your fingers.  It also matters what you do after you cleanse.  Do you use toner to remove excess cleanser?  Do you use appropriate moisturizers and creams for your skin type?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this brush for any type of woman, of any age. Or anyone with problem skin for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your time, if you&#x27;ve read this far! :)read this far! :)</li>
            <li> This is the best thing that I have ever used on my face. It has the greatest ability of getting my pores clean and removes more dirt from my face better than anything else. I recommend  this to anyone and everyone. It feels as though you are cleansing your face with clouds. The cleansing brush for this is so soft. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is better than washing your face with just your fingers/ wash cloth, but it doesn&#x27;t stand a chance in comparison to the clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li> I love this, it&#x27;s a very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Great at cleaning your skin without stripping it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week now but I could feel a difference after the first few times using it. Its not a miracle brush but its a wonderful addition to your routine. I wasn&#x27;t planning on using the cleanser it came with but ended up trying it &amp; I&#x27;m planning on buying more. Makes your skin softer &amp; brighter. I suggest using their cleanser &amp; follow up with your regular cleanser if you are using it to help with acne.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! Even I&#x27;d you don&#x27;t use the microderm cleanser and just use your every day facewash it makes washing your face so much easier!</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who cannot seem to stop blackheads from coming back.  Noticed a difference after first use.  WOULD definitely recommend for anyone who wants cleaner skin.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by this product. The head was small and rotated without vibrating. I prefer my friend&#x27;s ProActive electric face cleaner. Also, mine didn&#x27;t come with the face wash.</li>
            <li> the device is good and the price is amazing, however watch out for some rash that may occur if used wrong or roughly.</li>
            <li> The brush is gentle on your skin. You face really felts soft and clean after using it. When my Olay face cleanser that goes vwith the brush is finished, I use any regular face scrub until I replenish my stock.&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> The key to clear and healthy skin? Keeping it SANITARY. Yes many acne products contribute but in the end, keeping it clean is the most essential component of having great skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m 19, female, and don&#x27;t have acne anymore but I get occasional pimples on my forehead that aren&#x27;t visible but can be felt (like little bumps everywhere). It was really annoying. I don&#x27;t use any special products, just a plain facial scrub from St. Ives and the Olay Exfoliating scrub. Here&#x27;s fingers v.s. Olay Pro-X Scrub:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fingers/Manual:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin dries out a lot, skin stings from the scrub, acne still appears occasionally, skin feels rough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay Pro-X:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG. OMG. I had no idea. Absolutely smooth skin, cleans out pores so much better than my own fingers can, leaves skin moist!! &amp;lt;--my favorite effect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is now fresh, clean, and moist everytime I wash my face. I get the most satisfaction when I&#x27;m applying foundation because now it&#x27;s so smooth and glowing so my make up blends into my skin and gives it a smoother finish.</li>
            <li> I had considered buying a more expensive model, but glad I bought this one. I have received a lot of compliments on my skin since using. I will say, my face has started breaking out more, but my dermatologist said that is to be expected as my akin adjusts.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be similar to the Clarisonic...but it wasn&#x27;t even close.  I was taken in by all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try...I was disappointed and I&#x27;m returning the product (cost wise, with shipping, I&#x27;ll receive hardly anything back, but I would just throw it away otherwise).  The cleaner came with two batteries...both batteries in my kit were expired (over 6 months ago).  I replaced the batteries hoping to increase the rotation speed, but it didn&#x27;t make a difference.  Personally, just rubbing the soft brush with the power off across your face did a better job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in this type of product, I&#x27;d highly recommend saving up and buying the Clarisonic...it does cost 5x the the Olay Cleaning system, but it&#x27;s well worth the price...your skin will feel much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed...I had high hopes for this...but ended up disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 4 months ago off of Amazon. This Olay Cleansing System is truly a great product, I use it several times a week! The product itself is lightweight, and visually appealing. It has adjustable speed, spins in circular motion and has long lasting batteries. I have used similar products by a different manufactures in the past and have been disappointed in the size, shape, and functionality; but not this one!! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love it. Cheap and good. It is value for money. The price is much lower than supermarkets. A very useful machine.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for each of my girls.  Both are young adults.  The price of this was beyond belief compared to all the same type of products on the market.  Both my girls love it.  It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed todo, but at 75% the purchase price.  Really?  Really!  Skip the high price cleansing units and go Olay!</li>
            <li> Be very careful when using this. I overexfoliated and now have to wait for my skin to repair itself. Reviews for this product are very good so I&#x27;m sure once I don&#x27;t go overbaord It&#x27;ll be great. I used Dermalogica exfoliating stuff together with this brush and I used it daily and now my skin is raw, full of acne that is emerging, red and blotchy. I read about overexfoliating online (after the fact unfortunately) and now I know I really overdid it!&lt;br /&gt;I will now start using this with just water (it came with stuff but I only use dermalogica products on my face) and I will not exfoliate daily.&lt;br /&gt;I will try and update this review in a few weeks/months to let you know how I&#x27;m doing when not overdoing it! :-)</li>
            <li> Works as intended - great price and quality.</li>
            <li> absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;was surprised to see how small the cleaning soap was but was very happy with brush. cleans my face like magic. since i started using, i&#x27;m having much less black heads. wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of quality brush... but i have been using everyday for a month now and the brush still looks new. i also started using this with another cleanser, Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub and it works great.</li>
            <li> I really like the cleansing brush.  The Pro-X exfoliating cleanser was ok but I prefer Clinique&#x27;s 7-day scrub cream.  However the brush works very well with any cleanser.  I also use it with a mild facial soap.  It is gentle enough to not irritate my sensitive skin but it really seems to deep clean quite well.</li>
            <li> I love this system...I use it for daily cleansing as well as exfoliating.  Getting older is hell...but this tool is helping me in COMBAT!! Im going commando on these wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I wish someone could tell me why there are similar products out there for $100+. This does what they do...so I don&#x27;t get it. Look good for less! Very gentle on my skin. Quiet motor and a nice soft brush. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of hype surrounding Clarisonic, which is soooo expensive! I decided this would be a better deal...since it&#x27;s about a tenth the price of Clarisonic&#x27;s brushes. It works great and makes my skin feel soft and nice ( I have rough spots from acne). And it helps fade my acne scars because of how well it exfoliates. I feel like it&#x27;s gentle enough to use once a day, but for sensitive skin I&#x27;d advise every other day or once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Really does a great job in cleaning your skin. i use it before going to bed and noticed my skin looking a lot better in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this product. It gets my face so clean and so soft. I immediately ordered a second one as a gift for my aunt.</li>
            <li> you really need it if you want to get your facial cleaning on the right way.&lt;br /&gt;it is not expensive as well.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine. It does a great job of removing makeup. I would recommend this to anyone especially if you have problem skin.</li>
            <li> This product is a great exfoliant! I&#x27;ve been using it for two days and I already seen a difference in my skin! And it also came with an extra brush head so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times since I bought it and I love it, it leaves my skin super super clean as if I just had a facial, I really recommend it. The price is perfect and it really works</li>
            <li> I have used it several times. Haven&#x27;t seen any change on my skin. Maybe it does not work on me.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this cleansing system.  While I am unfamiliar with the exact features of the other more expensive brands, this is perfect for what I wanted.  I feel it does a great job at cleansing my face.  I have the Neotrogena exfoliating hand heald cleanser I use 1x/week.  I use this one for my daily cleansing.</li>
            <li> The soaps get stuck on the cleaner and the brush is harsh on my face. And I don&#x27;t even have a sensitive skin. Never used other facial brushes, so cannot compared to them.</li>
            <li> It  was too rough for my face, I sill use wash rag to properly wash my face. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s (29), and out of no where I started breaking out on my face, mainly my forehead. I purchased this thinking it was probably due to oil and dirt and getting older, since I have never had issues before. The first week I used this my face got worse! But after that, my face is almost flawless and it feels really soft. I would have given it 5 stars because I feel it could be &amp;#34;beefed&amp;#34; up a bit, but then it wouldn&#x27;t be $20! For the price, this is an amazing product. I can&#x27;t compare it to a $200 one, but I have seen a complete difference in my complexion...and I only wash my face in the morning (I know, I shouldn&#x27;t sleep in my makeup, but I&#x27;m Lazy!)</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! Works great!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the wash they sent but my face feels so smooth and buttery soft when I use this thing!  I am not sure if I should use it every day or not as I also use Retin-A, but using it has definitely cut down on my acne.  I feel like weird admitting this, but I get botox for the lines in between my eyebrows every 6-7 months and every time I go my lady says how great my skin is, so if a dermatologist says it...</li>
            <li> My face feel very clean after using it. Black head all removed easily and my T zone not as oily as before.</li>
            <li> THIS FACIAL BRUSH IS SUCH AN AWESOME DEAL!!!  YOU PAY MUCH MORE IN THE STORES AND OTHER ONES DOESN&#x27;T WORK AS WELL!! FOR EXAMPLE, I ORDER ONE FROM PROACTIV AND THE BRUSH ONLY VIBRATES!!!  :-(((  THE BRUSH DOES NOT CLEANSE YOUR SKIN UNLESS YOU DO ALL THE WORK.  THE OLAY PRO-X  DO ALL THE WORK FOR YOU. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> The thing is very good and easy to use. Excellent and marvelous service good job.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very very much.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and at first it didn&#x27;t work!! I was pissed...i even found this strange residue like oil in the battery compartment so cleaned it up using a Q-tip and used a blow dryer to kind of dry this residue i even changed the battery just in case and IT WORKED. It is a kind of weak but it does the job for cleaning your face. Good for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I am a male a manly male and I always make sure to hide this thing in my shower when I have company over but man... this thing works wonders.  I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.  My only critic is the amount of cleanser it came with was small but a quick trip to the pharmacy fixed that.  My skin has never looked better and nobody will ever know my secret!</li>
            <li> So, I bought my Pro-X and Wal-Mart and it&#x27;s cheaper than I have seen online.&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you are considering this over the Clarsonic, I have to say I love this!&lt;br /&gt;I used the Clarsonic when it was first popular, a few years back. I didn&#x27;t like it because you could only hold it and wash your face for 20 seconds, in each spot. I NEVER felt a deep clean with it.&lt;br /&gt;Last month, my face started breaking out super bad and it made me feel really bad about myself and over time, even if I washed my face, it still felt dirty and oily. So, after some research on the Pro X, I decided to try it and if I didn&#x27;t like it, I could return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s been almost a month, and long story short, I LOVE IT. You should get it if you are considering this over the Clarsonic. Don&#x27;t over wash or scrub your face. My pores have become so small, my face feels clean, my black heads are literally almost gone and my skin is even and so bright!!!! I feel so much better in my own skin! GET IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are wanting a gentle electrical brush for your face.  I was a bit worried, but tried it out immediately upon arrival.  It feels great on my face which I consider it to be sensitive since I have Rosacea.  I feel and see the difference after using this electric brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this one and the CVS one, both are identical so if you want to save money go to cvs and get their brand.  It was a good purchase though and does come with a cleanser.</li>
            <li> The brush is ok. Not too hard of bristles and it feels good! Definitely not the expensive one the way it works but its ok. The face cream they give you is good for a few days but for a sample its nice. I use my own cleanser with this. I like it for now considering my budget!</li>
            <li> I really really do like this product. I bought it about a year or so ago and used it on high and it irritated my skin. Then I saw a segment on Dr. Oz...you should use it on LOW speed. It&#x27;s exfoliating and makes you wonder how you ever washed your face without it before. Say goodbye to all your facial scrubs!! Use this with your regular cleanser. This product is really good for the price. I used it every other day or so. Too abbrassive to use everyday. And I have oily skin. Easily blemished. This helped out a alot.&lt;br /&gt;Since I love it so much I invested in the Clarisonic Pro....and I L-O-V-E my Clarisonic Pro. Honestly, it is the BEST beauty purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. TThe Clarisonic vibrates and I feel like I get to have a 1-minute facial EVERYDAY. It&#x27;s awesome and you can use it everyday. The Olay doesn&#x27;t vibrate but spins (duh) and removes dead skin...that said, BE GENTLE and use it on Low.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend $$$....get this one. It&#x27;s absolutely a steal. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I have always wanted one but never did anything about it until 3 weeks ago.  Even at age 66 my face looks brighter, smoother and is softer, and I have only been using it for two weeks!  I&#x27;m not sure yet, but it may be helping with the serious wrinkles I have around my mouth.  I &#x27;think&#x27; they look a little bit smoothed out.  Instead of the cleanser that comes with the brush (it&#x27;s a bit grainy and I think may eventually irritate my chin area) I prefer to spread Noxema on my face and then use the brush.  My face has never felt better!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love what this product has been doing to my skin. I suffer from sensitive, acne-prone, dry skin and I cannot get over how much my skin has improved just from using it for one week. I am shocked to see that some people did not like this item. Anyway, here is how I have been using it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I wash my face with Olay&#x27;s Sensitive skin foaming face wash to take off all my make-up and rinse everything off.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I lather up the face wash for a second time and massage it onto my face. After that, I use the Cleansing System and massage my face with it for One minute (as suggested on the directions). As soon as I am done rinsing my face my face always feels like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;I follow this routine every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am so amazed about is how much other products improve when I use them as treatments, moisturizers, ect. For instance, I use Avon&#x27;s Glycolic Acid peel and after just one time of using it I felt that it worked 10X better than it ever has. The cleansing System takes off all the dead skin cells and makes your skin act like an empty canvas. I feel like the glycolic peel was able to do its job much better as well as my moisturizers.I also apply Aloe Vera gel to my skin and that has been working a lot better as well. When I put my make-up I feel like my face has a natural glow instead of the cakey face that I had before I started using the cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my skin has improved dramatically. I feel like my pores can breath now and my scars are dramatically diminishing. Thank you Olay for another great product! I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I buy it. It is easy to use and wash my face really comfortable and clean</li>
            <li> Have not used the more expensive counterpart, so cannot compare this to other similar items. This little beauty does a good job though. It leaves your skin smooth and bright. Is not expensive, waterproof so you can leave it/use it in the shower, and is ready to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I don’t feel like this brush works any better than my hands. I feel my skin cleaner when I rub it in circular motion with my finger tips and my regular exfoliant cream. I would NOT recommend this product. really a waste of money</li>
            <li> Be sure to recommend this kind of cleaning device. Can put the face to get rid of excess cutin, I use two times a week now, each time finished face is exquisite and smooth, combined with the mask, the next day, feel the skin look brand-new</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with this product - have given several as gifts. Especially good for older delicate skin. Quick results - very happy with it but I do not use it daily - just twice a week is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> The product itself is nice. I am not sure if my skin is brighter like the box stated. Overall I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Brush is too soft and a bit small, I upgraded to a Clarisonic Mia.  The tool uses batteries and is water resistant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skincare nut and shell out top dollars for high end cleansers but never felt the need for a cleansing brush - wrote it off as a lazy-man&#x27;s device...what, you can&#x27;t manually scrub your face for 2 minutes each day?! I came in here looking to check out Olay&#x27;s Va Va Voom cleansing system, and instead found this little gem! For 20 bucks with a 3 dollar discount coupon, it was a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early 30s with oily skin. Have periods of time when I get \\&quot;You&#x27;re glowing\\&quot; and other times when its sallow and lifeless or extra greasy with open pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened up the kit, I was kinda disappointed that the brush head bristles were so soft - Thought what the hell is this little head going to clean that I cant get out of my washcloth. Maybe its supposed to be this \\&quot;soft\\&quot; - remember this is your face we&#x27;re talking about, not a kettle pot. Plus with the rotating motion of the brush, I feel you&#x27;re getting a good CLEANSING action (maybe not enough exfoliating...if you&#x27;re like me and used to more abrasive exfoliants)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the brush with the sample cleanser provided and you really feel you&#x27;re getting a face massage or facial. Its just another level of cleansing - better, more thorough, and able to reach that tricky corner where your nose meets your face. I felt cleaner and more refreshed after one time with this brush than I have in years. You do need to be careful about using it too close to the under-eye area as it can feel like its tugging or pulling on that gentle skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this kit is - like the other reviewers said - the battery compartment and how difficult it is to get that thing to open for the first time. Believe me, I read all the pointers about \\&quot;gently rocking it from side to side\\&quot; and even watched videos of how to install batteries in this thing...yet, NOTHING! Just when I was almost in tears and ready to give up, boom, it comes open. And once it was open, the second and third time I tried opening and closing it, it opened up really easily with no problem at all. I think you need to be a little rough with it - don&#x27;t be afraid its gonna break or crack open (even if its made in China). And persevere through the first time. It gets easier the next time round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser sample is good but nothing special, so I am glad I didn&#x27;t buy the other version of this kit with the full size cleanser - Instead invest that money and buy yourself some replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been a week since using this nifty gadget (on and off with the Olay cleanser). I use it twice a day - morning on the low setting and before going to be on the high and then layer on a thick moisturizer. Am happy to report my pores are smaller, skin is smoother than ever, and skin is definitely back in the \\&quot;you&#x27;re glowing\\&quot; category. Thanks so much, Olay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended! Try it - you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised! Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> This item lived up to the hype of the ads. My skin is cleaner and smoother than it has been in ages.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night. I love the way my skin feels after I use it. I have VERY sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t irritate me at all. So glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I love it, and clean face very well. The price is very reasonable with this price compared to other expensive brands. This does a good job to clean and massage face.</li>
            <li> I love the unit..glad I have it..I do wish it was more advanced..or a little more power..but it is good for the money..</li>
            <li> My skin can be acne prone, and I use this cleansing brush with a acne face wash and it has diminished my acne by almost 100%. I have had only 2-3 small zits since buying this and the cleansing brush clears them up quickly. My acne scars are becoming lighter and smaller. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this cleansing brush.  I considered purchasing an expensive time of cleansing brush but didnt like the thought of spending $100 plus on it, so i decided to go with this one and I&#x27;m glad i did!  i&#x27;ve only owned this for two month and my skin already looks much healthier then before.  I always had my problem areas and after using this they&#x27;ve seem to disapear.  I am very happy with my skin now.  I have not used the sample tube of the cleanser that came with this.  This review is only for the cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I bought this...friend has one and raved about it but I think hers is a much better product.  I have good skin and use a apricot scrub daily and I think it does a better job than this does. It feels good after I use it but can&#x27;t tell much difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really good after using this system and I would recommend it.  It was cheaper than in some stores.</li>
            <li> The cleaning head is small. I would say a bit bigger than a quarter. Its a joke to try to wash your face. Its battery powered and doesn&#x27;t last long.  Just go buy a Mia if you want something like this. They are worth it and stay charged a lot longer.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I&#x27;d thought a long time about purchasing one of the expensive models, but I seriously doubt it would clean better than this does. I purchased one for my mom and daughter for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Does a very good job. I can see a difference each time I use it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and uses it every day!</li>
            <li> This does not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I got an unbelievably low price, so I purchased two of these for gifts for my daughters. These sell for 2 1/2 times more in the store!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something like this but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $200 on the other brand when I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.  For $30 I can take a bit of a chance.  I have been using this brush since Christmas Eve and I am amazed at how much better my skin looks.  At 56, zits and clogged pores that just dodn&#x27;t want to go away are pretty much on the mend.  Imbedded black heads have disappeared.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this more than once a day because it tends to dry out my skin.  Hydrate after you use this.  In short, I&#x27;m really glad I bought this cleaning system.  A little instruction about how often to change the brush head would be nice, but I can live without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have been paying a lot more attention to my skin regime in the past year.  I use the Olay Regenerist lotions and cleansers, as well as the Olay Microdermabrasion Kit.  I have normal to oily skin and have been using this Pro-X cleansing system for about a week.  So far, I love it.  The brush action more gentle than anticipated but that&#x27;s a good thing--I don&#x27;t think my skin could handle something more harsh.  Prior to using this system, I would moisturize after a regular cleaning and would have that greasy shine after my night moisturizer.  With this, my lotion is completely absorbed and the skin feels so healthy and soft!  I use this 5 days/week, once per day.  The other 2 days I use the [[ASIN:B000F63TW0 Olay Regenerist MicroDermabrasion and Peel Kit]].  Really happy with this routine!</li>
            <li> I debated about purchasing this because I&#x27;m pretty disciplined with my established skin care regime, but using the cleansing system is like a trip to the spa (without the expense). I have noticed that my skin looks even better than it did before. I&#x27;m a 56 year young woman and dedicated anti-wrinkle warrior with sensitive skin, so I use the Pro-X Exfoliating Cleanser every 2-3 days to avoid irritation, but so far I&#x27;m happy with the results!</li>
            <li> This is a surprisingly effective device for facial cleansing.  I selected this for my wife but I&#x27;ve ended up being its primary user.  It&#x27;s funny because the bristles are quite soft and the speed it spins isn&#x27;t really that fast.  Basically, you don&#x27;t feel anything happening but when you&#x27;re done, your face feels markedly smoother!  Cool device.</li>
            <li> Works like it should - for the price a good deal.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m sure this product is meant to be used for microdermabrasion--anti aging stuff, but for me, this is FINALLY a solution to a life-long battle with clogged pores. I always thought that at some point my age would cause a shift in my oily skin and I&#x27;d stop having to battle blackheads and breakouts, but this wasn&#x27;t in the cards for me. The good thing about an oilier complexion is my skin is younger looking than most of my contemporaries (thanks Arbonne too!), but the bad thing is enlarging pores and ongoing battles with clogged pores. Biore strips (forget it!), scrubs, masques, on and on. What is working the BEST of everything (including ProActive) is this little brush and a mild cleanser. No more going after my pores causing redness and scarring. I use this twice a day and my pores are clear and SHRINKING! Woo hoo!! The other thing I use is Origins facial micordermabrasion scrub, Modern Friction. I have the clearest complexion of my life and my skin is getting more youthful all the time. I can&#x27;t give this brush all the credit for youthful skin waaaaaay after 40. But add this to an anti-aging skin care line that works for you (Arbonne RE9 for me) and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased. I LOVE that this is waterproof. Although I use mine at the sink, it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s not going to burn out because it got wet. Highly recommended. Also, a great exfoliating scrub with good lotions (Arbonne again, folks) would prevent the need for a big old machine that goes into the shower to sand the skin as this product is being compared to--yikes that sounds like a lot of work and maybe even dangerous!</li>
            <li> Being over Fourty, you can imagine how many gadgets, creams, potions and promises I have tried. Spending a ridiculous amount of money on my disappointing quest to find something, anything that did what it promised and actually WORKED. Seeing the Pro X Cleansing Brush in an add in one of my magazines, I came on-line to see if it was anything like it&#x27;s other counterparts. Thrilled about the price. (not $150.00 like it&#x27;s competition charges) I figured I had nothing to loose. I have always trusted the Olay brand. After all. My Mother has used Oil of Olay for 50 years and looks amazing. I should have listened to her when I was 16. But as women do, we get sucked in by &#x27;the next great product guaranteeing the Fountain of Youth&#x27;  I&#x27;m happy to say...my journey has ended. In a short week I have seen such a huge difference in the condition of my skin. It&#x27;s so incredibly soft. My Complexion is even and I&#x27;m starting to see the fine line DISAPPEAR. I have even gotten complements from friends, asking me what I have done different. And I&#x27;m happy to tell both them and all of you. This is your miracle. One more thing. I have to add that the exfoliating cleanser sample that os supplied is unbelievable. It&#x27;s the combination of the two product that make this the best Cleansing System Ever. I&#x27;m back to order some of the moisturizers. I have high hopes for this line. Thank you Oil of Olay. You have a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I had a Pretika for about 6 months that just stopped working. I decided to buy this instead because of price and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. It doesnt work as good but it wasnt as expensive. You get what you pay for. Its definitely better than not using anything. I have been using it for a couple weeks now and have had no problems. I do like that it does not have to be charged and can just be left inside the shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using the system for about three weeks and really like it.  I&#x27;m probably going to buy one to give my Daughter for her birthday.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t rely on other reviews to choose products but when I was looking to buy something I had never used before, I read many reviews before deciding to purchase this product. They were very helpful so I wanted to add mine in an effort to pay it forward.  I am very happy with this product. It also arrived on time and as described. As I age, my facial skin has developed a very specific dry T-zone and I could never moisturize enough. I finally decided to invest in a cleansing tool and unlike other reviewers, I found both speeds helpful. I tried the slower speed first to acclimate it to my face and was glad I did. It refreshed my face, getting rid of old skin and made moisturizing much easier. It lasted longer as well.  The higher speed does an excellent job of cleasing my face in the winter as it tends to get dryer then. I would recommend this product to anyone on the fence about buying a cleansing tool.</li>
            <li> On the bottom of the instrument, below the gray off and on buttons and the line, are words Olay Professional. That is the part that comes off to install batteries.  Hold the brush part down with one hand and pull with the other hand. It&#x27;s tough but it will come off. Do not pry with anything, you will scar up your brush.  They really should have included instructions for this! [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> I bought this in combination with the Olay microdermabrasion kit to address some skin issues I have been noticing lately including fine lines, brown spots, and breakouts. I investigated both the Olay Pro-X and Clarisonic as possible purchases, but decided on the Pro-X based on user reviews and price. I am glad I purchased the Pro-X as I really like this little cleaning tool. It is gentle enough on my face to use once a day at the end of the day and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and clean. I use it in the shower without a problem. Since starting to use it I have seen improvement in the overall look of my skin and I have had fewer breakouts. In combination with the microdermabrasion kit I have seen reduction in fine lines and brown spots as well although I think most of that is due to the microdermabrasion kit not the Pro-X. I have seen other people mention concerns about the battery compartment, but I did not have issues with the batteries to get started (have not had to change them yet). I got the Pro-X while on sale on Amazon about 6 weeks ago and I am very happy with the purchase. I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t have the benefit of having tried another similar product to objectively evaluate the differences.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest that I am not 100% sure what I expected to get out of this product.  I am always trying new skincare products so the idea of having a \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; seemed exciting!! I love getting spa facials and especially love the feel of my skin afterwards.  That being said I have been using this product 2-3x per week for a few weeks now.  It&#x27;s super easy too use (thanks to earlier reviews on how to put the batteries in as i would have thought I was breaking it!!) and I do like how my skin feels after using it. I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s really changed anything about my overall skin tone or texture but it&#x27;s a nice \\&quot;treat\\&quot; every few days for a deep clean.  I definitely plan to stick with it to see if there is any long term differences.  While I have never used the pricer brands I think this is a good deal for what you get!!</li>
            <li> I am only 12 years old but I have had serious acne for a long time. I had tried just about every acne treatment wash there is. None of them had worked until I used it with this brush. I noticed a difference after one try. My skin was super soft and the next day my acne was noticeably better. It really opened my pores allowing my acne cream to really work. This is the best item  I&#x27;ve ever spent my allowance on. Super fast shipping too!!! THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget!! I just wish the brush bristles was a little harder and more of the cleaning soultion :-)</li>
            <li> I normally wash my face in the shower by wetting a washcloth, rubbing some Dove sensitive bar soap on it, then adding a tablespoon or so of baking soda.  I smush that all together and massage my face with it.  It leaves my skin nice and clean and smooth.  When I purchased this Olay cleansing brush, I wondered if it could clean better than a washcloth using either the Olay cleanser that comes with it or my Dove/baking soda combination.  I do not think it does.      I do like it, though.  It&#x27;s a nice size: a little shorter than my hand and just a bit wider than the width of two fingers.  It was very easy to pop out of the box, snap the brush on, insert the batteries that come with it, push the button and use.  I think it is fun to use it and it feels nice on my face.  If you can spare the cash to purchase this, great.  If not, grab a washcloth, your favorite cleanser, some baking soda - and you probably have a pretty fair match.</li>
            <li> Actually I got it as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;later I purchased it for my friend.&lt;br /&gt;Its better and cheaper than clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;2 speed. I always use the highest one on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;suitable for everyday cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;very much satisfied with this one... Perfect brush for 20 -30+ skin. :D</li>
            <li> Products being compared.  Names copied from products&#x27; pages on Amazon.  \\&quot;CONAIR CORPORATION Facial Sauna Systems with Timer\\&quot;  \\&quot;Olay Prof Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System\\&quot; &amp;    The ideal piece would be combining the Olay&#x27;s brush and the Conair&#x27;s mechanics.    Brushes:  Conair - I didn&#x27;t know how hard the brush is until I used the Olay&#x27;s.  Conair&#x27;s is like those FIRM toothbrushes.  Olay-Olay&#x27;s is twice as soft as the SOFT toothbrushes.    Mechanics:  Conair - Love it!  Olay&#x27;s - A lot slower than Conair&#x27;s.    Conair is like a nice sports car going 70 mph. Olay is like a sedan going at 30 mph at top speed.  Olay has 2 speeds.  Conair has only 1; on/off.    Batteries: 2A&#x27;s    Conair - Cover slipped right off  Olay - I tried and haven&#x27;t been able to open the battery compartment yet.  I read a post on here of how to do it but I&#x27;ll have to scroll through to look for it.  I already tossed the box.    Even though I still own both, because the Conair&#x27;s brush is too rough, I  only use the Olay until I find one that has the Conair&#x27;s mechanics and a brush that&#x27;s NOT as soft as the Olay&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This thing reminds me of those people you see shining the floor with those industrial buffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start by saying, I am not a woman, but I can see this thing being more useful to them with the make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for some face cleaning products when I ran across this. Read a few reviews and it seems a good price and way to clean my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel tingly fresh like a lot of face scrubing lotions do, but I do believe that this works better than just using your hands to rub your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment is a bit tough. It felt like I was going to break the product trying to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample tube that comes with it is very small. I&#x27;m sure it will be gone very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this thing with [[ASIN:B001ET73JM Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser For Normal to Oily Skin, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]], but it doesn&#x27;t lather up using that cleaner. So don&#x27;t assume you can just use any face lotions with this mini buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a rough feel to it. I have yet to try using this prior to shaving. Hopefully it will help to make my rough facial hair a bit looser and easier to shave, hence the main reason I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning...be careful using this thing. Once things start getting lathered up and juicy wet on your face this product can start winging some high velocity rogue droplets right into your eyeball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So try and keep your eyes closed if your getting close to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a chick you might really like this thing. I&#x27;m sure I can live without it. But the true test will be the shaving aspect I mentioned. I&#x27;ll report back once I try shaving after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATED 9/28&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve owned this thing quite some time now. I was using it a lot at first to see if it would clear my face but didnt seem to help much in that department. My face seems the same after using it for a month vigorously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does seem to help with the shaving. Seems to loosen up the hairs a bit so that my shaves a slightly less painful. But still, the added benefit to the shaving aspect isnt anything to boast about. Just helps out a little. That is the only time I use this product now. Right before I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont know if I&#x27;d buy this again just as an aid for shaving my face as it only helps out slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.for a month vigorously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does seem to help with the shaving.

            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin and tone within two days.    The unit is very gentle to your skin and I strongly recommend this product to everyone (especially teenagers struggling with acne).</li>
            <li> I love my Olay Pro-X - as my face feels really smooth after using it. I use it every other day usually with my own acne cleanser (it comes with a small tube of Olay cleanser which was fine too). There&#x27;s a high and low speed. I use the high speed, which isn&#x27;t all that fast and works well. I would recommend buying it as the price is right and it seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Bought two different individuals this as a gift- one in her 50&#x27;s the other in her 30&#x27;s.. Neither women enjoyed the product much.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because people were saying good things about it and they were right. I will never use my hands to clean my face again. This facial brush cleans better and my skin is smoother when I apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used this one and I tried the Pretika one. Olay is spinning and really cleans your face. The exfoliating which comes with the box is great and i am using it every day although I am having sensitive skin \\&quot;oily too\\&quot;  The pretika is too tough and does not spin, returned the second day. But bigger brush.</li>
            <li> Pros: This product has a brush head that spins and cleans so much quicker than a standard brush. Perfect for traveling too!   Cons: It slows down after a few months and the brushes wear out a bit, I&#x27;m sure that you can add a few batteries in though and it will be fast cleansing again.</li>
            <li> It accomplishes what is expected I just wish the motor was just a little bit stronger</li>
            <li> i have used this about everyday since i got it 3 months ago. it leaves my face feeling so smooth and i have no doubt that it removes all the make up. i love it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the clearsonic, but couldnt rationalize paying that much $ on something that cleans your face. This thing is amazing. I love it, and use it often. I did have my face break out a little bit more, but it felt so clean. I have been using it three weeks now, and my face feels and looks great. The batteries are a little tough to get out, but there is insturctions on the side of the box. WORTH THE PRICE!! Do be careful if using a differnt facial scrub. I used a face cream that is more abrasive and my skin was sensitive for a little bit after that. Using the one provided is a good product though.</li>
            <li> I recently got a facial where the woman used the expensive, sonic version of this product.  I really liked the way it felt and the results.  Not wanting to spend that much money, I decided to try the Oil of Olay product as I use many of their products.  I am a 31-year old woman who has some adult acne.  I was amazed at how well this product worked.  It cleared up my skin and reduced the size of my pores, especially on my nose.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean after each use.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a gadget person but I really, really like this. It fits nicely in the hand, it has 2 speeds, and the brush feels just right-not too rough or too soft. I use this brush 1 to 2x a day. It keeps me honest in the fact that I believe that this brush allows me to get my money&#x27;s worth out of the other products that I use, by really getting to and exposing the skin&#x27;s surface.  I dab an exfoliator and cleanser on my face because I found that if I put them directly on the pad and then turned it on, the stuff immediately flew off all over the place.   I do believe that the brush coupled with my cleanser and exfoliator really penetrate deep to allow for the most clean, blank canvas, enabling the other products to do their thing. In the morning, I use an exfoliating scrub and a cleanser. I dab both in several spots all over the face, wet the brush pad, and wash with the spinner all over, from forehead to neck. (I then follow up with my serum-&gt;moisturizer-&gt;SPF-&gt;makeup routine.) In the evening, I do the same thing with the spinning brush and exfoliator/cleanser combo (followed up with retinol-&gt;moisturizer).   I truly believe the brush does a better job at enabling products to clean the skin better than a washcloth. I quickly found that my makeup looked better, it wasn&#x27;t sitting on dead, flaky skin (sorry, I know, gross). No doubt my $$$ anti-aging products are better able to do their job, too.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but I think this item is overpriced. It is small and cheaply made. You get a very small sample of the cleanser which I love and have been using. I will be surprised if it holds up very long. The brush is very soft and gently on the skin. I just think it&#x27;s way overpriced for what you get.</li>
            <li> I looked into this and the Clarisonic and ended up choosing this one because I couldn&#x27;t justify the cost of the Clarisonic when I wasn&#x27;t sure if this kind of product would even work for me. It has been fantastic! My skin feels very clean after each use and it has been clear even since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my nose.  I have tried every high end face scrub and moisturizer, but nothing got rid of it. Until I tried this exfoliator.  After just the very first use all the dry skin on my nose was gone! I just wish I had found it sooner.  Now I don&#x27;t have to throw anymore money away on expensive face scrubs. I&#x27;m switching to Olay moisturizers now too. This is a good brand that does what it promises!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a christmas gift for my husband. We both have oily skin and sometimes have issues with clogged pores and breakouts. I loved that olay had this option for $30 as opposed to the $100 alternatives. We both love this little cleaner. It leaves skin feeling completely cleansed and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> While I wish the Olay Pro-X Cleansing System was a little bit stronger (brand new battery and it seems a little weak and there isn&#x27;t a big difference between the low and high settings), I do notice a difference in my skin after just a few uses. I like the sample cleanser they provide but it&#x27;s very foamy and I feel like it might dry out my skin a little, even though the system itself exfoliates. This time of year though my skin is very tempermental anyway so I shouldn&#x27;t place all of the blame on the cleanser. I&#x27;ll probably alternate between my Cetaphil and the sample until it&#x27;s gone but overall I think it&#x27;s a great value. Also, it seems to help my light facial moisturizer penetrate better.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my mom and she uses it everyday! It&#x27;s simple and easy to use and helps exfoliates her skin making it look brighter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had both this product and the Clarisonic. I found the Olay to be just as good. Perhaps people feel that by spending more they get a better product, but truly I could not tell the difference. I am quite happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it&#x27;s very easy to get the battery cover off - as the instructions suggest, rock it back and forth while pulling it away from the unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical of these kinds of electronics but I really wanted something to wash my face differently. Also, I have tendonitis and honestly, sometimes my hands hurt so much that I don&#x27;t wash my face because it hurts to make those motions with my hands or to hold a scrubby or towel. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  Just got it delivered about 15 minutes ago from Amazon and tried it. Wow! My skin is so soft! And the motor is nice and slow so I felt like I had control of the device. Feels comfortable in my hand and I washed my face and neck for a lot longer than usual as it&#x27;s so soft and comfortable. Very pleasant feel!  The battery cover was hard to get off. I had to pry it off with a metal clip but hopefully I don&#x27;t have to change the batteries often.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this. A great travel size too.</li>
            <li> Just what my wife wanted for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Incredibly easy to use. I have acne prone skin and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since using this product. I use it once a day in the shower for about a minute with one of my own cream cleansers. My skin feels great after, and if it continues to prevent breakouts, it&#x27;s more than worth the small price.</li>
            <li> It was on sale in my local drugstore and I&#x27;ve bought it even though I didn&#x27;t plan to. Overall it does a decent job at cleansing and my skin felt smoother and fresher and absorbed skin care products better. The only issue I had with it is that because it rotates, it was sliding off my face numerous times. Not sure if I was putting a lot of pressure or not enough. But overall it&#x27;s good product for the price.</li>
            <li> works okay nothing to write home about though</li>
            <li> In a moment of cheapness, I purchased this and boy was I sorry.  The rotation of the brush is not very powerful and I just don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s getting my skin truly, deeply clean.  It&#x27;s main advantage over Clarisonic is that it takes changeable batteries and doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in.  I have to admit that I don&#x27;t like having to recharge my Clarisonic, I hate power cords hanging all over.  However, that is a minor inconvenience compared to the great cleaning it does.  Don&#x27;t be sucked in by a cheap price.  Clarisonic is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love Olay Prox, wish more cleanser and brushes was include. But overall great product.</li>
            <li> Works really good. Feels great on the chin and nose. Afterwards makes your face tingling and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever. It works and leaves your skin feeling flawless. I hope Olay continues to manufacture more products like this one.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this cleansing brush.  I have never used one before and have very sensitive skin so I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews that said that it can cause more acne because it can irritate the skin.  I have not had any negative side effects from it.  I bought it because my face has been extremely dry and flaky because of the cold weather and I wanted something to help buff off that dry skin.  This brush paired with a great moisturizer has completely solved the problem, almost immediately!  I also have occasional acne  and this has also helped with blemishes as well!  I use the cleansing brush with my prescription face wash.  Sometimes I put the cleanser directly on the brush head and other times I rub the cleanser into my skin with my hands first and then go over it with the brush.  Both ways seem to work great!  There is minimal splashing.  I am so happy I chose Olay instead of the more expensive version from Clarisonic.  This is a great affordable alternative!</li>
            <li> Waste of money..dont buy, it only works until the olay pro x wash that comes with the brush is gone</li>
            <li> I had been on the fence about whether this was worth all of the hype I had been reading, but then decided if it works half as well for my skin, then it would be a good purchase. Well, I have to say, it does a wonderful job of getting deep down into the pores- no need to apply pressure, just let the circular soft brush do it&#x27;s thing. Having naturally oily skin, I noticed a significant difference the very first time I used it. My skin felt less congested, less oily, my pores seemed less noticeable, and my makeup went on more smoothly. It did not, however, leave it feeling parched or overly dry--just extra clean. I think this could be good for those with dry skin as well, as the dead skin and gunk can be thoroughly cleansed away thereby creating no barrier to your moisturizer application, letting your skin drink it right up! It takes just a few seconds more in the shower to go over your face, a few extra more to go over your neck. But, that&#x27;s well worth it when you consider the payoff of better feeling, better looking skin. I can best describe it this way, it&#x27;s like going from a manual toothbrush to an electric toothbrush. You think your manual toothbrush is just fine, until you see how great and clean your teeth feel after using an electric toothbrush for the first time--it&#x27;s a big difference and worth the splurge. I highly recommend the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing Brush.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the included sample of exfoliating cleanser, as I have no desire to switch from my tea tree soap for cleansing and jojoba oil for moisturizing/balancing.</li>
            <li> I debated on buying the expensive facial cleansing brushes but tried this first in attempt to save money while planning my wedding and going to school. So glad I did! It works great. No complaints. It did make a few blemishes surface the first week but I think that&#x27;s expected when first using a new facial cleanser or acne tx. I noticed a difference in my pores, my skin looked smoother cleaner and just plain better! Love how clean my face feels after. I also use this with the play pro-x facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I wish i bought this long ago. It does the job. Im hooked. Cleaning my face with this every morning and once i get home from work. Thank you to all the other reviews that help me make my purchase</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day in the shower.  It isn&#x27;t high tech or fancy, but does a good job.  I feel that my face was fresher looking within a few days and I think that in the long run it will help me stay younger looking.  I don&#x27;t buy the expensive gel that goes with it.  I just use a cheap generic brand of exfoliant scrub and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now, and my skin never looked better. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and makes skin look fresh and bright. I am using the sample sized exfoliating face wash that came in the box, and find better results when I wet the brush, apply face wash on the brush, and then use it on my face, since the face wash is not easy to spread on the face directly.</li>
            <li> Recently I purchased the Olay cleansing system. I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about trying this product but after reading multiple positive reviews online I purchased it with high expectations. My skin is oily and prone to break outs so I was looking for a skin care regimen that would make my face feel clean and refreshed. I have to say, the Olay Pro-x system definately did that! After the first use I could tell this product does a great job of removing makeup and dirt, but is gentle enough to use twice a day. After two months of use I can tell a dramatic difference in the texture of my skin. It is much softer and it seems as if my breakouts occur less frequently. I love my Olay Pro-x and wish I would have bought it sooner!</li>
            <li> This is great.  I use it once a week and I love it!  It really cleans out my skin and makes my face look fresh.</li>
            <li> I got the unit 3 weeks and ago and it worked well till today. I opened it up and water poured out with the rusted batteries. The on/off switch stopped working. I had it on a shelf in the shower where water would get on it and it obviously can&#x27;t handle that. So, just a warning ti keep it out of direct water.&lt;br /&gt; And of course Amazon is taking it back and sending out a new one instantly. I love Amazon !</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product...both for what it promised, and the reviews.  I found it much too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> I was debating on getting a Clarisonic but was hesitant to spend that much money so I decided to try this instead. I love it. It really cleans my skin and makes it look better overall. I use this about once a week as kind of big exfoliation and it does a great job! I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, outbreak-prone skin and struggle with large pores and blackheads. In the first three uses my pores appear smaller and blackheads are less visible if not gone. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> was good but mine broke on me in 3 months. sigh. couldnt return it. disappointed. what a waste of money</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t write a review because the batteries are impossible to install.  The customer service number on the web site wasn&#x27;t at all interested in being of service and suggested I call back during normal working hours... I was on the fence about the Clairsonic  but they just made that decision easy!  This one will be returned tomorrow!</li>
            <li> So far so good! I got this for Christmas and use it once or twice a week. My skin feels super soft after each time I use it. It really gets your face clean. Worth what my son paid for it!</li>
            <li> I like it because it really does help exfoliate. Using a washcloth alone doesn&#x27;t help especially since I use strong drying out products. The thing I don&#x27;t like is that I went to a certain store, you know the one, it sells things in BULK (because if I say the business name it&#x27;ll get edited out) you know the one... it requires a club card to get into? Well I went to that large bulk selling club and found the SAME thing for just a little bit more AND it had more a couple extra brushes with it. I immediately noticed that you will need to buy more brushes and those extra brushes would&#x27;ve been nice!</li>
            <li> Bought this cleanser together with the additional head brushs! And most importantly, the product works so well! Product is not available in Singapore thus after searching for quite awhile, managed to find it on Amazon.com! Worth to recommend!</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the pricy ones in the department stores or makeup specialty stores. I does it&#x27;s job at cleansing my face. I don&#x27;t use it with the Olay cleansing gel, but I just use it with any of my cream face wash (make sure there at NO exfoliation beads, this will scrap your face). There are two mode to this and it is water resistant. I use this in the shower a few times a week and it has been 6 + months. No issue.</li>
            <li> I really like Olay&#x27;s Pro-X cleanser. The battery compartment is definitely a bit troublesome, but otherwise, I think this product is really good for its price. The texture of my skin is evidently softer and smoother after each use. Investing in this was worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Hmm, I would say it&#x27;s pretty useful. At least it cleans well for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for a few weeks and it works even with 2x 1.2v batteries.. those rechargeable ones. So far so good...</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked and felt so clean after using this little guy. I use to only remove makeup with remover wipes and then use my fingers to wash my face but after using this I will never go back to my old regimen. I like this better than the Clarisonic because the head is a lot smaller which allows you to get into every nook in your face without having soap splash everywhere. My pores are smaller after a few uses and my skin looks a hell of a lot smoother and brighter. I swear my makeup was never completely taken off before after seeing the stuff that shows up on the bristles even after wiping makeup off before cleansing. I did break out a little after the first few uses only because it was doing its job by pulling dirt out deep within my skin but since then my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I initially had awesome results with this product. My face felt so soft, but I feel like the luster is wearing out. I only use this to help get dry skin off my face every once in a while since it doesn&#x27;t do what it used to.</li>
            <li> it works jusy the way it is supposed to. the brush stays on. no problems</li>
            <li> Quite light and small, quite soft bush head, and I can feel my skin is more smoothy after using it~!</li>
            <li> Great product.  My face really looks better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Clariosonic brush and the Olay brush doesn&#x27;t compare.  For $20, it does a $20 job. I used it for travel and it was sufficient for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> So far, after three or four scrubbings, I really love it.  I neglected my skin for awhile, so I saw immediate results in the shine of my skin on my face.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean.</li>
            <li> Given it 4 stars because I have heard great things about it but haven&#x27;t yet tested it out.</li>
            <li> I can tell it cleans better than my hands</li>
            <li> Replacement for a cleaner I bought years ago...last a long time.</li>
            <li> Broke after first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just great! Does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. The first use proved how much residue is removed with the cleansing brush.  It would be nice to have a bag for the system to protect from contamination when not in use.</li>
            <li> I was considering getting a Clarisonic but since they are quite costly I decided to shop around for some cheaper options and I came across the Olay Pro-X. I had high hopes for this product after reading many reviews and seeing that it was listed as the #1 best seller by Amazon. There was an extra coupon offer that day so I figured for $18 I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with the Olay Pro-X and I purchased it. After unboxing the Pro-X I was disappointed by how chinsey it felt in my hand even for an $18 item, I was still excited nevertheless to try it out and reveal my magically lovely skin. Putting the brush onto the unit did not give a confident click or lock, so I repeated the action several times just to make sure it was actually in right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was washing my face at the bathroom sink so I held the Pro-X to my face and turned it on... immediately there is water and face wash flying off the brush in all directions, including into my eyes and mouth &amp; all over the bathroom (this went on for the duration of my face washing). I continued using the product with one eye cracked open a tiny bit &amp; mouth sealed shut tightly. Because of the spinning motion of the brush, it propels itself in unruly spirals around your face that are rather difficult to redirect which gives a similar feeling to being dragged behind a dog on a leash. I had used a headband to hold back as much of my hair as possible at my hairline after reading in the instructions that you cannot use the brush too close to your hairline or it will twirl your hair into dreadlocks. I tried to keep the brush away from my hairline, but that results in a 1 inch perimeter around my face that is impossible to clean. I edged in as carefully as I could in an attempt to bridge this gap, and surely enough I ended up with wet facewash frothy hair twirls -admittedly my fault for even trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device has a mind and agenda of it&#x27;s own and I felt like I was fighting it and losing. After I finally finished washing my face I felt this sense of relief, like I had narrowly escaped a hurricane &amp; was finally safe in my underground shelter. I rinsed my face expecting to feel baby soft skin after the ordeal I went through but my skin felt just as dry/rough as before, only with additional redness &amp; irritation now. I disappointedly rinsed the brush head &amp; gave the device a shake to release some water from the brush when what else.. but the brush head flies off the device and across the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all the device is garbage, the user experience is horrendous, and it is not worth your money. A washcloth can do a better job cleaning and exfoliating your face than the Pro-X can, and it is certainly less messy &amp; traumatic. On the bright side, my terrible experience with the Pro-X sent me right out to purchase a Clarisonic which I have been using for several months now and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying my friend&#x27;s Clarisonic system. I wanted similar brush but didn&#x27;t want to spend as much money. Olay had OK review so I decided to go with it. Olay isn&#x27;t too bad, but the brush head can be little harsh on dry sensitive skin, and the rotating motion makes it harder to reach sides of nose.&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic gently vibrates and its brush is softer and finer. It is significantly better quality compared to Olay. Olay&#x27;s only advantage is price. ($20 vs. $100) I have pretty OK skin that withstands Olay&#x27;s rotating brush and scrub, so I had a good result with Olay, but if you have a sensitive skin and extra $100 to spend, get Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;About the small tube of exfoliant that comes with the brush: It is probably too harsh for most people. I use &amp;#34;Alba Botanica Acnedote&amp;#34; scrub instead of scrub that comes with the brush.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness I cannot say enough great things about this brush. My esthetician recommended I purchase a spin brush to exfoliate better and specifically recommended the Olay system instead of Clarisonic because she thinks they are overpriced. I am gonna buy that woman a great Christmas present this year! My skin is ultra smooth and soft, I am already seeing a difference after only one week of use. Compact and convenient, it fits great anywhere and will be easy to travel with over the holidays. I am never parting with this!</li>
            <li> Water got inside or these easily and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love this cleaning system. So much cheaper than Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, works great and last long.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Gentle yet effective. The cleaner they included could have been better, probably because I&#x27;m used to much better, but good nonetheless. Now that I have this I will NOT even consider buying the Clarasonic. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This cheaply made &amp; does not spin very quickly &amp; the brush is to soft to really make any impact on removing dead cells. The micro dermabrason kit is fantastic, but the cleanser brush is worthless.</li>
            <li> A wash rag works much better. This mostly just sloshes the cleanser you&#x27;re using around. It feels like something I&#x27;d use if I wanted a mini buffer to wax a toy car. Those of you who want to actually scrub or clean your face should not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I used Clarisonic and Olay ProX, did not see any difference in results.</li>
            <li> I have been shopping all of the brushes on the market. You know the ones, for $149.00-$200.00 and they didn&#x27;t rotate at all. I knew it was a matter of time that someone would come up with this great product. I use it once at day, some time twice depending on makeup, etc. My face has not become tender from the use. I&#x27;ve used the product that comes with it and also one that I always used, and never had any problem with either causing any irritations. My face feels clean and fresh after I use it. Try it, you will love the way your face feels and cleans so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this a week now and can already tell a difference in my skin.  I have used both the sample cleanser (which I will probably buy) and my current cleanser (Aveda Botanicals foaming cleanser).  My skin&#x27;s texture is much smoother and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my pores...i.e. smaller pores and less blackheads.  I&#x27;ve been having problems with sporatic acne recently (I&#x27;m almost 30) and so far my skin seems so much clearer.  I can only attribute that to the fact that it is in fact cleaning my skin better than just the cleanser alone.  I am sure that the Clarisonic models are better, however, for the price, this is a great deal!      As for the brush heads, I think that using your best judgement on replacement is best.  I can tell already that I will probably have to replace it every month or so but seeing as how the replacement heads are less than $10 that&#x27;s not a big issue for me.      Until I&#x27;m ready to make the investment in a Clarisonic, this will work just fine!</li>
            <li> these are great and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for the longest time, so after reading the reviews i&#x27;ve decided to try it. its been only a week, but i love it, my blackheads are gone, my pores are smaller, it makes my skin feel clean. even my husband likes it. i recomend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> First let me say I do exfoliate often. I believe it helps keep your skin glowing and healthy.   With that being said..Let me say this brush was very cheaply made...Very plastic. The brush head was VERY soft and provided NO exfoliation what so ever. I returned this immediately!    Kim</li>
            <li> The Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System product does not achieve any deep cleansing.  The super soft rotating brush is way too wimpy to effectively remove dead skin cells or clean facial pores.  Using the minimally abrasive Olay cleanser sample with the rotating brush on this product felt like I was trying to scrub my face with a soggy noodle.  I was very disappointed in this product and I would not recommend it.  This product could be greatly improved with a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; type cleaning action and a slightly more abrasive brush head option akin to a pink buf-puf texture.  A two dollar wash cloth is more effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks.I am pleased to say I did see a bit of improvement in my skin.The product works fine and left my skin feeling fresh and clean. I will continue using this product because its the best one I found that actually works. The best part the strength of cream is not over powering</li>
            <li> After a month of using the Olay Pro-X twice a day, my skin looks and feels silky smooth and my pores are noticeably reduced.  What a marvelous surprise for my 63 year old skin!  The portability and small size make it easy to pack and travel.  A travel tip - remove the batteries, take an extra set (AA size), toss everything into a ziplock bag and you&#x27;re good to go anywhere in the world. No charger needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe its due to the demand of the holiday season, but I paid less than $22 in November 2014.  Today&#x27;s price is almost $39.  Ho Ho Ho!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, quiet, easy to use and it cleans my face really well.  Definitely worth the $30!  The battery compartment is a bitch to open.  Just breathe and have a good attitude.  I used my trusted technique of calling customer service while I was struggling and magically, the flap slid off before I connected to an agent.</li>
            <li> This was way cheaper than all the expensive brands out there, including the ones at the mall. The bristles are extremely soft. No harshness. My wife got a brand name one as a gift (not mentioning names here), but the cost is over $130, and I feel absolutely no difference in the two.  On the other side of the coin, I have no idea if this does anything. Maybe it does some more exfoliation, but I don&#x27;t fee the different yet. Probably better than my harsh rubbing of my face.</li>
            <li> The product works just fine but was a little smaller than I expected. Overall I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This device is a step up from the previous Olay scrubber which used something akin to a brillo pad.  This one uses nice soft bristles that feel good on the face.  Your face feels nice after the cleaning, not dried out like as you used soap.  Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing the Pro-X from Costco. It came with the brush and handle, a spare brush, a 7-oz cleansing cream. It says on the box to replace the brush head every 3 months or if the brush looks like it&#x27;s falling apart. I saw that a lot of people weren&#x27;t sure how often to replace their brush. Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> This product really does the work, I have been using it every other day for a week now and I am seriously amazed at how beautiful my skin looks, i would recommend it to anybody!</li>
            <li> I bought the pro x for my daughter.  It seems to clean really good.  She is really happy with it.  We don&#x27;t really know about any long-term info yet.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used other battery-operated exfoliation tools and I know that there are some more expensive products out there. I haven&#x27;t used them, so I can&#x27;t compare, but this is a good product. I like that I can use it in the shower and that it is fairly gentle. I&#x27;m not sure how good I am going to be about buying refill heads versus just exfoliating with my hands, but we&#x27;ll see! The product is easy to hold and comes with a sample size of Olay exfoliant, which is very gentle and has small beads. I would recommend more or less holding the product still and letting it do the work as you move it over your face (versus also moving your hand around, which I have an inclination to do). This gives a more gentle experience and seems to let the product do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with my Olay cleansing system.  [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]] It cleans well and makes my skin look very clear.  I like the compact size, it is great for the shower.    I would recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Quality facial system for the money. Makes cleansing fun at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely terrible. My skin was decent and had no acne, until I started using this cleansing system. During Day 2 after using this product, my skin appeared slightly better. But then after 2 weeks of consistently using this, my skin got really bad. My entire face started to break out, grow a lot of black heads and white heads, and turn as red as a tomato. Now my skin is completely wretched. I STRONGLY ADVISE EVERYONE NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT. My sister also tried this product and she too got terrible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ONLY REASON THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD REVIEWS IS MOST OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE PROBABLY BEING WRITTEN BY THE SELLERS THEMSELVES&gt;</li>
            <li> I looked at the more expensive ones, but I felt they wanted too much for them.  This one is a great deal and I believe it has done a GREAT job.</li>
            <li> I just received the cleaner and used it once.  I wanted to post a review because I had no problems installing the batteries as others have reported.  The instructions on the box say to gently rock the battery compartment cover from side to side while pulling with the same hand.  In doing this the cover came off within seconds.  I was expecting a battle involving a butter knife in the crevice, but didn&#x27;t need it.  The brush didn&#x27;t seem to lock in place very securely but it didn&#x27;t wobble or come loose with use.  I applied the cleanser to my face with my hands then used the cleaner.  I didn&#x27;t get any splatter, as I saw in some reviews.  It seemed much gentler than I expected, but that&#x27;s probably best on the skin.  After the first use my skin feels clean.  I did use it for longer than I probably will on a regular basis, but I imagine with regular usage it will do a decent job of exfoliating.  I can&#x27;t compare it to the more expensive models as I haven&#x27;t tried them.  For the money I think I&#x27;ll be content with it.  I will post an update after a few week of usage, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll clear, and keep clear some pores that seem to stay clogged and therefore look larger.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the Clarisonic at my sister&#x27;s house.  After reading the reviews of the Olay Pro-X here on Amazon, I bought the Olay Pro-X because I could not justify spending 10x the money on a Clarisonic.    That having been said, it was a poor choice on my part!!!  My Olay Pro-X arrived today, and I could not wait to use it.  When I did, it did not feel as though it were cleaning my face at all.  I used an astringent after cleansing my face and found that the Olay Pro-X left a lot of grime behind.  I had to rewash it with a washcloth and soap.    I just ordered the Clarisonic.  Hopefully it will arrive in short order!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say the first time I use this product.i saw a immediate difference in my skin,this is a awesome product ,it left my skin smooth and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I love this cleaning system. It cleans my face very well. All traces of makeup are removed. My face feels like all the dead skin cells are gone. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Much cheaper than other clear-a-sonic type products and just as effective</li>
            <li> This is the best way to see if its something you would like. $20ish buck is a steal compared to the $100plus other ones on the market. I haven&#x27;t used it that often just because its strong enough that I dont want to make my skin sore. Any time i&#x27;ve needed a deeper clean, this gets the job done. I like that the battery seems to last and stays consistently strong. I didnt care much for the cleaner it comes with. Any other cleanser is perfectly fine, as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife as a gift with extra brush heads and cleansing cream.&lt;br /&gt;Three months of use and she loves it.  She says her skin is softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s always beautiful to me.</li>
            <li> Though cheaper than the Clarisonic, you&#x27;re getting what you pay for. This brush simply spins which serves mostly only to move stuff around on the surface of the skin. There is relatively little actual cleaning. This also feels very abrasive. The Clarisonic vibrates at a high frequency which cleans better. Also, it has a very strong massage feel to it, which I like even better than the cleaning action - it&#x27;s incredible. Yes, it does cost WAY more (like $119+) but it&#x27;s totally worth it. Try it and you&#x27;ll think the price is cheap. Also, it&#x27;s a much higher quality product in look and feel, is available in different colors and patterns, and there are no replaceable batteries.</li>
            <li> great product at discounted price, skin feels smooth</li>
            <li> I liked it for the year that it worked, though I didn&#x27;t really notice the difference on my face. Then it died unexpectedly.  Since I think products should last longer than a year, I will be buying a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product! Contemplated and read reviews for weeks before I bought it (especially excited of all the positive reviews). But after using this product the first time, my face felt scratched and raw. Not a big deal, I thought, as long as it feels softer and the texture improves over time. I finally had to stop using it...my face started looking worse and worse..it was more oily and my pores seemed larger after each use. I am not saying that the device does not work for some people, but it actually worked against me. Nothing really serious, after a couple days without use, my skin returned to its normal dysfunction, lol. But it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I love this! Makes my face feel the way it soft as a baby&#x27;s bum . It is a great dupe for the clarasonic if you don&#x27;t have the money to spend . I&#x27;m glad I got this (; I have dry skin during winter and I kept having to exfoliate with a hand towel it was a hassle !</li>
            <li> Ought to provide specific instructions on proper use.</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft after using this. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Was given this for xmas so I have only used it since xmas day. My skin is fresher and clean! I was looking for something like this without spending a ton of money. Well hubby managed to find this for me. It is battery operated which is a HUGE plus because I have found that rechargeable ones just start losing their charging power. Don&#x27;t know how long this will last, that remains to be seen. But so far LOVE IT! My skin does too:)</li>
            <li> I am mid 20s and have very congested but dry/sensitive skin. No matter how many face cleansers I would use, I would get out of the shower and still my face would have make up and not feel or look clean. I became more and more interested in the clarisonic mia brush (the cheapest model) but that week I saw an ad for this Olay brush. WOW. my skin has not felt so smooth before in my life. my skin is still problematic but I do not experience the awful flakiness that perpetuated my problem skin! when i use my witch hazel toner, there is NO make up or grime in my cotton cosmetic pad. If you want a deap clean, this is for you. I was surprised the brushes are not crazy expensive, but there is no detail on how often they suggest you to replace them. I&#x27;ll use my own judgement on that. Love that I can leave this in the shower and not worry about it possibly getting wet or having any place where I need to plug it in. Great value if you think about the amount we ladies spend on face products. I love the sample cleanser in the box, a little goes a long way. I may think about purchasing that when it is empty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own the fancy Clarisonic thing that this imitates, but based on owning this, my advice would be do it right (and cough up the three-figure amount for the real deal) or don&#x27;t do it at all. I don&#x27;t see any improvement in blackheads, and the friction actually seems to exacerbate blemishes. I would give it two stars, but I&#x27;m giving it three in the interest of fairness: You&#x27;re only supposed to use it for 60 seconds, I think, but that goes by quite fast and I&#x27;ve probably used longer on many occasions. If you tend to be a little obsessive, you risk damaging your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also since learned that skin problems -- at least of the oil/blackhead/zit variety -- have more to do with what&#x27;s going on in your skin than on your skin. As in, blemishes are caused by oil you produce, not dirt/dirtiness sitting on your face. More abrasive and thorough cleansing have psychological appeal, but the ingredients in cleansers (salicylic acid etc) are more important. Certainly you want to thoroughly remove your makeup, and a brush like this may help, but you have to remember that you&#x27;re going to reuse that brush.</li>
            <li> I love this, after only the first use my face looked so much better! My face looked clean, fresh and it felt so awesome. I wish I would have bought this a lot sooner. I love it and you will too!</li>
            <li> it is ok, but not as effective as I would have liked,</li>
            <li> Love this product, definitely great comparison to clarisonic mia but much much cheaper. I don&#x27;t know if it was just my item but for some reason my brush head wouldn&#x27;t stay on, which became very annoying but other than that would recommend to anyone who wants the clarisonic but doesn&#x27;t want to splurge. This olay is a great dupe and a great price!</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about buying a facial scrubber for several years, but did not want to spend $150-$200 for a unit.  This is a good option if you&#x27;re considering one.  I had a heck of a time finding one at my nearby stores.  They were selling out faster than they could stock them!  I finally tracked one down and have been using it for about one week.  I was surprised to see a big difference in the texture of my skin the very first day. I have very oily skin which I try to control with blotting paper and powders.  My pores get clogged and I develop both white and blackheads, despite regularly cleansing.  This product has measurably cleared my skin within one week.  I&#x27;m amazed!  I&#x27;ve also used it to exfoliate my arms and upper chest with excellent results.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> The best, this is second one I bought during lightening deal.  One for my wife, one for my daughter.  They love them!</li>
            <li> I too went back and forth about purchasing the Clarisonic one.  I&#x27;m so happy I decided to try this one instead.  Works great- I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet (after 7 months), but I remember it was EXTREMELY difficult to put the batteries in when it arrived.  I might just get a new one when the batteries die.</li>
            <li> CHANGED MY SKIN! If you have P-Acne (I found out at 30 I do) its as simple as using this bad boy once to twice a week and I went from a constant breakout to the skin of a baby. I wish I had found this 10 years ago!</li>
            <li> Just okay.  Honestly I don&#x27;t see much of an improvement in my skin more than my typical use of an exfoliating wash alone, and while I don&#x27;t yet have anything to which I can compare it, it seems to be low quality.  I think I&#x27;ll purchase the new Clinique one and try that one out.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t come with a case so you&#x27;ll need to purchase a hard (not soft) case if you travel, as I learned the bristles bend.</li>
            <li> In less than two weeks, my skin is cleaner, clearer, smoother and just plain better looking.  It feels better from the inside.  Only tricky part was loading the batteries.  There were instructions on opening the package but not how to remove the battery cover.  I was concerned I would break it and finally used a very small screw driver very slowly and carefully.  This is a great value.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy one of the more expensive \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; brush facial cleaners - but this came out on the market - so I thought I would try it.  I received it ahead of estimated arrival date and was pleased it came with good copper top batteries and a trail size of the ProX scrub cleanser.  This really works - I&#x27;ve used it for a few days 1-2X with the scrub included and my usual facial soap and it works wonderfully!  The brush rotates at 2 speeds and it doesn&#x27;t pull at the skin so I get deep cleaning and no stretching (that&#x27;s bad for your skin). This product is great to increase circulation to the skin without stressing my skin.  The pores on my nose are very clean now-an extraction at a facial resulted in - my your pores are very clean - what are you using...? I am so glad I tried this on first  -  great value for great skin!!!</li>
            <li> My wife liked it, and the price is cheap, easy to use, and now, she used every week, I&#x27;m glad I bought a good thing</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always a little leery to try new face products, but I&#x27;ve had good luck with Olay in the past (their regenerist moisturizer is awesome - and for those wondering, I use the products at acne-dot-org usually. Work great!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d give this little gizmo a try when I realized that apart from the occasional actual scrub, I don&#x27;t ever scrub my face when I wash it. I wash it by hand, splash dry, and then pat dry with a washcloth. So I thought this gadget might help get rid of some places (around the nose and chin) where I get clogged pores (not pimples, not blackheads usually - just clogged pores. You can run your fingernail across in a certain way and they ooze out, but you can&#x27;t see them unless you&#x27;re investigating your own face in the mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since you can&#x27;t use this on your eyes of course, I decided to use it in the AM instead of in the PM when I need to remove makeup. It&#x27;s shower-proof, so you can use it in the shower. I really like using it in the AM - it&#x27;s a nice little wake-up to scrub your face a bit with it (the same reason I sometimes like to use body scrub in the AM) and get the blood flowing. It has 2 speeds, but I honestly can&#x27;t really tell a difference with it. The scrubby brush is VERY soft and not scratchy at all. And of course you can use it with the Olay scrub or another of your own, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it with anything very coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Well, it feels good. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks in this very dry winter and have noticed a couple dry spots that feel a little better. The clogged pores are maybe a little better off, though it&#x27;s nothing amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend? Eh, maybe. You&#x27;d probably get jut as much out of the non-battery powered scrubby tools that some other cleansers come with. With those, you wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about replacing batteries or changing the scrubby bit (you can buy replacements), because the scrubby is generally on the package when you buy it. It feels nice and I like it and will continue using it, but I can&#x27;t really tell you to run out and get one right now. For the retail price, it&#x27;s not that amazing. And I can&#x27;t help but feel that it&#x27;s a trendy thing, and you won&#x27;t be able to find those replacement heads forever. I mean honestly - it&#x27;s a soft, spinning brush. We&#x27;re not talking about anything revolutionary here!ike it and will continue using it, but I can&#x27;t really tell you to run out and get one right now. For the retail price, it&#x27;s not that amazing. And I can&#x27;t help but feel that it&#x27;s a trendy thing, and you won&#x27;t be able to find those replacement heads forever.

            <li> I really like this Olay \\&quot;scrubber\\&quot; - it feels great and my skin feels so clean and exfoliated after using! I also love that it comes with a sample of the PRO-x exfoliation facial scrub. It would be nice if Olay included at least one refill brush in the original package. I haven&#x27;t used comparable brands of cleaning systems, but am very happy with this Olay system.</li>
            <li> Freaking love my olay pro x. I started using this around month 3 of my 8 month accutane treatment and it has helped with my scarring so much. I recommend it to everyone. I guess I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin cause all the reviews complain about how harsh it is are crazy. The brushes for this thing are as soft as the brushes they sell for babies hair. I highly recommend this to anyone. I can&#x27;t figure out how to post images but you can view my results on my instagram @missdeevi</li>
            <li> Love this!! The only con that I see is the tube of the cleanser is very small.</li>
            <li> Because this cleansing system is not harsh, you can use it everyday - but once a day.  The brush is soft but it does a good job, and the brush itself cleans easily.  Within a few days use I could see a difference in my skin.  It glows and it&#x27;s perky!  Olay sent a sample cleanser, but I&#x27;ve also used my own (not soap - I use Cetaphil (it&#x27;s for sensitive skin)) and it works also.  You don&#x27;t have to purchase any particular cleanser for results, but I would not recommend anything harsh.  There is no installation necessary for the system.  Batteries are included and the brush just snaps on.</li>
            <li> Quite good. Exceeded my expectations. Will purchase one for my sister as well</li>
            <li> Instead of spending the money on the high-end unit, I decided to try this one by Olay.  This machine seems just fine.  Hard to imagine the expensive one doing much better.  It&#x27;s just somewhat difficult to get the battery compartment open.  Next time should be easier.</li>
            <li> My pores are so clean, my skin so soft - LOVE this.</li>
            <li> This cleansing system is great--the brush is soft, not abrasive, &amp; makes your skin feel slightly tingly &amp; very clean.  Like a mini-spa treatment at home!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help improve my skin.</li>
            <li> Its a very good product in which at first was hesitant to try but was relieved that it was better than expected.</li>
            <li> This Cleansing System works great and I am very satisfied with the product, especially for the price! There are numerous other options that are more expensive. I took a chance on this one, hoping it would work as good as the reviews indicated and it absolutely does. I have very sensitive skin and only use it about once a week with the exfoliating gel. It does not irritate my skin at all and I immediately notice how soft my skin is after use. Affordable and overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I love it?  Maybe not so effusive.  It works very well, is quite soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin.  The exfoliant lotion that comes with this, is a nice touch.  As stated, I think this allows for a better skin cleansing than the little manually operated brushes.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try one of the Clarisonic systems, but I felt nervous about spending so much money on such a product. When I saw the Olay Pro-X featured on the Dr. Oz show, it caught my attention. The Pro-X costs way less than a Clarisonic, so why not give it a go?     Well, I&#x27;m sorry I bothered with this product. I wasted my time and money. This \\&quot;cleansing system\\&quot; did absolutely nothing for my skin. My skin did not feel clean at all. I feel that the brush pushed dirt and oil around without actually removing it from my face. I did not get the deep  down clean that I strive for when cleansing my skin.    I get much better results using a    [[ASIN:B000NKHNI4 Buf-Puf Facial Sponge, Regular 1 ea]]    Those little exfoliating sponges are great! I highly recommend them!    At some point in the future, I may give the Clarisonic a try. I&#x27;m very leery, though. I just hope it does a much, much better job than the Pro-X. It would be an incredibly huge disappointment to spend so much money on something, only to have it let you down because it doesn&#x27;t do as it claims.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS GREAT FOR MY ACNE PRONE SENSITIVE SKIN. I HAVE HAD AWFUL BREAKOUTS AND STARTED USING THIS EVERYDAY AND MY FACE IS CLEARING UP (FINALLY!) AND FEELS SO SMOOTH! I LOVE IT! DEF. WORTH THE 27 BUCKS!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I was a little skeptical at first when I bought it.   I kept getting occasional breakouts on my face. I didn&#x27;t know what it was. I went to the dermatologist, got RX to try to tame the bumps, but nothing really worked until I started using this brush to wash! I noticed my face to be more cleaner after using it and within a week, my face really cleared up. This product came with a sample size cleanser. I used my own cleanser with this in the morning and at night in the shower. At night, I use it in conjunction with my usual cleanser and it WORKS! Main thing is that it really cleans my face and the reason I&#x27;ve been getting breakouts is because my face wasn&#x27;t cleaned enough. I thought I was cleaning it well, but after using this brush, I&#x27;m convinced  that I had to clean it in a different way. This REALLY WORKED for me and so hopefully it will work for others out there that have the same problem I was experiencing with my face!    I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it. I will be purchasing replacement brushes when this one  gets worn out. So far so good, and it&#x27;s been about a month (using it 2x&#x27;s a day).     Glad I didn&#x27;t spend $100+ for something similar. This works for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X is everything I expected it to be. It was my first ever exfoliating facial brush and is just a cheaper alternative I wanted to try out before saving up to buy myself a Clarisonic. I usually have a lot of dead skin lurking on my face after I get out of the shower, but I started using this in the shower almost every day (big points for being waterproof!). The Pro-X makes my skin super smooth and not only that, but I feel it deeply cleanses my skin, which is great, because dead skin is another contributor to pimples. If you&#x27;re just looking for a quick fix to the radiance your skin lacks, then the Pro-X is great for the job. It&#x27;s also petite so it&#x27;s really easy to travel with. The only con about this product is that it might not have the high pressures and DEEP cleaning that Clarisonic has, but for $20, you save a lot more on something that is almost as good!</li>
            <li> For this price, it is good. I haven&#x27;t try the sonic one, but the performance of this is good enough for your daily cleaning. And the free clean gel is good.</li>
            <li> I started using this on a every other day basis because sometimes my skin can get over-dry if I use a more powerful face wash, especially in the colder months. Even though I don&#x27;t use it every day, it&#x27;s worked well in clearing up my skin. Like a lot of other people, I get those pesky blackheads on my nose that are hard to get rid of. But using this gets rid of them and has kept them away. It&#x27;s even prevented any bigger pimples from sprouting up. My skin is a lot smoother and softer as well. The bristles on the brush work well. They are hard enough to clean your skin well but soft enough that it won&#x27;t rub your skin too hard and make it red. Although the cleanser works well, I might use my regular cleanser instead of buying a new bottle of the Olay. I haven&#x27;t quite decided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem was getting the part where the battery goes in open. I tried for at least 10 minutes on my own and eventually had to ask someone else to help because I was too frustrated. I understand that it needs to be waterproof but there has got to be an easier way to have a waterproof battery part and still be a little bit easier for the consumer to get it open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, I really like the cleansing system and would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay too much to get a good face cleansing system.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this product at all.  I was looking for a product that would provide cleansing but also remove the dead skin cells that accumulate and cause lines and wrinkles.  What a let down!  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  I am glad I bought an extra head for the hand held device so I can try to sell this hyped up product to some other unsuspecting consumer and recoup some of my money.    My advice, don&#x27;t bother.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 years old and still wondering why I have acne. My friend told me I wasn&#x27;t washing my face enough. Well.. In fact I was washing my face day and night. So I thought I&#x27;ll give pro-x a try. The first time I try this, it made my face clean and glow! It also save time in the morning because you only should use it for 2 minuets. But I highly recommend to use a good moisturizer. Some times I wash my face too long because it feel so good that my face hurts when I put toner on. So be prepared to have a good moisturizer! Other than that it really made my life easier in the mornings and have clear skin every day. No regret buying this.  Over all I think that people who think that hand wash is not enough for you should get this product! For $30 why not try it?</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro Cleansing system works very effectively. I feel it was a good investment. I feel that after a few weeks I can definitely see the difference in my skin. My face defnitely feels softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> The brush does a great cleaning.  Of course, Olay knows how to make a good product.</li>
            <li> cleans well never had one of the more expensive brands but for the price its good and gives you some extra cleaning.also replacement heads available at local dept stores in town.I like it and use it nightly feel it helps get dry skin cells off easy.</li>
            <li> I read some of the positive reviews for this product and I decided to try it.  I am 46 and I have two boys.  One son is starting to get blemishes on his face. I was in search of something to help get my face clean without tearing it up or drying it out.  I love this little gadget.  My boys like to have their face cleaned with the Pro X and the condition of their skin is improving.  I like that I can use any kind of cleanser on the brush head.  We are currently using Equate 3 product system to control acne.  It is very affordable and it is working for us.  I also purchased Equate rejuvenating cleanser and it works great with the Pro X to get my skin clean.  I purchased two boxes of replacement brush heads from Amazon.  If my Pro X breaks, I am going to buy another one.  I did not have trouble with the battery compartment.  I looked at the instructions and figured it out.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice any difference in my skin</li>
            <li> The product worked quite well but to me it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.  I think women who enjoy spending a lot of time with cleansers and/or makeup may enjoy the process and it seems reasonably priced for this type of item.  I think of it as a gadget that you might use for a while and then it sits in some drawer collecting dust after a while.  I think I will pass it along to my teenage son who will like to use the rotating brush to clean his skin for the novelty of it, but I suspect he will get bored with it after a short time.</li>
            <li> After reviewing the comments from previous users, i decided to purchase the olay cleansing system.  I love it.  I use it daily along with the olay cleanser.</li>
            <li> Beauty devices like the Olay Professional Pro-X Cleansing System are most accurately reviewed after an extended sampling by the reviewer. Unfortunately, I am a very disorganized person and wont be able to log my opinions for that long. Therefore, I&#x27;ll edit this review as my experience with this product evolves.    First impression: This contraption is rather small. It will travel easily. There is a fair amount of heft to it and, in my opinion, the device is well-built and perfectly capable of surviving a tumble onto a hard shower floor. The battery compartment door can be a source of considerable frustration if, like many, you have a hard time prying it open, however I found that by using a wiggling motion and gripping with the heel of my hand, it comes off without too much trouble.    The bristles are well designed. They strike a fine balance between being too gentle to do any effective cleaning and too harsh or irritating to the skin. The bristles are soft and short, which translates to a firm press with little give when applied to the face. I found the motor to be very adequate for the purposes this device was built for. I anticipate that unless you were to violently press this against your skin, the motor will not stall.    Finally, the process of cleansing itself. I noticed that it was much harder to know which parts of my face I had passed over with the device already, due to both the small surface area of the brush and the lack of feedback for my hands. (I&#x27;m used to using my hands in conjunction with an exfoliating scrub.) In the end, though, I felt that my skin was definitely smoother and cleaner.    Day 3: Improvement in skin, particularly around areas without a bony palette underneath, like my cheeks. Softer. Seems like my hands just weren&#x27;t doing the trick. I&#x27;ve been using it daily and noticed slightly more dryness post-shower, but nothing bad. Moisturizer absorbs more quickly than before and offsets and additional dryness caused by this method of cleansing.    1 week+: After a little while, getting a little doubtful as to whether this is the best product for my acne. Face is softer, true, but it might be irritating. Not sure whether it is the brush or cleanser that I recently switched to. Not liking the condition my skin is in right now...</li>
            <li> I love this product&lt;br /&gt;The brush is not abrasive but you feel it on your skin&lt;br /&gt;My face glows after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;It removes the oil, dirt or make up from the day.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my neck and chest area too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived sooner than advised and was packaged well</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this because it was so cheap. Now, I know why. First, the brush head is TINY. It spins and often falls off. The other cleaning tools clean in a more vibrating, sonic way. After 2 months, the thing just stopped working. For the same price, Amazon sells another item that is very similar.I think its called the Petrika or something.  Also, the Sirius Sonic which is very comparable to the pricy Clarisonic is amazing and only $50. Save your money by avoiding this product and get something of quality. For $25 more the Sirius Sonic will actually last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling hormonal acne for a couple of years now. I recently determined part of the problem is my skin just doesn&#x27;t slough off well enough, or quickly enough on its own. I bought the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System because I wanted to try out one of these types of products, didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune (in case it didn&#x27;t help), and the reviews on this site and others have been really positive. My skin has been better since using this product. I use it twice a day - when I wash my face in the morning, and again at night - sometimes the night cleansing will be with the brush, sometimes I use the brush with one of the two microdermabrasion scrubs I use 2 - 3x a week, after cleansing. It clearly works, as far as cleansing goes - I wash my face with cleanser and my hands first, then use an AHA wash afterwards with this brush, and you can see how much more make-up this product removes, that the actual cleanser missed (and I don&#x27;t apply make-up with a trowel, either!). Nice to see that it really works, but gross to see how little is removed by using a cleanser and no brush. It keeps my skin pretty smooth, and flake-free (especially since I use the microderm and chemical peels at home), and I do think it has helped (along with the AHA products I&#x27;ve recently started using) with excess oil - just in the last month or so, even during hot, hot, hot AZ days, my skin hasn&#x27;t been nearly as oily as it had been before I started using this. Even the \\&quot;hormonal\\&quot; oil that surfaces twice a month - before I started using this, during those times, my skin would feel thick, slick and rubbery, like a seal&#x27;s. So gross. Now my skin is much more like it used to be - some surface shine, but nothing out of the ordinary. If it could just make the chin acne go completely away, I&#x27;d be over the moon, but that&#x27;s more than what this product is made to do. Long story short, get it, I think you&#x27;ll be happy with it. It&#x27;s effective, but gentle - my skin has never been irritated by the brush. I&#x27;m still on the first set of batteries too, and it&#x27;s been at least a month.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item on Sept. 23rd, it was shipped yesterday (26th) and I received it today, so the delivery time was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting but...this seems quite pricey ($26.00) for such a meager little piece of machinery. The way Olay describes the product you&#x27;d think a lab full of rocket scientists developed it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment is EXTREMELY hard to open. After numerous tries, and using all my strength, I finally pried it off. I attached the brush head and turned it on just to see it \\&quot;spin\\&quot;. It was a little wobbly. I thought perhaps I didn&#x27;t insert it properly so I removed it and re-inserted it...same thing, wobble-wobble. Not a crazy lopsided wobbling but for $26 I feel the brush head should be balanced and sheesh, the renewal cleanser is close to $20!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I used it for the first time tonight, along with a dime-sized amount of the small tube of exfoliating renewal cleanser that was included so...we&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;m going to give the product a couple weeks and I&#x27;ll be back to update my review. I do have to say though, the hand-held cleansing brush seems cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 10/30/11  Well...I really, REALLY wanted to love this product. Unfortunately, for me, it made my skin worse. I was always blessed with great skin. However, now that I&#x27;m older my skin has become extremely dry and sensitive. The brush and exfoliating renewal cleanser felt like I was rubbing sandpaper on my face. When I try to put any type of moisturizer on afterwards, it stings because it&#x27;s so irritated. I also have red splotches everywhere. Not only that but my forehead and temples are so dry they&#x27;re peeling. Also, my pores haven&#x27;t gotten smaller and my face doesn&#x27;t feel any cleaner after using this product than it does normally. Glad it&#x27;s worked for the majority of users, I, unfortunately was not one of them :(</li>
            <li> its okay kind of rough i don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> After first using the Pro-X I can honestly say I wasn&#x27;t that impressed, however I continued to use it.  I was very surprised to find that after I skipped using it for a day or two I really missed it.  I also purchased one for my friend and she loves her Pro-X too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a week now. I have dry skin that flakes. I had the Clarisonic Mia for over a year but it got stolen a couple weeks ago while on vacation :( Instead of running out to buy a new Clarisonic I saw this at Walgreens and picked it up. 30.00 well spent my skin is just as smooth and clean as it was when I used my Mia. Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been used for about a month, and so far works great for a low-cost item. I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about 4 months now and it&#x27;s changed my life. I have stubborn cystic acne and it&#x27;s diminished outbreaks greatly and that was not even a result I was expecting at all. I just thought I was going to clean/exfoliate my skin and that&#x27;s all. I only use it every other day as I don&#x27;t want to overexfoliate my skin and it still is very effective. A lot smoother too.     I love the stuff that came with it so much, I bought a big bottle and think it&#x27;ll last a couple of years (really) since the little tube is over 4 months old and it&#x27;s still going strong. Great value and great product.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleansing device.  I can&#x27;t compare it to the Clarisonic since I don&#x27;t have one but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how clean it gets my face.  A lot of the posts mention that it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate - I use it with my regular cleanser and I do get some level of exfoliation.      I had a problem with constantly getting a blemish right around my eyebrow area (likely from using waxy eyebrow pencils to define my brows).  When I use the device to clean my face, I also lightly go over my brow area to remove any makeup.  After the first couple of days of use, I noticed there were \\&quot;flakes\\&quot; in my brows- it was my skin exfoliating off from cleansing in that area.  It fully went away after a couple additional days of using the cleansing device but it showed me that one of the reasons I may have been getting blemishes was because my skin was not being properly sloughed off in the area under the eyebrow hairs.      Long story short, I like my skin more and more everytime I look in the mirror after using this and it seems my blemish spots are fading faster as well.  And, the smallest benefit is perhaps the biggest...  I work hard and I don&#x27;t always have time to pamper myself.  There is just something nice/luxurious about gently working the soft brush around your skin and I feel a little bit special each time I use it.</li>
            <li> Very good, inexpensive compared to clarisonic. the head rotates only in one direction (anti clockwise). two speeds only. seems to hold good charge and runs only on AA battery. skin feels better after using this. i am using olay cleanser and want to try it with some other cleansers and yes i am a guy.</li>
            <li> This is more of a buffer than a scrubber. Also, is very much under powered. I will keep looking for a better scrubber.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day cleansing my face.  At 71, cleansing and moisturizing is important if you don&#x27;t want to look like a shrunken potato.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this product, some how I got the batteries stuck in my original one and it became useless. Overall I really like this cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> Its ok. Not as goot as the main brand</li>
            <li> At 46 I have tried everything to unclog poors and take care of blackheads on upper cheek bones. Most products dry out my skin, which is bad because I have sensitive skin and most moisturizers make it worse. This did not dry my cheeks and took care of the blackheads immediately. If you have been searching for results, but don&#x27;t have a lot of money for high end products, give this a try.</li>
            <li> The Olay system really does work as well as the more expensive Clarisonic. The brush heads are soft, so your skin won&#x27;t look like you have been attacked by Brillo pads! The cleanser is also gentle on my sensitiive, mature (47 yr.old) skin. It is a great product, and I don&#x27;t often leave rave reviews. You can use any products you like with this brush if you are not a Olay user.</li>
            <li> Love this, use it every other night</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush for many reasons. 1) it&#x27;s cheaper 2) it&#x27;s cheaper 3) IT&#x27;S CHEAPER need I say more? I tried the brush for about 2 months, at first it was doing good, but in the end it only enflammed my acne more and caused me to have painful breakouts. I stopped using it and started to use just my hands to wash my face. I stopped getting painful acne but still had some minor breakouts, I turned to the clarisonic with the recent holiday box sale for $119 at sephora which includes a bunch of cleansing goodies free with the clarisonic. Since using the clarisonic my face is much clearer.  My aestichian has said that since the clarisonic uses sonic motion it is gentle on the skin while cleansing, the olay pro x  brush however, is too rough on the skin and brushes are not supposed to rotate because it is too agressive and creates micro-tears in your skin where bacteria can form..which explains my painful breakouts. I think that in the end the clarisonic is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> + has 2 speed settings&lt;br /&gt;- the speeds are slow and turtle&lt;br /&gt;+ the bristles are firm but not abrasive&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t bother with buying the Olay face scrub that they recommend.  It&#x27;s weak, smells unpleasant, and very expenseive ($15?!).  You can get plenty of other decent exfoliant scrubs for $3-8 that work much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product - a sponge or washcloth work just as well.</li>
            <li> I had a more expensive one before this.....like this one so much better. Very glad I purchased it. Makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and remove dead skin!</li>
            <li> I had been eyeing the Clarisonic for a while and saw this in a sale ad. I figured for $30 it was worth a shot to try it before buying the Clarasonic. I am SO glad I bought this! I don&#x27;t even want to purchase the Clarisonic now. It removes all dead, flakey skin and leaves my skin looking fresh and feeling smooth. I really didn&#x27;t beleive it&#x27;d help with wrinkles but my skin does feel tighter and firmer. Even if it&#x27;s \\&quot;not as good\\&quot; (which I think it is) as Clarisonic, it&#x27;s $30 versus $120, worth a shot for everyone!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t conpare to the clairsonic, but it works really well.  My daughter likes it, but wishes the brush held its shape better.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am obsessed with my skin. Just because I rotate three toners, three cleansers, one exfoliator, three moisturizers and a night serum and use eye cream twice a day does NOT mean I have a problem! Preventive maintenance is the key! I was intrigued by this product and was excited to try it. It has a very soft bristle head that snaps on a shaft attached to the motorized body and comes with a tube of exfoliating cleaner. I opted not to use the Olay cleaner and swapped it for my regular exfoliator since the texture and odor were not amenable to me. You are directed to moisten your face, the brush head, and to rub the cleanser on your face. My thought was, why am I doing all the work? Nonetheless, I soldiered on and ran the brush over my face for a minute as directed. My face seemed shiny and polished, but it was also irritated despite the seemingly gentle rotation of the brush. I also had three red splotches on my forehead. I wasn&#x27;t too pleased. Maybe using just a cream cleanser with the apparatus would lead to better results, but why not just use a washcloth and some vigorous scrubbing? Or for that matter, a toothbrush. This might be good for someone with oily and flaky skin that was not sensitive for high-level exfoliation. I personally felt like I had used a rotating sander on my face and need to use extra serum tonight.</li>
            <li> $30 to get $200 results? Yes, Please.  I am a terrible skeptic. Still, I took a chance on a lightning deal and ordered this. I am so glad I did.  Well in to my 40s, I still have oily skin, get pimples and have pores you could land a plane in.  I wont tell you this gave me luminous, perfect skin overnight. However, I have been using this for over a month, and I have seen definite improvement.  My skin is much cleaner looking, much smoother and yes, my pores are less noticeable.  There are two speeds for the spinning brush head. I only use the higher speed. You don&#x27;t have to push the brush down hard against your face to get results. It is easy to clean and fits in a nice, small organizer.  The kit came with a trial size cleanser that helps exfoliate.  I love the spa experience on my time and terms.  This is definitely worth trying.  It has taken me 30 years to find something to work on my pores.  I love this. I use it three to four times weekly.</li>
            <li> the gadget itself is good. but i wish the whole industry (not only Olay, but Neutrogena and Clarisonic too) would stop pushing this &amp;#34;daily cleansing&amp;#34; crap...&lt;br /&gt;your dead skin cells feed the good bacteria that NEEDS to live on your face.&lt;br /&gt;if you remove the dead skin cells daily, you will break out, and you will thin out your skin, and then you will go and buy new products to reverse the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so - it is a good device to use maybe once a week, even better if once every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;do not do it every day.</li>
            <li> Good brush for the price. It&#x27;s very light weight and gentle on my sensitive skin. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best quality but it gets the job done. My face feels cleaner since I&#x27;ve started using it. I pair it with the Purity one step cleanser.  It does come with a sample size exfoliating cleanser but I just prefer using my own cleanser. I made this purchase mainly for the brush.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and looks brighter.  Very impressed!  It is well worth it and the price is right.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and the person said it worked well.</li>
            <li> I spent a great deal of time debating---do I spend $150.00 for the real deal, or get the Olay spin-off!? After reading many reviews, I purchased the Olay one, and boy am I glad. I noticed a difference almost immediately... My face looks fresher, pores are smaller. Incidentally, I had a facial last week during which a Clairisonic was used; the only difference I could tell was the bristles appeared a bit stiffer? If you are on the fence, and money is the issue, go with theOlay one. (I figure I can always move up!)</li>
            <li> Deep cleansing with a gentle massage.  I received this about a week ago and I&#x27;ve used it at least once daily.  Will be giving this as a Christmas gift!!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It&#x27;s cheaper than other systems similar such as the one sephora sells but works just as well.  I would recomend this to anyone.  Leaves skin feeling super clean. And I use my own cleanser instead of the one provided, the results are just as great.</li>
            <li> Love it! I bought another brand and it was so flimsy. I recommend it, it has 2 speed so if you have sensitive skin, use it on low speed and low pressure, it wont irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I had to buy my kids their own because mine kept disappearing from my bathroom. Now we&#x27;ve got three of them. I did buy one that had to be returned because the brush wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;click\\&quot; onto the unit, but amazon was great with the return. We keep them in our showers, and have never had any problems with them. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels really fresh when I use it and I am almost 35.  I am pretty sure it scrubbed off a broken blood vessel that never came back.  I totally love this product but I am also super duper cheap and would NEVER spend $200 on the competitor.</li>
            <li> Works great. I was hesitant to order based on other reviews that the product was too weak to really work but after using it I love it! Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> My family uses this system.  My wife and daughter especially like it because it cleans skin well and exfoliates, cleans much better than just soap and water alone. We have been using it for well over a year now and still love it.  It is also very easy to use. My 8 year old son has eczema and uses it on his own. This product does what it is supposed to do and lasts.</li>
            <li> Although this is much cheaper than the $200 other brand, I have not seen any real improvement for the last week that I&#x27;ve been using it.  I was disappointed that the directions don&#x27;t specifically mention whether you should use this once or twice a day.  I have been using it twice a day (in the mornings with my normal cleanser) but it seems to be too drying to my face so I am going to use it only at night to remove my makeup.  It does a great job at removing makeup and my pores look cleaner, but they haven&#x27;t reduced in size and I still have more black/white heads than I would really like.  I will continue to use for another three weeks, and if I don&#x27;t see some obvious changes I think I will have to purchase the $200 one. (I will also update my review if I see a decent improvement.)</li>
            <li> This little gem does all it says! Clean, exfoliated, beautiful skin for a steal of a deal price! The bummer was that it takes batteries, but I bought rechargeable and am happy as a clam!</li>
            <li> I love, love this product.  I almost bought a clairsonic, which is way more expensive, but after reading some of the reviews on Olay Pro-X, I took a chance and ordered it.  Boy, am I glad I did!!!  My face is looking better then ever and after just a few times using this product, I can tell the difference on my skin.  Not to mention how well my skin absorbs the creams I put on.  I&#x27;m a happy camper.    [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> I just used my pro-x for the first time and I am very pleased with the result. I am happy that the unit is waterproof, so I can use it in the shower. This will help me to use the unit more often. There is only so much time in the day for extra beauty regimens. I used the exfoliating creme in the box first but then used some burts bees peach and willowbark deep pore scrub. I liked the burts bees better. The only concern I have is that the brush looks like it will wear out eventually, so I will have to buy another. Also, the motor seems small. If I bear down too hard I know the unit will stop, which means if I bear down a little, the motor is straining, which will eventually wear it out. I guess when that happens I will be able to afford a new one since the price is very good!</li>
            <li> Requires little time for great results.  I use this 2 to 3 times per week at night with the Regenerist cleanser. Couldn&#x27;t believe the results after (1) week.   Skin is brighter and feels cleaner. Love this product - now looking at other Olay products.</li>
            <li> I just started using this for a week now.  I have normal to dry skin and everytime I use it (which is every other day because I don&#x27;t want to over-exfoliate) my skin ends up so smooth.  My husband even noticed how smooth and radiant my face looked after using the brush with the exfoliation facewash.  It makes my moisturizer work even better and harder than it would normally.  I exfoliate right before going to bed.  My face feels so clean and soft I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! And for those who don&#x27;t know how often to change the brush-head, the box says every 3 months or so based on the wear and tear of the brush.  Spend the money and buy this product, it is cheaper than the competitor but works just as well!</li>
            <li> Great item. Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Product is weak.  I get more exfoliation from rubbing a soapy towel to my face.  I thought maybe the batteries were just old and decided to replace them.  Same problem.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  Go for the Clarisonic.  You do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> After seeing on Dr. Oz, I ordered a set of Olay&#x27;s Pro Cleansing gadget.  It worked as I thought it would be. I do feel cleaner, smoother.  Amazon always a great place to shop, n reasonable price too. Price is on par with Walmart, Ebay.  Order on Amazon if you don&#x27;t live close to Walmart.</li>
            <li> I have tried a large range of facial cleansing brushes (low end to high end) and the Olay Pro-X is definitely the best bang for the buck. It certainly isn&#x27;t as good as the Clarisonic, because the head rotates rather than pulses, thus not cleaning as deep, but for less than $30, it does the job well enough.  Pros:  The brush head did not irritate my sensitive skin  The exfoliating cleanser is great  Thoroughly cleaned my face, leaving it soft and smooth.  Can use it in the shower  Good battery life  Sleek in appearance    Cons:  Package doesn&#x27;t come with extra brush heads  Hard to clean brush head well  Uses rotating motion rather than pulsing motion to clean face, which just cleans the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son to use with his prescribed medication, so I cannot provide a recommendation for the Olay cream.  The brush system itself is great and withstands use in the shower.  The brush is soft and the unit is durable.  All this at a much lower price than much of the competition.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because of the low price, but after reading so many great reviews I decided to give it a try. I had a full face of makeup on and simply splashed my face with water, rubbed the exfoliating cleanser onto my skin and used the brush on low speed about 1 minute and then high speed for the second minute. After I rinsed my face, I used a makeup removing towelette and it was completely clean! This brush left not a trace of makeup on my skin! Not only did the brush feel great on my skin while I was using it, but after moisturizing my skin was so soft and glowing! I am hooked.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be the only person who had no idea how to open the battery compartment and put in the batteries. This product comes with no instructions inside at all and teeeny-weeeny lame instructions on the side of the box, which I didn&#x27;t even see, though I looked pretty hard. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because of that glitch.     Here&#x27;s the good news:  a really cool young woman named Valerie has put up a great instructional video on youtube that includes a battery how-to:  [...]    Lots of people commented that they had searched the web to figure out how to put in the darn batteries and found her site. Olay should pay Valerie a commission. I was ready to return this thing.    Otherwise, this seems like a very good product for the price. It feels high quality, it&#x27;s very simple to use and works great so far. You can use the exfoliating cream that comes with it or use any other cream or facial cleanser you choose.  After using it just once, my skin feels tight, smooth and clean.  I feel sure it will help clean my pores and exfoliate my skin more than cleaning alone or using facial masks.      You can even use it in the shower since its water-resistent, which I think is a big plus. I definitely look forward to using it again.</li>
            <li> This product is useful to remove the dead skin in the face. I use it every other day. My face becomes soft and bright. Good product.</li>
            <li> gift for mom she loves it</li>
            <li> Not a bad brush, a little softer  than the ones I had before.  I like the fact that you can use it in the shower which makes it waterproof. I have not used it for a very long time but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel very soft and smooth. If your skin is really dry or sensitive don&#x27;t use this everyday...1 or 2 times a week with a moisturizing cleanser. Normal or oily maybe 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Having suffered from acne since I can remember and being on various prescription face medication, this is the first time I can honestly say that my skin is noticeably and remarkably clearer. My breakouts are rare and my skin always feels soft and clean after using the brush. I do not use Olay&#x27;s cleansing products on my face, rather those from my dermatologist, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the brush is great to use with other face cleansing products! I would recommend this product to anyone with minor to severe acne to help balance out your skin. As an alternative to other costly face brush cleansing systems which I was not willing to spend the money on, every penny spent on the Olay brush it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oil of Olay pro-X in lieu of spending $150.00 on the competition. An exfoliator by nature, I have used many differnet types of products to exfoliate, including, wash cloths, scrubs, buf-pufs, loofahs, etc. When I learned about this little gizmo, I thought I would give it a try as it was garnering such great reviews from the press and from actual users of a similar more costly product. I thought before I spend all that $$ on the $$$ model, let me try the Olay to see if I liked it.  It was a very good price to deliver a similar effect that the expensive one does, and the reviews on Amazon pointing out the pros and cons are quite accurate. I do use it daily, it does not tear up my skin as one reviewer mentioned, it has two speeds, is easy to work, does not need the recharger which cuts down on it&#x27;s size, can be left in the shower caddy, and was totally worth the money. I am glad that I tried the Olay first and as a result will not invest $150.00 on the original version of this cleansing system, as I cannot imagine it does that much more than the Olay does. It is the same principle, and as I mentioned as an exfoliator, all methods work as long as you are diligent, and know your skin type and how to exfoliate effectively without doing any damage. So if you want another way to exfoliate to change your beauty routine, the Olay Pro-X is a very nice addition to your cleansing routine, and it can be used with any type of cleanser or scrub, according to your skin type.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I feel like I was snowed by all the positive reviews. It&#x27;s nowhere near as good as my Clarisonic was. It&#x27;s actually pretty silly. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Save up for the real thing and get a Clarisonic - I wish I had.</li>
            <li> I bought the Olay Pro X system a few months back. I use it about 3-4 times a week, especially on my beard area. It makes shaving much easier, and the results of my face: much smoother.  For those that say the directions/instructions are not included.....LOOK CLOSELY ALL AROUND THE BOX!  It&#x27;s there...:)</li>
            <li> As good or better than the over priced competitor.</li>
            <li> I considered getting a more expensive facial scrubber but am glad I got this. It feels so good while you&#x27;re using it and my skin is so clean and smooth after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aug 2013- Still working great. Have replaced brush twice which I think is reasonable.</li>
            <li> i love this product very much. it clians very good . thanks amazon for this great product. olay profesional is the best</li>
            <li> This is the first product of this kind that I have tried. It is gentle, but very effective. I love how it is safe to use in the shower without interfering with the function of the product.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this product for me from Amazon three weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been using it 5-6 times so far. I am very happy with the results. My skin is much cleaner and the pores are finer even after the first couple of times. In addition, my skin looks brighter due to the fine exfoliation it provides.   I am 33 (woman) and the skin on my face is mixed, normal to oily on the T-zone and very dry for the rest. I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s better for me to use it longer on the T-zone and only superficial on the rest of my face; otherwise my face tends to get dry. I used the product about 3 times a week. I think more than that would be too much for my skin. I have used it both with the original Olay pro X cleanser (included) and with my regular face washer and I haven&#x27;t seen any difference. Therefore I think the system works with any face cleanser whatsoever. The original cleanser has some micro-abrasive particles but I think the system&#x27;s results are produced by its rotating motion and not by the cleanser. I prefer to use it at night before bed and after each use I apply a moisturizing cream. Although the brush is incredibly soft,it still provides a a nice refreshing massage to the face.  I have not used other cleansing systems before but I have tried all kinds of face washing products with exfoliating power. None of the cleansers by themselves compare to using this system. It definitely is superior.     The brush is recommended to be replaced after 3 months or sooner if it&#x27;s worn-out. The product is very easy to use once you get the batteries in place. I had troubles identifying where the mechanism opens up to insert the batteries; there is not button to push it open, you just have to force down the bottom part of the handle. I had to have my husband do that because it requires a certain force (probably just for the first time).  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I liked how easy this was to use. The brush applied the cleanser easily with no mess. I once used a similar system that had a sponge brush, which I didn&#x27;t like because it was messy and seemed to use up a lot of cleanser. Using this one was no harder than hand-washing my face.  The texture of my skin felt better and cleaner and I think my skin accepted the moisturizer better after using this to cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly, I liked how the brush felt on my skin--a nice gentle massage, something nice to do for myself each day. I feel like it did have an effect on my skin&#x27;s texture, but even if it didn&#x27;t, just the simple ritual of taking time to care for my skin in this way made it a joy to use.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but it did not  take that long for this to break so WARNING... do not waste your $.  Olay will not do anything about it either.  I plan to purchase the Clarisonic (2 year warranty).</li>
            <li> I have been tempted to buy a clarisonic, but could not justify the price.  Love the Olay model.  It is perfect for someone who wants smooth, clean skin - without a lot of effort and investment.  It seems ideal for people like myself who have combination skin!  I am using less produce (toner especially)to clean my skin, which in turn means I&#x27;m having fewer difficulties with dry skin.  Nevertheless, I feel my skin is getting very clean.  I keep fionding myself touching my skin because it is soooo smooth and soft!  The olay microdermabrasion kit is also great.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more after reading others reviews !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing the face with your own hands gives more sense of what you doing .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head falls very easily .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice that it is water poof . But I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again .</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about buying the clarisonic and you would like to try this as an alternative...just go ahead and purchase the Clarisonic. Dont waste your time. This is not what I expected...I absolutely love Olay products, but this didnt make the cut. Ive used this product for a month now because I wanted to make sure that my review was accurate. The price was music to my ears because I originally wanted the Clarisonic is which $195 in comparison to this $30 product. I have been using it for 1 month, every night faithfully and Im not happy. There are any changes in my skin. It doesnt even make my skin feel any cleaner than when I use a face cloth, so I dont understand what the hype is all about. I will be purchasing the clarisonic within the next couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> An excellent product.  The battery case was ridiculously hard to get off.  I&#x27;m pretty strong for a woman, but I couldn&#x27;t get it myself.  The brush is amazingly soft.  I sorta braced myself to use it for the first time, but it actually feels like a wonderful little facial massage.      I&#x27;m in my early-40&#x27;s and have had hormonal acne since puberty.  Prior to using the Pro-X, I&#x27;ve vacillated between using my fingertips with a pricey cleaner (never seemed to really clean that deeply) and a washcloth with a cheaper facial cleaner (cheaper stuff because the washcloth soaks up a lot of cleaner), which feels like a deeper clean.    I thought the Pro-X would work well, but would be more time-consuming and inconvenient than my normal routine, and I was only half right.  It left my face feeling and looking clean and exfoliated, but it wasn&#x27;t any more difficult.  The washing part took slightly longer because of the small brush head, but the time was more than made up by the much quicker rinse time.  And it rinsed a lot cleaner than a washcloth does, too.  So now I get the best of both worlds, with my higher-quality cleaner and my Pro-X.    I was a little concerned about my long hair getting tangled in it, but so far that hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  The brush has gone over some long hair hanging down by my ears in particular, but the hair hasn&#x27;t gotten tangled in the brush.  I do push my hair back when I notice, though.  A headband would solve that problem nicely.    I actually look forward to my little mini facial massage at night, my face looks a lot better, and it&#x27;s at least as convenient as my old wash cloth.  I like it well enough that I&#x27;m considering purchasing one for my tween daughter.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com  Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System     I highly recomend the Olay Professuonal Oro-X to every woman. I bought 2 one for myself and one for my daughter.   I believe I can safely recomend it to young boys going thru puberty.   My face feels so smooth and clean, I use it faithfully morning and night. My Mother passed at 86 years of age and had next door to no wrinkles, she used Oil of Olay products throughout her life.  Betty Taylor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for cleaning but I see no changes in my skin. I&#x27;m happy I did not spend more on the expensive \\&quot;other brand\\&quot; as I suspect I would see no difference with that one either.</li>
            <li> It helps remove all the makeup in my face</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product.t provides a much deeper clean than you can get with just using a cleanser and wash cloth.Overall, a very good product, it is great for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> This helps really get a good scrubbing on your face. It gets into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> I use it more often than I thought I would!</li>
            <li> This is the best cleaning system I&#x27;ve ever bought.  It doesn&#x27;t cut my skin like other brands, and my skin feels soooooo good.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading multiple great reviews and I LOVE IT!  I have severely dry skin and an occasional break out.  I have been using this product for a week now and have noticed a huge change in my skin.  My skin is no longer blotchy and covered in dry patches.  The break out I had on my chin is completely cleared.  My skin is softer and looks great.  I highly recommend this product to anyone that has dry or acne prone skin.  It is gentle and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old guy with a very oily skin, I just wanted to buy something to get rid of that excess oil and old acne scars. I typed in oil control in amazon and this was the first one which grabbed my attention. The reviews were good and so I bought it. Arrived faster than expected, was looking durable. Getting the batteries in requires some effort. I tried it immediately with the sample cleanser provided, and felt that it was a little better than washing with your fingers. Not a microdermabrasion, but that would be expecting too much from a 26 dollar thing. So yeah, it is better than fingers and a scrub, but not as good as the reviews make you believe it is. Anyway its got this 60 day  return policy, so you can try it and return it if you don&#x27;t like it. The bristles were Ok, not soft not hard, I think it depends on your skin type if they are good for you or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this product is best for unclogging pores and preventing blackheads.  I have been cursed with large pores. I thought my exfoliating cleansers were doing a fine job with removing make-up and oils at night. I just figured my acne-prone skin had solely to do with hormones. It wasn&#x27;t until I started using the Pro-X system that I actually realized how much of my make-up and oils remained on my skin after my nightly cleansing routine. My skin feels WONDERFUL immediately after using this, smooth and very clean. It&#x27;s addictive. I use the more vigorous speed at night while removing make-up and then use the gentle slow speed briefly in the morning before applying moisturizer. My pores are definitely less clogged, although I still suffer from hormonal acne and my search for a miracle continues.    Some quick notes about the product:  1. The heads last about a month or a little longer (with twice-a-day usage), before the bristles begin to flatten some. Mine didn&#x27;t come with a replacement head and I wish I had bought that with my initial order to be ready. If you are not using it for make-up removal, the head would probably last longer and will definitely stay more clean.  2. Rinse well after using it. Run it on the fast speed for few seconds to shake off excess water and prop in an upright position to help it air dry. I felt the head lasted longer when kept clean and dry between use.  3. The head is a nice compact size great for cleansing beneath the jawline, behind the ears and neck, and on the temples.  I can&#x27;t compare this with similar products as this is the only one of it&#x27;s kind I have owned, but I like this one so much that I&#x27;m not interested in trying any others yet. :)  A quick note on cleansers: the sample that comes with the system is...eh - okay. It has fine beads in it for exfoliating (it doesn&#x27;t suds at all if that is important to you). I really like Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Pore Scrub (but it doesn&#x27;t get sudsy either). It doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals, dyes, or sulfates for those with sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li> Do not use this product around the eye area. While I was going over the bridge of my nose from my forehead the brush slipped and scratched the cornea of my eye. The whole half of my eye was blood covered....there literally was no white it was all red. I know this was a slip on my part but it is easy to do so be careful while using because the brush spins and is abrasive.</li>
            <li> It is the best cleansing brush I have ever used so far. I like it very much. It removes the makeup from my face clearly.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this since I don&#x27;t like using too many different things on my face. I have psorisis on my face so after I would wash my face, I would get small flakes here and there. Because of this, i had to start putting coco butter on my face. My face can&#x27;t really handle things that harsh and I wanted a way to make sure I got my face completely clean once the day was over.  When I purchased this, I instantly fell in love. It actually cleanes your face NO PROBLEM and leaves your skin looking FLAWLESS. I love this thing and I HIGHLY HIGLY recommend it.  The cleaner scrubes deep in your face like nothing else can and leaves your skin feeling AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Like so many other people I have been toying with the idea of buying a Clarisonic, but was turned off by the high price tag. So I bought this instead, and I wish I could say I didn&#x27;t regret it. This is nothing more than a little spinning brush head. There is no technology behind this and you can just tell it is very basic and cheap compared to the Clarisonic. I don&#x27;t think it did anything above what I can do with a washcloth and a decent exfoliating cleanser. Whereas with the Clarisonic, I really notice a difference in my skin after using it.  If you are realistically never going to spend the money on the Clarisonic, then I guess this could be a great addition to your face cleansing routine to give you some extra exfoliation. But if you&#x27;re looking for something that will actually make a difference in problematic skin, I don&#x27;t think this is going to work for you. If you are like me and you have been going back and forth on which one to buy, skip buying this and just put the money towards the more expensive option... I wish I would have done that from the beginning! Buying cheap is never worth it in the long-run.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty reasonable purchase for those that do not want to pay for the prestige version of this product.  It works well to exfoliate, but the head pops off a bit too easily, which can be annoying in the middle of cleaning your face.  For the price and what it does, I think it&#x27;s a good product, but I haven&#x27;t compared it to the more expensive versions.  I also wish it had one more intensity speed to it.</li>
            <li> Good design...except the brush bristles should be removed from very center. When spinning, the center bristles create a thick point that feels like its in the way.</li>
            <li> I like it! Its a nice soft brush that sloughs off any dead skin. Its not too rough and easy to clean....no complaints!</li>
            <li> I am so amazed by the simple, yet effective nature of this device. It is super inexpensive for what it does for my skin. It deep cleans, exfoliates, shrinks my pores and makes my skin creams go in much nicer. I love how it feels while using it. I&#x27;ve always loved to exfoliate but this just brings it to another level and I like that you are able to use exfoliating cleanser with the brush...or any face wash you like for that matter. I am so glad I bought this and I can&#x27;t imagine buying that other product that everyone is talking about. You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with the Olay Pro X though. Good one, Olay!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about purchasing this because I&#x27;m usually not a huge skin care product fan, but using the cleansing system is like a trip to the spa (without the expense), and it is definitely worth the value. My skin feels clean and refresh after every use, and I have noticed that my skin looks even better than it did before. The results are sooo over my expectations for the cheap price</li>
            <li> Kept my skin clear and clean while I was deployed to the sandbox. Thank you Olay!</li>
            <li> Sometimes i get a little paranoid when a product claims to help the skin. It really is a big thing to say, moreso when you see the market and all the things that have entered it. Luckily I picked this up and I marvelled a pit, noting not only the cost but the wya it worked. It was a grand item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the deep cleaning kick has not been one I hung with for a long time, but it is one I like. I have been trying things for around two-three years now because I felt the way my skin feels when it is refreshed and, luckily, it is nt an impossible feeling to obtain. all you need is a product that can do the speed, reach the pores, and that has something that others do not. That is why I liekd this because it moved with greatness and yet did not feel rough, it went deep but left a face behind, and it is easy to use andyet great when it comes to results. Honestly, it is hard to argue with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that convinces is results and, when used, this is noticeable. Combine that with the dollar amount and oyu know you get two great things in one. That is why I wrote this out and why I endorse the product, not because I have to or because I feel obligated but because it means a lot to me to feel right and this did it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much.  I gave the one I bought at WM to my daughter and when I went back to buy another one they were all gone, went to 5 more stores and everyone was sold out so I bought on line. Couldn&#x27;t wait to get it and when I did I was so happy, you can really tell the difference in the way it cleans your face.</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality spinner-scrubber. The scrubber is very soft and the soap sample that comes with it is nice enough. A few things though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) This product comes with no directions. The words on the packaging are all you get, so you&#x27;re on your own when it comes to figuring how to use it, how many times a day or week, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) I wish the spinner went both ways, it just spins in one direction. Seems like I could get cleaner skin if it was a dual-spin head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) It takes WEEKS to see any changes, such as cleaner pores. Don&#x27;t expect overnight glowing skin. I&#x27;ve been using it on and off for months now and don&#x27;t see any change at all. Maybe I need to use it more, but like I said, with no directions, it&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s too much or too little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) The liquid cleanser isn&#x27;t special at all, nor does it have an appealing smell. You could basically use your favorite skin cleanser with this and it would be just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) The batteries were SO HARD to put in. I&#x27;m normally good at stuff like this (think lots of kid toys with batteries), but it took my about 15 frustrating minutes to get them in, plus using a kitchen knife!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.) It&#x27;s handy that this product is waterproof so you can use this in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.) You don&#x27;t have to spend any more money after buying this product, unlike the Neutrogena Sonic Wave. This has a reusable head (great!) and Sonic Wave has these disposable pads (BAD for enviro &amp; waste of our cash!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my hair totally caught in the product. Oh no, I thought I was going to have to cut it out. Smartly, Olay makes the head pop right off, so all was good once I figured out that solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I was really torn between this and the Clarisonic, given the Clarisonic appears to be very sturdy and waterproof (this is water resistant), but this is just SOOO much cheaper. So I finally broke down and bought the Olay Pro-X today and tried it out.  Only one try so far, but I like it.  It does leave my face feeling soft and smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s too much abrasian for my facial skin.  I plan to use with my own cleanser, so I can use something a little more designed for acne treatment, but the cleanser in the pack feels nice as well.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try out this system to see if it improved the depth of cleansing of my skin. I believe that it does clean the skin better than just using a washcloth or your hands. I like that it has two speeds and that it can be used in the shower. I haven&#x27;t had the problem of water leaking into the housing while using it in the shower (that another reviewer experienced). I haven&#x27;t yet tried the Olay cleanser that came with the brush; I&#x27;ve been using a facial cleanser that I already had. I haven&#x27;t experienced problems with my skin reacting to its use, although I use it every day twice a day. Perhaps that is because I haven&#x27;t used the Olay cleanser yet, which is an exfoliating cleanser (which could result in skin irritation even without using a brush). Overall I think it&#x27;s a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Ten years ago I had microdermabrasion in the dermatologist&#x27;s office.  Great results.  Now, I&#x27;m 66, and after one wash with the Olay system, my skin was very chapped - even after using a moisturizer.  Maybe the cleanser was too harsh for my skin.  Skin does feel cleaner but will try the brush with a mild soap.  I gave the product a high review because it is probably very good on younger skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay Professional Pro-x Advanced cleasing system on Amazon.com after looking in retail stores and it was by far the cheepest.  I paid $28.95 vs. $41.00 at Target \\&quot;on sale\\&quot;.  The product does a great job of cleansing my face and stands up to it&#x27;s claims. I&#x27;ve even lent it to my teenaged son.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a Clarisonic face brush for quite some time, but could bring myself to pay $150.00 - 200.00 for one. I noticed the Olay system, and decided to try it out since it was a fraction of the cost. It works pretty well - It&#x27;s worth the $30.00 I paid for it. I still would like to get a Clarisonic in the future. I have a feeling with the Knock offs on the market they may come down in price.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered very quickly and works wonderful! I love it. Well worth the money verses the expensive ones. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> While waiting for my Pro-X to arrive, I read alot of comments regarding the brush head getting bent, flattened, or otherwise crushed during travel.  After I got mine and used it the first time, I looked around the house and ended up making my own travel protector sleeve out of a (used) K-Cup - the bottom is the exact size of the brush head!  Just tear off the papery K-cup top, pull out the filter and wet coffee grounds and wash the plastic cup out.  Then use a sharp scissors tip to puncture the middle of the bottom and then cut-cut-cut round and round to get the right size hole.  Then drop the Pro-X brush head down into the K-Cup and let the tip go through the hole you made and then stick it back on the Pro-X.  It reminds me of when a dog has to wear one of those lampshade-looking things.  Anyway, this temporary fix will do until I use up a little plastic container of mineral face powder.  Actually this will work even better for travel so the brush won&#x27;t take a beating inside a cosmetic case.  At home I&#x27;ll just let it dry in place with the Pro-X on its side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a gadget like this and I just love it.  I was always a face scrubber so at first I thought it should feel stronger.  Then my wise daughter reminded me I&#x27;m using an exfoliant gel and to just let the gel work around with the brush and do its job.  I was really surprised how different my skin felt afterwards.  The moisturizer went on and absorbed well instead of feeling like it was sitting on the surface.  I haven&#x27;t decided how often to use it but maybe every other day...  we&#x27;ll see.  I mainly want my skin to look healthier rather than oily-flaky in places.  With dead cells removed regularly and better utilization of the skin products, it should be right for my routine.  This is far better than the puff kinds of exfolient pads we&#x27;ve all tried.  Wow those were harsh even for a scrubber like me.  May as well have used Lava soap on my face!  Yikes!</li>
            <li> This is the best beauty purchase I made in 2011. Obviously most people can&#x27;t talk about this without mentioning the Clarisonic, and I was torn between getting this and dropping $200+ on a Clarisonic Plus, and in the end decided to try this out. If it didn&#x27;t work out, oh well, less than $30 lost. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and it is absolutely fantastic. I have stubborn blackheads and enlarged pores on my nose and cheeks, and the results with this are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clarisonic does have additional options for different brushes, but I don&#x27;t honestly see the need for that. I don&#x27;t really need a special body brush, I use this all over. The replacement brushes for this are less than $10 on Amazon, whereas the replacement heads for the Clarisonic can be up to four times that much. It&#x27;s no contest. Sure, I could buy the Clarisonic, it would look a lot prettier in my bathroom and it&#x27;s a lot fancier and has more bells and whistles, but this little guy gets the job done and leaves me with lots of extra money for makeup and other goodies :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update February 2013: I actually received a Clarisonic as a gift last year and didn&#x27;t feel right leaving this review as it was. I have to say that the Clarisonic is better in every way, my skin feels completely different after using it. That doesn&#x27;t take away from the cleansing capabilities of Olay&#x27;s product -- yes, it cleanses well and I did see a difference in my skin, probably due to the light exfoliating effect and the thorough cleansing. Previously, I wouldn&#x27;t even thoroughly clean my face every day(gross, I know), so I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a factor when considering the efficacy of the Olay cleansing system. The difference with the Clarisonic is that it goes a step beyond that. I use it two or three times per week and my skin has a different glow about it. I break out less, my pores are visibly smaller, and I even find that makeup goes on more smoothly. So yes, for $20, the Olay cleanser is great, but if you&#x27;re looking for the effects of the Clarisonic, this isn&#x27;t a substitute.g for the effects of the Clarisonic, this isn&#x27;t a substitute.</li>
            <li> just what i expected for the price - not super powerful though has two speeds</li>
            <li> Love it and saw a big difference in my skin shortly after I started using it.  Can&#x27;t imagine ever going without it!</li>
            <li> I have battled with oily skin and acne througout the years but as you get a bit older acne products dry out a lot so I bought [[ASIN:B000V3J4MQ Olay Total Effects Anti-Blemish Daily Cleanser - 5 Oz]] It was working good but not perfect. But then I bought the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and began using them together. In five days my husband noticed my skin was clearer! Two months later I am able to get away with not using makeup on weekends and fell confident! I also use Clinique Anti-Blemish makeup. With the three products I have seen great results!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time</li>
            <li> This was a gift to someone and they said they liked the main product, which was a facial scrubber, but the Olay cleansing cream that came with the facial scrubber was not a good product. The cleansing cream that came in a tube with the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System was a total rip-off. The tube could have been half the size, which was small in the first place, there was a lot of air in the tube, not only did it not feel like it was cleaning the face it didn&#x27;t clean the face and it never lathered up. Very disapointed in the cleansing cream but the facial scrubber was great.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and soft, I did not want to invest $200 on a facial brush and this one does the trick for me. What I don&#x27;t like about it is the difficulty in changing the batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen products like this for in excess of $150, and I can&#x27;t imagine them being any better than this one.  The Pro-x brush is so soft and gentle, and it cleans my skin beautifully.  No sign of make-up or exfoliation!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it consistently for a week. I have noticed my pores have shrunk and my skin&#x27;s looking healthier.</li>
            <li> I bought this product out of frustration, actually.  I am fed up with skin problems.  I have what would be classified as mild acne, but I&#x27;m 28 and sick of it.  I have paired this brush with the AcneFree face wash system daily, and I have not had a breakout in over a week (a record for me).  My pores are less prominent and appear smaller.  My skin is smooth.  It would have gotten 5 stars, but the battery gasket does not look like it will hold up over time.  Overall, this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this 11 months ago along with the cleanser and exfolliant. I have to say I am pleased with the results. you need to cleanse first and then use the exfolliant. I have fair skin and during the winter months I didnt use it everyday . But it delivers what the higher priced products do. I saw a segment from Dr. Phils s company \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot; and the plastic surgeon said you would get very good results if you used it regularly. I do and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about buying the Clarisonic Mia...I had heard great things but even at the cheaper price of the Mia I didn&#x27;t feel like I could justify plunking down that much on a facial brush.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea if the Clarisonic is better than the Olay ProX but I do know that the Olay version is amazing and well worth the $. It has completely changed my skin, I had milia on my cheeks for yearsss and nothing could get rid of them. I changed creams, used scrubs, facial peels, etc. I even had extractions done by a facialist who only mauled my face and left scars that took months to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;The Olay brush removed almost 100% of my milia in less than a month of 1x daily use.&lt;br /&gt;My face is baby soft, I keep on feeling it and am amazed--my skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft or looked this good since high school&lt;br /&gt;If it helps, I am 27 years old with combo skin and have been using this brush for at least 3 months now</li>
            <li> There is no holder for the cleansing system product as I would of brought another one that had it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I expected too much, but this device seems to make no difference at all to the way my face feels after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit rough if you press too hard, but with gentle use feels just fine.  I&#x27;m not a teenager with pimple or acne problems so perhaps it works better for them, I wouldn&#x27;t know.  For a middle aged woman it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> I notice absolutely no difference after using this product, other than my skin feeling tighter in an uncomfortable way. I have large pores. They look exactly the same before and after exfoliating. I now only use this after a night out when I&#x27;m wearing more makeup than usual that needs to be scrubbed off.</li>
            <li> I love my Olay ProX cleansing system.  I recommend the cleansing system to anyone who needs a deep penetrating brush.</li>
            <li> My bf raved about clarasonic. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a small fortune on a brush. I did some research. To my delight, Olay makes a cleansing brush 75% less than clarasonic. I am very pleased with my product. I still use my skin care brand which is Origins. The brush swirls around the face. The brush doesn&#x27;t feel harsh nor tickle my face. Afterwards, my face feels refreshed( I use a toner after cleaning). When I use my moisturizer on my face,my skin feels smooth. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought since the first one I bought a couple of years ago stopped working (not because of battery replacement). I had loved the cleanser sample that had came with it but with this second box the unsealed cleanser was definitely not the same thing! Kind of gross, had a weird consistency that was not right and I did not put it near my face out of fear of what it is. Another case of a tampered product from Amazon. Sigh.</li>
            <li> Thanks to another reviewer (whose directions I printed out), I would have never been able to open battery compartment.  Have only used it for a month or so, but am hoping it works on oily skin better than a sponge/washcloth. Best price I had seen on this.</li>
            <li> Not as high powered as my last one, but it works nicely.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than getting it in store, used a couple of times per week for about two weeks, face is now peeling all over thus stopped using for now.</li>
            <li> I used to break out often on my cheeks. I tend to have really oily skin on my cheeks and dry skin on my forehead. The first week or two, my skin was all over the place, but I stuck with it because another reviewer says that will fade away. After using it for almost a month, my skin looks SO much better. It&#x27;s smooth, haven&#x27;t had break outs in a while. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> for what i paid for this for my wife, it has been excellent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written a review for anything, but I just had to for this! I have combination skin, fairly dry, but deal with frequent break outs on my chin. I&#x27;ve tried multiple facial washes and face creams from the drug store, Clinique, and my dermatologist. Literally after using this product one time, my skin felt incredibly smooth and refreshed. I&#x27;m not afraid to spend money on products that work, but honestly this is all I need! If you&#x27;re debating about purchasing it just do it!</li>
            <li> This should be a definite buy for anyone who&#x27;s looking for facial cleansing products. For the price, it works out very well. :)&lt;br /&gt;However, make sure you put it on low speed and not pressure on your skin. It will be rough and cause irritation and lots of dry skin and peeling if used with too much pressure.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I &#x27;ll add to this review after I&#x27;ve used the brush but so far all I can say is absolutely useless design - nothing on the package tells you how to open it to install the batteries so I googled instructions which said \\&quot;gently rock\\&quot; the battery compartment and pull at the same time. That didn&#x27;t exactly work for me....I was unable to open the battery compartment until I got mad and threw it across the room and it loosened up when it hit the granite countertop. Like I said, I&#x27;ll use it for awhile and add to this review.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, didn&#x27;t come with instructions but luckily I watched a how to video before purchasing product, very gentle on skin, my skin feels softer after using this and seems to have a glow. I used the wash it came with but noticed some blemishes. Starting to form but switched back to my usual wash and everything went back to normal.</li>
            <li> I bought and returned a Clarisonic a few years ago because it irritated my skin.  I thought about trying it again to see if it would work for me now, and I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews on the Olay cleansing system first.  I agree with many other reviewers here that this is just as good a device as the Clarisonic and comes with a MUCH cheaper price tag. Try this one and skip the more expensive devices.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After wanting a Clairisonic for like 3 years, my husband bought me this instead. And I admit, it&#x27;s not half bad! My face feels softer after using it, that&#x27;s for sure. You can use pretty much any cleanser that you want, but exfoliating kinds work best. I wish the brush head had a higher speed, and that there were multiple brush heads, but it still does the job. I have never used mine in the shower, just at the sink, so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I notice that while using it, it kind of splashes the face wash all over my face and the mirror, which can be a little annoying. Overall though, I&#x27;m glad I got this instead of spending that $130 on a Clairisonic.</li>
            <li> I asked for this product for christmas and i got it! i started using it the same night and it has got to be the most amazing item i have ever owned! I am a makeup artist where i go to work wearing so much makeup. I normally used to just clean my face with wipes and then wash my face with face wash and i used to break out sometimes... since getting this item i clean my face with wipes and i use this machine with my regular face wash and it cleans so much better!!!! i can even see brown makeup still coming off..i haven&#x27;t broken out since!!! i would highly recommend this item if you are thinking of getting..best present ever!!</li>
            <li> I have had the Pro-X for about six months, and using it in conjunction with my regular acne system it has actually reduced the number of pimples I have at any given time from 8-9 to 4-5. This is with no change in my other acne products at all. It gets your skin super clean and with time leaves it with a glow. Make-up goes on smoother, moisturizers and acne products soak in more quickly and over-all better. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> When comparing products this one can&#x27;t be beat. It perfoms just as well as other brand priced much higher. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought the Susan Lucci on OVC for about 65.00 bucks. Was not impressed with machine and it stopped working after only a few uses. This is in a home with only myself and hubby, so the machine only had one used. Fortunately, I do have the line of products that came with it.   Got this today, and love it already. The S. Lucci had a larger buffer and cleansing wheel, but this smaller one is better.  Love this! Small, comfortable in hands, waterproof and the sample Olay cleansing cream is good too. Once I use that up, onto the S. Lucci assortment. You won&#x27;t go wrong if you choose this item.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial machine for the best price. It gets your skin soft clear and glowing will recommend to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> I debated endlessly about the Clairsonic, but the price held me back.  I was about to spring for the CS when I found this Olay Pro-X recently at Costco....$36 for the device, a full 6 oz. tube of the Olay Pro-X exfoliating cleanser, an extra brush head, and 2 batteries. Seemed like a good deal.  By the way, putting in the batteries isn&#x27;t rocket science, it was quite easy!    What I was looking for:  an end to dry patches of flaky skin.  I have good clear skin, but at 62 I have had endless problems with flaky skin.  I also have very sensitive skin, so using a washcloth and also using the exfoliating cleansers so often in my attempts to control dry patches left me with red, irritated skin...and still flaky.  Nothing seemed to help.    I was worried that the CS or this one would leave me with very red, inflamed skin from the brushes and the cleansing action.  Not so.  Ten days of using this and there has been zero redness or irritation from its use, and my skin is smooth as silk and best of all,  no more flakes or dry rough patches.  I&#x27;ve always washed my skin carefully, but it has never felt this smooth and silky, I see a definite difference from using this.  I didn&#x27;t expect to like the Olay exfoliating cleanser (I&#x27;ve tried some of their other cleansers which were too harsh), but I really like this one...it&#x27;s extremely mild with very tiny granules in a creamy base, but thus far I&#x27;m using it only every few days, no need to use it daily.  My current favorite am/pm cleanser is Aveeno&#x27;s ultra calming cleansing cream, which works wonderfully with this device.  I use the Pro-X every evening, and occasionally in the morning on a dry spot here or there if I detect any sign of flakes anywhere.  So using the Pro-X once a day is not too much when used with a gentle cleanser.  You do not push the brushes into your skin; rather, you just let them barely touch the skin and slowly move the brush around.  It feels wonderful....so much so that you don&#x27;t want to stop!    The brushes are incredibly soft, by the way.  As for the two speeds, I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the two.  The first, slightly slower speed might be better when using the exfoliating cleanser, and the faster one for just regular daily cleansers. But really, the difference in the two speeds is barely detectable if at all.  And by the way, a couple of reviewers mentioned that this device flings water all over...absolutely NOT SO.  I held it away from my face to see what it would do, and it didn&#x27;t send any water anywhere at all.  I can&#x27;t imagine what these folks did to produce that effect!    I can&#x27;t comment on how long the batteries last yet.  If they seem to go too fast, I may get the rechargeables recommended in an earlier review.    I also can&#x27;t compare to the Clairsonic.  They do work differently, apparently.  The CS vibrates very fast....I saw one in Sephora the other day and was able to turn it on.  Its brush was very soft, and it didn&#x27;t seem like it would be in the least bit harsh.  The vibration of its bristles did seem different from Olay&#x27;s device,  which rotates in a circular direction rather than just vibrating.  Somehow I think this rotation might work better for the flakiness issues, but I wouldn&#x27;t really know unless I tried them both.  However, at the Olay price point, I&#x27;m 100% happy with this product and I&#x27;ve stopped lusting after the Clairsonic, no need to spend that much money since I&#x27;m getting the results I want from the Olay.    A final comment:  You can over-do putting products on your skin, and you can increase skin problems because of what you are putting on your skin...overkill, if you will.  I saw this for myself.  In trying to stop the irritation, redness, dry patches and flaking, I was using too many products, and my skin was reacting to all these things.  What ended up working best was gently cleaning my skin with very gentle no-fragrance cleansers (Cetaphil is fabulous, the Aveeno I&#x27;m using is as well), and avoiding harsh products because they are not needed.  I found that less is more.</li>
            <li> Just as good as a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Size is small and handy even for people with big hands. Brush can be slightly bigger. The speed seems slow even on turbo but after a while, I got used to it.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift from my sister.  I was actually contemplating purchasing the Clarisonic cleanser after reading such great reviews from the beauty blogging community, but was hesitant because of the price.  On a daily basis, when wearing makeup, I wipe my face with Neutrogena makeup removing towelettes, and then I use a face wash and rinse.  Even so, I felt my face was not fully clean.  I use the Olay cleanser in the shower, and it really makes my face feel super clean.  My face is acne-prone and I use an acne prescription, Differin, which regenerates the skin with new skin cells, so I can&#x27;t exfoliate everyday since it would be too harsh, although I wish I could because it makes my face feel amazingly clean and soft.  My forehead had a bit of cystic acne but it&#x27;s all cleared up since I&#x27;ve started exfoliating.  I&#x27;m glad I hadn&#x27;t purchased the Clarisonic, it might work better - never tried it, but I&#x27;m not complaining about the Olay cleanser so I&#x27;m satisfied with this.</li>
            <li> After extensive research on the Clarisonic (both the Pro and the Mia), I opted for the Olay Pro-X. I figured for under $30, even if I hated it/it broke/the batteries died, I wouldn&#x27;t be out more than, say, a dinner at Chili&#x27;s. That being said, the Pro-X has far exceeded my expectations in most areas.   The battery compartment was much easier to open than most reviewers reported, but that&#x27;s probably because I read all the way to the last paragraph of K. Sprite&#x27;s review, where she tells you how to do it. Read and follow her instructions and you&#x27;ll have no problems.  The batteries included with the unit have lasted over 3 months with regular use (7-10 times a week). I have had no trouble with the brush draining/drying, as I set it on the edge of the sink with the brush part slightly off the edge. I don&#x27;t use the scrub that was included because I prefer Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s Daily Pore Scrub, which works incredibly well. I use the Pro-X both in and out of the shower, and it travels so well I&#x27;m thinking of getting a second one to keep in my travel bag.  The only thing I was disappointed in was the strength/speed of the motor, but to be fair, I was hoping for something more like a sandblaster, where the Pro-X is more like a polisher. This is actually a good thing, because it means I can use it daily without turning my face into hamburger.  All in all, I am extremely satisfied with the Pro-X&#x27;s performance and results. My skin has never been so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Never used the face wash that came with it, but the brush is a must have!!! My face is noticeably clearer and cleaner and it wasn&#x27;t that bad to begin with.</li>
            <li> Did not really notice a difference, I gave it a month and it did not feel like it did anything. I guess I&#x27;m out the money for this and now ill have to shell out the 100 for the good one. I can&#x27;t believe this had so many positive reviews. Im disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various cleansers and they all work great with this. This helps to bring out a healthy glow and radiance (that might be the first time I ever said that word) to my face.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product after watching a segment on &#x27;The Doctors&#x27; about effective cleansing. It was mentioned as being a good, cheap alternative to expensive salon treatments.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, light-weight and does a great job. I use it every second day with my cleanser and I have noticed a difference in my skin; I have fewer blackheads and breakouts. For a cheap product, it is very effective and I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> After watching sales pitch for similiar product, on one of the shop TV programs, I found this Olay product on Amazon.  I am more than happy with the results I am getting.  In fact, could see/feel results after one use!  And, the best part is, this Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, cost much less than the product I saw advertised.  I have used Olay products for many/many years, with total satisfaction!</li>
            <li> Have been very pleased with this product.  I saw immediate improvement in cleanliness of my pores.  I have not used it every day but I use it 3 or 4 times a week with great results.  I use it on my neck also where I have a lot of sun damage.   I thought it would be more powerful but of course, realized, it did not need to be or it would do damage. First use, sloughed off dead skin, felt great. Since then, the blackheads where my glasses sit under my eyes, my chin and my nose are showing great improvement.  Just have to keep using it regularly.  I do wish it came with a replacement head rather than have to go out and get one later.  But all in all, very pleased, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> First of all I bought Olay Professional Pro-X just to see how to really use the brush. I have been wanting the clarasonic for a long time but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price for it. I use it everyday..absolutely love it. Only takes 5 mins. My face is smoother and pores seem to be smaller. Helps with exfoliation also. So glad I tried it out first. Well worth the money. Kids like it also. thanks Olay for a great product.</li>
            <li> Probably would be a great product if it worked, any amount of water and it stops working until fully dry again, although it says its made for use in the shower, its quite expensive for the product you actually get. Also the battery compartment was filled with clear goo? thought it was just my face wash leaking in to it, but after reading another review I found it has happened to others</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so good after I use it. Love it.</li>
            <li> I liked the novalty of this when i first bought it but i never noticed any appreciable difference in my skin quality after a few months of using it.  I have since stopped using it and just use the cleanser from the Pro-x line. It takes too long to use this brush for no benefit.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin (including rosacea spots on a fairly regular basis. I was afraid of anything scrubbing my face but this is very gently and the cleanser that comes with it seems like it might be too harsh but it wasn&#x27;t for me. It was very gentle with no fragrances. I think I will be able to use this every other day with moisturizer afterwards. I have only use it sporadically at this point and every time I do, my skin is smooth and not flaky or irritated for days.</li>
            <li> Love this, my face is shiny clean afterwards. No reason to buy the more expensive types of brushes out on the market. I have since bought these for myFriends and family because I am so excited to share this with them. I don&#x27;t know what I did without it!</li>
            <li> It is so gentle and clean my face well. I bought anothe expensive cleaning brush before I got this product.However, Olay is the best. I even bought more for my friends.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the performance of the Olay Pro-X.  It cleans without irritating your skin and leaves your skin feeling clean and squeaky.  Perfect for travel as it is small and it requires no fuss to use it.  Everyone in the family should own one.</li>
            <li> OK, I had to try it.  That being said, I would not buy it again - no power.  I personally think you fare better using the cleansing bath gloves on your face.  I was looking for a portable machine to travel with to replace my Clarisonic but \\&quot;there ain&#x27;t no such animal.\\&quot;  I will just use the cleansing bath gloves and buff puff until I return home.  I did buy a set of replacement brushes to go with it but I don&#x27;t think I will ever use it again.  It doesn&#x27;t have much power and you&#x27;re better off using your hands with a micro-dermabrasion cream than this brush.  It&#x27;s just too small - about one-third the size of the Clarisonic and not even powerful enough to use as a shoe polisher.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this item , but reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot.  Wish I had bought this sooner.  Great item. I have only used it for a week but I can tell a noticeable visible difference in my skin. It looks brighter and softer. You can also use this brush with other cleansers of your choice. So I use it with my acne cleanser also. The only negative I have seen is the battery case is rather hard to open. Hopefully it will get easier in time. I would highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> Extremely gentle yet it got my face cleaner than it has ever felt.  After reading the other reviews I was skeptical that it would get my face that much cleaner than a rough wash cloth or cleansing pad but it really did.  It also felt very nice.  I use it two times a day.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, would recommend to everyone. Have been using this for two weeks and skins feels great. Excellent value too.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life!?  I adore this product because it works so well and feels so awesome on my face and neck.  It really works to clean your face and I will use it always.  Worth the buy and a must have for any woman.</li>
            <li> I feel the exfoliating scrub could be a little stronger or the brush should be a little stiffer.  I will see what else is available to use with the brush.</li>
            <li> Has visibly reduced blackheads even with my own face wash. I shave my head and it exfoliates my scalp, just love this thing. Dont need to overdue on the time, just a quick few min in the shower and BAM - done.  I would say a pad can last a few weeks if used once maybe twice a day. I am in need of more.</li>
            <li> This cleansing system works realy well, I have some acne issues due to hormones and this is helping alot. I break out alot on my chin and forehead and i&#x27;ve only used this 4 times so far and I can already tell a difference in my skin. I use it wil cetaphil and it cleans really well. I don&#x27;t have any other time of spinner cleaner so I can&#x27;t compare it to another system but I can imagine that I am getting my money worth, vs. spending over $100 for some other product. In a nutshell, I love it!</li>
            <li> Mine did not work from the start. Went through several batteries and nothing.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product very much, I wish I had purchased it sooner, it works like a charm.  I don&#x27; know why there has to be so many words for a review before you can post!</li>
            <li> I have probably tried every system out their for skin. I&#x27;ve used all the cleansers, masks, prescription medications, etc. This has worked the best for me. I love this thing, I use it with Olay exfoliating cleanser at night and in the morning I just use my St. Ives Green Tea cleanser (I&#x27;m not made of money) and I think it doesn&#x27;t matter so much what kind of cleanser you use because either way the brush is what&#x27;s really doing the trick. I love this, buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  Batteries and brush last for a really long time.  I use it with my proactiv+ set instead of Olay products but I really love how clean it makes my skin feel.  It gives you a thorough cleaning and clears out pores that you may not have been able to get to before with your bare fingers.  If you are not used to using exfoliators like this, the brush head may seem a bit rough at first but it softens up with use and your skin gets used to it.  My face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the Olay Pro-X Cleansing System to help with removing makeup/oil and exfoliating my face. In my opinion this is definitely worth the price. If you were to purchase a Clarisonic the basic cleansing system is $119 and the only difference is a larger brush and product color. I use this at least twice a week and my skin feels smooth and great afterwards! Plus you can use your own facial cleansers or scrubs. I would also watch YouTube reviews comparing the Clarisonic and Olay. Overall, it works just like it is supposed to!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this - I can feel my face needs some serious exfoliating.  I spent the last twenty minutes trying to open the battery compartment.  My hands are raw and red.  I tried force, I tried gentle tension. I seriously feel like I bought a shake and weight.  I used every muscle in my upper arms and hands to try and rock it open, it just WON&#x27;T BUDGE.  I watched youtube videos, I tried to pry it open with a screwdriver.  I am now on hold for 15+ minutes with the customer service number I found here within the reviews and they&#x27;re extremely busy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never returned any item I purchased from Amazon - this will be my first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t blame Amazon at all, this product really needs a seriously better battery redesign. It&#x27;s too bad - because I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  I really like it.  The other product has more &#x27;stuff&#x27;, like a delicate brush for sensitive skin, which might be nice to have, but I&#x27;ve found that if you&#x27;re gentle with it and you don&#x27;t try to scrub your face, this is just fine.  Glad I didn&#x27;t spend $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/3/2013 - it&#x27;s been a year - I&#x27;d still igve it 5 stars...</li>
            <li> The brush is firm enough for me. Better than a lot of brushes I used before. My skin is now red but I do it on purpose since I really want to exfoliate. I don&#x27;t know if that tube of cleanser worth that much of money. I can get another one, such as Biore, lower price. I recommend this brush for people with oily skin and acne problem. One word, exfoliate!</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as some of the others on the market. Average performance.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I&#x27;m a dude. And I use this. Its been working good for a year now, and i drop it ever time I take a shower. It still works fine..no damage other than a few dents in the bathtub. wet it before use and then sand all the crap outta your face. it gets soft when wet and does the job good with some facial cleanser or with plain old water in case you forgot to purchase the cleanser for the last two months. like me.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than the similar product Macy&#x27;s is selling. works fine so far. been using it about 3 months. seems to be fairly resistant to shower water and steam.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research first on the clarisonic system and I just wasnt ready to invest that much money into it yet so figured id try this out and im happy I did..Its a fraction of the cost of clarisonic and if you ask me they do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Olay pro-x cleansing brush for about two months now and everything seems to work so far. I can see my pores were more deeply cleaned after just one to two uses. My skin is getting more clear and clean, especially the \\&quot;T\\&quot; area. The best result I saw was the nose and chin area: much less blackheads. The brush is soft enough and won&#x27;t hurt my skin, but I won&#x27;t recommend using this brush every day since it will thinner the skin. I use it two to three times a week, and it has been great so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Brush that works and doesn&#x27;t cost much, and replacement brush head is not expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Light weight and portable. Great for travel!&lt;br /&gt;Water proof so it can be used in the shower. I did try it out and it is proved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Changing batteries is difficult because the cap is TOO tight (makes sense tho cuz it is water proof).&lt;br /&gt;No carrying bag for this product. I still put it in the original box after each use, and it is annoying cuz the box is big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a four star because there is no storage bag to put the product into after use. I wish Olay will manufacture a small bag/box to store it so that I won&#x27;t need to use the original box.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s so much easier to wash my face.  I keep it in the shower and I just wash my face as part of my regular shower routine.  Easy to use, batteries have lasted about two years and my face feels fresh every time.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, I had used clearsonic once, but my skin breakout day before the use. So I decided to go with this coz this one is lighter than clearsonic. Works great on my skin. Would recommend to those who have sensitive skin and first time users.</li>
            <li> Got one of these on a recommendation from my sister. I&#x27;ve had it about 2 months now. It helps slough off dead skin and keeps me from having skin problems. It is not a miracle worker (hence 4 stars rather than 5) but I have no complaints. Bristles are pretty soft and the rotation speed is fairly slow helping it do the job without too much abrasion.  I use it in the shower with no problems. Leaves my face feeling a little dry with the included facial scrub so you will probably want a moisturizer to use afterwards. I use it once or twice a week.  I imagine i will need to buy a new bristle brush after about 6-12 months of use because the bristles are starting to tilt/lay down a little bit. This model is quite a bit cheaper than other brands and amazon had it cheaper than my local store.</li>
            <li> After using the cleansing system for ~2 days I began to break out.  I think this was due to the irritation the brush causes.  I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, so was surprised.  I tried to use it for a couple more days to see if my skin would improve, but it did not.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this item and so far i&#x27;m very impressed with the item. My skin isn&#x27;t dried out after using it and I already see a difference with my skin and breakouts. This is definitely a must buy for great skin, deep cleansing at it&#x27;s best. It&#x27;s like having a mini facial at home.</li>
            <li> Had a Clarisonic that died after a year (and I didn&#x27;t really use that much). This works MUCH better and doesn&#x27;t take up room on the counter while charging...just needs two batteries. Face feels much cleaner after using this one than the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I reacted to the free sample exfoliator (sensitive skin) but the brush is excellent and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I bought this product because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on the Clarsonic. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. It has gotten my face cleaner than facial washes and scrubs that I have used in the past. I have very sensitive skin so I was unsure what it could do for me. I loved the little sample that came with it. I used every drop until I had to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will mention is opening it can be a pain. I used a butter knife to pop the bottom open for the batteries. Other than that this is a wonderful product and I love it!</li>
            <li> The product works as intended. But for me, I was wanting stiffer bristles on the brush. For me they are too soft. I&#x27;m thinking I need a belt sander at this point. I&#x27;d say they are of medium stiffness. Probably perfect for most.</li>
            <li> The brush surface area is too small. Otherwise, it works out fine.</li>
            <li> I have used the $200 cleansing system in the past. If you&#x27;re looking for something comparable but without the big price tag, this product is great. The main differences are: this system takes batteries (not rechargeable), does not include a case, brush head spins in a circle as opposed to back-and-forth. Also, the brush head is smaller. But, it does the job!</li>
            <li> I had been saving up to buy a Clarisonic cleansing brush after it was strongly recommended to me during a professional makeup consultation. While I was waiting for my birthday to roll around in order to justify spending the $200, I saw a commercial for this product from Olay. The other Amazon reviews led me to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now, and it is still working great on the original batteries. It has made all the difference in my skin and I use it almost daily. It gets rid of all the dry, flaky skin that was plaguing me. I did get a recommendation from an aesthetician to avoid using a cleansing brush with an exfoliating cleanser since it might harm the device, so I just use it with one of the other Olay foaming cleansers. This has been such a great find that I signed up to get one monthly through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save service, and now I&#x27;m giving one to all my friends for their birthdays this year!</li>
            <li> Great price and daughter loves it works great</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was really surprised by how well this Olay Cleansing System works. After using it for a few months now, my skin has never looked better. The brush is soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but the rotating motion does a much better job of cleaning than just soap and a washcloth. I use the Olay Cleanser or occasionally some other liquid cleansers and am always amazed at how well it removes every trace of makeup and leaves my skin and pores looking spotless. My makeup seems to go on smoother after using it and it also helps keeps away the flakiness of dry winter skin. Even after a few months, I&#x27;m still using the original batteries and brushes, so it&#x27;s pretty low maintenance. I considered the more expensive cleansing brushes, but with how well this Olay has worked for me, I don&#x27;t see the need to pay triple the price for a different brand.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and deep pores that often get clogged. This product is so gentle and leaves my skin exfoliated and cleans my pores! It really shakes up the dirt. After I use the Pro-X, I will use a clinique toner to pull up any excess dirt/oil/makeup. I love this and it is such a great price. Other stores were selling it for over $30. I love it!!</li>
            <li> So two years ago I saw this really expensive brush that I couldn&#x27;t afford, it like made me mad cuz I wanted my skin all pretty like the picture said. Ok anyways I got over it quick when I saw the price, I was watching tv last night and saw a comerciall for this product and googled it.  Ok so I read alot of the reviews on here.  Seemed like some people who maybe work for this expensive other face brush company are trying to bash olay because it&#x27;s a steal of a price.  Which made me want it even more ok.  So I actually went to target payed 20 something plus tax.  I have to say those little black dots that I can see in my magnified mirror are 90 percent gone! WTF I just used it once so haha to the expensive fancy rip off brand.  You guys got schooled by olay.&lt;br /&gt;  Ok also I got to call out some peoples reviews.  The battery compartment is easy to work also the instructions are on the box and way simple it says wiggle and pull duh pops right off oh and it came with it&#x27;s own batteries the good brand to.  Someone said it didn&#x27;t say how long to use it....uh once again the box said 60 seconds.  So whoever said they needed a kitchen knife is probably an old fart with arthritis or something.  Olay you guys are awsome and Thankyou for making this product affordable to everyone who has sense enough not to drop hundreds of dollars on a brush.</li>
            <li> I would like it to be a little rougher on my face to feel like it cleans a little better but a good deal for around $20.</li>
            <li> Cheap. I set it back. Save up for a Mia Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel clean and fresh!  Scrubs away all the dirt, old skin, everything... yet it&#x27;s gentle!</li>
            <li> It works Great, Price is also reasonable.  The brush is very soft and gently on the skin. I see the difference soon after using first time., and my skin feels very smooth... what I didn&#x27;t like is, you will get a very small sample of the cleanser which disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy (yes guy) and I am in my early 20&#x27;s. This product really works on getting the dirt off my face. Can&#x27;t beat the price. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the cleanser. It&#x27;s pretty small and did not last long nor does it smell good or taste good if you get it in your mouth. I started using my own soap/cleanser once I ran out. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Finally found battery operated cleansing brush for affordable price. I am finding it pretty gentle, not too abrasive for my skin. I like to use it with my foaming cleanser and it works wonders. My skin feels very soft and smooth and not irritated. Great little investment.</li>
            <li> Okay, I just had a facial last week where they used the Clarisonic on my face.  I have to say that was my first time with that particular machine.  I could really feel the Clarisonic working well.  I have the Clarisonic toothbrush so the facial cleaner was something I was interested in.  But, for 150 bucks, I am going to pass for right now.  The reason I purchased this machine from Olay was the price differential (30 dollars is a great buy).  Now, I just tried the Olay cleansing machine and can say there is a noticeable difference between the two; however, if you are looking for an adequate machine that works okay then this one is for you.  I will say that the Clarisonic is better though.  I could see a difference in skin texture last week after that was used, but it could also have been the other products used on my face from the facial too.  I would say that you could get this Olay and feel satisfied because of the cost decrease.  In the end, I will use it a few more times to see if the results are improving my texture or not.  I think the cost is perfect for the consumer who is looking for a good cleanse.  After cleansing I did use my ROC stuff and it burned my skin more. LOL... That means is was getting to the skin under the surface layers better due to the Olay machine.  LOL</li>
            <li> I may not be using this correctly because it really made my face break out...and I&#x27;m way too old for pimples at this stage of my life.</li>
            <li> Soft brush, makes skin tingle!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the positive reviews and substantial marketing materials that made it sound like a very new and upgraded way to wash your face. I&#x27;m sorry to say I find it quite disappointing. The bristles are so soft and move at a mediocre rate, so I don&#x27;t really feel much scrubbing/exfolioation being done.  I think you can get better exfoliation using a basic washcloth.  I also have used a simple 99 cent hand brush from a pharmacy and the Conair facial brush and both of those options feel like they do a better job and cost less.  The two advantages I feel the  Olay sytem  has over the Conair facial brush is that its shape and size do feel more comfortable in the hand and the push button off/on switch is easier to use than the sliding switch on the Conair.  However, the Conair switch also offers the option to reverse the direction of the bristles, which also gives it a feeling that it may be doing a bit more thorough cleansing job.  I&#x27;m going to keep this brush and give the Conair to my teenager who can use a deeper cleaning process at this time. Overall I feel this is one purchase I got \\&quot;sucked into\\&quot; by a company&#x27;s  large marketing budget and the product doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> After debating between this and the very costly Clarisonic, I chose the Pro-X and haven&#x27;t been disappointed. While I have no comparison with the two, this for me, was a decent choice. For the cost of the Clarisonic I would hope it would make me look 16 again and since there isn&#x27;t much chance of that, the Pro-X is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans very well and leaves my skin feeling very clean with no residue. A good product.</li>
            <li> Within three uses, my skin was transformed.  It is amazing.  I can&#x27;t stop touching my face.  My skin has never felt so soft.  And, my make-up glides on.  I love having an every day post-facial glow.  It is a miracle worker.  Best $26 I&#x27;ve ever spent on a skin care product.  [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> I was at Saphora looking at the more expensive version of this and thought to use the Amazon app to check the online price (which is great with the barcode scanner by the way) and Olay Pro-X came up as a related/suggested product and it was really affordable. I decided to order to it so see if I like it before I spent $100s on a similar product. It WORKS. I have congested, dry skin prone to black heads and spots and Olay Pro-X totally cleaned up the bumps on my skin. My skin feels smooth and soft and cleaner than ever before. I am really impressed and frankly surprised. I am not sure if I will go ahead and buy the more expensive version as I am totally satisfied with this.  Maybe for the body at some point but I am not in a rush. I rarely recommend things but Olay Pro-X, I really do.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I saw results the second time I used it. Try it. You will love it.[[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]]</li>
            <li> Used this for 2 days and my skin was so irritated and dry I had to stop using it.  I have tough Italian skin that&#x27;s oily in some places and dry in other places.  I don&#x27;t have delicate or sensitive skin at all.  But my skin hated this tool.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels now that I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my girlfriend. She loves it and it works great! After one use she could tell a difference in the softness of her skin.  I don&#x27;t really understand all the previous reviews talking about how hard the batteries are to put in. You just put some muscle into pulling the bottom part off and 20 seconds later its up and going.  Also, for those of you that are looking at the Clerisonic...you might want to try this one first before spending $200. It might not be the same exact thing but in my opinion its the same concept and your skin can only be so clean/cleaned/scrubbed.</li>
            <li> Having used both the Clarasonic and Olay Pro X, I can honestly say that I am very impressed at the Olay brush, considering it costs 1/5 the price of the Clarasonic. I love the way the brush spins 360 degrees, it feels like I&#x27;m getting a deeper and more thorough clean than the Clarasonics 10 degree spin. This product isn&#x27;t without its flaws though. The installation of the batteries is REALLY tough, it took me nearly 20 minutes to figure it out! I was so frustrated I was seriously considering returning it to the store! I finally got it though (after googling it) and I am really not looking forward to the day the batteries need replacing. The brushheads are also not antibacterial like the Clarasonics. Overall this is a great product though for those on a budget and I would definately recommend it to anyone with problematic or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I have never used Clarasonic and don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like.... but this product works great. I actually scrub my face with a washcloth to get the whiteheads out ,which I know this couldn&#x27;t be good for my skin, but what&#x27;s a girl to do? I&#x27;ll tell you, get this olay brush! It made my white heads come up and I just used the washcloth to wipe them out. This was after one use, I&#x27;m sure with more uses my white heads probably will not even be a problem. My pores don&#x27;t look too bad either after one use. The brush is very gentle and I couldn&#x27;t imagine using anything rougher or harder. I&#x27;m really looking forward to what long term use of this brush will do for my skin!</li>
            <li> Gives my face a nice clean. You can use the included sample tube of cleanser/ exfoliator immediately to get a deep clean or just your own face wash. I don&#x27;t think I would use it with an exfoliator other than the recommended Olay product as theirs has very few granules in it, and you don&#x27;t know what you might do to your face if you used this with another brand, which may be harsher. A good moisturizer after the clean is great for your skin.   I am glad I got this, it works only on batteries so can go anywhere easily, no wires to haul along. It is small so can be packed easily, even slipped in your handbag, if your carry a good sized one like me. Having used this, I am now going to buy a Clarisonic plus System, which I had thought about in the beginning, but having never used this type of product before, was not willing to spend so much money on something I might not like. I want the Clarisonic Plus System to use for the body too. I will still use this for travels though. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much other than my wife loves this thing.  Was just about to drop over a hundred dollars on the clarsonic at the mall but then I remembered seeing this on Amazon.  Trusted the other glowing reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did.  My wife likes it so much she wants to get more as gifts for others!</li>
            <li> This is gentle and does a good job.  You can use your own cleaner, results are the same.  Good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> so far i still can&#x27;t put in the battery, just can&#x27;t open it. so what should I say? Anyone can help?</li>
            <li> After comparing a few different facial cleaning devices, I decided I would give this one a try. I have used it now for 4 weeks wish I didn&#x27;t wait so long to get it. I use it every other day and noticed an improvement in/on my face right away. I was surprised how soft the brush head was for it to be as effective as it is. I have even used it on two of my family member&#x27;s faces and we both saw/felt results from the first use. I did by the store brand cleaner after the sample ran out for half the price, and I like the store brand just as well as it&#x27;s name brand counterpart.</li>
            <li> I actually had an expensive face scrubber in my shopping cart ready to buy, but I couldn&#x27;t justify paying such a large price! I was so glad when the Olay Professional came out with such a reasonable price that I bought it immediatly. I get dry, flaky spots that I need to exfoliate and this product works great. It has a soft brush so I don&#x27;t over exfoliate and irritate my skin which I have been known to do in the past with other face exfoliaters. I also use this product to apply my face lotion. I use this face brush everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I don&#x27;t have any fancy cleansing gadgets in my bathroom. I&#x27;ve always used the old fashioned exfoliating pads and gloves with my brand of choice for facial cleanser. My big problem area is my nose. If I don&#x27;t exfoliate every single day, I get blackheads on my nose very quickly. Just rubbing cleanser on the area with my fingers was not enough, so I started using exfoliating gloves with the cleanser and though it&#x27;s really scratchy and not quite pleasant, it keeps the area clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, is the Pro-X better or worse than \\&quot;manual\\&quot; cleansing? I&#x27;d have to honestly say, it&#x27;s about the same, with one slight edge: the Pro-X is like a daily massage for your face and it does feel quite nice and relaxing as opposed to the scrubbing with the scratchy exfoliating pads. I would say the results are very close with my traditional way of cleansing, and with my clogged pores I can literally see the difference after I&#x27;ve finished. Though the overall process is much more comfortable and enjoyable and the massage factor seems to bring color to my face which is always a plus when you&#x27;re as pale as I am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it uses plain old AA batteries and has no fancy chargers. Keep it simple! And I love that there&#x27;s literally no clean up. You wash the little brush after and let it sit to dry. No messy device that gets gunked up. Again, simple! It&#x27;s comfortable to hold in my hand and the size of the brush is perfect for every area of my face, even around my eyes. I will obviously warn that you close your eyes when using this, as even when you&#x27;re cleaning your cheeks and chin, the cleanser can and will fling off the brush from time to time and get in your eyes. Aside from that, I can easily get around all the curves and angles of my face, even my nose, with ease. You do have to put a little pressure on it if you are trying to clear blackheads because the gentle brush doesn&#x27;t do enough without that bit of pressure. Because of that, after only a few weeks of use my poor little brush is all worn in the middle. I hope they make replacements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like (and this is easily remedied) is their included cleanser. I have very sensitive skin that is prone to over drying and whatever is in that cleanser made my face dry up and flake with only one use. I immediately stopped using it and just put my own cleanser on. Obviously this won&#x27;t be an issue for everyone, but do yourself a favor and test a small area of your face first. Don&#x27;t do what I did! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great buy, considering that traditional manual exfoliating gloves/brushes/pads can cost nearly just as much and aren&#x27;t as comfortable to use.ush is all worn in the middle.

            <li> Very pleased!     PROS:  *works like a high dollar system for a fraction of the cost.  *sample cleanser comes with pkg. (save for airline travel)  *water resistant  *comes with duracell batteries  *2 speeds and seperate on/off button   *fits hand perfect but yet small enough to travel with.    CONS:  *no booklet but really not necessary  *battery compartment hard to open but thanks to previous posts I knew to put \\&quot;umph\\&quot; into it.    TIP:If you get it at Walgreens you get an extra 6 oz tube of cleanser in addition with the 3/4 oz one in the brush box.(limited time)$20 value</li>
            <li> I originally tried the DDF Revolve 400X MicroPolishing System &amp; found my skin looking &amp; feeling the same before &amp; after.  Next I tried this and found it really works.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Totally waterproof. Has 2 speed settings.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every night to remove make-up.&lt;br /&gt;Simple device. They have not added a ton of features to it and made it annoyingly complicated.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. I HAVE ONLY BEEN USING IT FOR TWO WEEKS AND PEOPLE ARE TELLING ME MY FACE LOOKS SO HEALTHLY AND CLEAR.  IT ALSO FEELS MUCH SOFTER.  TWO OF MY CO-WORKERS ARE ORDERING IT.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how all the expensive Cleansing systems work, but this is so great for the money I spent on it! I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this. I was hoping for a cheaper alternative to the extremely popular clarisonic, but this is just not it. My skin is peeling a bit from a new retinol product and I bought this figuring it would take care of the issue. The skin detaches very easily with a cotton ball, but I wanted to more easily rinse the dead skin away. The Olay brush didn&#x27;t take off any skin, and my cotton ball and toner I used after took all the skin off. A cotton ball took off more dead skin! Can you believe that? A cotton ball that probably costs a penny by itself exfoliates more than a 30 dollar skin brush. Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Love this more than I thought.  Great price and use it one or two times a week. Just buy it, it&#x27;s cheap enough and your going to like it.</li>
            <li> This is good product. but I regretted. Because I could not see any better.&lt;br /&gt;If you have scrub at home. Just use it. Don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> a good ol&#x27; plain washcloth does a better job for me.  seriously, this was basically like holding an electric toothbrush (with much softer bristles) up to my face.  and the soap that comes with it isn&#x27;t any better than the super cheap stuff.  totally not worth the money or time.  the things we buy and try because people talk them up is ridiculous!  i&#x27;m going back to all natural products i think, instead of buying into what commercialism tells us we need to use.  oi.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my ProX. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the speed, I wish it went a bit faster. However, I am definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a while and I get compliments everytime I do. It makes my skin look smoother. I use the olay luminous face wash with it and it looks great. I love the result and I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with acne, rough skin, and redness for 15 years. Been to dermatologists multiple times and the only thing to ever clear it up was Accutane, which I&#x27;ve been through twice. My bad skin kept coming back. So I decided to try this because I knew my rough, dead skin played a part in the formation of acne. I coupled it with a benzoyl peroxide treatment, and for the first time in 15 years I have clear skin without the need for Accutane. My skin is smooth, radiant, even, and gorgeous. My only complaint is that ridiculous battery compartment. It really is very very hard to open, but if you keep wiggling it back and forth and side to side, it WILL open up. Just don&#x27;t put any lotion on your hands before you try! :)</li>
            <li> I have had this product now for about 2 weeks and my husband and I both use it about every other night.  It really makes your face feel clean and brightens your complexion.  I know that there is a more expensive unit out there but for my needs it is just right.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love my pro x brush it makes my face feels so clean and smooth !! I also like the sample cleanser they added in the box</li>
            <li> Love this thing. My skin feels so smooth and clean and it helps self tanner go on smoothly. My friends all have the clarisonic but this works just as well and in my opinion much better b/c it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my Esthetician to get the Clarisonic Pro from her dermatology office ($200). I have heard many great reviews of the product but could not bear the thought of the expense. I immediately went on Amazon to see how much of a better price I could find it. I ended up finding the Olay Pro-X Cleansing system and all of the positive reviews. For $30 I decided that even if it was a piece of crap, it was worth a shot. I do not use it with the included Olay cleanser, I instead use it with my different cleansers of my choice. I use it every night before bed and almost immediately my skin has had more of a glowing even tone. I get regular facial peels and it seems as though I benefit more from the peels now because of my better nightly regime including this device. Even my Esthetician has been commenting on how great my skin looks. I feel as though I must get my makeup and dirt out of my pores better and the stimulation of the rotating brush head must be very beneficial. I recommend everyone to try this product especially if you are debating between this and Clarisonic. I am sure the Clarisonic is worth every penny as the reviews imply, however I was excited to try something similar for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> I paid 28 bucks for mine and even then I cringed at the thought of paying that much on something like this, but I have to say that after regularly using it myself...I was impressed and felt better about my purchase, especially after reading some other posts out there...when I read how others have spent over 200 bucks on another product to get similar results.     I don&#x27;t really have problematic skin, but I am interested in taking care of my skin. Since I started using the brush, I have noticed that my skin is considerably softer and much cleaner than before...it gently cleans deep into your pores. I was worried about it actually irritating my skin, but that won&#x27;t happen as long as you apply the right amount of pressure and don&#x27;t take too long to use it.</li>
            <li> I hated this. My sister really wanted it. It doesn&#x27;t do anything seriously . waste of money</li>
            <li> I actually purchased four of these Olay Cleansing Systems and gifted three of them to my two daughters and 15-year-old granddaughter. They all love it, but my granddaughter loves it the most! She was amazed how clean and smooth her face was the first time she used it. Mine is a year old now and still going strong. I&#x27;m so happy I can cleanse with excellent results and save $$$ at the same time!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use a different cleanser, but the spin brush exfoliates great, especially for the price. Great buy!</li>
            <li> My face was definitely cleaner when I used it. But now the brush head just wobbles and  falls off. Been looking around to find out if its the brush head that is bad or the device cant hold a brush head. I would  have just bought a replacement brush head from the store but they are pretty much half the price of the product itself so I might get a new one.</li>
            <li> Best Facial brush ever.  Easy to use in the shower and you come away feeling clean.  Gave my mother one when I realized it was so perfect</li>
            <li> I was skeptical if this product could clean my face better than just using your hands.    I used this product quite a few times and so I can give an honest review.  I washed one side of my face with the Olay PRO X and the other side with just my hands.  I found that this product did get my face cleaner.  I think this is good to use if you wear makeup, it will help to remove it and get your face very clean.     I will say that when you are using it on your face it feels wonderful and even after you are done using it your face feels tingly for a few minutes.  I liked that about this product.  I like the way this makes my face feel better than the cleaning effects that it gives me.     I would recommend this product, it cleans your face and make it feel wonderful.  You will like using it just to have your face feel tingly afterwards!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Makes my skin super smooth and makes my moisturizer stay on longer.  My skin never feels dry since using this product every other day for the last three weeks!</li>
            <li> I was reading reviews on the Clarisonic Mia, when my friend suggested I look into this... I am so glad she did! It&#x27;s a fraction of the price and so far I love it! After one use, I was able to tell that my skin looked cleaner... more vibrant! I have pretty decent skin to begin with... I stay out of the sun, no acne, small pores, so I just needed something that effectively/ properly exfoliated my skin. The brush is super soft so I did not experience any irritations or rawness after use. The Pro X just cleans and does not send the sonic vibrations like the Clarisonic, so if you have problem skin, and looking for something to treat the root of the issue, this is not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, the difficultly installing the battery. I read reviews prior and one of the reviews gave good instructions. Other than that, I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  While smaller than other brushes it seems to do a satisfactory job.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This cleansing tool is fabulous and always makes my skin feel so very soft afterward.  It cleans the pores and gives you the cleansing you need.</li>
            <li> great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product that rivals the more expensive brands. It leaves my skin totally smooth and clean. I only wish that it was made with a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daugjter. This is the second one we bought. The first lasted five years in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 2 weeks now.  I have really acne-prone skin, especially on my cheeks, and I have a ton of black heads everywhere.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and none worked.  I started using this nightly, and my skin feels so much better!  I still have a few pimples here and there, but I&#x27;m not breaking out daily like I used to.    I like this because you can use it nightly after your regular facial cleaning, my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out, and I use it on my neck too and it feels so much nicer.    Not only does it get rid of the dead skin cells, it stimulates your face which helps with regeneration.  When I use this, I press pretty hard, and I can see my face getting red.  It&#x27;s not getting red from irritation but from blood-flow to my skin, which really helps kick-start new cells growing.    Some other cleaning systems like this are so hard on my face and I can&#x27;t use it nightly.  This works just enough to get the dirt,skin, and grime off but still be gentle enough for nightly use.  And there is a high and low setting if I don&#x27;t feel like scrubbing too hard.    It&#x27;s waterproof too, so it&#x27;s shower friendly if you like to clean your face while showering!</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit because the higher-priced unit is not recommended for use with products that have any sort of cleansing grain in it.  It serves its purpose.  I read a lot of reviews that said it will take the place of that higher-priced unit, and owning both, I would say that I disagree - further, I think I could PROBABLY have used the other unit with a sensitive or gentle brush and saved my money on this one.  But it works, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do...and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Excellent, cleans skin better than a wash cloth and brush is soft on the skin, not irritating. The on/off switch and low/hi speed switch are a little touchy. Sometimes I have to push the buttons serveral times to get the high speed.</li>
            <li> Updating to 1 star: died within 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought as a replacement for a pricey Clarisonic that died shortly after the one year mark. Definitely not the same, but a cheaper and serviceable item for a fraction of the cost. Wish the unit was sealed better because if you bang it or drop it, the whole thing comes apart and you get water inside the battery chamber.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Don&#x27;t waste money on the expensive ones! Get this one.</li>
            <li> I freaking love this device!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve already told several others about it. It&#x27;s gentle but very effective at cleansing the pores in my skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. No need for the expensive brushes to exfoliate. I&#x27;ve had mine a long time and the bristles are like new. Great purchase for a good price!</li>
            <li> I have been waiting for this Pro-X cleaning system.  It is a great buy and refills are available on the same page. It leaves skin feeling as clean as it can get.</li>
            <li> I purchased this items a few weeks ago because the reviews were good and i wanted to try it.  The machine is small so it fits right in your shower holder and that makes it easy to get.  I think that the power is not that much so i am not seeing alot of change.  My face does feel smoother and it is a pleasant experience so that is why i am giving it three stars.  I has become my daily routine.  I used the little tube of olay that came with the machine but then found olay cleaner and toner at TJ Maxx and it works really well!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! My skin feels fantastic after using it, and it feels like a nice little face massage while using it.</li>
            <li> This is messy to use, sprays all over the mirror if you don&#x27;t use it just right, and is not worth the money.  I found it to be something that made for work for me to clean up than any benefit it was doing to my face.  Although I rarely return anything I returned this.</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself and one for my step-daughter. We both love it. Cleans well, gentle and effective. Very sturdy, too.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a facial cleansing system so this particular model is a good value for money, for me.  It is really easy to use - the detachable brush can be washed and fixed back easily.  It cleanses effectively with a one-minute use.  Would have to ensure that the face is sufficiently moist and lathered though.</li>
            <li> This was the first facial cleansing brush I have purchased, and am very happy with it. I initially researched a Clarisonic, but saw this and figured it was better to spend $20 and possibly not like it, than take the risk of spending $150 on a Clarisonic Mia. This brush has a low and high setting, but I generally stick with the low and let the brush gently spin on my skin. I started off using this to wash my face every night, but found it was a little harsh on my sensitive skin, so I only use it a few times a week with Cetaphil cleanser. Regardless, this really does do a great job of removing all the dirt and makeup from my skin, and I notice a huge difference in how clean and soft my face feels afterward compared to just washing with my hands.  The box comes with one brush and a small tube of Olay face wash, but I haven&#x27;t tried it. The brush head is very easy to take on and off and replacements are cheap (under $10 for a 2 pack). My only complaint is that the cover for the batteries is a bear to get on and off, but for something that is used in the shower, I&#x27;d rather have it that way than a loose one.&lt;br /&gt;**I bought this for $22 with amazon prime and noticed that the price has increased since I purchased it, even with the current clip coupon feature. I have seen the same item and packaging for $23 in supermarkets and beauty stores**</li>
            <li> exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> My face does feel less dry and it is a nice experience so that is why i am giving it four stars. I have been using it as part of daily routine. I used the  tube of olay that came with the machine when I purchased but then found olay cleaner  at the store and I am very satisfied! I purchased this items a few months ago because the comments were good and i wanted to try it. The machine is compact so it fits right in your shower holder and that makes it easy to get. I think that the power is not all that much so i am not seeing alot of change.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I have been using it for the last 9 months,love it.Iam glad I bought it instead of Pricey Clarisonic. Every one should try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. Feels good. My acne has dissapeared! Gets deep, I just wish it had another higher speed. But it isn&#x27;t needed. Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I did my research and listened to about 20 reviews on youtube about this product and the clairsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that is normally very oily and prone to breakouts!  I have also tried everything under the sun so when I bought this my fiance said it would be a waste!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for one week 2 times daily I noticed a huge difference in the size of my pores and the overall texture of my skin.  I also noticed that I wasnt as oily.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for two weeks I noticed an improvement around my eyes and neck line.  I also got a few compliments from friends that I have a certain \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using it for 3 months and just bought my first replacement heads and now notice that my blackheads are almost non existent.  AND best of all my pores are micro compared to what they were.  I dont have to wear as much makeup because my skin has better texture (smoothness!!) and also not as much blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I am using a different cleanser - I use the Olay Ageless wash and I love the smell of it.  You can use any cleanser you like with it.  I did notice that when you use a foam cleanser it dosnt work as much - just a tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will def continue to use this and recommend it to people!! ;) Very happy!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. Didn&#x27;t seem like much at first, but after 1 week my face looks better than it has in years. Alternated using the wash that came with, &amp; Cetaphil cleanser. Been battling a horrid case of acne for about 4 years.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this gift for a friend who placed it on her wish list.  She loves it and uses it religiously!</li>
            <li> I loved this product!!  It worked great; I am currently in Afghanistan with the military and used this every day. My skin stayed looking great it even improved with use of this.  I recommended it to my friends here everyone loved it! I was careful with it, it never stayed in the shower I dried it off after each use.  However, it only worked for 2 months!!!! I changed the batteries (it wasn&#x27;t them) I was so sad that it broke :(  I did email the company since I could not call from my located.  They offered me a refund and said this was not normal, however after reading other reviews I am beginning to think it is.  I also wondered why they did not offer me a replacement instead of a refund if this was not normal.  At this point I know I love the facial scrubbers so I may buy the more expensive one once I return from Afghanistan.  I say don&#x27;t waste money on this one though unless you&#x27;re looking for a tester to see if you would be interested in a pricier one.</li>
            <li> Works great, as expected. But I&#x27;m not actually sure if it&#x27;s any better than just a regular face wash without a scrubber. I feel like face soap on my face is enough, even without some rotating brush.</li>
            <li> Used this product for 2 -3 weeks and saw absolutely no difference. Skin was just the same. Leaves skin smooth but I get that from other face exfoliators I use, so this was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Based on the sample face wash the cleansing system came with, I&#x27;m super impressed and want to buy the full size. It brightens my face in a way other face washes don&#x27;t. I use this with other face washes too (St. Ives apricot, MyChelle scrub, Cetaphil), but the scrub that the cleansing system comes with is far and beyond the best. The cleansing system itself is great ... I was curious about the Mia but didn&#x27;t want to drop that much money on it. Face feels super fresh after using it. It helped me get over one of the worst breakouts I&#x27;ve ever had. During that period, I used it almost every day, but now I use it maybe twice a week. I only wish that the brushhead could turn in the other direction, too, but whatever. For this price, it&#x27;s all good. I liked it enough to buy one for my mother.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep at my lake house instead of shelling out another $150 for a Claresonic. It works OK but slings soap on the highest setting. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because of this.</li>
            <li> I received my pro x two days ago.  I am using it morning and night.  I like it.  I have oily skin and just feel that it makes my skin feel so much cleaner.  I just wish it had a bigger brush head.  For the price, it&#x27;s a great little machine.  I use it with my anti bacterial cleaner from neostrata.  I did try the exfoliating cleanser sample that came with it this morning and that seemed pretty nice.</li>
            <li> My daughter asked for this, so I assume she has experience with it.  She tells me it works great, hence the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It works great! I saw this on a lightening deal and I just had to try it out. I use it daily and have been for a while and it still works great. The included face wash though is a bit too harsh for my liking so I use one without the little exfoliation beads, I feel like this tool does a good enough job without adding more abrasiveness.</li>
            <li> Ok..at the risk of sounding like a commercial for this item...I Love my PRO X system!  My skin feels so great after I use it..it is soothing and invigorating at the same time.  I know...sounds corny, but it it true! This gives just enough exfoliation to make your skin look and feel great, but it it gentle, too and does not irritate my sensitive skin. I use this day and night and I use their moisturizer Olay regenerist at night.  :)</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a month ago and have been using it once a day (my nightly routine) and I have to say that I am highly impressed! It improved the look and feel of my skin withing 2 days of using it! If you don&#x27;t want to shell out $200+, I recommend giving this a try! I am definitely not disappointed!</li>
            <li> this is a good product backed by a great company. My skin feels so refreshed and clean after using this. My blackheads are disappearing and my pores are looking smaller. I don&#x27;t have any real facial problems but those aforementioned are making my skin look better and then I can apply age reducing products. But the first step is having really clean skin.</li>
            <li> If there were a way to achieve the same results without batteries, that would be a better option.  I&#x27;ll keep it till it fails.</li>
            <li> First, I want to start out my review by saying WOW, I AM SO IMPRESSED!!! I read numerous reviews before I bought this, and I was really skeptical about it, even with this being the number one selling beauty product on Amazon AND with all of the five star reviews. I didn&#x27;t actually even come shopping on Amazon for this product, but when I looked at the beauty bestsellers and saw this one had been the #1 seller for so long, I wanted to see what it was and what the hype was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 27, have occasional breakouts, and have semi-oily skin with a few pesky blackheads on my nose. I never wear any makeup other than mascara. I have never felt the need to wear foundation, and when I have tried it in the past, it bugged me having it on my skin, I was always aware of it being there. Because I do occasionally have breakouts and have blackheads, I wanted to go ahead and try this. I ordered it last week on sale from Amazon. It was on sale for around $23 and it had a $5 coupon, so I got it for around $17. Now that I have used it, I can say that I would be willing to pay full price for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received it in the mail today, and immediately used it in the shower. I had no problems getting the batteries in like a lot of people have said in their reviews. I just popped the bottom of, and put the batteries in, popped the bottom back on. When I turned it on I actually wondered if this was going to work well, because the two rotations are so gentle and the bristles on the brush head are so gentle and soft. I was expected a stiffer brush and faster rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got in the shower, I wet my face, and wet the brush, then I squeezed some of the Olay exfoliating cleaner in stripes across the brush head. Then, I used the brush quickly across my whole face to get the cleaner all over, then went back over each part of my face and took some time to let the brush scrub on each area. I was surprised when the cleaner lathered up a little bit. The scrubbingfelt really good. It felt like the right amount of rotation when combined with the cleaner. After I did every part of my face, I rinsed my face and the brush, and then turned the brush on the low setting and went back over my face one more time and rinsed. After I rinsed my face, I immediately knew this product had done it&#x27;s job. My face has never felt smoother or cleaner, and I have tried so many different facial cleansers in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I dried off, I looked in the mirror, and my face was GLOWING. My cheeks were rosy, and my skin just looked so healthy. I was SHOCKED. After one use, the difference was just AMAZING!!! Almost all of the blackheads on my nose are gone. As I sit writing this, 2 hours after my shower, my cheeks are still rosy, like I put on blush, and my entire face is still glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use any moisturizer after my shower. Since I have oily skin to begin with, I never use moisturizer. I read a lot of reviews that said this left their skin a little dry, but mine is just perfect. Not too dry, not too oily. And it is SO SOFT!!! My cheeks, forehead, chin and nose are so soft, I can&#x27;t get over it. It makes me wonder what happened! My skin was not rough or dry before, it has always had a tendency to be soft, but never like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending this product to everyone I know and this product definitely deserves it&#x27;s high rating and ranking on Amazon. I now know what all the hype was about, and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> This item gets my face squeaky clean without being too abrasive.  My daughter who had bad acne breakouts started using it with her acne cleanser and her face is finally clear so I got her one too. The price is right and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> The speed of the brush seems too slow and maybe the bristles are too soft.  It doesn&#x27;t really seem to deeply clean my acne-prone skin and the accompanying cleanser definitely broke me out.</li>
            <li> Brushes too soft.  Does nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money - I&#x27;ve gone back to apricot scrubs and get a much better result for pore cleansing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really explain it but this thing works.  My skin is softer and more clear after 2 weeks of using it pretty regularly. Its great to keep in the shower.  I put conditioner on my hair and use this on my face for about 2 minutes while the conditioner is working.  Its such a great value that you almost can&#x27;t go wrong by trying it.</li>
            <li> Works well to clean skin deeply. It was a little harsh for my skin so I don&#x27;t like using it. It does the job though.</li>
            <li> makea my skin very smooth and feels nice and fresh</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes of not having to spend money on another Clarisonic. It is a bit different but so far so good. The brush head is smaller than the Clarisonic, that is both good and bad. Good, because it gets into the little spaces on your face that the Clarisonic does not. Bad, because it runs on batteries (you can use rechargeable ones) and the brush head is smaller and a little wobbly. Olay offers a guarantee so use it and if you do not like send it back to the company within the time allotted on the package.</li>
            <li> I had a clarisonic for about four years until it died. I didn&#x27;t want to pay another 100+ for a new one, so I decided to buy Olay. Olay reminds of the brushes they use in Spa&#x27;s.  This will save you money, try it!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much I bought one for my daughter.  She loved it so much she suggested we buy one for my mom on her birthday!  It has made our skin so soft and cleared up our blemishes.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> durable and good device</li>
            <li> Not recommended. The entire package is a product of China, and more importantly, the cleanser cream is as well made from China. After one week use, I started to get pimples. Very disappointed. This throws off my trust for the product line Pro-X. I love theirs Pro-X face cream, but this cleansing system is particularly a failure. I quit using the cleanser cream.</li>
            <li> Helps in getting your complexion beautiful</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would recommend this very highly.  I had some pore issues and this lightly scrubs your skin, which cleared the problem for me.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling incredibly clean and refreshed!!</li>
            <li> Love this! My skin is acne prone and sensitive, but this keeps my skin clear and glowing. I couldn&#x27;t use the face wash sample with it because it made me breakout, but this isn&#x27;t uncommon for me when trying new soaps. I use it every other day in the shower with the Body Shop tea tree face wash. It&#x27;s a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this! My skin looks healthy and happy for the first time in years. I have two suggestions.  First, don&#x27;t use it every day if you have sensitive skin.  That proved to be too much for me and my skin got quite red.  4 times per week seems to be perfect.  Second, if you have very sensitive skin, use a gentle cleanser.  I use it with Cetaphil and it works very well for my skin, which tends to be dry and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this... I could not justify spending hundreds when this gives me skin that is wedding-ready!</li>
            <li> I have had acne since my teenage years (im 26) and I have tried so many other products...this one by far is the best...I use the brush with my proactive cream and it worked fast! Within 3 days my sin was softer and my bumps are less..I would recommend this product to anyone looking to get rid of acne</li>
            <li> Terrific product. Exfoliates and polishes skin. Results: wonderful, glowing and healthy skin. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly for my 12 year old daughter, but I have also used it.  I think it is a great product.  It does a great job of cleaning pores. It provides a much deeper clean than you can get with just using a cleanser and wash cloth.  It doesn&#x27;t keep her from getting getting pimples, but it has reduced the amount that she gets.    I would recommend using a good moisturizer after you cleanse your face, because my face got a little dry when I didn&#x27;t moisturize right after using it.      There is no recommendation on how often to change the bristle head, but we have had our for about 1 month and the bristles are not starting to break down or curl yet, so I haven&#x27;t changed it.  My plan is to just watch the bristles and  when they look bad, I will change it.      Overall, a very good product.  I would recommend it, but just know that it is not a miracle cure for acne but it does help.  It is great for deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> This system actually enlarged my pores.  I had bought it and was using it on low and my face seemed fine, better even.  But after I switched to high speed and used it for a few days, I finally noticed that my pores got significantly larger. I stopped using the system, but my pores have remained large.  Be aware that scrubbing your face intensely can make the pores worse.</li>
            <li> I bought this after waiting for the price to drop as I thought they were asking too much for it initially. It really does do what they say so I&#x27;m happy with it. The brush head is fairly soft so it doesn&#x27;t make my skin act up (I have very sensitive skin) but it still does a good job. I am a little upset though as two days after I got it one of the big warehouse stores I shop at had it on sale for a few dollars more but it came with extra brush heads and a full size cleansing gel. But if you don&#x27;t have membership to one of those stores this is the best place to buy it, it&#x27;s a few dollars less than Wal-Mart for both the unit and replacements heads plus you get free shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the machine for 3 days now and I feel like it has really made a difference in the texture and cleanliness of my skin. My skin immediately felt smoother and free of dead cell debris and my moisturizer absorbed a lot faster and better upon application. In buying Olay&#x27;s machine, I was really really hoping that it would be the solution to my blackhead conundrum!! I&#x27;ve been plagued with blackheads for as long as I can remember and it&#x27;s just been a chronic and STRESSFUL concern of mine.</li>
            <li> I received the Pro-X yesterday and I used it last night for the first time. Wow! After two uses, my face feels so clean and refreshed! I can tell that my skin absorbs my moisturizer. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend $200+ on the Clarisonic. But we shall see.... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my daughter, she wanted this set because for the larger brush so she can use it on her shoulders &amp; back.  I have not seen any other product offer that size of brush.  Replacement brushes are also available for sell.</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s face scrubber is one of the best gifts I&#x27;ve ever bought myself. It performs as promised at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 50-year-old female who continues to battle breakouts -- that is, I used to battle breakouts, but using this face scrubber appears to have solved that problem! Woo-hoo! For the past six months, I have been using it a couple times a week in the shower and no more than that. The scrubber action is gentle, and the scrubber head is a good size for skimming on the edges of my nose and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I use my face scrubber in the shower, I do not keep it there, which may help with the product&#x27;s reliability. After I shower, I dry the scrubber off and rinse off the head one last time, and then I place both on a towel on a shelf in my bedroom where the air is dryer than in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Olay&#x27;s face scrubber on Amazon.com after examining the product on various store shelves. I was delighted to find that Amazon offered it for several dollars less. I have Amazon Prime -- another excellent gift to myself -- so ordering was easy and shipment was fast. The scrubber arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little soft, but I actually wash my face now that I use this. I used to be too lazy. I can definitely feel a difference.</li>
            <li> Your fingers and hands are not going to be able to clean inside little indentations inside your skin, which is wear oil, dirt, and makeup deposit themselves after a normal day. A washcloth might, but it won&#x27;t do a great job.  This little product, sold at like a tenth of the price of its competitor, does the job fantastically well, and it also an excellent companion to a light exfoliator like the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub.  If you want a clean face, JUST BUY ONE.</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel smooth and clean after each wash:)I am very happy with the product. If I dont use it, my face feels not completely clean.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me with my oily skin and also with my acne. It is embarassing to still be suffering from acne at my age and I was only making it worse by covering it up with foundation, even at the gym! This cleansing system exfoliates your skin in the most gentle way possible and gives you a super supple, clear and glowing face, it feels so fresh after usage. My skin and break outs have become so much better and all you have to do is pop the brush in and batteries and it&#x27;s ready to go. Great for travelling too because it is not too heavy, I am hoping that after another few weeks of usage that my acne can be a thing of the past, fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted for alot less than in the stores.</li>
            <li> just loved this product. Seriously, I do not know how I lived so long without it. is a super simple brush however brings a deep cleansing of the skin. I recommend!</li>
            <li> the brush is soft, but I still feel a little bit hurt.  I prefer to use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I only use this a couple of times a week, but I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in how smooth my skin is, particularly on my forehead. I did a ton of research in deciding between this and just going for it with the Clairsonic, and I&#x27;m really glad I got this one. For the difference in cost between the two, this is totally worth it, and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Just not what I expected. Too small and too slow. The rite aid one I had before this was much better</li>
            <li> Good brush to clean your face daily with the right cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use this every evening in the shower and my skin has been clearer, pores smaller, less blackheads! I do wash my makeup with a salicylic acid cleanser first because otherwise it feels like you&#x27;re pushing dirty makeup around. Then I use the brush and a soap that contains sulfur to penetrate deep into my pores and kill the bacteria that cause acne, then lastly I use Olay&#x27;s pH balanced Pro-X cleanser which leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated and.... balanced :).</li>
            <li> I used to have to rub a lot to get all my makeup off, but with this lil gadget it cleans my face for me :)  It also made my sides of my face smooth (they used to be rough), so my makeup application is easier and smoother.  I would definitely recommend it, but i suggest closing your eyes when it&#x27;s on your forehead because it might splash water into them.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the bristles on this would be sharp like some of the cheap, handheld facial brushes. I was happy to find that the tips are rounded and feel more like a caress than scratchy.  I&#x27;m glad someone recommended this affordable face scrubber machine rather than spend so much on the professional $200 machine that will also scrub your body. Instead I got this machine and some sloughing gloves for my body that were a few dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things about the clairsonic and read that this is comparable and at a fraction of the cost. Now that I&#x27;ve tried this I can say that i would only try a clairsonic if it was gifted to me or somehow i got an 85% off deal. I am a bit OCD when it comes to my skin care regiment so maybe this review should be taken with a grain of salt. I can honestly say that this tool is less or equally effective as using a nonelectric skin brush and less effective as using the Aveda Shammy Cloth. I wish i could get my money back. I am going to stick to using plain white organic paper towels, in a circular motion on my face. That&#x27;s until I purchase another Shammy Cloth.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have very much power. Did not feel like it was cleaning my face at all. It is battery powered, and I think that is why. I now have a Clarisonic, and it does a much, much better job.</li>
            <li> Ok product.  You get what you pay for as this product is not as efficient as others that cost quite a bit more.  However, works well for daily use.</li>
            <li> I like the facial cleaning brush, but wish the head were a little bit larger. The bristles are soft and the product does a nice job if you use it for at least one minute.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year now. I don&#x27;t think I will ever not use it when doing my nightly face routine. I feel like it gets all of my makeup, oil, and dirt off my face leaving it clean and smooth for my creams. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works as good as the expensive items.</li>
            <li> does things that a rag cannot do</li>
            <li> I was all set to save up to purchase the Clarisonic MIA. 2 of my friends got that and they were disappointed. I usually had good skin so I hadn&#x27;t even thought of getting something like this until i noticed white bumps and larger pores and no matter how much I scrubbed my face I always noticed leftover makeup residue.     So, I just bought this and although I can&#x27;t say how much of a difference I see (I&#x27;ve only used 2 times so far), what I can say is how soft and smooth my face is and the brush is super gentle. I love that it has 2 speeds and the waterproof qualities already gives it 2 advantages above the clarisonic. AND the refill brushes are only $10, vs. $40 for the clarisonic...that won me over!</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a cleansing system and had researched many from the high priced on down. After checking out the Olay Pro-X, I felt this was the system for me.I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.It does the job and does it well!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me not to use this kind of thing as in the long run it will do more damage than not. She said that it makes skin look nicer in the beginning partly because it swells tissues but that it&#x27;s actually damaging skin. Good luck.</li>
            <li> very nice to use, does the job</li>
            <li> After using this device for a little over 2 weeks, I think it is as good as the more expensive brands. Not only did my skin look and feel better from the start - people have commented on my youthful glow - but it cleared up my skin as well. A bonus of using it is that you will need less moisturizer, which is also a savings. My skin is so smooth that applying night cream is wonderful as it absorbs almost immediately and spreads more evenly too. Most people have a tendency to overuse creams, which can cause blocked pores. Try it out - I bet you will be as pleased with it as I am!</li>
            <li> This machine is very easy to use and leaves my skin felling refreshed and clean.  The price is good also.  I have priced others similar to this for as much as 3 times the cost.</li>
            <li> I am 49, with dry skin.  I wanted something to deep-clean but not overly scour and irritate my face.  I&#x27;ve only used this once, and it&#x27;s nice and gentle.  I didn&#x27;t use the cleanser that came with it, but instead used my usual creamy Olay foaming facial cleanser.  A few complaints:  1)  I couldn&#x27;t open the battery compartment at all.  Thank heaven my husband&#x27;s an engineer.  (Though he made a lot of cracks about it looking like a sex toy!)  2) I wish the head were larger.  It seemed to take forever to cover my whole face and neck.  3) The head came off while I was in the shower, though I&#x27;m pretty sure I had put it on correctly.  I put it back on and it stayed there (at least through that one usage!).    If you have young, oily, blackhead-prone skin or need major exfoliation, this probably isn&#x27;t strong enough for you.  But I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it.  My skin wasn&#x27;t irritated at all after using it -- though I can&#x27;t say I noticed a dramatic transformation either!  I guess psychologically, I feel my skin must be cleaner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this product. I have been wanting a Clarisonic but could not afford it. I have been using Olay products for almost 40 years...ever since I saw my mom&#x27;s pink bottle on her dressing table. This product super-cleans my skin and leaves it so smooth that the rest of my skincare products glide on and my make-up looks like a pro did it! I will never be without this!</li>
            <li> I love this!  I got this as a lighting deal and was very pleased when I gave it a try.  It really is helping my skin, diminishing black heads and exfoliating. I also like that I can buy replacement heads and cleanser at the local chain stores.</li>
            <li> I read the great reviews and thought it would work wonders on my skin.  My skin did tingle a little when I was done but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance or how it felt long-term.</li>
            <li> I was on the verge of buying the Clarsionic when this caught my eye. I have oily skin and after using it for a couple of weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in oil and acne.  My skin is softer and my make-up is staying on better.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife. She likes it and has no complaints. I tried it to see how is was and it does seem to clean well. I tried bogging it down some but it worked fine. For the price appears to be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Less is More! This is the best little device I have ever purchased. My skin feels terrific. The Olay Pro-X is so gentle and even has a slower, more gentle speed. Removing/installing batteries is simple, just get one of those 3&amp;quot;x 3&amp;quot; rubber jar openers @ the grocery or I&#x27;ll bet even your mom or grandma has one. Just a back and forth motion and it pops right off. So simple but yet so inexpensive. Bravo!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting a mini facial at home, whenever you please.  I love this product! My skin is baby soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I have had combination skin my whole life.  It seems I would get one area of my face and throat clean and still lack another.  The Pro-X gives me tthe ability to clean all areas, especially the difficult ones.ie:  Around the nose,mouth,and chin area.  I hve the liquid cleanser and tube that came with it so I switch as to not irritate my skin.  I am very impressed with Olay products in general and believe me when I say they are good and affordable for working women.</li>
            <li> I swear by this thing. I have been using it religiously for the past years and have had a noticeable difference in my skin. My initial problem was my skin looking dry and dull, but have noticed additional benefits since using this like breakouts clearing up quicker and some of the few fine lines I had becoming less and less visible. This in conjunction with a good skincare regimen will do wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to try one of these devices as I have very delicate, and aging skin.  But after a month or so, I really notice a difference in the brightness and tone of my skin.  I use it both with the Olay product, and also occasionally with my regular daily cleaner (cheapo drugstore variety) I did experience a &#x27;flush&#x27; of small blemishes at first, but that was just bringing up what I was unable to clean before this product.  My skin is clearer, more vibrant and the only change has been to add this to my regimen.</li>
            <li> I have added this to my daily regime. My skins is more visibly softer, and it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> This is great, especially for the price. I have had it for a while now and it&#x27;s still using the original batteries with regular use.</li>
            <li> Delivered timely and product was as expected and described</li>
            <li> This feels really good combined with the olay cleanser it leaves the face feeling great just got it but so far its nice</li>
            <li> I purchased the Pro X cleaning system after the holidays, so I have been using it for about a month. I love how super clean my face feels after using it. I use the entire line of Pro X products. I am 61 and my face is glowing! Thank you Olay!</li>
            <li> Helps with big pores.</li>
            <li> If you want to look like your cat just clawed your face off then I REALLY dont recommend getting this product. I was so excited then i tried it and now i have about 5 scratches on my face and its burning intensely. My face is also very red.  I will continue using this for a week maybe a little more gentle but as it stands right now i am extremely P&#x27;d off.  Just save your money over time and get the real deal.    &gt;_&lt;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dont bother.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at the reviews saying Clarisonic was better and this one was not worth it.  You know what, they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and it&#x27;s amazing. I love how great a job it does. Clarisonic might be more thorough but it&#x27;s also more expensive. 30 bucks for refills, haha no thanks.  I think pro x does a great job.  UPDATE: It broke after 4 months of everyday use. draw your own conclusions.</li>
            <li> I have used my friend&#x27;s clarisonic a few times to try it out, and decided i wanted to get one for myself. after seeing the prices for them, i decided to find a cheaper one, and i came across this one from olay. i love olay products, and was hoping this one wouldn&#x27;t let me down. and it didn&#x27;t! i love my olay cleaning system even more than the clarisonic! i feel like it cleans better, and it is also much more quiet! and you definitely can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I love how soft and smooth my skin feels after I use this! It&#x27;s waterproof so it&#x27;s really convenient to use in the shower while I let my conditioner set.  The sample size of the cleanser is also a nice tester, but I was a little disappointed as to the size, of course the more the merrier.  I find that I&#x27;m able to use the product once a day, and my skin doesn&#x27;t really dry out (although I always apply a moisturizer anyway).  It has two speeds, neither of which are too harsh or irritating.  I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference in my black heads, blemishes, and pores.  It also really helps your skin get the most out of your moisturizer and skin care products.  I always feel great after using this and think that everyone is due for a good clean once in awhile, great feeling.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful!  I bought it one month ago (Amazon&#x27;s price is better than Wal-Mart &amp; Meijer).  I have acne prone skin that is naturally oily, but of course dries out with acne product usage.  The two speed options are great: the gentle one is perfect for my face every other night (after removing my makeup, I use my own cleanser with the brush) and my face feels as clean and fresh as if I&#x27;ve just had a facial.  I like the higher speed for the decolletage area, which feels great, even though the brush is not specifically designed for this.  I really can&#x27;t imagine the $100 or $200 plus brushes being any better than this!</li>
            <li> My has a problem with the &amp;#34;wheel&amp;#34; not turning evenly.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of trying my sister&#x27;s Mia before I bought the Olay model.  Compared to the Mia, the Olay version feels cheaper.  The bristles aren&#x27;t nearly as nice, and I don&#x27;t think the brush rotates as fast.  I also think the brush head is smaller than the Mia.  All that being said, it works pretty well.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a week.  Bottom line, I&#x27;m just not willing to pay for the Mia, so this will do for now.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product pretty consistently since we received it over a month ago. She said it makes her skin feel cleaner, softer, and smoother after using it and that the waterproof feature is an excellent idea.&lt;br /&gt;She said it took a few days to notice any real difference in the cleaning action but that ultimately she feels her skin is much cleaner after using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did say that she feels she can get the same cleaning results the old fashion way but that it takes much longer and is more difficult to achieve the same results. She feels this is a gadget she would not normally purchase and that she often does not want to take the time to achieve the results it is capable of providing if one wants to spend the time and money. However, given the modest price compared to other similar products this is worth purchasing especially if you have other than ordinary skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out in years, but this made my skin horrible for approximately 2-3 weeks. I believe that the &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; cleansers that I used to exfoliate was embedded in my skin after using this. My skin was horrible, irritated and broken out. I like the Regenerist line of products, but did NOT like this PRO-X tool.  I did not think it was harsh on my face in regards to the feeling, because it did not hurt, but obviously it was not good for me.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to spend $200 on the other Professional Cleansing system that all of my friends have.  Sure enough, Olay came out with one $170 cheaper.  I decided to give it a try since I had much less downside.  I love this product.  I live in Houston and the air is humid and thick here.  I use this product once a day; in the evenings when I remove my make up and go to bed.  I use a good moisturizer when I am done. I am 50 and I think my skin looks significantly better after about 4 weeks of using the Olay system.  I also bought my teenage son one of these and I think his skin looks better also.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product. I had the more expensive Clarisonic, I think the Olay cleanser works just as well for a LOT less money.</li>
            <li> Ok, this was something for my wife. It is not the sort of product I would normally buy, but she is very into anti-aging, skin protection, night masks, etc. What she has been doing is using the battery operated brush to apply her normal skin care regimen and she enjoys the convenience of the brush as well as the included Olay products for skin cleaning.     I&#x27;m not sure how much more efficient or effective the brush system is over a hot wash towel and a good scrubbing and to be honest I have not noticed much of an improvement in my wife&#x27;s skin, but she enjoys the product and that is what this rating is based upon.</li>
            <li> This device can be purchased at CVS, etc. for a few $$$ more, but when I saw it featured here, I had to have it.  It brings  the blood to your skin for a healthy glow and exfoliates dead skin, all the while rejuvenating your skin.  I must pick it up a few times a day.  BTW I&#x27;m over 70 and do not use Botox, Restalyne, etc.  The PRO-X works for me.</li>
            <li> this thing is amazing. i went out and picked it up after reading so many wonderful reviews!many of your were wondering about the brush head and how often to replace it...on the side of the box is says to replace the brush head every 3 months or sooner is bristles become deformed! this was a great investment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of exfoliating, from home made scrubs to luxurious products I&#x27;m the girl who has to hold back not to over scrub her skin, so I take it easy but I love what the benefits are, glow and fresh skin is right under our reach, easy does it with a gentle hand is best.     This is a little device with a rotating scrubbing disc that does a nice job of doing a very foamy face wash especially easy to use in the shower and it comes with a small tube of Olay face wash just for this purpose. I wish the difference between the two speeds was more pronounced but it&#x27;s nice to simply squeeze any favorite face wash as often as allowed for your skin type onto this and wash away, sometimes I use it daily and then I leave it alone for a while, easy to use and fun, it makes the skin glow and it&#x27;s not too strong, you don&#x27;t want to scrub your face like it&#x27;s the kitchen floor, so take a light touch and use this sparingly but remember that healthy young skin renews every 28 days so this will helps keep it fresh and smooth. I like how this makes the makeup looks so much better the next day if I use it before bed or even in the morning, if I drink a ton of water and sleep this makes me glow.</li>
            <li> I was too cheap to by the fancier version of this, but I love the Oil of Olay one!  I use it every night and can definitely see and feel a difference.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford to get a Clarisonic so opted for the Olay cleaning system.  I like the multiple speeds and being able to take it in the shower.  Wish it had a body brush.  Over all I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and would suggest it for anyone on a budget.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this. I bought is thanks to ksprite&#x27;s review on here. I was scrimping for the Clarisonic, but I&#x27;m over the moon I went for this one. I saw instant results, which is always a plus when you&#x27;re trying something new (I hate waiting to see fabulouslness emerge). I have desert dry skin, and no matter how much I exfoliate or how rough the product, I still suffer from scaly patches of skin. One round with this puppy fixed that right up, even on the gentler cycle. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and struggle with dull skin and a depressing onslaught of tiny wrinkles popping through, and so far Olay has helped with those issues. My skin actually glows. Lovely. I&#x27;m combining this with other Olay ProX and Regenerist products, and I&#x27;m really happy with the entire package. I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin, so it&#x27;s exciting to find something reasonably priced that does the job as well as department store potions. I highly recommend this.     The back of the package has the only instructions that come with the product, which is nuts since even coffee filters these days come with illustrated step by steps. But it does tell you how to wrench off the battery cap and how to prep the face for use. And it&#x27;s hardly rocket science, so I can&#x27;t complain.     Overall, I&#x27;m really happy I bought this, and I&#x27;m excited to see continued improvement in my skin&#x27;s dryness and dullness. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three months.  I was going to purchase the Clarisonic device first but read the reviews about the Olay product and decided to try it first because it was so inexpensive.  I really love it!  It&#x27;s a little drying at first but I used a great hydrating moisturizer after that and it was fine.  Also, I know new things can irritate the skin so I started off using it every 4 days for two weeks then every 2 days for a few weeks. Now I use it every other day.  My pores are much smaller, my skin is very soft and my make up goes on so smoothly.  I will be 40 in August and people still guess me for my late 20s so I must be doing something right.  I use good skin care and lots of broad spectrum sunscreen and it seems to work. I also want to add that I do get little bumps on the back of my arms and that I use this product on my arms as well and I&#x27;ve also seen an improvement there.  I will definitely continue to use it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in February along with a tube of the Pro-X exfoliating cleanser that goes with this. First off, it doesn&#x27;t provide nearly enough power for any actual results. It claims it&#x27;s 6X better than washing alone and I can only assume they mean 6X better than just splashing water on your face because I&#x27;ve gotten much better exfoliation with a washcloth or nylon sponge than this weakling can provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, now after 9 weeks of use, one brush head change and 6 batteries later, it no longer works at all. After about 6-7 weeks, it stopped turning on and I had to hold the button down continuously to get it to spin, then in the middle of the night, I&#x27;d suddenly start hearing a whirring sound from my bathroom (I thought my drain was haunted), but it was just this little brush suddenly on and spinning by itself. (the switch was the first thing to go...) I was using it in the shower and it claims to be water resistant, but I guess it&#x27;s resistant for about 3 months since it won&#x27;t turn on at all anymore. I still have about 1/2 a tube of the cleanser left, so basically that outlasted the actual spin brush! (side note, the cleanser claims to be \\&quot;exfoliating\\&quot; but it has no feeling of crystals or scrubbing properties like other exfoliators I&#x27;ve used.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you have VERY sensitive skin and are looking for an affordable way to GENTLY massage your face OUTSIDE of the shower, this may be acceptable, but I saw ZERO results either visibly or in how my skin felt. Save your $ and stick with manual washcloths, sponges or scrublets or invest in a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised at how small this is...don&#x27;t know why, but I expected it to be bigger. However, I like how it fits in my hand and I take it into the shower and use it on my face, neck, and upper back. My skin looks and feels great and I feel like it is really getting cleaned.  I read reviews of this vs the Sonic and decided to try this less expensive item and I&#x27;m very glad I did. As I have not used the Sonic, I can&#x27;t compare, but the Pro-X brush and cleanser work very well for me. I have super sensitive skin and at times the first speed is a bit rough. I then switch to the slower speed which is a great feature.  I&#x27;m finding that Olay is becoming more and more my product of choice for skincare.  In my humble opinion, they have great products at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> This is my first review...ever. I loved this cleansing system so much that I had to write a review to let others know that this really works. I&#x27;ve spent so much money on expensive cleansers and moisturizers, and they never gave the results that this system gave after using it only a few days. I&#x27;m 41 y.o.... my skin looks so fresh and youthful. And, the price is great!</li>
            <li> I got this product not knowing if it would work or not, and let me tell you I have used it now for alittle over a week and my face looks amazing and feels great. I am so happy I cant even tell you how great this product is. I am and I will buy this product again in the futre. And what a great price you cant beat it anywhere else. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I like it but my old one had a much bigger brush and spun much faster which i like I bit better.  I&#x27;m still getting used to this one but I like it, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> When it comes to facial brushes, you can spend up to $100 and over, or you can spend under $30-either way, as an esthetician, I can tell you-aside from price, they are  really all the same. Sure there are a few things you will get with a more expensive brand, but if you are looking for an inexpensive facial cleansing brush that does a great job-look no further. The Olay Professional Pro-X is just as good-if not better-than the high priced and highly recommended Clarisonic. Now, The Clarisonic will have a few extras, such as more speeds and additional attachments for the body, but if all you need is a high-quality brush for the face, why spend all the extra cash?&lt;br /&gt;The Olay Pro-X is a really lightweight, small brush, making it easy to handle. It also makes it easy to take with you when you travel. It has a super-soft brush head, that works very well at either of the two speeds and replacement heads are sold separately and under $10 for 2.  It only requires 2 AA batteries, which are included with it. No charger needed. It is water resistant, so it can be used in the shower. It also comes with a sample size of the Olay Pro-X exfoliating Cleanser, which is nice, but I have own my favorite products, and you can use it with any. I just love the way my face feels after using this. You know how your teeth feel after using a electric toothbrush? That really,really clean feeling? Well, that is similar to how my face feels. Very \\&quot;polished\\&quot; Very clean. And unlike with  my last facial brush, I don&#x27;t have to clean the whole countertop after I use it-no messy \\&quot;spraying\\&quot; of cleanser everywhere. Really the only downside I find to this brush is that it would be nice to have a cover or case to keep the brush head protected, but since it is so small, I can use a makeup case. Overall, a great brush for the money.</li>
            <li> I use this at nighttime bec my face does get red after using this. I use this with olay pro-x face wash than, the exfoliant it comes with, than the pro-x wrincle cream. I think the brisles are right on, not too hard, not too soft. It seems to really clean your pores. It has 2 speeds on it and is battery operated. I am happy to have bought this.</li>
            <li> I used the brush for a few weeks and did not feel like it gave me a better clean than using my hands.  The cleanser that came with the brush made my skin oily.</li>
            <li> For $18, it is a steal! No gimmicks here,It has improved the texture of my skin and really cleans it, shipping was fast as well(:</li>
            <li> I bought this system about a week ago and I have to say I really love it!  When I use it, my skin feels so smooth and my pores look much tighter.  I also find that when I use it after washing off my makeup with my regular cleanser, I find that I still get make up on the brush, so I know this is a really deep clean.  I would definitely recommend that anyone try it - and for the price there&#x27;s not a big risk!</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;ve never used a face cleansing system such as this.  I mean, I&#x27;ve used cleansing systems, like proactive and Neutragena,but not one with a battery operated brush. And while I liked the cleanser, and the way the Pro-X felt as I washed my face, I honestly didn&#x27;t see the point of taking the time to do this when you can just wash your face with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, so since I did like the way it felt and cleaned, I&#x27;m giving it four stars.</li>
            <li> Love this Olay Pro-X Cleansing System.  I had used it for 2 weeks when our puppy destroyed it.  (chewed it to bits)  I had become so enamoured of this product that I immediately went to amazon to re-order, but they were not in stock.  Looked for it online at wal-mart.com, target.com, cvs and walgreens stores.  There were none in stock anywhere.  I kept searching and finally found one at a cvs store.  I went to a lot of trouble to find it again to replace the first one I had because I like it very much and think it is a great price.  A bit tricky to open the battery case, but just keep trying.  The pieces will eventually come apart if you pull hard enough!</li>
            <li> As my title says it is an OK alternative to the coveted Clarisonic. If you cannot afford the actual thing it&#x27;s fine, but honestly it doesn&#x27;t compare to the Clarisonic for a few reasons. The Olay brush I feel isn&#x27;t strong enough to adequately exfoliate my skin, it really felt just like a very VERY gentle rotating scrubbing which didn&#x27;t make a difference in my skin. Also, the brush rotates in circular motions as opposed to the Clarisonic that vibrates and goes deep into the skin. I feel like this thing is like a glorified spin brush. :( I also don&#x27;t like how it uses batteries and how difficult it is to get the battery section to open up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product that came with the brush wasn&#x27;t too great either.</li>
            <li> It definitely gets all my makeup off and has my skin feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> great product for a lot less than the other brands, maybe lacks the power others have, but I don&#x27;t have a face made of marble to clean!</li>
            <li> Really like this product, I use it once a day in the shower (completely waterproof) and my skin has a noticeably better texture with smaller pores! I havent had a break out of acne since using it.</li>
            <li> First of all - I am guy and bought the product as I felt my skin was blocked and have those occasional dry patches and bumps on my face.   I used it only once with my regular cleanser (non-abrasive) but the skin on my forehead is peeling crazily since 2 days. I don&#x27;t see the peeling anywhere else on my face. I am not quite sure what&#x27;s contributed to it but I certainly didn&#x27;t expect so much of flaking with single use.   Not sure what to think of it..</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a year ago and used it to wash my face and remove makeup every night.  I used my normal cleanser, not the Olay cleanser it came with.  I have acne prone skin and this was too rough for it.  I&#x27;ve since learned, I need to be very gentle to my skin when cleansing.</li>
            <li> It really does it&#x27;s job to clean more thoroughly than the past routine. Post facial products are being absorbed better than before.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far about two day apart, been four days since the last time and I feel no need to use it again yet. My sis-in-law and I had been wanting to try it so we got it and the first time i used it it broke me out just one little pimple in my chin, but I didnt mind becuz I rarely break out and when I do, its right there and usually causes no major problems. She said it broke her our a couple places, but I think its just the impurities right under the skin get exposed. This is such a cool product, it kind of buffs ur face, so that I guess if u dont have super sensitive skin, it leaves it what some people refer to as radiant:) yes, feels like u just got a facial or even microderm abrasion. I love it but it is very powerful so I think twice a week or maybe three if u use it lightly is ok. U guys can know about this but when my friends ask me what u do to ur skin, as they sometimes will, I&#x27;m not giving this one up....evil laugh</li>
            <li> This arrived in the estimated delivery time. I have combination skin. This really made my skin soft. Sadly, it&#x27;s not been helping with my acne. :( I think this would work better for other skin types. But I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> It looks like my wife uses it so it looks like it was a good buy ;)</li>
            <li> While this product worked well for a good amount of time, it no longer powers on. I bought it in March and it is now May. I replaced the batteries multiple times, but nothing works. Don&#x27;t buy this product if you want it to last for a while.</li>
            <li> I have bought one for me and one as a gift. My skin is smooth and much cleaner than washing by hand. I wanted to try this kind of cleaner before spending $100+ on the Clarasonic to see if I liked it. Well I do and this does the trick for me. It exfoliates very well and does not irritate my skin. The only downside I have found is when washing, I will rinse halfway thru and if I don&#x27;t shake the excess water out of the brush head it will spray it every where. So, when using be sure to get all the extra water out if you rinse before putting it back on your face. Other than that, I have no complaints and no need at the moment to spend 5x as much on the more expensive models. If you&#x27;ve never used one of these before, try this one before spending the extra money. You wont be disappointed. The person I gave this as a gift to absolutely loved it and told me how much smoother her skin was after using it a few times. It removes all traces of makeup and the brush head is small enough to get under my eyes. I use this with Billy Jealousy-Liquid Sand cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. it really gets the dead skin off, I ise it with my exfollexator , It really works good, hold batterey power&lt;br /&gt;very well, I&#x27;ve tried other machines but this one is the best!</li>
            <li> To me, I consider this is an affordable luxury item.&lt;br /&gt;I say luxury item because you dont necessarily have to have it. You can live without it, BUT it does make your life easier.&lt;br /&gt;You could probably get the same results with an exfoliating scrub (around 2 bucks) from Sally&#x27;s or something or even a washcloth but since this is an automatic cleanser with 2 settings, it takes the work out of scrubbing. All you  have to do is hold it up to your face.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it does make your face smoother and feel cleaner than just using your hands. It also works as a mini massage for your face! I love that you can use it in the shower too.&lt;br /&gt;The downside is: it&#x27;s hard to figure out how to install the batteries - you have to look it up online. The mini exfoliating cleanser sample sucks...St Ives works much better for me. and again, it&#x27;s not a MUST HAVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you really want to try it out, I say go for it. Once you buy it, you&#x27;ll definitely use it every day but again, a semi-rough wash cloth would probably give you the same results.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my aunt and she likes it. She didnt know how low the price was. Sorry for the terrible review.</li>
            <li> For purely facial (not body) cleansing, I would choose this device over the Clarisonic even if their prices were reversed. It&#x27;s more gentle, more inherently ergonomic, and the brush head is small enough to easily clean awkward spots like the very back of your jawline or the edges of your nostrils. (As far as the battery installation issue, I found it took me less than 2 seconds after glancing at the instructions printed on the outside of the box.) So... why is gentle better than a literally-sonic scrub action? If you have acne-prone skin you&#x27;ll know. Too much abrasion irritates the skin and actually incites more blemishes. Ergo, it&#x27;s always a battle to figure out how to really clean off makeup (and oil, dirt, etc.) without creating more problems. For me, the Clarisonic, even on the gentlest setting with the sensitive brush head, made things worse not better. (But that&#x27;s me -- people with different skin issues may have very different experiences.)  I didn&#x27;t start out expecting much from the Olay device. Another reviewer mentioned that the Olay device doesn&#x27;t do \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; (jittery) cleansing, but only spins (btw, be sure to pin your hair back or it can get caught in the spin!). That was partly why my expectations were low, but I discovered I didn&#x27;t feel much qualitative difference -- I only know that the Olay causes a lot less injury to my face while still getting the makeup really off, either it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; or uses a softer brush head, or both. I tested it with a long-wear foundation (which, by design, is particularly hard to remove), and started out by wiping my face with both sides of a wet \\&quot;facial\\&quot; towelette. While plenty of makeup came off on that, I knew there was plenty more. I wet my face and applied my own creamy (non-exfoliating) cleanser, then turned on the Olay device. It was super-lightweight, very easy to hold and maneuver, and because of its smaller size and gentler action allowed me to use it in places I&#x27;d never successfully cleaned with the Clarisonic. Every 20 seconds or so I&#x27;d rinse the Olay, with more makeup visibly coming off each time. After that was done I immediately applied my acne-fighting moisturizer, which seemed to absorb much better than when I was just cleansing without a device. After a few days I saw a visible difference in clarity -- without changing or adding *any* skincare products other than using the Olay device. So: it cleans well enough to wash away pore-gunk that I was failing at removing before, while seeming to create a much more welcoming environment for my anti-acne moisturizer. I&#x27;m an adult (mid-30s) with very acne-prone skin, so my experience might not be relevant for people with different skin issues who want or need a more aggressive scrubbing action. For me, the Olay is perfect, does exactly what I need it to do without causing new problems by doing more.</li>
            <li> awesome product, it works great..</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months now and am amazed at how good it works! Very gentle, but effective. It makes your skin look and feel great! An incredible value at this price. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I expected a larger product ! However I love the fact that it has two speed and the fact that  when I use it my face feels extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad most users are experiencing good results, but I&#x27;m not reading anything extraordinary that would make me run right out and buy it.  I would think the rotating brushes would pull too hard on the skin, abrading it and breaking down the elasticity of the skin.  I have a feeling this is just another gimmick and the real secret to beautiful skin is plain and simple...your genetic make-up and diet.  Hope someone would correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.  Is there a dermatologist out there that would please comment?</li>
            <li> I got my olay pro X about a month ago and I like it , gentle on my skin , but cleans very well, and seems like my pores are smaller  and skin is smoother too!I have noticed a nice change in my 51 year old skin! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am in my forties and I have been using those rough \\&quot;buff\\&quot;ing and \\&quot;puff\\&quot;y type sponges since I was a teenager. I won&#x27;t ever go back to using them again. This brush cleansing tool softened the texture of my face after the first use. My pores are cleaner and smaller. My middle age acne is clearing up. Use any type of facial cleanser/soap you want with it. If you want more foam on your face just wet the brush head a little more. For an extra treat once a week I use about 3 drops of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Peppermint Liquid Soap on the brush head and clean my face with it. The peppermint soap has a cooling effect on your face while you massage it with the brush head. I do strongly suggest that after washing and drying your face that you always use a moisturizer, even if it just a tiny amount. I like to use a few drops of Complex 15 Therapeutic Moisturizing face cream.</li>
            <li> ... Ok...I bought another 6 sets as birthday gifts for my closest friends and relatives.... That&#x27;s how wonderful this product is.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for mother&#x27;s day and returned in within a week. The brush was very limp and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as a wash cloth. The cleanser included was average.  I love Olay products but this one needs to be recalled. I&#x27;d suggest making the bristles a little more sturdy and the brush needs to rotate in both directions.</li>
            <li> doesnt work. made my skin more red.</li>
            <li> I use this brush every other day and can tell a hug difference in my skin. Pores are smaller and makeup goes on better. The only thing is the exfoliator that comes with it is a tiny tube only good for about 2 weeks use depending on how often you use it.</li>
            <li> Very soft cleaning brush and after I am done my face feels so smooth.  Cleans the pores well and my face looks better now that I am using it.</li>
            <li> I love that this cleaning brush is softer and not stiff, as I have sensitive skin. It&#x27;s great, has two speeds and does a superior job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that can&#x27;t handle most exfoliation products, yet occasional exfoliation is integral to smooth skin. This product has a gentle spinning brush.  After one use this product leaves my skin very soft. If you have sensitive/dry skin I don&#x27;t advise using this more than once a week, as that&#x27;s all you need. Be sure to moisturize afterwards as it is very drying.</li>
            <li> I really like this little cleanser - I wanted to be able to exfoliate but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on a big one. It does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Love this item! I have been using it daily for more than 4 months without any issues/complaints.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. It came in good condition. It&#x27;s really easy to take apart and put back together. You can keep it in the shower. I use it daily with alternating facial scrubs. After using it, my face feels really nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I compared, investigated and debated between this machine and the Clarisonic Plus for several days. I liked the CP because it came with a body brush, but then it occurred to me that I could just have an extra brush with the Pro-X that would serve basically the same purpose, so out went that argument for the CP. Heck, at this price, I could just buy an addition unit to use as a body brush!    I went back and forth between the two, reading reviews and so on, and it was when I finally saw a report by a dermatologist who said that the Clarisonic works great in cleaning the skin but that it&#x27;s not an exfoliator and doesn&#x27;t stop wrinkles. So, I figured that if what the Clarisonic boils down to is a facial cleansing brush, well, why not just go with the Olay for a whole lot less. So, I did. And it&#x27;s great!    I generally use a make-up wipe before using the Olay Pro-X brush; however, I did a little test early on and used the brush (on a fully made-up face) BEFORE using the make-up wipe. Believe it or not, when I wiped my face after using the brush, there was NOTHING on the wipe. It did that good a job of cleaning my face! So, I&#x27;m happy. And very happy I didn&#x27;t fork over $200. And my skin looks beauuutiful!</li>
            <li> bought for my 12years old daughter and she loves it, she uses it everyday and it works and is great quality</li>
            <li> work just like its advertise</li>
            <li> It works! I like feeling more clean with using this product. I will say that I have no complaints but not seeing a huge improvement from scrubbing with my fingers but I like being lazy especially when it has been a late night.</li>
            <li> Great price, almost 15.00 less than major chain store. Works great, I also use it with my other facial routine and it works terrific.</li>
            <li> The results of this product are incredible.  Prior to use, I had blackheads on my nose and chin that wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what I tried in addition to occasional pimples and some dry, flaky patches of skin.  Acne products over dry my skin and are only minimally effective on my blackheads and pimples.  Moisturizing products help my dry patches but make my pores look huge and, of course, increase my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product, my blackheads are almost entirely gone.  My skin looks noticeably better with each use.  My pores are much smaller.  The dry patches of skin are gone.  I have had no new pimples.  My skin looks better than it ever has in my adult life and I&#x27;ve only been using this thing for about a week and a half.  It is absolutely incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning tool is a very soft brush that spins on two settings, either high or low.  It runs on batteries that are included.  The casing is made in a way that allows it to withstand water for shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser it comes with has very fine exfoliating granules.  I have been using a very small amount each time.  I only use this once a day because I don&#x27;t want to over exfoliate my skin.  I believe that the magic is really more the brush and less the cleanser.  I am looking for something more natural with the same fine exfoliating texture.  The cleanser that comes with this set is also a little more expensive than Olay products typically are - currently $15 for 6 ounces -- if you decide to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay recommends you replace the brush heads every 3 months and they are currently $8.50 for a set of 2.  They swap out easily so if you have more than one person in the household that will be using this, you could change the head between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product has, by far, exceeded my expectations.  I am extremely happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. The person who received it said she loved it</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It gets my face really clean and leaves my skin super soft! I&#x27;ve seen results within just a few weeks  and will continue to use this and recommend it to my family and friends!</li>
            <li> I am in my 20&#x27;s and have dry, fair, sensitive skin with a minor case of rosacea. I am also a make-up artist and need my skin to look flawless. Having dry flaky skin is difficult enough, but add sensitive in the mix and it is a real pain to find a product that will exfoliate without causing irritation. For the price, it seemed worth to at least try the pro-x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! It makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated without causing much irritation. I even use it on my d&amp;eacute;colletage for little sun damage bumps. The only thing I would like to see is some different brush heads. I was hoping they wuld have a foam head like the DDF hand held. Other than that, I LOVE this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a few months now and I&#x27;ve noticed that ever since I started using it I have way more acne on my forehead.  I had a really cheap Pretika brush that I bought at Rite Aid for only about $12 a few years ago, and even that one was better than this Olay brush.  The head is also much smaller than any other brand I&#x27;ve used, so it takes a much longer period of time just to wash my face, which is really annoying when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  The Pretika brush washed my face faster, and much more thoroughly than this brush does.  The head also rotates much more slowly than any other brush I&#x27;ve used, even on its faster setting and with new batteries.  Don&#x27;t bother with this one.  It looks pretty, but it won&#x27;t make YOU look any prettier.</li>
            <li> Amazing for the price.  Really see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time! Not crazy about the product itself but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Spent half as much on this product as I did on my MK brush and can&#x27;t tell a difference. Well worth the price</li>
            <li> I was surprised to read reviews from people who thought this was too hard for their skin. I really can&#x27;t figure out what they are doing with it.  I have pale and sensitive skin but am not prone to breakouts.  I had no problems with it. I find it very gentle but it does help exfoliate.  I rarely use it with the exfoliating cream that came with it but do occasionally for a little extra scrub. I am very pleased with the price point (compared to the crazy price for the Clarisonic) and to find it is still of good quality and effective.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product that will give out in due time... mediocre results comparable to other similar devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you want quality... go big for the $90 rechargeable ultrasonic facial massage device sold online by the mfr! The one with a cosmetic brand name... sold at the department store, too, and offered online for MUCH MORE if you are not careful!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it I&#x27;ve had it for months now and only used it for the first two weeks. The bristles are soft so it doesn&#x27;t feel like your face is getting clean. The sample bottle of cleanser is probably a tablespoon worth. If you don&#x27;t close your eyes while your using it you&#x27;ll spin soap in them. I gave it two stars because it probably still works after a few months of not using it.</li>
            <li> A while back I spend $300 on a clarasonic. Long story short I ended up returning it because it irritated my face, and made me break out. So after my fave calmed down and reading the reviews on the Olay brush, I figured why not! So glad I did! It&#x27;s so gentle on your face and wow what a difference it makes! My skin is cleaner, softer and pores smaller. I&#x27;ve been using it not a few months and I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it now! Shipper got it to me fast, and I&#x27;m ready to purchase replacement heads!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a clarisonic to compare this to, but I really like this product! I use it every morning--it&#x27;s a lot easier than scrubbing with a washcloth! Easy to clean. Haven&#x27;t had to replace the brush yet but it&#x27;s lasted at least a month. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been tempted by an expensive cleansing system, but decided to try the Olay Pro-X.  I love that I can use and leave it in the shower, which makes me more apt to use it on a regular basis.  It leaves my 50-year-old skin feeling soft and brightens the complexion.  Because I live in an extremely dry climate, it is necessary to exfoliate to allow maximumize my moisturizer.  It&#x27;s small and compact for traveling.  Great product!</li>
            <li> the face wash they send with the brush isn&#x27;t that great so I used my own, it washes all right but I wasn&#x27;t shocked by the results or anything the brush head is super small also, I was expecting it to be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!! I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in the size of my pores since I started using it and my face is so much softer. I use it twice a week for deep cleansing and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Clarisonic Mia and really liked it, but couldn&#x27;t justify the high price tag. I bought the Olay system hoping it would be similar enough, but it wasn&#x27;t. It lacked power and I don&#x27;t believe it cleansed my skin as thoroghly as the clarisonic. You get what you pay for, so if you don&#x27;t mind having a product that is decent at best, it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I ever wrote for a product, for a reason!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to get something like the clarisonic but when I found out Olay has a similar product, I decided to try it and I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is oily, t-zone oily and my pores are easily clogged and I break out and have an uneven skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;The product cleans much better than I thought it would, the brush is very soft but there are 2 speed settings so it depends on how deep you want to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I always have it on the higher setting, but I would suggest to use the first setting in the beginning just to test out the waters. It feels amazing and has a massage like effect.&lt;br /&gt;I use a regular anti-acne cleanser that I have so you have a lot of freedom with what products you want to use to cleanse your face.&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for two months and have been using the same batteries since I purchased it so it&#x27;s very good in that aspect. However, it takes forever to actually open it to install the batteries, and that&#x27;s the only complaint I have about it.&lt;br /&gt;You can have it in the shower and not have to worry about getting water damage.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, It&#x27;s well worth the money, can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap for a product that is so efficient and does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks more even, is cleaner, and is so much softer. Also, when I am not lazy and use it in the morning and before bed, I have no blemishes and no break outs.&lt;br /&gt;Its so worth it, everyone in my family with their different skin uses it and loves it.&lt;br /&gt;GET IT, what are you waiting for? You&#x27;re gonna love it.</li>
            <li> JUST GOT IT TODAY. THE BRUSH HAD A FUNNY SMELL, LIKE IT WAS SITTING AROUND SOMEWHERE WHICH WAS A TURN OFF. BUT I USED IT ANYWAY. THE BRUSH ROTATES, AND VIBRATES..I THINK. UM...WELL IT DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO. MY FACE FELT SMOOTH AND CLEAN AND REFRESHED.</li>
            <li> The brush is just soft enough.  The cleanser gets rid of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; but does not rough up my skin.  I like being able to scrub my skin without hurting it.</li>
            <li> First time user of a powered brush exfoliater and I am sold on this one, it is portable, comfortable to hold, has 2 speeds and the battery seems to last pretty long in this.  Comes with a very small tube of exfoliating cleanser but you can order the larger tube or use with a cleanser of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really not to much else to say, just simply is worth investing in.</li>
            <li> USEFUL!AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. can make u face really clean, but has no effect on black nose!&lt;br /&gt;u can buy it for daily wash!</li>
            <li> I bought this cleansing brush because a relative has a similiar one and I like it, however, this one is weak in strength and the brush is too rough for my skin, it made it welt.</li>
            <li> It is what I expected.  Not too abrasive, which is what I worried about.</li>
            <li> Love this system...As good as an &amp;#34;outside spa&amp;#34;.  I only use it approx. 3x week, but it makes my face look more alive.  When I first received the System and used it, the next day I had a friend comment on how nice my face looked.  Made me feel good!</li>
            <li> This brush works amazingly well! I have used the real Clarisonic brush that costs nearly 10x as much as this one, as well as the Clarisonic knock-off called Pretika, and I can honestly say that the Olay brush is my favorite of the bunch! It&#x27;s bristles are the perfect texture and the motor&#x27;s speed is just right. I even prefer the way it fits in my hand (it&#x27;s much smaller than the other two). Last year I was trying to decide between purchasing the Pretika and the Olay brush, and I ended up with the Pretika. A little over a year later, it stopped working and it was outside of warranty, so I decided to try the other one. I wish I had chosen the Olay brush in the first place! The Pretika brush is MUCH rougher on your face. I can&#x27;t believe I used it for a year! The Olay&#x27;s brush head is so much softer, but still really effective. I have only been using it for about 4 days and my skin already feels different.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product back in Februaury.  I immediately saw an improvement in my skin&#x27;s tone, texture, and clarity.  The love affair was short-lived however.  In 3 months time the motor started dying out.  I replaced the batteries, but it did nothing to change the now super slow speed.  I wrote to P&amp;G and immediately was contacted.  A &#x27;replacement&#x27; coupon was sent to me.  No stores would accept this coupon.  I wrote back, I was sent an e-mail advising me to inform the retailers that they would receive their money back, as it was an official company coupon.  I still could not use it.  I was told a check for $29.99 would be mailed to me.  After 2 months and no check I sent another e-mail.  I have now been informed that it is company policy not to issue replacements, either of the product, or in coupon form.  I also was told that I would receive a check for $29.00 now, not $29.99.  Even though I received a prompt respose initially, I&#x27;m dissatisfied.  I received conflicting information from the same person.  I have all original correspondence(e-mails, letter, and coupon.) In the meantime I still haven&#x27;t purchased a new brush and I&#x27;m waiting on the check.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, because Im too cheap to buy a Clarisonic. I have used it for a couple of weeks and have not noticed much difference in my skin. My face does feel clean, but no different than using a good cleanser. It really just speeds up the process. So I primarily now use it at night when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face well the old fashioned way. I do like the product, but worry it may be too abrasive for long term use.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and liked the weight of the unit and the strength of the motor. What I did not like was that the brush head was so extremely soft that I found it wasnt doing much exfoliation, even after a week of every day use. I am a regular exfoliator (both chemically with retin A and Alpha hydroxy acids; and mechanically with a scrubber). I guess if you have super sensitive skin, this might work for you, but most people just have average skin. The whole point of exfoliating is to irritate the skin to turn over new cells and produce collagen. This machine is barely doing a thing, except producing a nice foam.  They really should PROVIDE TWO BRUSHES, one for sensitive skin and one for more friction. I called the company and got my $30 back. I&#x27;ll stick with the $18 unit that isnt quite as nice, but has a little firmer brush head to do what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I was hesitant due to a few negative reviews, but thought I would try it before the plunge of the clarisonic.  So worth it.  I can no longer wash my face with a washcloth, because the Pro-X gets my face so smooth and clean.  It gets rid of all the little imperfections and my skin has never looked brighter or as healthy.  I would reccomend a different cleanser than the one which comes with it though.</li>
            <li> MY Olay pro X is out of order!!! It doesn&#x27;t work!!! I live in Italy and... this is a big problem</li>
            <li> I have clear skin. I didn&#x27;t buy this because I had an acne problem. I felt the normal aveeno face wash I was using was too harsh so I tried this. It made my face break out terribly. I mean bad. I&#x27;d never recommend this or use it again myself. But it did arrive quickly and was as advertised. So hats off to the seller :)</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and clean...you can clearly feel the before and after difference......get it and you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, and I am extremely happy with the results.  NO it won&#x27;t remove wrinkles or do magic on your skin, but what it does is make your skin super increadibly clean.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever had my facial skin so clean and so radiant and looking so young.  The device is very easy to use and feels wonderful on your skin.  I use it about 3 times a week and the results are amazing.  I am so happy with this product, especially with the price that Amazon charges.</li>
            <li> This is it... Finally!    I have very oily skin and even though I&#x27;m an older woman I was suffering from constant breakouts of acne. So bad that I lived behind cover-ups and foundations everyday.  I read in a magazine that gently exfoliating your face regularly would help this problem. And although a $200 power brush was being promoted in that little article, I wasn&#x27;t about to blow that much cash on something I&#x27;m not sure would work.  I did my research and came across this lil&#x27; darlin&#x27;. Still a bit reluctant, I went for it. And what I thought was a hopeless case is now a glowing, supple, clear and fresh face. Mind you, I still have SOME acne breakout every now and then, but hardly any at all since using this skin cleanser.  The brush is easy to assemble. Just pop the brush in, install the included batteries, and it&#x27;s ready to use. It&#x27;s not too big or heavy and you have the choice of two speeds! Make sure you order the 2 count box of extra brushes. Love It!</li>
            <li> I am so inpressed with this facial cleanser. I just put my cleanings cream on with a little water &amp; run this little cleanser  and I am here to tell you my face feels so refreshed and looks amasing.  If you have a lot of money, you will have more in your purse if you purchase this cleaner to buy other things.  I buy most everything here at Amazon, however I bought this at Walmart (and it cost more) than on this Amazon Site.  Enjoy, I am sure you will.</li>
            <li> Removes dead skin without damaging or irritating your skin. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell how long the brush last. I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> i got this bc i didn&#x27;t want to dish out a few hundred bucks for a FACE BRUSH. and this thing is amazing!  it exfoliates well, i use the wash it comes with. you might want to get a big one after you finish using the sample!  and pick up a few extra brushes as well. this is worth trying out.</li>
            <li> Had to review this item.  I had low expectations though I had read great reviews.  I didn&#x27;t really expect it would clear up my skin but after suffering for more than 15 years with recurrent acne, I finally seem to have it under control.  If I do get a blemish, it clears up faster than before. I am still using the same products I was using before the olay pro-x, but apparently my skin is cleaner and the products seem to do their job better.  People have asked me what I have done with my skin and I think this is the secret, along with the loreal skin genesis serum.   I am getting one for my mom and my cousin</li>
            <li> I liked this item okay at first.  It&#x27;s interesting to read in the various reviews how some people think it&#x27;s too wimpy while others think it&#x27;s too strong/scratchy.  So does that mean it&#x27;s like Baby Bear&#x27;s porridge - just right?    I have used it only in the shower. I did find that using it was a bit much for my skin - any kind of exfoliation, mechanical (like this) or chemical (retinoids, etc.)tend to get my skin kind of overexcited if used too often, so that it gets rough from trying (apparently) to overcome the loss of cells or protective layers.  So I didn&#x27;t use it for a while, and then when I picked it up again, it appeared to have two colors of mold on the brush section, at the base of the bristles!  I am fairly sure that our water supply here contains algae, yeasts, and goodness knows what else, so that isn&#x27;t amazing or anything.  However, it&#x27;s unpleasant and a bit scary!    I&#x27;m trying to decide whether to bother getting a replacement brush.</li>
            <li> 2 speeds, use it in shower to clean face.  Batteries are lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought. The first one I at Walmart whilst on vacation and I am in love with cleaning system . I can compare it to the clarisonic which I used first and the olay is best by far in terms of price and cleaning.</li>
            <li> After hearing Dr. Oz&#x27;s recommendation I began researching the Olay Professional Pro-X Cleansing System.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has begun to have breakouts and flaky skin.  I&#x27;ve used scrubbers and special cleansers but usually end up with irritated skin.  After reading many reviews (good &amp; bad) I decided to try it.  I have been using the cleansing system (with the Olay cleanser) every day for the past 8 months.  I no longer have the flaky skin and have minimal breakouts. It would be better if this was a rechargeable unit, but then it might cost significantly more.  For $30, not a bad deal. Great gift idea for teenagers too.</li>
            <li> I buy one about once every 6 months, I just wish they would lsst longer, but this one lasts much longer, is consistently great quality and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I got the worst case of Acne Mechanica from this rotating brush.  It brought on hundreds of small pustules all over my face and neck.  I have not had acne this bad since college.  I&#x27;m acne prone and usually only see small pimples before my cycle.  Now I&#x27;m covered with acne.  This is probably ok to use on the t-zone of the acne prone or maybe just on a weekly basis.  But I would not use it once daily as I did.  I&#x27;m on my second week of trying to get rid of all this acne.  Makeup will not cover all these little active pustules.  I might need to call the dermatologist just to get an antibiotic for this month.</li>
            <li> I was little skeptical before, but after using it I surely can recommend it to my friends.I really like the way it cleanses your skin, leaving it soft, clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone combination skin and I came across this as a top seller under beauty items on Amazon. Out of sheer desperation (I&#x27;ve tried a lot of skincare products), I ordered it. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week, but I can say my skin looks noticeably better. It&#x27;s smoother (your face really feels amazingly smooth after using it), brighter, and makeup goes on looking so much nicer. Not to mention the best part: I&#x27;ve broken out less. I don&#x27;t remember the last time I went a day without breaking out, so this is saying something. I also feel like my acne creams and moisturizers soak in so much better, like other reviews have mentioned. Oh, and by the way, the battery case isn&#x27;t as difficult to open as some reviews have made it sound. I&#x27;m a weak girl with tiny hands and if I can open this, I&#x27;m pretty sure anyone else can-- just get a good grip. It&#x27;s made to be waterproof so it needs to be tight, so just put some strength into it :) If I remember, I will write an update after a few more weeks of use. But so far, so good!  Update: 11/20/11  Hi, so as promised here&#x27;s an update on this product after another 2 weeks of use. So far, I&#x27;m still loving this facial brush. It&#x27;s still keeping my skin much clearer than in the past and my skin has developed a healthier looking glow to it. Be warned, though, your pores won&#x27;t shrink after only 2 weeks of use (for the reviews that have mentioned this, I still haven&#x27;t seen a drastic difference but that&#x27;s maybe because my pores are really big and it would take a lot more deep cleaning for them to appear smaller). Definitely keep expecting super soft skin and great moisturizer absorption. For people with skin that tends to be on the dry side (like me!), I recommend using the brush only at night, before applying a heavy moisturizer.  Also, for those of you on the edge about this brush because of some reviews bashing the brush quality, please believe me when I say you seriously don&#x27;t want anything more abrasive than this. Your skin will hateyou for scrubbing it like a metal pot, rather than gently exfoliating it with a soft bristle brush. The point is not to have amazing skin after one scrub, but to routinely use the brush so as to see improvement over time :)  Update: 12/15/11  I&#x27;m happy to say that my clearer skin has remained consistent since using the pro-x. Sad thing is, I looked today and Amazon is now selling it for under $20 when I bought mine for $25 :( Oh, I also saw Costco selling the same system but with a huge bottle of that cleanser for a decent price. I would not recommend getting the Costco pack unless you KNOW you like the cleanser, though. For me, the cleanser is nothing special-- it smells quite bad, though (very, very plastic-y smell).</li>
            <li> I looked at all the $200 facial brushes, and they were all too large for me to hold comfortably though I have a normal size 7 hand.  Then on impulse I bought this brush, it was so cheap!  It is perfect to hold, the brush comes off for washing, it has two speeds and the lower one does a nice overall job, the upper good for difficult places.  Now the wonderful part.  It works.  I&#x27;ve always done home facials, but they are messy.  This brush is small enough for the medicine cabinet, and it takes about 1 minute to use!  I use a tiny bit liquid hand soap with water to wet my face, then go over with the brush.  Then rinse and apply moisturizer.  Every face is different but I find that a few times a week keeps my face blackhead free.  It even got rid of some tiny skin tabs and lowered bumps that had been there for years.  After a year the brush is still fine and the batteries still working.  I can&#x27;t recommend this little brush enough.</li>
            <li> Really cleaning i love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 speed veeeery nice and waterproof</li>
            <li> Compared to similar cleaning brushes out there the price is great. I don&#x27;t care for the cleaning scrub that comes with it although my skin is extra sensitive so I just use my own. The brush itself itsnt quite as strong as I thought it would be but then again I was expecting something more like microdermabrasion kit. But it does get your skin clean and glowing and gets the job done. For 25 or 30 bucks it&#x27;s definatley worth it.</li>
            <li> Nothing to compare. This product doesn&#x27;t even belong in same category as Clarisonic. It brings awareness which is great, BUT get the Clarisonic as your face will THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I love this! My skin feels clean and soft after using it. ...like a mini facial everyday. I think the value is great for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great!  So glad I opted for this affordable model over more expensive ones that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  Even &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; type moisturizing products will cause me to have breakouts and blisters on my face.  I have to be extremely careful with anything that touches my facial skin.  This product has been a life saver for me.  In just one week of using it, I can see an absolute difference in my skin clarity.  I did not use the sample of skin cleanser that was included for fear it would break out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and not irritating to my skin and I am able to use any cleansing product I wish with it-or in my case, just water.  I find using it in the shower is very convenient because the casing is totally waterproof.  The brush head is easy to remove and replace.  The battery casing is horribly tight and very hard to open for battery (re)placement and is the reason I would not give this cleansing system 5 stars.</li>
            <li> they sent me the olay cleansing system, and it looked used. the front of the handle has a black smudge, and inside where the battery is supposed to go i noticed some clear/thick liquid. and i still have no idea what it is. i couldve gotten this in the store. thats what i recommend. DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li> Waste of money ,very poor product .Reaction To sample three weeks to recover. Trashed it. machine too slow. thank you</li>
            <li> I was honestly skeptical about this product at first, and I hesitated to spend the $30. However, considering how I&#x27;ve been so absolutely happy with the pro-x products (lotions, creams, treatments), I convinced myself to try this out. WOW WOW WOW. I saw a huge difference after just the first try. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and my skin has never looked this good since I was a baby -- it literally has made my skin baby soft and smooth. My only disappointment is that it&#x27;s not rechargeable, but I hope olay will release a new rechargeable version soon. I use this product along with the pro-x daily moisturizer, the wrinkle smoothing cream, and the eye-restoration complex. I&#x27;m 29 yo, and my skin has never looked this wonderful. My whole routine is definitely not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth the price (at least to me) compared to the more expensive alternative luxury items out there.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the overwhelming positive reviews from other customers. I too had coveted the Clarisonic, but there was no way I could justify spending over $200 on something to clean my face. Yes, I have researched the Clarisonic, and most people would say that it does more than just \\&quot;clean your face\\&quot;, but I think the Pro-X is a pretty good alternative for the price! I did get a little frustrated trying to pry the battery compartment cover off, and I finally managed to shove a pair of scissors in the little space, which I do not recomend! My husband walked in with a horrified look as I was struggling with the battery cover. I read the instructions, did exactly what I was supposed to and got wonderful results. My skin was soft &amp; smooth, and it did have a \\&quot;glow\\&quot;, which can somewhat be attributed to the small sample of exfoliating scrub :)  Great product at a great price!! *Some words of advice, make sure you place the scrubbing brush firmly against your skin BEFORE you turn the Pro-X on, or you will sling stuff everywhere!! LOL!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the many reviews raving about it and the few that were not as pleased with it. I used the clarisonic a couple of times and I debated whether to buy my own or buy this Olay. I decided mainly because of the cost to go with Olay. I am so happy I did! I have to say I love how small it is, it fits nicely in your hand and travels well. I also prefer that the Olay pro-x head turns in circles as opposed to the clarisonic that just pulsates back and forth. It has two speeds or you can choose to not turn it on and just manually move it in slow circles on your skin, I do that some days and it works just as well. I love using this every morning. My face always feels so clean and refreshed, and the bristles on the head are nice and soft.   I will say the only complaint I have is with the facial wash that comes with it. I did not like it at all, well more it did not agree with my face. It made me break out badly so I stopped using it and I have used the Olay pro-x with Purity, Philosophy&#x27;s face wash, which worked much better, but didn&#x27;t necessarily help with my acne, but the pro-x still worked great! And now I use it with Obagi Clenziderm, which works well with it too and definitely helped clear up the acne.  I am aware that the box does not come with instructions for how often to use it or how to open the thing to replace batteries, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. Start using it every other day depending how sensitive your skin is and add or lessen the days you use it. To replace the batteries you just pull the bottom part out. It is a bit stubborn, but it&#x27;s easy to get the hang of it. After using it every morning my batteries lasted for 3 months.   Overall, GREAT product and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it in for the world!  Easy to use, travels great, cheap price!</li>
            <li> I bought  his as a gift.  I had bought one for myself previously and really liked it.  I have not used the much more expensive versions of this device but cannot imagaine how they could work any better!  Great for the price.</li>
            <li> I enjoy my pro-x system. I especially love that it is waterproof and that I can just leave it in the shower and use it there. The box comes with the cleaning system, one brush, batteries and a mini cleansing solution. I recommend keeping the little tube of cleansing solution for travel, and then going to the store to purchase the bigger container of solution for home use. I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months and have not had to change the batteries yet; I use it about every other day. When you use the product the first few times when the bristles are still new, you do feel a difference in the slow and high speeds; but now that I&#x27;ve worn the bristles out I am unable to tell the difference with the two speeds of the brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this little facial machine for my grandson who is fighting problem skin.  In just a couple of days, there was a noticeable difference....and we all know that when we look good, we look happy!  Good price and speed of light shipping.  Do not hesitate buying this item and saving your money on the very expensive model.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves how soft and clean her face is now!  Much cheaper than the Clairsonic and gives fabulous results!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I haven&#x27;t use any other cleanser, but I was thinking about trying the Clarisonic.  This is perfect for my needs!!</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel so soft and smooth, and lets you daytime or nitetime moistures work all that much better well cleaned face.  I have sensitive skin and using this is just fine. For the cost, this is a wonderful product with lots of benefits.  Inexpense, gentle, and once again leaves you with that super clean feeling.  5 thumbs on this product!!</li>
            <li> My wife only used it for 1 month, then it doesn&#x27;t work. My wife keeps blaming me that I should have not bought this kind of product. I hate this.</li>
            <li> YES! That is all I have to say. When you use this system, you will wonder why you never used it in the first place. I started using it when I started breaking out all the time and I couldn&#x27;t get rid of my acne. Olay is the only skin care line that has not cause my face to break out! It has gotten rid of my acne, and I rarely have minor zits. I bought this for my mother for christmas and now both of my parents use it! The greatest part is that it is water proof, so you can take it in the shower, and you can use any facial cleanser with it. Love Olay.</li>
            <li> I love using this product in the shower every day. It feels so good and leaves my face feeling soft and clean. I like the sample tube of exfoliating wash that it comes with but you can use it with any facewash or soap as well. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in how often I break out or how bad breakouts are, but it isn&#x27;t making anything worse and is very fun to use.</li>
            <li> Very good product and want to buy another one for my mom. It feels very clean after washing face with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews on Amazon as I was looking for a more inexpensive option to the Ultra Sonic version. It was working great and my face felt awesome BUT 7 months later it just stopped working, I changed the batteries and was already changing the head regularly but nothing works. I&#x27;m so disappointed! I sent  Oil Of Olay an email regarding the situation. Hopefully they will stand by their product.</li>
            <li> Having lifelong problems with blackheads, whiteheads and nasty \\&quot;bumps\\&quot; on my face, I was looking for an effective way to remove makeup and exfoliate. I have friends who swear by their much pricier Clarisonics, but I am very happy with this scrubber. Combined with the cleanser/scrub, my face feels really clean and I haven&#x27;t had the problems with the outbreaks. The brush is soft and gentle, easy to detach and wash, and scrubber has 2 speeds. Good size and easy to use. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to save some $$ and get all the benefits of a thorough cleansing system. Feels really good, too!</li>
            <li> I had low expectations due to the low cost of this item. However, it works fabulously! I have never used a Clarisonic before so I can&#x27;t compare the two. I just know that this battery powered device is great. I have adult acne and this has helped my skin clear up like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I use it just once a day in the evening after I&#x27;ve taken my makeup off. I do not use the cleanser that comes with the device. I did not find it to be very helpful for my sensitive acne prone skin. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a very clean, smooth, and acne free complexion.</li>
            <li> I use it every single night. I have a severe dry skin problem so just washing my face doesn&#x27;t get all that grossness up. But this not only takes care of that, it keeps me from breaking out and makes my face feel wonderful. The only thing that bothers me is that to replace the brush heads, it gets a little expensive. But its soooo worth it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it broke down after only 2 weeks. I changed the battery, but it still did not work. I only used about 5-6 times and followed the instructions carefully. I left a feedback requesting a replacement, but did not get any response. I threw away the original package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works fine, but I&#x27;ve never expected that it would break down so soon. Maybe it&#x27;s just bad luck.</li>
            <li> I think the product needs to have a little more speed to it. If you apply just a bit of pressure the brush stops turning. Changed the batteries same thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often.  It irritates my skin a bit.  I do have sensitive&lt;br /&gt;skin.  I can tell if it&#x27;s doing any better of a job then a wash cloth does.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. You will notice &amp; feel a difference in your complexion within one week. I use it with the Boots No 7 skincare line and receive a lot of compliments on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. It is not as nice as the Clarisonic but definitely does the job of deep cleaning her face. Her face feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleansing brush, it cleanses very thoroughly and leaves skin very smooth and soft.  I find that my skincare products go on much more evenly. It is super easy to use, feels good, and the compact size is great for the shower/travel. I won&#x27;t wash my face without a product like this ever again, it definitely is a much deeper clean than using just a washcloth.  However, please note - this product comes with absolutely no instructions - i.e. doesnt say when to buy replacement brushes so I&#x27;m guessing every month or so?), and it is VERY hard to put in the batteries.  Also, the batteries that came with mine did not work. Aside from these minor issues, the product itself is terrific.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people are comparing this to the Clarisonic.  It is worth 10x less.  If you have extremely sensitive or perhaps acne prone skin, then this tool is gentle enough for you.  Or, if you have very dry skin and want to massage a moisturizing mask on, then I think this would be a gentle enough utensil for you.  But to exfoliate, NOPE, no comparison.  And, I was so hoping to like it after reading the reviews comparing it to the Clarisonic.  Just not what I was looking for.  I&#x27;m 50 and a buff puff is much more exfoliating than this little gizmo.  Just trying to give a fair evaluation as I love skin care products that deliver!!</li>
            <li> I no longer have the flaky skin and have minimal breakouts. It would be better if this was a rechargeable unit, but then it might cost significantly more. For a low price, not a bad deal. Great gift idea for teenagers too. After hearing Dr. Oz&#x27;s recommendation I began researching the Olay Professional Pro-X Cleansing System. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has begun to have breakouts and flaky skin. I&#x27;ve used scrubbers and special cleansers but usually end up with irritated skin. After reading many reviews (good &amp; bad) I decided to try it. I have been using the cleansing system (with the Olay cleanser) every day for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> I really think the brush helps. Better thAn other brushes and a lot cheaper. Makes my skin so smooth too.</li>
            <li> I initially started out with the Clarisonic and returned it in about a week.  I thought for the $200 price tag I would achieve amazing results.  I was VERY disappointed.    Still, looking for a facial cleansing system, I came across Olay&#x27;s product.  I too was skeptical considering the enormous difference in price between the two; however, for a fraction of the cost, it was worth a try.  I was amazed at how well the product worked and I felt (and saw) how well it cleaned my skin.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier and nearly a year later, I still use the product.  Oh and I use any cleanser and it works just as well.  Obviously to each is own; however, honestly, you really don&#x27;t have to spend the $200 for the Clarisonic to get a product that works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and is great!  After you wash your face with it you feel super clean.  Price is right too compared to the ultra expensive brands available.  I like that it is small and portable, makes it easy for travel and to fit into the bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> great brush and does the job of cleaning off my makeup.. i use it with African black soap</li>
            <li> This an excellent product.  It does a great job.</li>
            <li> Weak in power. Might be slightly better than using just your hands to wash your face but not that much better. Might be ideal for traveling since it&#x27;s lighter and smaller but that&#x27;s about it.  Just save up and get a clarisonic brush instead.  It&#x27;s worth way more and it&#x27;ll last you longer.</li>
            <li> I like this cleansing product. I use it everyday and I feel my face glows and the skin become healthier than before. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s not to big! You can replace batteries so no need to rely on a rechargeable unit. I use mine every other day and the cleansing brush is still in great shape!!!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001JQLNNW Olay Professional Pro-X Anti-Aging Starter Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;I sent my daughter the Olay for Valentine&#x27;s Day. She was with me when I bought mine and thought I should have bought one for her too. For years I thought I was washing my face with a wash cloth and my very thorough \\&quot;routine.\\&quot; After using this, and seeing how much I had been missing...I only would use this method. I had been really missing so much make-up. Now I travel with my Olay Pro-X. I have one in my shower and one at my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001JQLNNW Olay Professional Pro-X Anti-Aging Starter Kit]]</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic is by far much better then this Olay brush. Trust me Clarisonic is worth the splurge . The Olay brush dosent use the technology.the Clarisonic has... Such a dud.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome! I love how soft it is on my skin and it is able to get every curve and angle from the sides of my nose to behind my ears! I have a different microdermabrasion brush that I was using but my skin was getting really dry in patches from it. Also, you can only use microderm every other day so on the off days I was just using a wash cloth and my skin didn&#x27;t feel very smooth. This brush takes care of the daily dead skin buildup and actually feels good as it does it!</li>
            <li> Want nice soft face?  This scrubbing machine will do it.Your face will be soft and clean.  You will love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing for that money !leaves your skin fresh clean and regenerated you can use it also with ever other face soap cleanser it works wonders to a dry and tired gray skin just try it and you will see !</li>
            <li> Its good for a regular facial clean but if you really need some deep cleaning...probably do better to get a more powerful brush and unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried one so I can&#x27;t compare them. The bristles are very soft which is probably good for me because I have a tendency to scrub my face very hard and causing dryness and what not. Definitely feels like you get a good clean compared to just using your hands. I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my face, mostly in the shower when the face has gotten a little steamed first, so no problems getting it wet, it&#x27;s waterproof. The batteries that we&#x27;re included have lasted for several months so I&#x27;m very pleased with the product overall.</li>
            <li> It OK but not worth the money I paid. The brush is too soft and short. I would like to fine another with some horse power.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was looking over the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator,and this in the beauty isle. The Neutrogena was twice the price with pre-filled scrub pads to use only once. This had soft brushes to replaced every 3 months. And I chose it because I could use whatever cleansing product I wanted, not being stuck with pre-filled scrubs I might not like. (it is described as having micro crystals in them That seems a bit rough to me for a facial scrubber. Also this one is water resist, and the Neutrogena is not. So for the price and freedom to decide, I picked the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dislike the battery compartment, and feel over time it may wear out from just changing batteries. Other then that I like how soft the brush is, how easy it is to use, does not tear up my skin, and it has softened my forehead wrinkles (yes we get them).&lt;br /&gt;Also it appears to assist my moisturizer in absorbing more efficiently as well. It certainly helps me enjoy the time I now wash my face more often, and am now more consistent with clearer skin and softer appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for ease of use, brush replacement costs, freedom to use your own cleaning products and being waterproof (or resistant).</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what you expected to do; however, I have had powerful motor in my previous one. the results are basically the same you end up with beautifully exfoliated healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I have never purchased the Olay cleansing product that came with this facial brush, I use my own cleanser. Brush has always worked great, replacing batteries every few months to keep a good spin. I buy the 2 pack replacement heads about every 6 months....each head last about 3 months if brush used daily or twice daily.  I bought this instead if spending the hundred dollar+ on the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; brush.  Great alternative. Would repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> This simple yet effective face scrubber is lightweight and easy to use. It has two speeds. The higher speed is gentle and not excessive for the task. I have not used the lower speed because I have not found a need to as yet. It is \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; so may be used in the shower. That is where I use it most of the time. I would recommend to the company that the scrubber come with some additional attachments for use on elbows and feet. The kit includes the Olay facial cleanser. I have no feedback for that product because I have not noticed any outstanding feature of it after several uses. I will mention that it is made in China and for that reason I shall look to purchase another cleanser to use with the scrubber. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this cleanser which feels great on my face--it gently scrubs and cleans.  I used it with the small tube of exfoliant that came with it and my skin was very soft afterwards.  It will work with any cleanser you want to use.  Bought one for my daughter &amp; daughter-in-law for Christmas and they both love theirs also.</li>
            <li> I love this scrubber.  It makes my face feel so good!  I&#x27;ve done microderm before and this scrubber is very comparable if used regularly.  The battery lasts about 2 months being used twice a day.  I will warn that you don&#x27;t want to use it longer then a couple of minutes because it can leave your skin feeling raw.  I only use regular soap with it.  The scrubbing soap tends to be to much for my skin.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates well and worth the money</li>
            <li> Great transaction, but the product is not worth it. Very weak.</li>
            <li> Great customer service. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, but wish I had shopped more carefully and purchased the two in one brush available (like this but faster, with microdermabrasion pad)</li>
            <li> Received item but did not work very very disappointed. Thought the batteries might be dead but bought new batteries and the item still did not turn on. WOULD LOVE IT IF IT TURNED ON!!###</li>
            <li> I have wanted a Clarisonic since they first came out.  Unfortunately they cost more money than I am willing to pay.  I encourage anyone who wants a cleansing brush to try this product.  It really gets in there and cleanses pores. The brush utilizes the perfect speed and exfoliation and skin is thanking me.</li>
            <li> Really helps exfoliate my face. Pores minimized *slightly* after use. Pores will never be smaller but helps my peace of mind.</li>
            <li> Great power. 2 speeds. Works really well!</li>
            <li> I had always wanted to have one of these advanced cleaning systems but didn&#x27;t think that they would be affordable. I came across this item and along with the $3 coupon the purchase was reasonable. I tried this yesterday and it is so wonderful. My skin feels wonderful, soft and smooth. The only set back was trying to insert the two batteries in the unit.  I am not mechanically inclined.  Neither is my husband. What a bunch of dopes, you must think.  Anyway, I clicked on YouTube and figured it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever considered buying one, don&#x27;t think, just do!</li>
            <li> The best part is you can use this in the shower! It works very well, has 2 different speeds and makes your feel so smooth when adding an exfoliator scrub to the brush. It is easy to use &amp; isn&#x27;t loud, cumbersome, or awkward to handle in the shower. I love it and use it all the time now and my face feels so much cleaner &amp; smoother.</li>
            <li> This has worked really well for me.  I have very sensitive skin and only use it once a week, but I have seen a big improvement in my skin.  My skin used to get extremely dry and very flakey in the winter, to the point where I was using heavy night-creams and oils with limited success.  I have not had problems at all this winter.  I like that this is more like microdermabrasion, as opposed to the exfoliators with large rough grains.  I bought one for my sister and she really likes it as well!</li>
            <li> This is ideal for anyone who appreciates a clean, smoothe complextion.  Very easy to use and extremely easy to keep clean and store.  It is well suited for various cleansers.  You can use a scrub type substance that has beads.  You can use a liquid wash or even a cleaser from a tube.  This is a very versatile way to cleanse your skin.  Just great!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am 24 years old, Caucasian, and have always had pretty acne-free skin. However, I have always since I can remember had blackheads all over my nose and chin. I have tried everything! Face washes, biore strips, masks, facials- nothing has gotten rid of them. So I heard about the Mia 2 but didn&#x27;t want to commit to the price so I purchased this product. I have to say its been 2 weeks and my nose and chin ae clearing up fit the first time in my entire life! My pores are smaller and blackheads are smaller and disappearing. I use it once a day with tea tree face wash from body shop. I don&#x27;t suggest using this twice a day as it may dry out skin. The first week I did get 3 pimples but they have gone away. Your skin and pores have to get used to exfoliation. I will definitely continue to use this product and hopefully all my blackheads will be gone soon!</li>
            <li> I saw many good reviews about this product and wanted to try. The device delivers the expectation which clean my skin very well. However, I found the brush being a little too stiff and harsh to the skin. I just need to be careful not to put pressure, just lightly buff the skin like scrub.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaser that came with it is smelly and specially it was MADE IN CHINA. I personally do not trust any consumable/skin contact product from China. They are well-known for mixing toxic chemical to increase volume/sales. I tried using it once and do not like it at all. It is gel like, no foam action and did not clean well. I use Clarisil cleanser for sensitive skin and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;For the price $16 (I got $5 coupon clip during the purchase), this is the worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Not really impressed&lt;br /&gt;It works better when I use it with st Ives facial scrub</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person loved it</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this to exfoliate in the shower, the unit is waterproof so that was an acceptable move. After even a few days, the difference was noticeable. Reduced dry skin from the cold or dry air, reduced skin irritation and pimples from a more thorough cleansing and exfoliation. (I&#x27;m really glad she&#x27;s here helping me type this, I think the last time I worried about cleansing my face was when I had some acne at age 14) The battery has lasted half a year so far with no signs of stopping. The tube that comes with it contains an adequate source of cleansing, though I&#x27;m lead to believe that she also sometimes uses plain dove soap as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, she is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this product.. Cleans my face thouroughly and leaves no oil or make.......&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teresa Santillan :)</li>
            <li> I think this product does a great job.  You do not need to spend big bucks for this type of product.</li>
            <li> The brush head is exfoliating, so I just use a little Cetaphil. My skin cleared up, and my makeup goes on much more smoothly. If different size brush heads were available, this would probably be a good treatment for chest and back acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I started to have breakouts after I started using the  brush and scrubbing cream.  It had been about 36 hours since I started using it twice a day, when I broke out for the first time in over a decade.  I only used it lightly and for 60 seconds at a time.  I also think the rotating action is not so great around the delicate skin areas.  I saw that it pulled on my under eye skin area as I was using it on my cheekbones.  I&#x27;m over 40, and starting to have wrinkles there, so this can&#x27;t be helping the situation!</li>
            <li> So... I ordered this product at the beginning of the year and it was expected to come about a week and a half ago... but it never did. I contacted Amazon and they said to wait it out, but no package came. I let them know yesterday at around 10am, and by 12pm they had shipped me a new one! I was so pleased because I recieved my Olay in 24 hours!  Amazon really cares about their customers.  Now about the product- I&#x27;ve tried it once with the cleanser it comes with (more of a cleanser with tiny gentle exfoliating beads) which made my skin feel so clean and smooth. I tried it with a harsher exfoliant and it had a similar result, but made my face a lot more red temporarily. I also tried it with a gentle cleanser with no exfoliant and that too gave a deep clean. I&#x27;m trying to decide what I will primarily use with the device, but I&#x27;m so excited to finally have something that feels really good. Even if this thing doesn&#x27;t clear up my acne, it feels so good... like a massage. I used it in the shower and I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s water proof :)  Yes the battery compartment is difficult to open, but it&#x27;s totally worth it anyway.  Fair warning- it did dry my face up quite a bit so be sure to have a good moisturizer near by.</li>
            <li> Good product with easy transportation.</li>
            <li> I will say that I wish the bristles were a little stronger but overall this is a great product. I just manuever around that and spend more time on each part of my face, but it gets my face really clean and I have seen a major improvement in my skin complexion.</li>
            <li> Love this. Cleans my skin great!</li>
            <li> I just received this and after the first use I noticed a difference right away, I love it.  I have only used it 3 times and other people have noticed it too.</li>
            <li> Must buy this.  When i bought it was not sure can i compare with the sonic. After using a month yes i can.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter to add to 500+ reviews, but I was really impressed! I saw a difference in one use, that is amazing for a product of about 30 bucks. My skin really looked more radiant in the morning and felt smoother right away. One thing that I was worried about was that it would be too rough on my skin, but nothing could be further from reality. The brush is very soft and the rotation of the spinning is just right, enough to give basically a massage with some exfoliation without overdoing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this. Will update with longer term results.</li>
            <li> I wish it could have been a little more abrasive to clean my skin and clean it a little bit better. And it would be great if it had a body brush as well, but if you use it for like 2min every other day your skin will look fine.​</li>
            <li> Has a fairly strong movement, but soft on the face and neck, just what I wanted and feels good.  Two speeds and I dip the brush under hot water as I am using it to continue foam.</li>
            <li> Great motorized brush, i have used for many months.  There is absolutely no need to pay for the Clarsonic.</li>
            <li> Let me be the first to say that as a Guy I wasn&#x27;t 100% how I was supposed to review or even what this was supposed to do. Now that being said Ill say what this has done. I was in the Marines for 4 years and after two deployments my face maybe due to the water and dirt that soaked my face left it always feeling rough and my face has never been the same. I used to sweat more often than normal when I returned and I think it was my bodies reaction to stay cool because of the heat that my body was always faced with. I have gone through so many face washed and nothing just had any effect on cleaning my face and bringing it back to my old self. With this product I think I am on my way BACK!!!! My face feels smoother and cooler, I know that my face has to be the extreme end of the spectrum and many people won&#x27;t have the rough and beat up skin as I had but this product does work, if you have never had any real cleaning done to your face this is a great product, I understand that I am not the best person for information but i can tell you only what this has done to me. Thanks and hopes this helps.</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Still using it a year later and I&#x27;ve never changed the batteries! Great mild exfoliation!</li>
            <li> Great cleansing system!</li>
            <li> Great addition to my life. It came as expected and was the quality I wanted .I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I recieved my product only to have a hard time opening it to put the batteries in and then to find some nasty clear fluid in the section where the batteries go and some hair as well. if this was sent to me as a joke trust me im not laughing very disgusting. im sending ryt back. im trying to upload pictures as well</li>
            <li> A friend didn&#x27;t like it so I said I would take it and try it out. I did and I love it. I use it with regenerist I dont care for the prox creams but I&#x27;m only 20.. So I don&#x27;t really need it for wrinkles I just like how it cleans so well. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The brush is soft, so it&#x27;s not like your scrubbing your face raw...but you will need to exfoliate every few days with something a bit rougher.  I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s extremely difficult (at least it was for me) to open the battery compartment.  The directions say to rock back and forth...not a lot of wiggle room -- nothing moved.  I finally used a butter knife to separate the compartment from the base.  After getting a start, i was able to open it.  Not a big deal -- I don&#x27;t anticipate changing the batteries that often.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this -- it makes your skin feel very soft.  I also have a Neutrogena Facial Cleanser that has velcro fastening pads (disposable).  Similar concept and useful for a deeper scrub as the pads are rougher and more exfoliating. Downside of that is, pads need to be replaced after each use - so you can go through a lot.  i&#x27;ll be using that one every so often, but the Olay product will be used twice daily!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife to remove makeup and my son to prevent acne. It works really well for what we expected. My wife loves the thoroughness of the makeup removal and both she and my son say their face feels much cleaner after using it. It is not the other brand that costs a $100, but it does what it was intended to do. Only time will tell if this will last, but it seems to be working great since December on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This product works great, I love it.</li>
            <li> This works just as good if not better than the calrisonic that&#x27;s is sold for a lot more money. Bought them for gifts and had to get myself one.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this brush for daily cleansing because of the soft, but powerful brush that provides a deep cleaning.  My son is a teenager and is on the Proactive cleansing system.  The brush has a high and low speed and the unit is so simple to operate.  Cleanup is a breeze...I simply soak the brush in vinegar and water solution for a squeaky clean disinfectant.  I am well pleased with this machine.</li>
            <li> ITS OKAY, I DID FIND IT A LITTLE ROUGH, BUT TO BE HONEST I DO NOT HAVE ANOTHER CLEANSING SYSTEM TO COMPARE IT TO, IM NOT SURE IF I USED IT LONG ENOUGH TO SEE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE, BUT I DO USE IT FROM TIME TO TIME</li>
            <li> so far, so good. wish it came with a protector for the bristles but it is a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s water proof, also considerate have everything in one package, including the cleaning machine, one brush head, 1 AA battery and a face cleaning foam.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing system.  I use it with various products and my skin feels amazing and it&#x27;s gets rid of flaky skin.  It&#x27;s an amazing value!</li>
            <li> Visible results about 2 weeks after daily use. I have always had acne and this has been one of the best ways for me to get rid of scars! I even bought one for my mom to use in her daily facial cleansing ritual.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use Olay products, rather I use Clinque. I pay enough for the 3 step daily products and refused to spend $150+ for a darn brush. This brush feels so amazing on my skin. I only use once or twice a week.  I don&#x27;t use it in the shower, that is just too much multi-tasking lol. But I enjoy using it, it comes with two speeds, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had read so many great reviews, but am too cheap to spend the money on the more expensive brand. I literally only used this item about 5 times, and my face broke out not only in zits, but in those hard red cysts. I went to see my dermatologist and he told me that if you are not prone to breakouts that this may not be for you. He told me it turns the follicle over very quickly which could be great for someone chronically broke out, but for someone who generally has clear skin it can cause break outs. I was so bummed out.</li>
            <li> Best product for skin careu</li>
            <li> I just got home and had the box with this on my bed, so I tried it. I just got off of school and am oily, sweaty, and greasy but this was amazing! I was so excited to dry it and now my skin feels great. I hate washing my face and I used this for 20 miutes because I love how it feels. I am going to keep it in my shower to use it. I love it!!! You should buy it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an OK device. I would not recommend using it everyday because it&#x27;s a bit rough for a skin especially if you have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Batteries included were dead.  Instructions are misleading because they state that there are two different brush heads to choose from when there is not.&lt;br /&gt;Overall skin feels softer and cleaner so I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I have not used the cleanser, but I have used the brush and it was worth every cent.  It cleans better than your fingertips and it is not abrasive.</li>
            <li> I really love this product! I have been doing research of which scrub brush to try. When I purchased this, it was only $18 but now I see it has jumped to about $45 so I don&#x27;t know that I would pay THAT much for it. But for the price I paid, it&#x27;s great. I was very worried about trying it out because I have extremely sensitive skin and it seemed like a fast spinning brush would hurt. To my surprise, it felt great! The bristles are very, very soft and flexible so it&#x27;s not like a stiff brush. I have been using the slower speed to start with, again because of my sensitive skin, and it leaves my face feeling really smooth! No irritation at all and I have used it four times now. So don&#x27;t be afraid to give this item a try if you have sensitive skin! Just use the slow setting to start!</li>
            <li> Brush is much rougher on my skin than I had expected, I stopped using it after a month when I noticed my skin was getting too irritated, just washing my face with a washcloth works well enough for me</li>
            <li> I got this product yesterday and used it lastnight and it felt great on the face, not rough. What I really liked about this cleanser is that you really feel it working after one use, I woke up with no oil on my face and I felt refreshed!. I love it and will be placing orders for more. :)</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with large pores, and as I get older my pores are getting bigger.  And even with my oily skin, I also had a couple dryish patches on my face.  This isn&#x27;t a miracle product, but it definitely improved the appearance of my skin a little bit.  In combination with the enclosed cleanser (which I also recommend), this little machine took care of the dry patches.  And while I can&#x27;t say I have small pores after using this product, I do think it helped smooth out my skin slightly and it slightly decreased how obvious my pores are.  I would recommend this product, although I would caution you to have realistic expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily in the shower and apply an oil-free moisturizer immediately after use.  Be extra careful to keep your hair out of the way.  I was careful and still managed to get my chin-length hair tangled one time.</li>
            <li> It is an affordable facial cleansing system that does the job. I feel my skin much smoother,cleaner. I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Actually it seems impossible to release the battery cover by hand. Finally I did it with pinchers. Don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s normal or an exception. Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> every penny. love this &amp; use it every few days in the shower, love that uts waterproof.. just wish it would fit other heads like the microderm one... anyone know if it does?</li>
            <li> if your looking for something to clean your face with this is not it you can find a better cleaning system for less on amazon this is high priced and its junk dont waste ur money</li>
            <li> I have been considering one of the Clarisonic \\&quot;face sanders\\&quot; as I like to call them. I had looked at the Olay Pro X at Ulta and figured that it would be cheaper at a regular store like Meijer. Nope. I ended up buying it at Ulta today so I could get the points. I used it with some baby shampoo (Cetaphil would do well also). My face is so soft. I can&#x27;t stop touching it. I&#x27;m afraid of the cleanser that came with it since my skin in so sensitive. I strongly recommend Cetaphil&lt;br /&gt;or baby shampoo for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for cleansing my face. It leaves my skin so soft. Before I used this my skin was so dry and now it is getting more moist and more softer.</li>
            <li> i use it every morning and this brush cleans ma face to perfection, leaving it smooth, oil free and fresh feeling</li>
            <li> a great value. I&#x27;ve had less breakouts, a brighter complexion, and better cleansing with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It does need the battery changed here and there; which is not easy -- the only design flaw of this hand cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to travel with, small size, portable. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I have a clarasonic and i dont use it after getting this.It works faster than the clarasonic and feels like its working better.Worth the money if you dont want to spend so much on the clarasonic.</li>
            <li> The product itself is awesome but some one has took the replaceable brush out, which is not pointed put in the production description.</li>
            <li> Bought this on impulse and I am disappointed. Pulls the skin when used, even with a light hand. The brush has a three month life, but who wants to use the same brush that long? Very difficult to install batteries. Inadequate directions, as almost every product in the Pro-X line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad decision on my part. Thumbs down, way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on the positive. I called Olay, returned the item, and received a refund! It took about 4 weeks from start to finish.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2S69L4WYONFK0]]I apologize for the lighting. My brief review on the Olay pro x cleansing system. My skin feels soooo clean and soft right now its ridiculous! And so much less oily...I mean I just got done washing it so obviously it isn&#x27;t oily but it just feels much lighter than usual. Go buy it!!!</li>
            <li> Having purchased the Clarsonic and then having given it to my daughter who was having skin issues a few months back, I knew I could not afford to buy a second one so I did without.  Then Olay came out with this product and with the price the way it was, I thought why not???  I have to say that I actually feel that the Olay does just as good a job if not a better job on my skin than the the Clarsonic did.  My skin seems so much more healthier since I started using it!!!  Great job Olay...thanks for an awesome yet affordable product!!!</li>
            <li> Really. And at that price. Exfoliating your skin without removing too much actual skin is where you want to be and this does it. And all that crud on the wings of your nose? Little white-heads? The flakes? Gone! History. This entire line is yielding amazing results for me and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how clean &amp; glowing my skin is now. Gentle, but VERY effective.  I&#x27;ve been using this cleaning system about 3 weeks now and zits and bumps that have been on my face for a year or more now are GONE! Love, love, love this battery operated little brush.  Deep cleans and exfoliates like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. And for only $29.99 YOU CANNOT GO WRONG.  Moisturizers and skin care products just melt right into your skin like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  This is the first review I have ever done for any skin care product, but that is how much I love this thing!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought this type of brush, so just have few thoughts about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: waterproof, two modes to choose, light weight, bargain price&lt;br /&gt;Con: difficult in opening battery lid, an okay cleaning result to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad, suggested to purchase the brush head replacement together, this old version only comes with one brush head.</li>
            <li> The low speed is strong enough to make my skin feel like it&#x27;s gotten a good cleaning.  The quicker speed is great for a more powerful exfoliation, however, with my skin anyways, it is a bit too intense for daily use.  It&#x27;s quiet, light-weight and water-resistant enough to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution to the scaling that happens on my cheeks during the winter months.  Wash clothes are too rough and cause even more damage and irritation.  Exfoliating cleaners seem to just dry my skin even more.  The Olay Pro X cleaning device offers a soft-bristle brush that rotates at two speeds offering gentle cleansing and exfoliation.  After a month, my face is softer and my skin is clear.  Though the system comes with a sample cleanser, I&#x27;m using my usual cleanser but you can even use a beauty bar, if you wish.  I&#x27;m using the device to clean my face, neck and upper chest.  I am extremely pleased with my purchase and the fact the Amazon price is significantly less than the shelf price at the local, national pharmacy chain store.  I have already recommended this product to several friends.  Given the chance to buy it again, I would.</li>
            <li> So although I was forewarned from previous reviews, I too found the battery compartment VERRRRY difficult to open. I called the # on the box and told them my problem and that I was going to return the product and post a negative review. The customer service rep was sympathetic. First of all although I appreciated the instructions in other reviews it wasn&#x27;t clear to me that the part that comes off is the little end piece that says \\&quot;OLAY Professional\\&quot; on it...........use a ruberized bottle opener to improve your grip and rock that small end piece back and forth (like taking a cork out of a wine bottle).........the end piece is very slippery and at first this didn&#x27;t work. I just kept trying and all of sudden it worked......I just tried it again and couldn&#x27;t do it at first!!!! however, what I learned is that if you twist in one direction it all of sudden pops (you are actually releasing a seal which is what keeps it waterproof) and then it comes off easily.  I told the customer rep that at the very least they should have a label on the box pointing to where the battery compartment is so that you know what you&#x27;re trying to get off!!! I&#x27;ll review the actual product later...........now that I can use it!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.  This product has really help to take all the flakey dead skin off of my face with out leaving the redness from a rough wash clothe.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday with my own facial cleaner.  The brush is really gentle, but clean my skin really well! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted one of these thingy that claims to clean your skin very well and finally got this one from walmart. It does make my face feel cleaner and get rid of all the dirt and oil and reduce my blackheads after a while, but at the same time it makes my skin feel kind of dry at the same time. I also am worried about using it too often may make your skin sag. Not sure if too much pulling and rubbing would do that. This is an ok product, as long as you use something hydrating after it to make up for the tight feeling</li>
            <li> This is great for deeper cleansing.  My daughter uses too!  Very refreshing on the skin. Cheaper than a salon!  I want to know where to buy more brush heads</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be an inexpensive alternative to the Clarisonic, as touted in the Olay commercials, but it&#x27;s not. I used it for a couple of weeks, and have noticed absolutely no change in the tone or texture of my skin. I don&#x27;t think it does any more exfoliating than a regular washcloth, or a face scrub (without the brush) really. Also wish it were rechargeable instead of running on batteries. Perhaps my expectations were too high for this product(especially at this price), but now I&#x27;ll be saving up to buy the real thing!</li>
            <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks and now I actually like to wash my face! I use this once a day and have seen great results. My pores look so much smaller and my makeup goes on a lot nicer.</li>
            <li> I would give this exfoliator five starts if it had a better way to get to the batteries.  I also had trouble with getting the battery compartment open.  There are no instructions with the product and it is hard to tell whether the batteries go under the gray controls compartment or whether they go in the bottom compartment.  I checked online and found that the batteries go in the bottom compartment.  My husband tried to get it open and ended up using a knife to pry it open.  The battery compartment could have been designed much better so that it can at least be pried open!</li>
            <li> I purchased this little gadget only 5 days ago, and I cant believe the difference in my skin already! Iv been using it every morning and evening with the sample cleanser it came with, and my face has not only cleared up (acne), but my skin tone is evening out, and my face actually glows!</li>
            <li> Directly after, the first time that I used the PROx (Olay Professional) my skin was baby soft as it was years ago.  I was very happy and amazed with the results.  I walked out of the bathroom, and my husband asked if I had used the PROx, because he had noticed how refreshed and soft my skin was looking.  My word...I was hopeful when buying this product, but I received more then I had ever hoped for...Thanks Olay, as always your products rock!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this last week and received it yesterday.  My first reaction after taking it out of the box was that it doesn&#x27;t seem cheap at all (compared to the way more expensive Clarisonic)--it seems really solid. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times since I got it, and bviously it&#x27;s too soon to see any major results, but I have noticed that my skin feels SO smooth after using it!  And, I swear that the blackheads on my nose are already looking better--which is amazing, because I have been trying to get rid of them for YEARS and have tried every product under the sun, but nothing has ever worked.</li>
            <li> I recently got this and use it everyday.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.  I had been looking at the Clarisonic and when I saw the tv commercials for this, I thought I&#x27;d try it first.  I am very happy with it and won&#x27;t be buying a Clarisonic.  My face feels clean and fresh and looks brighter.  It is fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like this brush a lot,but found that if used everyday it causes some flaking on my oily face.  I think it is a good alternative for those who find the other skin brush (you know which I am talking about) a little expensive for their budget.  I use it with olay&#x27;s Total Effects cleanser with blemish control, and I have to say, it works great, minimizes pores and helps your moisturizer really sink into your skin.  I only took off one star for the drying aspect.</li>
            <li> been using this brush for serval years now higly recommend this and the seller.</li>
            <li> In &#x27;! HUGE difference in my face after cleansing. I get a natural glow that I having searching for&#x27; Got it on sale and I&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
            <li> Its a very useful implement for getting deep into skin pores. My skin feels and looks much cleaner, softer, radiant. Thanks for such a useful product.</li>
            <li> I love this baby!  It is so much more affordable than other powered cleansing brushes and does a good job exfoliating, even around my piercings.  I don&#x27;t much care for the cleanser it came with, but I mix it with a cleanser I made with a basic soap with a couple drops of essential oils in it or with my dandruff shampoo, (the tingly one is my favorite,) and I&#x27;m good to go!  Because I like to use this everywhere I could use a little extra exfoliation, I wish there was another brush head with stiffer bristles for areas like elbows and knees.  Overall, I love this thing and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> As described, Came on time...would order again.</li>
            <li> I feel that it does a good job in giving a good cleaning--definitely better than just wiping your face.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the performance of this system. I use it an average of 5 nights a week, need to use very little of the cleanser. I think this is the best my face (skin) has looked in years. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> She liked it but not as good as Clarisonic</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know if it was a good idea, but it is a very affordable item and the shipping was very fast (considering the fact that it came from the US).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for just about a week and at 42 my face gets rough (especially during a Pittsburgh winter!).  This had almost immediate results.  I won&#x27;t be using the cleanser or exfoliation lotion with it after the sample is empty because i&#x27;ve found a simple apricot scrub works just as well.  But it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and I never seem to find the right cleanser.  This really cleans my face well and I have much fewer breakouts on my chin.  It makes my skin feel great.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> the brush very soft, and it feels good, good price,good quality, i like it, my husband rob to use it.</li>
            <li> Just received this and am very pleased, especially since reviews seem to be overwhelmingly positive. Will update after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> There are so many reviews on this so I&#x27;m just going to point out my personal thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;makes you wash your face thoroughly for those people (like me) who tend to rush it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I know people don&#x27;t want to hear it but you would get the same results if you used a manual brush...I recommend Sephora&#x27;s \\&quot;Face Complexion Brush\\&quot; for $5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great product, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I like the brush a lot it makes my skin feel nice and smooth.  I store it it the shower which makes it convenient to use.  2 things that it doesn&#x27;t have that the more expensive ones have...no rechargeable battery and the brush head just spins one direction. Still feel that it cleans better than cleanser alone or with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that was not too expensive to clean my face.  This purchase not only provided that but also a gentle electronic tool to deliver the cleanser. Definitely a weekly process as it exfoliates while cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great price and the product was exactly what it said it would be.  I would buy others at the price I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am sorry but this was a waste of my money. Hardly no spin at all. I did purchase the Clairisonic!!!! What a differance in the two. I&#x27;am sorry Olay but there is just no comparison</li>
            <li> great little personal device and not as expensive as other ones, love the job it does</li>
            <li> Great buy.  All my teenage children are using it to clean their skin, and reduce pimples.  Saw it on \\&quot;the Doctors\\&quot;. As a great alternative to microdermabrasion.  All happy with our really clean skin.</li>
            <li> My skin glows afterwards!</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I use it with and without the olay products.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it daily with non abrasive soap.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the shower. I find it very soothing. The best part it is less expensive then the high end one. Does the same thing.</li>
            <li> I was considering diving head first into the clarisonic craze since there are so many good reviews out there, but I thought I might as well try this first since it&#x27;s so amazingly priced.  Actually I&#x27;m still not sure about the vibrations hype of the more expensive brushes...the circular motion we have here is working beautifully for me.  This ended up costing something like $17 after the $5 coupon!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been suffering through lots of bad breakouts since I went off and then back on the pill, all in all like 3 years of incessant picking and popping.  I had cysts and blackheads, it was a nightmare.  Honestly I think stabilizing on the right pill had something to do with the clear up, but this brush has most definitely sped it up and has been making my skin feel so clean!!  I was scared that it might aggravate zits, but it didn&#x27;t at all.  The brush is really soft.&lt;br /&gt;I have exfoliated with either the st ives apricot scrub or the neutrogena blackhead daily scrub for years and I was wondering whether this would be comparable to those, but it is so much better.  I think maybe the smaller grit of the scrub that comes with this brush is better.  Also there&#x27;s a really really mild fragrance in it and I appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it every morning in the shower, just a quick two times over my whole face.  When I first started using the brush, for a couple days my skin felt a little dry and tight.  That went away fast and it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks now.  I do use vitamin e oil, sunscreen and another moisturizer after my shower but I used all of those before the brush came on the scene.&lt;br /&gt;I have some discoloration due to my extreme picking but I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s actually taking some of it away.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still interested in trying the clarisonic but this thing works so well I&#x27;m thinking why bother.  All I&#x27;m concerned with now is what&#x27;s gonna happen when I go camping next weekend for 4 days.  If my skin freaks out, I will definitely update this review because I thinkit&#x27;s an important factor!! And then perhaps I would consider not using it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended this product to friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this product for a while and other products like it at 5 times the price.  I finally bought it and I am could not be happier.  It works great and leaves your face really smooth.  I was surprised at how wonderful it felt while I was using it.</li>
            <li> This Pro X cleaning system is amazing!  My face has never been so clean and alive all at once.  I have no more pimples, which I had new ones everyday.  My pores were really big, I felt like I could put spare change in them.  My pores were so large that I began using a brush and foundation to fill them in.  I&#x27;ve had the Pro X for less than 1 month, I use it in the morning and before bed and my cheeks look 20, my forehead looks 32 and the rest of my face I think looks 35.  I&#x27;ll be 46 next month and a month ago, boy did I look it!!!  Knowing what I know now, it&#x27;s the one product I recommend to everyone.  If you have to only choose one thing to pamper yourself...this is it!!!  I&#x27;m thinking in 6 months, I&#x27;ll look 20 and my cheeks will be 15....LOL!  The results for me are so encouraging, that I joined a 24 hour gym so my body will match my face.  God is so good and I&#x27;m so grateful for this special gift, gift yourself....you are worth it!  By the way, buy all you need on Amazon, the store is way too high.  i was attracted for like 2 years to the Pro X, but it was always like $45-50 for a starter kit and I&#x27;m talking about at Target and Walmart.  I&#x27;ve saved so much and I don&#x27;t buy anything now without first shopping Amazon first.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed, but happily surprised so many times.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal, I think it&#x27;s the best  skin care item, I have ever purchased! And it&#x27; a high praise coming from a beauty products addict like me. After using it, you will wonder how you lived without it. It leaves skin so smooth and clean and the moisturizer gets absorbed by skin so much better after cleaning. It&#x27;s not too harsh for my Norman to dry skin. I use it once a day before bed, on my face and neck, twice a day would dry my skin too much. Why only 4 stars? Well, I think it deserves all 10 , considering how it improved my skin in a short period of time. I even bought 2 more for gifts. But I had to deduct one star, because I do not know how long will it last, it already doesn&#x27;t start when I push a button, I have to try a few times and hold the button down for a long time, or otherwise it just stops. I read a lot of reviews and it seems to be a common issue. I&#x27;m afraid it might stop working altogether, like a lot of reviewers complained... But I&#x27;m addicted now and will probably buy a new one, although might be too much, if you have to buy a new one every other month.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I&#x27;ve bought two more as gifts.  I don&#x27;t feel it is harsh like other reviewers.  There are two settings.  I don&#x27;t use the Olay products with it.  I use something else and it works great!  Buy it!</li>
            <li> I like this face scrubber, but I wonder what the really expensive one would be like.  It helps exfoliate and makes my skin feel cleaner.  No real frills but no real downfalls either. That is why I wonder how much better those 100.00 ones would be?</li>
            <li> I F&#x27;ing love it! I love everything about it. The price,the product, and the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> I Can use whichever cleanser I choose and it cleans my skin so well it shines, has fewer breakouts than it used to and my clogged pores are much smaller and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about rotating cleansing brushes, and definitely didn&#x27;t want to spend the exorbitant amounts of other brands.  But I ordered the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, and since I started using it two weeks ago, everyone is commenting on how much brighter my face looks.  I use it twice a day, and use my own cleansers and exfoliators as I would normally.  Great product, great price, and it can travel.  I have never written a review before, but feel so strongly about this product that I want to recommend it!</li>
            <li> Product shipped and arrived as advertised</li>
            <li> I love the system. I use the brush after I use my olive nut oil makeup remover. It seems to be a far more thorough cleansing routine then a makeup remover and cleanser alone. Plus I don&#x27;t ruin any washcloths with residue from my foundation</li>
            <li> When you buy something special, as described, very practical, strongly recommended. I hope the next time there is a larger discount.</li>
            <li> One of my best purchases ever. I love it and my skin looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> the package came in a plastic bag, no box and no cream attached - only the brush and 2 batteries.</li>
            <li> The cleaner looks fine in quality。But I think the same principle is just to polished surface of the skin，and it  can&#x27;t clean the pores。</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the more expensive Clarisonic product. So i can&#x27;t tell how this one fairs to Clarisonic. But overall for the price I paid, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen tremendous improvement in my skin tone since using the cleansing system. My face is&lt;br /&gt;smoother. I am recommending it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Glad I decided to buy this! My face feels so clean after I use it. I think my husband wants one now.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was having a hard time with random acne and I thought maybe my pores were getting clogged. So I grabbed this real quick, and when I got it I was thrilled! I started using it right away and my acne got tons better! I took it to my parents house soon after I got it and left the cleanser there so I grabbed an exfoliater from Clean and Clear that has worked really well with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power, but it gets the job done and is gentle for everyday cleaning.I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a deeper clean! I use it every day and have yet had to replace the batteries, so that&#x27;s awesome too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love to spend cleaning brush.  I would obviously love the very expensive one that it&#x27;s imitating but for a fraction of the cost I&#x27;ll take this! The batteries last forever and I like that it has two speeds.  Plus a little bit of product goes a long way so it&#x27;s not very expensive to use. My skin is definitely softer since I started using this once or twice a week and has a great glow. It also helped get rid a lot of my surface blackheads.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> Love the smoothness it brings!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. My skin has visibly improved and breakouts have definitely decreased. I use the Olay face wash now and then, but mostly use my own foam wash as I have sensitive skin and the device exfoliates my skin enough on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing. I was a little unsure at first, but when I used it for the first time it really scrubbed my face and felt good. At first your face seems a little dry but it&#x27;s not it is just really clean.</li>
            <li> I use my Pro-x system on a regular basis.  I have seen clearer skin and shrinkage of my pores.</li>
            <li> I dont feel like this has enough power.  It spins so slowly, even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> I been using this brush for a while now. I just love it, it leaves my skin clean with no make up and after use my skin looks radiant. The price is not bad i do change the brush once a month since it can develop bacteria.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the gen 1 proactive brush for the past couple of years, and I decided to try this since its only $20. I am presently surprised. This brush feels good and cleans great too. The brush head is a little small but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Worked okay. After a year of use, I ended up buying a Clarisonic - boy what a difference! I&#x27;m glad I switched. This just doesn&#x27;t do near what the Clarisonic does. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> My youngest child wanted this for Christmas due to the fact she has a lot of dry skin on her nose that was making her makeup flake. She started using it the same day and after the second use her skin was very soft, shiny, and smooth. She wanted to show me how it works and she did my face. I love it so much that I am going to purchase my own!</li>
            <li> Bought this to try for me before I gave to daughter for Christmas. Friends&lt;br /&gt;were buying $200 Clarisonics for their adult children. Based on conversations with several friends, young and old,  I went withe Olay Pro.  The Olay Pro works just fine to exfoliate and I like not having to clutter my conter with a charging station.  I use a couple times a week and can feel a difference.  Daughter likes hers as well.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. I use it every day, sometimes twice a day. I&#x27;m using this to slough off flakey skin from my Retin A regime and it works pretty good for that. I started using this a little over a month ago because I&#x27;ve been dealing with stubborn adult acne for a while (I&#x27;m 25, I have had pretty good skin my whole life, the last couple years it&#x27;s been getting progressively worse), so I got this and I also got Retin A and the combination of both has cleared my acne tremendously. When I first got this, the bristles seemed totally weak and like they wouldn&#x27;t do much to deep clean at all, I&#x27;m so used to scrubbing my face with abrasive stuff, but it really cleans and exfoliates deeply and effectively while being really gentle on your skin. Also, I use my own facial cleanser with this instead of the tube of cleanser it comes with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay for about 3 years and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new products.  I already use the cleanser so, after reading all of the great reviews on Amazon, I decided to give the Advanced Cleansing System a try.  It&#x27;s very easy to use but I do think it&#x27;s a bit abrasive.  It leaves my skin feeling a little irritated and in need of moisturizer.  Because of this reaction, I&#x27;m only using the cleansing system every few days.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working miracles but I have to believe my face is getting a more thorough cleansing.  For that and the price, I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about what a little motorized brush could even do for my skin- and I was pleasantly surprised! My skin tone is more even and my pores are much more clear--Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have always been an Olay fan, and this cleanser has worked great for me it takes off any makeup left behind by your regular cleanser. It does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this little machine!  I was in the market for a face brush and had settled on the Clarisonic Mia, when I found the Olay brush!  I immediately ran to target to purchase one and used it.  It feels so good on your skin, and yes I had an immediate glow afterwards.  I went to bed, woke up this morning and WOW.  My face looks 50% better than it did yesterday!  It feels like I had a chemical peel!  I will be purchasing the Olay Microderm/Peel today :-)    I wanted to give an *update* I have been using it for a week now and by skin looks awesome even the dark spots are fading.  I am so intrigued to try the Clarisonic though because so many of you swear it&#x27;s better.  I may one day cough up the $150 for one, but for now this works wonders :-)</li>
            <li> I originally visited Amazon to price a Clarisonic system, but while here, I was diverted to the Olay ProX.  So glad for that!  I noticed an immediate and remarkable improvement in the look and feel of my skin even after the first use.  What&#x27;s not to love about highly-effective and budget-friendly?  A new must-have for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS...Installing the batteries was a breeze thanks to the help of other reviewers.  The trick is in the wiggle!</li>
            <li> i purchased this brush as a stepping-stone to purchasing a Clarisonic in the future. I figured, Id see how the $30 \\&quot;version\\&quot; worked for my sensitive, acne-prone, multi-textured skin. I love it! Now, I cant compare it to a Clarisonic since I dont own one. But this Olay brush has made my skin much smoother and gets all the remaining makeup off my skin (after i use a makeup remover towelette). I use it almost daily with african black soap (which helps control my acne). Those two combined work well with my skin. The brush comes with batteries, which is a plus. No one enjoys buying batteries lol. It also comes with a sample of the Olay ProX exfoliating gel cleanser. The cleanser is ok. I actually thought it would be more gentle on my skin since the exfoliating beads are so tiny, but it felt harsh, so I choose not to use it. I would recommend this brush to anyone looking to even out their skin&#x27;s texture and make it smoother and softer and to get all traces of makeup off their face. It definetly does that for me. Olay claims the brush will maximize the effects of your moisturizer, I cannot speak to whether it has or not. But my skin is softer. I believe $30 is a good price for it. A similar brush on the market is the Pretika Dermabrasion Brush which is $40 on drugstore.com. I was going to try that one if the Olay failed me. I think I will stick with my Olay. I recommend purchasing it from a drugstore because they have generous return policies in case you dont like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to test it out to see how it works before shelling out $150 to get the clarasonic version, and I L-O-V-E it!! Seriously one of the best facial cleansing system I have ever purchased, and I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to buy the clarasonic one now (unless one day I find myself with $150 I can burn). Has two settings, low and high. Takes of any makeup/dirt/oil, exfoliates super well, and leaves my face feeling super clean. After using every night for two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks smoother all around, and definitely have noticed less breakouts and a clearer complexion. Love it so much! Def. A great alternative to the clarasonic cleanser system A+++!</li>
            <li> My opinion is still somewhat out on this one. It is cheaply made for the price,and I feel it is overpriced by about $10. The brush head is very soft, not what I was expecting. It does work to scrub your face, but not enough to make a huge difference. The sample scrub that comes with the unit is just enough for 2 uses, and the battery compartment is a real challenge to open. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good, but not for delicate skin. I can&#x27;t use this in all the part of my face :( :( :(</li>
            <li> The brush is perfect for daily exfoliating while cleaning.My result, is a smoother complexion, if it is used with a great facial cleanser. The cleanser that is included caused breakouts on my cheeks after only one use.</li>
            <li> Its a good purchase. Its small so it doesnt take up space, yet it does its job nicely. I like the two-speed setting. There&#x27;s enough difference that for the fast setting I have to move the product around faster so that I dont peel my skin off. Believe you me, it does scrub your skin. I like to use it with my favorite facial cleaner. Some may say their skin feels radiant, but I think its because your top-layer of skin was just scrapped off so beware not to overdo it. The product is waterproof, so it can be used over the sink or in the shower or even in the bathtub for something more intimate (~_^). Battery seems to last awhile, but if you are worried that the compartment is hard to take off, just put on some dishwasher gloves or latex gloves on and it opens easily.</li>
            <li> This is a smart little product.  My skin is not sensitive, but is aging  and oily. The exfoliating cleanser included in the package works very well and I plan to buy it again, but I think that any exfoliating cleaning product would work okay. This is such a great product, and the price is right. My skin&#x27;s appearance has  improved since I started using this little device two months ago. In fact, I could see improvement within the first week. Although, I was exfoliating my skin with cleansers every day, the Olay brush does a much better job. The little problem bumps and things are gone and discolorations are reduced.</li>
            <li> This brush helps to exfoliate the upper dead layer of your skin leaving your skin fresh and clean. It&#x27;s not too strong as to damage the skin.</li>
            <li> iT DOES ROTATE , BUT I WOULD RATHER SHARE THE CLARSONIC WITH MY DAUGHTER, WE HAVE SEPARATE HEADS AND SHARED - I GOT THIS OLAY VERSION TO AVOID HAVING TO GO GET IT, SWAP OUT THE HEAD, ETC. BUT I WILL STILL USE THE CLARSONIC AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK, THE VIBRATION JUST SEEMS TO DO MORE.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this every day and we both love it. It cleans so well. We do not use the cleanser so it can be used with any kind. Got one for my mom and sister and they love theirs also. Batteries last a several months before needing to be replaced to. Great product!</li>
            <li> love it keeps my face nice and clean u can feel it scrubbing down deep and u cane tell the before and after on how  well ur porse get clean good product</li>
            <li> The tool works perfectly and friends noticed my skin improvement. I am very glad I got it, and I recommend it to anyone who asks.</li>
            <li> Just like most I was looking for something more affordable than a few hundred dollars. After some researching, I decided to give Pro X a try.   I&#x27;m a 47 year old women with Asian olive skin tone. I suffer with moderate chin acne, large pores and oily T zone area. I also struggle with some dermatitis and flaking across my nose and cheeks that started after entering perimenopause. I have only used this for two days, morning and nighttime. So far I am very happy. Gets my face crazy clean. I can already see my skin appears much smoother and pores also are less noticeable . I do use my own face cleanser because of the dermatitis instead of the cleanser it came with in the box. Also my face \\&quot;holds\\&quot; my mineral make up much better. With less oil and a more smoother canvas it looks great. I would suggest that even someone with an oily face make sure to apply some moisturizer after use. Though the brush seems very soft, it gets the job done. Over all I am pleased and would recommend it.  UPDATE: Well I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now. Still amazed but how clean and soft it gets my face. Also has done a great job of smoothing out the texture and has evened out my skin tone. Has lessened the appearance of some old red spots from some old acne spots on my chin. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day, morning and night. I did get some cystic acne spots on my chin after using it for a week but kept using it. Glad I did, I&#x27;m clearing up now. I&#x27;m using an old favorite soap and lotion of mine: Purpose. My huge pores appear much smaller now and the oil is much less.My dermatitis and flaking is GONE without any using anything on it. I&#x27;ve become quite addicted to this face cleanser. My face simply does not feel clean enough without it now :)  December 12, 2011 Update  Wonderful. I can&#x27;t do without it. I did skip a few days and could tell a huge difference. It&#x27;s like getting a daily facial. Biggest plus: No more dermatitis! The irritated itchy skin is gone. Pores are appearing smaller and much smoother. Acne is much better too.  Turned my best friend on to it as well. She loves it too :) Happy purchase.</li>
            <li> My skin is combination and not known to be sensitive at all. I watch what I use on my face and thought that this olay product would be okay, I never tried Clarasonic but I wont be now. The brush seemed soft at the beginning but I think it was to harsh, after two weeks of using it my face broke out! and my face is generally clear :(</li>
            <li> One for me and one for my mom. This thingy really does a god job at cleaning out pores. Have noticed a difference ...my skn is clean and clear. Dont listen to people with problems with opening battry compartment. Its no big thng! Worth it and would recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought the Clarisonic as well and I must say I like this much better because the brush spins much more circular motion than the Clarisonic. I absolutely recommend this over spending the money on the Clarisonic.  Besides the fact that it will be great for travelling!</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year and I did like it. However, water leaked into the battery compartment, causing the batteries to leak. When I opened the battery compartment, the batteries were leaking. I tried to clean out the compartment to no avail and ended up having to throw out the product.</li>
            <li> Works well for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for something to clear my skin up for over 15 years this brush is amazing and did just that. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a careful mix between the brush and the soap that comes with it, but this product truly changed my complexion I love it. I recommend this for anyone who has difficult break outs and sensitive skin. I would break out very easily, but now I can wake up without seeing a patch of new blemishes all over my face.</li>
            <li> my skin in winter gets some small dark dots and this cleaning system helped me to get rid of them thank u so much</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced and makes my skin feel great.  Only problem was with finding refill cream.  I finally just started using my own cream with crushed apricot seeds in it.  Same result.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time as promised and well packed.  The cleansing system really works effectively.  Best for a good price and Olay&#x27;s excellent quality.  Highly recommend both, product and supplier.</li>
            <li> Love that I can use in the shower.  Works great.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, after I use this I use a toner and my face is so clean! My skin looks better,feels better, and my pores have shrank! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from acne/oily skin. Even anyone who has normal skin! This is definitely a steal at 21 bucks!</li>
            <li> Great face brush! It comes with batteries and an extra head so that&#x27;s an automatic plus! Really helps to clean my pores and get rid of any existing acne! The only complaint is that it is a bit on the slow side, even with the two different speeds, compared to other brushes. But it still works just as well as any of the expensive ones. Make sure you clean/rinse the brush head throughly after each use. And to guarantee a longer life-span I&#x27;d suggest not using it in the shower even though it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> It is not as great as they advertised it. The skin gets clean but I didnt feel a great chance. Also the cream separately is kind of expensive</li>
            <li> Excellent product - reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product I thought it was great. However, it just stopped working after about 2 months of use. I tried changing the batteries but no luck, it has just decided to die on me. I&#x27;d rather spend more money and buy a high quality product such as the Clarisonic that has warranty and will last than waste money on something that will only work for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> These are okay but they don&#x27;t clean any better than if you use a Wonder Puff and cleanse your face in circular motions for a few a minutes with a good cleanser.</li>
            <li> amazing ... I love it</li>
            <li> This is a medium to slow, rotating brush.</li>
            <li> Love my pro-x, my skin is much smoother,face feels so clean. Had some problems with dry skin, much better now. Thank you so much. Linda mikel.</li>
            <li> I tried it last night but I used my Neutrogena Face Cleanser with it and I truly like it.  The brushes are not too harsh, however, if you want to use it as a exfoliating use the sample of Olay that comes with it.  I highly recommend this and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> This Olay Pro-X system is absoulutley wonderful!!!  It is compact, and works on batteries, that last along time.  It deeply cleans your face, removing the grime fro the day, and deeply cleaning your pores.  It is gentle yet strong.  I love it!!!  Highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful little soft brush that really cleanses your face.  I use it twice  a week as they say and I see a difference  already.  My face is clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works great</li>
            <li> Not very impressive but does sort of work</li>
            <li> This product is good for a while but the motor will slowly die in 2 years or less</li>
            <li> I use AM (slow setting) in the morning since my skin is not that dirty and PM for deep cleaning (fast setting). My face feels clean and some dead skin is lifted and washed away at the same time.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, and high-end cleansing instrument compared to no different. Use every day, cleansing works well.Also very easy to use  ...</li>
            <li> I order this item from Italy about 2 weeks ago and today i recived it; I had no problem with the dogana (sorry but i don&#x27;t know the English word) and 2 week for a item shipped from U.S.A. it isn&#x27;t too much. In this week I&#x27;ll test it and I hope to do a positive review.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that didn&#x27;t make me so happy is that I paid the same ampunt for the item and the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;For the rest I&#x27;m very happy!&lt;br /&gt;(sorry for my English but I&#x27;m only a Italian girl :-) )</li>
            <li> I wanted to splurge and buy the Clarisonic, but I decided to give this one a try because of the price and the good reviews. It does not disappoint. It&#x27;s super gentle for the skin, it really exfoliates nicely without irritating. I love it and would recommend it to anyone. I use it with my Purity facewash and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Proper exfoliating is super important in preventing breakouts, says my knowledgeable and experienced esthetician. Of course, it all makes sense now. That dead skin is the stuff preventing the oil from getting through. The missing link!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting the outer shell of dead skin professionally removed from my face, this product (or the more expensive Clairsonic) was recommended to me. I will not be getting the Clairsonic because I am so happy with the results from this (and my skin was ultra-funky). It&#x27;s at least a good first step and if you don&#x27;t like it, give it to your little sister and your only out 20 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product comes with one soft-bristle brush, strong enough to remove that built up skin, soft enough to leave you with skin-intact and minimal redness unless you are the aggressive type. If your skin is super-sensitive, this might overdo it, so go easy and maybe use a different exfoliating product or just a gentle cleanser. Good thing there&#x27;s two speeds! Not heavy, fits in hand well without slipping out, waterproof/submersible, comes with two real (Duracell) batteries too, been using it almost every day for a month and no signs of power degeneration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also great for the legs, right before shaving and underarms to prevent in-growns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also brings healthy circulation to your skin, hastening the healing response....not something you can easily do when washing with your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal results....One month later after using almost 1-2 times a day (gently) with my own cleanser and taking a day off if getting too much drying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin, surface now smooth and one layer opposed to many layers of various flakiness. Reduction of blackheads on nose. Pores almost empty. Immediate positive results after two days (smoother skin), but took 2-3 weeks for the residual acne to clear up. Feels like my face can breathe! Week 4, huge reduction of breakouts, I&#x27;d say 75% more clear. Super happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you are using professional skin products, not that cheap stuff at the box stores. The ingredients and preservatives in the cheap products can irritate skin more or get trapped in your pores. You may have to invest a couple hundred but you will make it back in return  when your self-confidence is through the roof and the fancy-dinner dates start rolling in. Buy a good cleanser, toner, a mask to control the oil in the warm seasons, this beautiful product, and a good moisturizer for afterwards because the brushing does cause drying. I hear good things about the Eminence line, also acnewhisperer.com is a great place for info and samples. If your skin is breaking out more after using this, you may be using the wrong cleanser or using this product too much. If you over strip your skin of its oil, it will produce more oil...not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy skin brushing!you are using professional skin products, not that cheap stuff at the box stores.

            <li> When I first starting looking into cleansing systems, I was going to go with the Clarisonic Mia but, after reading reviews (and price tags) I decided to give the Olay one a try first.  Now on my fourth week of daily use, I am not disappointed! Using this product really has changed my skin making breakouts less often, less severe and giving my skin an overall glow.  Since I have not tried the Clarisonic, I cannot attest to which is better, but I do know that the Olay brush has done a great job and that I am super happy with what it does for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small note:  Like some have said, the first week or so using this brush is rough, especially if you are acne prone.  I had several breakouts around my chin and lips and between my eyebrows.  These, however, have since cleared up and I am now experiencing less spots than ever before.  Maybe the &amp;#34;purge&amp;#34; rumors really are true!</li>
            <li> I was hoping it can remove my whiteheads around nose area and under mouth, but in fact it doesn&#x27;t. It even gone worse. The product mentioned that the brush is tiny enough to clean pores, I don&#x27;t agree (I have big pores). Was kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that the Olay brush was really doing a lot, until I put it away for several weeks.  I started noticing  blotchy skin larger pores, so I added my Origins (Dr. Weil) skin correcting serum back to my rotation, hmmm, not really helping.  I saw an ad for a really pretty Clarisonic Mia2 and thought well maybe I need a pretty one.  The Nordstrom&#x27;s Anniversary sale wouldn&#x27;t start for a couple of weeks, so I thought I would pull out my Olay.  Well, it has begun working it&#x27;s magic.  The pores are noticeably reduced and the blotchy is going  away.  One change I made, was to use the brush for at least 1 minute.  The MIA has a timer.  I realized that I wasn&#x27;t using it for very long.  So, I know use it for 15 seconds on each cheek, 30 seconds for neck, and approx 10 seconds foe forehead, chin each. My skin feels VERY smooth and is well on its way.  I will skip the MIA and spend the $100+ on clothing.</li>
            <li> super soft brush, clearer skin~ smaller pores, less black heads. ive been using other cleansing products, and they hurt my skin, but this works great~ would recommend this for people with thin and sensitive skin :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine. Nothing special. Came with an extremely small amount of cleanser and only one brush. Hasn&#x27;t improved my acne one bit.</li>
            <li> Save your money- get a clairsonic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to facial buffers and brushes. There was not a single difference I&#x27;ve noticed. My pores were not different and my skin did not look or feel cleaner afterward. When I use a $2 facial buff people comment on how my skin glows. I also see a noticeable difference after exfoliating with sugar/salt and/or baking soda. This cleansing cream and brush are not worth the money. I&#x27;m glad it was only $20. I&#x27;ll give it an extra star because it really does feel good on your face.</li>
            <li> I recently started to break out because I switch makeup that would not fully wash away. I decided to buy this product because I saw the cost and figure it wouldnt hurt to take a chance. Im so glad I did because this worked wonders on cleaning. I use it in the shower and it has not broken yet regardless or the amount of water running. I use this along with some st Ives scrub and it completely removes all makeup all dead skin cells. My face feels better looks better and I have not have a problem with this brush. I recommend it for those that want to feel what a completely makeup free face feels like.</li>
            <li> The PRO X is a superb tool for exfoliating my face, day and night. After using for several weeks my face looks radiant. The moisturizer and cream are absorbed more quickly. I love this tool and have recommanded to my friends, thanx Olay!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love. Not a firm brush but it works good! !!!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve bought this twice. It&#x27;s good for in home facials. This is a great product. You can use it with any face washes. Great!!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  My face feels cleaner, and visibly looks cleaner also.  Pores are smaller, and cleaner.  Product was red instead of white like it shows in the picture on the box, but that doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me.</li>
            <li> I am a forty-something with relatively new issues with acne, which was resistant to run-of-the-mill cleansers.  I could see the clogged pores and scrubbing was just not doing the trick. I figured I needed a spin brush to really get in there but was not enthused about spending a ton of money for one.  I was sceptical because this brush was so relatively inexpensive but have been very pleasantly surprised!  Using the brush and included exfoliator I noticed improvement after one use, and daily thereafter, until my skin was completely clear after one week.  Have continued to use for daily cleansing and maintenance.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Clarisonic Mia for a few years and only wish I had tried this first and saved a LOT of money! This works just as well and the batteries are replaceable which is a dirty little secret about the Mia they don&#x27;t tell you. So after spending all that money, in a few years, you need to replace the entire thing. Thank goodness I read some great reviews on the Olay and gave it a try. Hope this review saves you some if you are debating between the two.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews it has and was a bit disappointed. The box says that the Olay Pro-X cleaning system is supposed to come with an extra cleaning brush and it doesn&#x27;t. Things I did not like: the missing extra cleaning brush, the brush that does come with it hardens after a couple of uses. Things I did like: its compact, it can be used in the shower and the price.</li>
            <li> What I like about the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System is that it is the perfect tool for skin cleansing. Before I started using the System, I had a lot of clogged pores which always bugged me because they were so visible; now I have 95% clearer skin, which also looks flawless when I put any sort of coverage on such as foundation. What I did not like what that there was not any specific instructions, especially of what you should and should not do since the skin on your face is very sensitive. Obviously you would just have to use common sense. Otherwise, I would highly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay cleansing system in Jan 2013- I had been trying to decide between buying the more expensive Clarsonic and ended up purchasing this instead since it got great reviews and was significantly cheaper. Throughout the past year I have LOVED this brush. It has done a great job keeping my face clean and I feel like my skin was healthier. In November I went on a two week trip to Europe and for the sake of saving space in my luggage I decided I could do without it for 2 weeks so I could pack more souvenirs in, but looking back I should have taken it. I got a few pimples during the two week period and felt like my face wasn&#x27;t as clean during the trip. I have to say I&#x27;m hooked on how my face feels after using this.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to today- the brush died a few days ago and I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to re-start. I thought maybe the batteries had died, but new batteries didn&#x27;t do the trick. I&#x27;m a bit surprised that the brush suddenly stopped working, I only had to change the batteries maybe 3 times in the past year with daily use of the brush so I didn&#x27;t think the water-tight seal would fail after so few openings. I went ahead and ordered another one today, I&#x27;m hoping that this one will last more than a year. If not, I might splurge on the clarisonic next time.</li>
            <li> I have never had severe acne. I don&#x27;t have scars but I have blackheads and have mild acne in concentrated areas. So investing in Clarasonic ($180) didn&#x27;t make sense. So for $25 I couldn&#x27;t say no. I absolutely love it. The brush is very gentle and I saw my blackheads disappear in 2 days! I use it with yes to tomatoes daily pore scrub. I have mild acne, but still best results than just scrubbing using my hands.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has been wanting a cleansing system like this but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on it, so if your sentiments are like hers, then this product is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are soft and is really gentle on the skin. The cleansing wash that was included feels very refreshing on your skin! She&#x27;s used it in the shower and hasn&#x27;t had any problems with water getting into the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars is the two modes it has.  There&#x27;s very little difference between the high and low modes that she just uses it on high all the time. Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Cleans thoroughly without being to abrasive to my skin. Recommended 100% My face is soft and clean after using it!</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with this pro X cleansing system.   It works well and I am pleased with the circulation and results using this item.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I debated between buying the Olay brush or the expensive clarisonic brush, and I&#x27;m glad I bought the $20 version! It works so well. My skin feels clean. The brush head lasted longer than the 3 months recommended.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best beauty product I have ever purchased. I am over 50 years and now and having blemishes and other skin issues. I immediately noticed a difference in my skin after the first use. I have had the Pro-X a month now and have not had a single blemish since I started using it...I was having 3 to 5 at any time. My skin feels soft and smooth. I wish they made a larger one for the entire body. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Perfect starter cleansing brush.  I&#x27;ve always wanted a cleansing brush but did not want to spend $100+.  The Olay Cleaning Brush works great - i use it every day.  I also convinced my roommate to get one too</li>
            <li> K so I have had skin issues on and off since high school but lately have been suffering from persistent cystic acne breakouts that would not go away.... I tried everything u can think of proactiv, oil cleansing method, dermalogica (which worked the best of them all) along with countless store brand face washes but when I read the reviews on these microdermabrasion face brushes I started looking at the various brands..the clarisonic which was wayyy too rich for my blood had me intrigued, the next best thing was the pro x and it worked perfectly at 1/10th the price:-0. I to date have not had one breakout since I have been using it ( 4 months n going strong), my old acne scars are quickly going away and it really does get out all the grime &amp; make up that normal face washing leaves behind.  The only issue I had was getting the back off to put the batteries in... its very tight to avoid moisture seeping inside but apart from that I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet and it works like a dream. The only improvement I would suggest is making the head a bit more secure as it is easy to come off since it is replaceable  but sometimes it slips off if you arent holding it correctly and put your fingers under the head. Needless to say this brush is gonna be gifted to a ton of my friends and family this xmas!!! Uber happy with this product. :-D happy dance</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally know much about this but what I can tell you is that my wife absolutely loves this face cleaning gizmo and the cleanser that goes with it. What a teriffic hit of a gift!</li>
            <li> I got this a week ago and have been using it everyday, and it seems like a really good concept, but I&#x27;m still on the fence about it. The spinning bristles are a little slower than I thought they would be, not sure if it&#x27;s because I got a bad/defected one or that&#x27;s just how it is. I&#x27;ve read other people&#x27;s reviews saying the same thing, so not sure...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was either going to get this or the Clarisonic, and chose the cheaper option, but I&#x27;ll make my final decision in a week on which one to get (and give this to my sister or something if I get the Clarisonic).</li>
            <li> As described, fast shipping, high quality.</li>
            <li> The little manual brush does a better job.  For the price it really  doesn&#x27;t seem  worth it.  There are nice manual brushes on amazon.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  The brush is worth the cost.  You can use ANY face wash with this product and it does a super job.  I like this a lot -- my face feels very soft and clean after I use.</li>
            <li> Works well and the price was significantly less than in the stores. I found it to be a great value. Got one for me and one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> It is a very effective product and easy to use.  I bought the extra two bushes; but I believe that the original bush will hold up for a good while.  I use the low speed now &amp; find it does a great job cleaning my face.  I have large pores &amp; along with using pore minimizing products my face is feeling firmer &amp; the results are already noticable to me.  I find it only takes an extra minute of my time to get cleaner fresh results when washing my face &amp; using this product.</li>
            <li> I love my cleansing system. It works beautifully for me.  Price was good compared to the other systems that cost hundreds. This did not hurt my pocket book to try it. My face looks great after using the Olay cleanser along with the Olay cleansing machine.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]] I struck gold by purchasing this product. My wife uses it every day and is very happy with the results this product gives , her skin glows and is soft to the touch . I look forward to trying more products by Olay . Shipping was fast and the packaging protects the item purchased .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the gel that came with it but the brush works great; especially on Acne Prone skin. Lovee. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Great system, easy to use, and does the trick to keep skin clean and clear at affordable price. Feels good in hands too!</li>
            <li> Tube of exfoliating wash is very tiny.  I would have expected a bit more or extra brush head at least for price.  Work s just as well as any other I have had in past.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference. I got this product with a good deal, so I would say it is not bad. But I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love this tool.  Face seems softer and pores are getting smaller.  Really takes off makeup better than regular washing.  I gave it a 4 because I wish there was a softer brush available or a body brush.  I have no problem with the brush head that came with it, but the more expensive facial cleaners have a different variety of brushes to use.</li>
            <li> Great product, reasonably priced.  Has two speeds which is great and really cleans your skin.  I have sensitive skin and use this a couple times a week with no problem.  I also use this with my regular cleanser and after I am done it feels like I just had a facial, very pleased!</li>
            <li> My face loves this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and your face will thank you too. It is a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I usually use the apricot scrubs to get my face clean but I apparently didn&#x27;t realize my face could be cleaner! The bristles are soft but still firm to scrub your face and my face is really smooth after it. My skin is combination, leaning towards sensitive, and it doesn&#x27;t like being scrubbed with this twice a day but I&#x27;m still happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Works very well in getting make up off and cleaning face.  Leaves my face soft and smooth.  Very good item.</li>
            <li> I was debating for a while whether to get this or the Clarisonic. I chose this, and I&#x27;m glad I did! The brush is so soft, so it doesn&#x27;t feel scratchy on your face at all, but it still feels like it&#x27;s exfoliating. Plus it has 2 power settings, which is nice if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE this cleansing brush! My skin tingles after I use it, and it is SO gentle, but it does it&#x27;s job! Get one, and they&#x27;ll send you some the gentle abrasive cleanser to use with it. You will enjoy it!</li>
            <li> do not use it as much as i should but for the money stimulates your skin,  good</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It really helps your face to feel revitalized.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the low price and good reviews.  I have used Philosophy&#x27;s microderm abrasion products for years, so I know when my face gets a good exfolliation.  This product just didn&#x27;t produce any more impressive results than me just using my hands to scrub my face.  A good comparison of the difference between the Olay and a pricier Clarisonic is, the Clarison is like a Sonicare toothbrush, whereas the Olay is like a Colgate spin brush.  You can clearly tell a difference in results.</li>
            <li> My Clarisonic Mia broke (so mad because it was not that old) so while searching for a replacement I found this, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Definitely comparable to the Clarisonic and so much cheaper! Works great, smaller size, and two speeds. The only down side I can see is that it runs on batteries versus having a charger.</li>
            <li> Well, I am not sure what it is suppose to do, so I can&#x27;t give it anything but good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Brand new batteries. Switched them and it still does not turn on.&lt;br /&gt;Majorly disappointed</li>
            <li> It is ok.  Right size for travel but feel it may not last long.  More than ten years ago I purchased one that Susan Lucci (All My Children) was promoting on TV.  It came with several attachments which over the years could be replaced for a reasonable cost.  It finally gave out a few months ago. Of course, ten years ago it was less expensive.  With this purchase I did not pay as much attention as I should have when reviewing different makes.  I ordered this one because of the Olay brand name and lower price.  Did not notice that it has only the facial brush and for a few dollars more, the other brands come with a variety of attachments.  I really do miss the large pad for exfoliating the body and the scalp attachment.  I do not remember the brand name of the old one and so do not know if it is still made.  As for the Olay cleansing system, it works fine and as mentioned, a good size for travel.  It just does not meet my needs but is fine for now.</li>
            <li> BRUSH IS WIMPY AND COMES OFF WHILE USING</li>
            <li> Dermatologist told me not to use this because it&#x27;s a rotating brush and all it does is brak the blood vessels in your face.</li>
            <li> I love my spin brush.  It makes my skin feel so clean.  Works great!!</li>
            <li> Great quality and cleans very well!</li>
            <li> so happy I bought this. really does a great job of deep cleaning the face. would totally recommend. it was great that it came with batteries included as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using a little over a week and I love this cleansing system.  Makes your face seem so much cleaner than just washing.</li>
            <li> Delivery was timely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse my face thoroughly and very handy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely recommend it as it is cheaper than retail price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the brush, i tried the cleanser too and it made my skin break out which it never does.  I use Arbonne RE9 regime every day but i wanted something to exfloiate without being too harsh. I love the brush and it works great in the shower! Really leaves your skin very refreshed!</li>
            <li> After first use..makes a difference of your skin..polished &amp; fresh look..my co workers remarked I look rested &amp; refreshed..I am over 55..so makes a big difference..love the fact has 2 different speeds &amp; so economical..received item quickly &amp; had it 4 months now &amp; still working strong....buy it..you wont regret it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a while and finally used it last night. It really works and removed all my makeup gently. It arrived quickly and I wish I had started using it sooner.</li>
            <li> Works well. Have had for years and it&#x27;s still going strong. I don&#x27;t find it to be too abrasive, but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Purchased a gift and the recipient likes the system so giving at least 4 stars since results are not known in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> The cleaning head is very fragile and does not stay on well.</li>
            <li> I bought this package for the motorized scrubber.  At the time I was experiencing some serious sinus problems, and found the motion offered by this system helped to relieve some of the pain and pressure.  Since that time I&#x27;ve used it for it&#x27;s intended purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find myself a fan on the Olay cleansing product.  I use it with other brands of scrubbing skin cleansers, and find that it works great.  I store the unit in the shower so that it&#x27;s always ready to use, and the constant exposure to moisture hasn&#x27;t affected it in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price and the durability of the product for my use, I give it four stars.  I&#x27;ve removed one star because of the Olay cleanser, which I didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> This is a now a part of my skincare routine. I have been using this daily at night and it makes my face feel so clean and fresh. My skin is much smoother and softer. Also, I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues since beginning use. I have been using it with the Olay Professional Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser (which is great) but as soon as that&#x27;s gone I will give the Olay Pore Scrub a try. Very happy with my purchase. Great value for what I paid :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now, I took a break from it for a week and noticed that my skin was different.  I went back to using it 3 days a week and what a difference.  That extra bit of dead skin that I could always feel on my face even after I have cleaned it is gone.  It feels great and I am amazed that my pores are noticeably shrinking which I never thought was possible.  I have combination skin and this thing has been great for me.</li>
            <li> Be careful, I kept this in the shower because I assumed it was waterproof, which I think it actually is .. but ended up breaking down 2 months later &amp; the battery was leaking on the inside.</li>
            <li> Although the brush was super soft, it still irritated my skin and made my face worse. I started getting rashes all over my face due to the irritations it was causing. Immediately returned this product.</li>
            <li> Let me start out saying that I&#x27;m 57 years old. I got lucky and started using Olay in my 20&#x27;s. I have also always exfoliated. I have very few wrinkle at all and it&#x27;s due to products like this along with my Olay moisturizing routine. I can wash the makeup off at night but then I grab this facial brush and I&#x27;m still shocked at how much is still left on my face and neck. I only use the cleanser that comes with it once a week due to it having an exfoliating grit to it. I highly recommend this system for a smooth and softer face.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft bristles unlike other similar systems.</li>
            <li> It broke in 2 months.</li>
            <li> We have both the clairsonic and the olay. Both are equally good in quality. The Olay is smaller and more compact, which makes it easier for travel. It also runs on batteries so there is no cord or plug in issues.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this little contraption. For a fraction of the price of the Clarisonic (which I&#x27;ve never tried), it seems to exfoliate well. I use it almost every day. Most days I use it with Cetaphil for sensitive skin, and some days I use it with my exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wary of the exfoliant that came with this cleansing system because it did not list the ingredients. It has been relegated for the husband&#x27;s use, along with hordes of other rejected beauty products that I&#x27;ve purchased over the years.</li>
            <li> It works great, I just wish the bristles were a little stronger. They&#x27;re very soft, so I&#x27;m not sure how much exfoliating is actually happening.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I don&#x27;t believe it competes with the higher brand ones. It&#x27;s good to just clean the surface but not a deep cleanse. Motor is too weak.</li>
            <li> I used this ONCE and my skin looked fabulous. It&#x27;s a great exfoliator and at a great price. Try it!</li>
            <li> I used a Clarisonic before this and decided to buy this product to use when I shower in the gym. Some other reviewers have said this works just as well as the Clarisonic but it does not. This definitely does the job but in no way leaves the smooth and silky feeling like the Clarisonic does. But what I suggest using this as an additional face cleanser for traveling or the gym? Yes definitely as the price is right. After using this though I ended up asking for a Clarisonic for my Christmas (which I got!).</li>
            <li> i usually do not use Olay products. If you have sensitive skin do not use the cream on your face first..test it on your hand or something first...i was going to return it..but i like the brush</li>
            <li> I choose this  rating and the product because I was looking for an  item to deep cleanse my skin. This product was worked wonders for my skin. It looks better than I started using the product.</li>
            <li> The brush is excellent and works great, however I use it with other scrub because the one came with the brush doesn&#x27;t works for me at all. Doesn&#x27;t remove me the grease of the face at all. Any way the brush is great.</li>
            <li> This was an impulse purchase that I now regret. I really don&#x27;t think this brush cleans better than an exfoliating cleanser and a washcloth. My daughter said that this compares to the Clarisonic like a SpinBrush compares to a Sonicare toothbrush. It&#x27;s a case of you getting what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love it. It works great for me. I have used it for 1 month and the battery is still ok. Be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and have used it side-by-side with my Clarisonic Mia for a week now. While it&#x27;s not as intense as the Mia, my skin is every bit as soft and radiant with the ProX. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a product that&#x27;s several steps above handwashing and don&#x27;t have oily-active skin, the ProX does the trick. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re managing problem skin (frequent outbreaks, clogged pores, blackheads and blemishes) and you&#x27;ve got a few hundred bucks to burn, then the Mia is definitely the better pick.</li>
            <li> Great value and works well.  The battery is difficult to change almost impossible to open, multi speeds is a nice feature</li>
            <li> Refreshing, my skin was dry and after use I could feel the difference. I would recommend using this product it left my skin soft and glowing.i only wish it had more cleaning product. Purchased at amazon had no problems and received un damaged and in a timely manner. Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> It is a good system for cleansing the skin and is affordable. There are so many expensive things on the  market and this system is simple and works.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush I use it in the shower everyday while it&#x27;s not water proof it&#x27;s water resistant it still proves to be able to handle being in the water now I&#x27;m not saying soak this think in water but I&#x27;m saying while in the shower I have held this think under the shower head at maximum pressure throughout the shower and I take long 30-1hour showers most the time the whole time the things in and out of the water while I&#x27;m Wasting my face so it&#x27;s very good resisting to water because it still works the brush on it is very soft and also it take 2 AA battery&#x27;s and even with them in I still took it under the shower head so like I said great water resistant and also the cream I use which is really not a dedicated \\&quot;facial cream\\&quot;  but works even better is Ivory body wash nice big bottle of it for about 6 bucks and on amazon you can get a pack of 6 for about 25 it&#x27;s working great for me I hope this was helpful</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Have use it for 3 days and it cleans my skin very well. It goes well with any cleanser.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item locally (not from Amazon) and enjoyed using it. Yes, my skin was brighter, felt cleaner, etc... but the unit quickly lost power and then would only work sporadically. I was careful not to get water inside the unit and replaced the batteries (twice). Finally, I threw it away. Yes, it did everything it claimed it would, but I was hoping it would last longer than a month! I&#x27;m currently online shopping for the professional version of their competitor.  Quality is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the Clarisonic but so far, the Olay brush has been great.  After about three months of use, I would say the \\&quot;wow\\&quot; factor is gone but my skin still feels great.  When I first started using it, I could not stop touching my face--it felt AMAZING!  Almost better than after a facial.  I suppose by now, I have just gotten used to it feeling good but I still use it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to compare to Clarisonic but I&#x27;d rather spend $200 on some new shoes or clothes.  I didn&#x27;t mind taking a chance on the Olay and it was well worth it.  Buy it!  You can&#x27;t buy shoes this cheap anyway.  :)</li>
            <li> It cleans face very well...it gets all the dirt that everything else leaves behind. great price. I thought about buying the more expensive items but this was a great buy and it works.</li>
            <li> Did a good job, price was right for the product advance cleaning system really works but is expensive combined with the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Not sure why people say this scratches their face /: I use it WAY longer than the recommended time and push pretty hard and my face doesn&#x27;t feel irritated at all. The brush is pretty soft and stops spinning if you press too hard. Anyway, this thing is awessssoooome! Really glad I bought it.  The cleanser it comes with is nice too. Good price, works great. I&#x27;ve had mine for a year now and it hasn&#x27;t needed batteries.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great produt, after clean my face I use the Cleaning brush, it is soft and does some deep cleaning. I like it and highly recommend his product!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how small and lightweight this cleansing machine was when I opened the box. It easily fits in your hand and has a nice feel to it. It&#x27;s incredibly quiet on both speeds. Difficult opening to insert batteries, but this is good as it makes it more waterproof, I suppose. The only issue I had was how soft the bristles on the cleansing brush were. I have somewhat dry skin and needed a bit firmer cleansing brush to do a better job of exfoliating my skin. If you just need a makeup remover, this will do nicely. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This thing barely even spins. I guess you can&#x27;t expect much for this price, but it was definitely a waste of money</li>
            <li> Never tried the clarisonic so I don&#x27;t know what to compare it to but I think it works great. I notice that my face feels cleaner than cleaning my face with my hands. I&#x27;ll use this after cleaning my face with makeup remover and my brush still ends up having some makeup residue on it. I&#x27;m always amazed. But then after I use my toner, I still have slight residue left over as well. Still a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> It only spins one way. It definitely cleans better than my bare hands, but not as I expected or I maybe expected too much as I wished it could rotate both ways.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to using Aveeno cleansing/scrubbing pads alone to get rid of makeup gunk. This product was just ok. I do like that it is portable and small though. Very gentle.</li>
            <li> While this proved a little too harsh for my skin, it worked very well on our toddler&#x27;s cheeks during an eczema flare up. It exfoliated gently with just water and seemed to contribute to her healing by removing the build up of dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine, and these refills are just fine. I&#x27;ve used generic, and I&#x27;m not a fan of how soft they are. These are perfect!</li>
            <li> I found the idea of an electric powered face cleansing gadget intriguing.  Clarisonic was too pricey to try so I bought this one just for the kick of it.  I stopped using it on my face after a few uses for fear of a breakout.  Nothing really happened, but I could somehow feel my skin was at the verge of a breakout.  I had also tried it on my body but found it too weak.  Now, the little gadget has been laying in my shower untouched for a year.  For people who are happy with a hand-and-towel cleansing routine, this could be more of a gimmick than a real plus.</li>
            <li> considering some similar products cost $50-$75 or more, the price was great and the product&lt;br /&gt;works like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  My skin felt and looked so good after only one use that I didn&#x27;t even wear makeup the next day!  As an added bonus, it feels like you&#x27;re getting a wonderful little face massage while using.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and I really did not use it. I can say that I received such a pleasant report from the person I gave it to that I am considering getting myself one. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter-in-law and she says she is very happy with it. Works well and she uses it on a regular basis</li>
            <li> What I like about this brush is the durability and then to speed adjustment got here within 24 hours I love prime</li>
            <li> This product I give 5 stars!! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this item, I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to invest in it. I bought this product merely as a cleaning tool for my face because I have very oily skin. After using this product, I saw results in my skin within the first week, especially after the second week; my skin was more radiant, clear, and free from pimples. I would highly recommend this product along with your favorite skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this. Your face feels so soft and clean after using this. I recommend highly! The price is reasonable too!</li>
            <li> Just as good as a Clarisonic. Makes my skin smooth and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and I&#x27;m really happy with it. I do apply make up everyday and use this at the end of the day to wash off any residue. My face has become much softer and fairer after using pro-x. I do apply a moisturizer because it does makes the skin dry a little bit. It&#x27;s pretty cheap and I would recommend this to everyone because you have no idea how much gunk is in your skin unless you wash it out and pro-x helps you with that. Also, the acne formation on my skin has reduced a little bit. I dont know if this helps for acne scars but I&#x27;m following a strict regime to get rid of it too. So far pro-x is helping me good with it.&lt;br /&gt;Though im new to this, i set the brush at a faster speed. I&#x27;ve learnt that lingering on one spot irritates the skin and the area becomes rough the following days. As i used it, i understood how my face likes it and I brush it as per (without irritating it).&lt;br /&gt;Also, it costed me about 15.99; why does the price fluctuate often??</li>
            <li> I have no qualms with this product other than it stopped working a month after I bought it.  When it was working it was exactly what I expected.  Then it simply stopped working.  Tried to return it, but it was outside of the window to do so.  Booooooo.</li>
            <li> I started using this as soon as it arrived.  I must say I can tell a different in complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and have recommended it to several people.</li>
            <li> This brush makes my face look vibrant and leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It evens my skin tone, my skin feels much softer and cleaner. Try a dry-brushing without using water and scrub! Skin gets veeeerrrry soft and it stimulates blood circulation! I recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Using this system leaves your skin glowing and fresh from daily exfoliation. I highly recommend this product at a great price point.</li>
            <li> As a guy, this is almost embarrassing to say how much I love this product. I just apply some soap to the brush when in the shower and turn this sucker on. Usually go for about a minute and the higher speed and my face feels like new after. The first time I used this I was shocked! My face felt so much smoother and cleaner, I cannot believe that I was just using my hands my whole life. I am probably responsible for the selling of at least 5 of these to my friends, as I cannot stop raving about this product. Some people say not to use this product every day as it is harsh on your skin, so I did cut down on using it everyday, but still use this product about 4-5 times a week. One thing is I would suggest is you would probably not want to use any face scrubs that have exfoliating products already in them, as that would likely not be good for your skin. Even the little soap that they give you with the product I would not want to use everyday as it has little microbeads in it and I do not want to be taking off layers upon layers of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I cannot speak to how the clarisonic operates, as I have never used one, but this is a much cheaper alternative. Not only is the product cheaper, but the replacement heads are cheaper. You can get replacement heads for under $5 all the time on amazon, when clarisonic heads cost $20+. On top of that the machine costs about $100. Save money, and get the job done with the Olay Pro-X!</li>
            <li> I was afraid this would be another way to overstimulate and irritate my very reactive tender face. I was pleasantly suprised -no redness, rawness and when looking into my 10X mirror, no skin debris in my pores. Fits the bill. If / when it gives out, I may invest in an ultra-sonic or occilating brush, now that I know it won&#x27;t be a facial torture device. I was loathe to spend a lot on something without trying it out first. quite satisfied with the Olay face brush, and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Product itself does what it says.  I would not recommend it if you have&lt;br /&gt;any kind of skin care issues.</li>
            <li> There is no reason to pay this much when it has the same effect as just hand exfoliating with baking soda or another type of scrub. It works no better than any method of exfoliation that doesn&#x27;t require a $25 tool. For that much, I expected it to work better than other methods, but it really didn&#x27;t. Plus it takes too long and the head pops off easily.</li>
            <li> I can feel my skin clean and clear smooth and reduce scar and whitehead and blackhead. I very love it .</li>
            <li> A good brush but not the best quality. Though, for the price, it is a good budget brush.</li>
            <li> I like the Olay Pro-X. I can&#x27;t attest to say my skin got any clearer from acne since I&#x27;ve already had rather clear skin. However, It does do a good job of removing makeup and for a lazy person like me who doesn&#x27;t like scrubbing, this is awesome. However the cleansing cream it comes with smells really funky to me and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of it. I rather use Ponds cold cream with the machine and it works like a charm :)</li>
            <li> item exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I recommend researching the product before applying to face . The cleanser I applied didn&#x27;t go well on my skin but other than that the electronic scrubber does its job</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels! Soft and relaxing it&#x27;s just a nice luxury doesn&#x27;t not cure acne.</li>
            <li> Great way to deep clean your face and clean out those pores !  I like the 2 speed settings, but the &amp;#34;on / off and speed level buttons&amp;#34; could be marked better.  Not a big deal ..... Just turned it off or faster or slower when I was trying to do the opposite !  Not that much of a problem and I would recommend this cleaner !</li>
            <li> Love! My skin feels sooooo amazing after using it. At first I was worried about the bristles being hard, but they are really soft! Feels so nice and relaxing while using it! Definitely will keep using. Worth the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different cleansing and exfoliating products and by far this is the best one. It is not harsh and it works very well. It has really made a huge difference. The cleanser will last a lot longer than most do to the fact you only have to use a small amount for it to do its job. And it cleans my face very well. I&#x27;m a person who is only in my 30s and I wear a lot of makeup and work out doors in the sand dust and mud. And this is the best product I&#x27;ve used to keep my skin looking young and that can remove all my makeup and dirt build up. I highly recommend you get this. Gonna be getting my mom one...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 and still suffer from acne and large pores. I started using this about two weeks ago . I use it every night before bed with the sample  face scrub it came with. I have noticed that my pores are shrinking and my face is noticeably smoother and my pores are a lot smaller. You don&#x27;t need to apply a lot of pressure when using it, at least that&#x27;s what my dermatologist advised me. It helps to gently exfoliate the top layer of skin, and gives you a beautiful glow. I love this and recommend it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this cleansing brush. I&#x27;ve used much more expensive brushes, and this one leaves my face feeling just as wonderful. In order to not dry out my skin, I use this every other day with my Eminence cleanser. It leaves my skin feeling just like I had microdermabrasion done.My makeup goes on perfectly. In fact, I haven&#x27;t even found the need to have any microderm done in almost a year since I started using this. Completely recommend.</li>
            <li> You definitely get what you pay for.  If you&#x27;ve never used a Clarisonic, you should be happy with this. However, I used my Clariisonic for two years prior to buying this for travel. After getting used to the more expensive model, this feels not unlike putting my electric toothbrush all over my face. It serves the purpose for a small travel version, and if you&#x27;ve never used it&#x27;s much more expensive cousin, you&#x27;ll probably like it.  If you have, I&#x27;d hold off until Clarisonic has a sale.</li>
            <li> Really like this cleansing system! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the cleansing lotion sample. It has an odd odor to it that makes me hesitant to use it. Smells like it is past its expiration date! I also was surprised with the high speed. It actually feels like it is cleaning deeper.</li>
            <li> I think it does an OK job as a small travel cleaning option, but that&#x27;s about it.  My biggest complaint is that the rotation is strictly one direction meaning you&#x27;re constantly fighting the brush to remain on your face.  It&#x27;s not by any means a powerful motor, but regardless it&#x27;s annoying trying to clean your skin when the one direction is pulling your hand each time you make contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it, but my wife has decided to keep it as a backup to her Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> If you get white heads, black heads, or have trouble with dirty/clogged pores this product can really help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; cleaner like other offerings at much higher prices and should not be compared to those. This unit uses an electric motor to spin a soft brush wheel in one direction. When used properly, it provides a gentle cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not like the cleaning solution that came with this product, I threw it away and made my own. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to use an exfoliate with abrasive particles with this unit, it may damage your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a 50/50 mix of [[ASIN:B001DJDP7C Thayer Unscented Witch Hazel, 12 Fluid Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B00015XAQ0 Avalon Organics Refreshing Cleansing Gel Vitamin C, 8.5 Fluid Ounce]] to be an excellent cleaning solution to use with this product. Shake it up before using and it will produce a nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is water resistant so it can be used in the shower. The battery compartment is sealed with a silicone strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The all white design looks great. The soft rubberized exterior feels durable and is comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I don&#x27;t think this product can be beat, although there are better options at higher price points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major problem with this product is that the motor only spins in one direction. A pulsing back and forth would probably be more effective, and the sonic products that cost a lot more are definitely more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;+ Great value&lt;br /&gt;+ Solid construction, durable finish&lt;br /&gt;+ Comfortable to grip in one hand&lt;br /&gt;+ Effective at cleaning surface level dirty/clogged pores&lt;br /&gt;+ Rubberized exterior and silicone seals make are water resistant&lt;br /&gt;+ Long battery life, uses 2 standard AA batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons / Considerations:&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;- Brush spins in only one direction&lt;br /&gt;- Not a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; system like higher priced products such as ClariSonic&lt;br /&gt;- Using this product too often or pressing too hard with it will probably damage your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;Used in moderation and with the right cleansing solution this is a great tool. The formula I am using works great for me and seems to be improving my skin. I use it about 2-3 times per week and I&#x27;m careful to be gentle with the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not go crazy with this thing and use it every day or press really hard on your skin with the brush. Use it carefully and you can expect to get very good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your budget can afford a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; tool, you may want to consider going for that instead because you can get much \\&quot;deeper\\&quot; cleaning.lariSonic&lt;br /&gt;- Using this product too often or pressing too hard with it will probably damage your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;Used in moderation and with the right cleansing solution this is a great tool.

            <li> Period. This item buffs the skin without irritating it. I find that it exfoliates really well and leaves my skin feeling, and looking, radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device comes with batteries and a travel/sample sized bottle of Olay exfoliating cleanser. I use my own cleanser of choice with the brush (Purity by Philosophy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has two speeds and both are just fine by my sensitive, mid-30 skin.</li>
            <li> I searched around and looked at several brands before I received this one for Christmas this past year. I have now been using it off and on since then and I am more than pleased. It was easy to understand how to properly use and the batteries seem to last. You do have to put batteries in it yourself but I&#x27;ve had the same ones in there since December. My skin feels wonderful and I am having less breakouts now as well.</li>
            <li> I like this product and my face feels cleaner when I use it, especially after a sweaty workout.  Thanks, olay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using everyday, and it is really good. I feel my face really clean and relax when I used. However, It stopped working last night. I&#x27;m super disappointed and wouldn&#x27;t thing it would within a month. It was my valentine&#x27;s present. Now, I don&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Was thinking of ordering the much more expensive version of it, but figured I should give this a shot first. Works wonders. Noticeabley better after a couple uses. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has 2 speeds, but I prefer to use the high speed, it removes more dirt. I found that if you put the cleanser directly on your face it works better than if placing it on the scrub. You can use any cleanser. I like a lighter one for 6 days and use the mirco scrub for the 7th. Many of the reviews complained of peeling and drying out. I found it that if you use a night cream, which is a little heavy than day cream, it works wonders. So you have a clean and hydrated face in the morning.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sis. The next day, she told me her whole face started redness after using this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t about to cough over hundreds for the Clarisonic version, so I was thrilled to see this item and its great reviews. After over a month of using it, I am in love. My skin feels softer, less oily, and my pores appear smaller.  I still have to use an exfoliation pad occasionally to remove old rough skin, but this does an amazing job at deep-cleaning.  Definitely an awesome value; I&#x27;ll be sticking with this tool for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m a guy using this for his acne. I don&#x27;t have major acne or anything, but enough to annoy me. I didn&#x27;t want to go through a whole dermatologist regimen, since I feel it to be unnecessary; so I got this cleansing system. I&#x27;ve noticed that when I consistently use this right before I sleep my acne will be significantly reduced. On the days, or weeks sometimes, I skip it my face starts breaking out again. It has also made my skin look and feel more alive, so that&#x27;s always a plus. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to improve their facial skin.</li>
            <li> The ladies in my family think it is good present. It is a good present for woman. It is cheap but is useful and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy since it was very inexpensive compared to other products, but works great I use it every day!</li>
            <li> I just love this little facial cleanser. Its cheap and works great. The bristles on the brush head are super soft and gentle but you do need to replace them every few weeks. If you dont, the bristles eventually become harder and a little too rough for washing your face. I use this cleanser with hand made, organic bar soaps. I have taken mine in the shower and its very waterproof. Very easy to clean. I just turn the brush on and run it under water, using a finger through the bristles to remove any left over soap or dirt. Then I seperate the brush head from the handle and dry with a towl. Worth every penny. Works great!</li>
            <li> The first day i got this and used it, my face had a reduce size in bumps. It&#x27;s great for getting out grease on your head produced by your glands. I use it with soap. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and it still has lived up to it&#x27;s title. The thing i dislike is that it collect dirt and loses it&#x27;s whiteness overtime, but that is minimal.</li>
            <li> Cheaper. And effective. Really cleans your face and helps whatever cleanser, moisturizer, or whatever penetrate your skin more. I haven&#x27;t broken out as much anymore except for when I get this pesky &amp;#34;time-of-the-month&amp;#34; pimples and even those aren&#x27;t as worse anymore either. The quantity of my pimples has definitely decreased except I may get 1 or 2. But overall, money well spent. It won&#x27;t help clear up dark spots though. I suggest microdermabrasion treatments for that. But I do suggest all women and men use a facial cleansing brush. It really cleans all the dirt and/or makeup off your face more than your fingertips do.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a clarisonic.  I have this.  I can tell no difference except that my skin looks better than hers.  I&#x27;m 50, she&#x27;s 20.  Why pay more??</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband so he would leave my Clarisonic alone.  It&#x27;s not as heavy duty but it works for him and he&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> I came inches away of spending $$$ on a Clarasonic for my face. During the summer, my skin is oily which causes a lot of break-outs around my forehead mostly. I decided to try the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and am super pleased with it! I only use it two-three times a week due to my sensitive skin and it has made a great improvement on my complexion. My skin is not oily and the break-outs have reduced dramatically. Don&#x27;t spend your money on any other cleanser! This is it!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product so far. It works very well and is easy to use and clean (just pop off the brush after use and wash separate from unit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks great, though it doesn&#x27;t seem to help my nose very well. Not sure why but could be the type of face wash I am using. I am trying two different products right now. You can use any face wash with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much I am hoping to get two more as gifts!</li>
            <li> I am Very pleased with the product !! I wish the product came with a bigger size of exfoliator cream.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE WAY THIS BRUSH CLEANS MY SKIN AND THE PRICE IS JUST RIGHT! I BOUGHT ONE FOR MYSELF AND MY SISTER AND WE BOTH LOVE IT! HAS 2 SPEEDS AND CLEANS WONDERFULLY! MY SKIN FEELS BABY SOFT AFTER AND THE BRUSH REALLY CLEANS DEEP TO RID MY SKIN OF DIRT, OIL, AND OLD MAKEUP. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BEAUTY MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 and a regular user of this complexion brush. Mild cleansers, along with this brush, yield a fresh looking complexion. I use it about 3 times a week, faithfully. The price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!! I don&#x27;t feel complete if I don&#x27;t was my face with this, even after I take off my make up it removes what I couldn&#x27;t even see.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal, good price, and fast, affordable international shipping. This product works the same, if not better, then many other more expensive competing versions. I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many good things about this product.  Just recently I have been breaking out worse than ever (I&#x27;m 23 yrs. old) and I needed to figure out what works, I&#x27;d been switching between different face washes, but this one works.  It does take awhile for it to work.  I feel like it gets worse, then gets better.  Skin is soft, I do it every day or every other day.  I also use it other places besides my face to exfoliate too.  It helps!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product, but unfortunately when I received my package I only received the Toner and Cleanser that I ordered in conjunction.  I contacted Amazon and they were happy to help me with a refund. I will be ordering this in the future, but for right now I think I&#x27;ll stick to physical stores. ;)</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a couple of months. I was so excited to get it and have been very pleased with it. I love the way it makes my face feel, so clean and smooth! I use it with whatever facial cleanser I happen to be using, but it does feel the best when used with the exfoliating cream. I didn&#x27;t have any problems putting the batteries in it.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy my sister one because I want her to see how cool it is. Buy it! It&#x27;s a great deal and cheaper here than at my local Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li> I am glad I read the reviews and purchased this item.  It is easy to keep in the shower for a good face scrub.  It works well just with water or a face wash.  Also, it is a great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This little device really amps up the facial experience.  My skin feels rejuvenated after using it. Will buy a couple for gifts for Xmas.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, but for the price, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try. I&#x27;ve always have breakouts around my chin area and now I have none at all! I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 months straight without skipping a day (ok, maybe once or twice, but it&#x27;s now become part of my daily shower routine). I&#x27;ve had no major breakouts since. If any start to sprout, it goes away very quickly. You don&#x27;t have to spend too much time on your face with it. Just scrub scrub in less than a minute and done.  I use the Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Purpose cleanser with it. You can use any cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the soft bristle and though it seems like the motion is not doing much, I&#x27;m sure it did clean my face because I have had no painful breakouts. The hardest part is putting the battery in. That thing is very hard to open up, but the battery has lasted to this day (7 months and still working). It&#x27;s waterproof, so keep it in your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister bought the Clairsonic and it doesn&#x27;t do anything much for her, but in all fairness, she hasn&#x27;t been using it daily like I do with the Olay Pro-X.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X spin brush does a fair job. My face is smoother with a bit less number of blackheads - but not so much less that I am impressed. My short hair gets caught in the spinning brush - HUGE concern for longer hair. The batteries last 3 to 5 weeks - which surprised me....</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of products through Amazon and I decided to just start reviewing the products.  I bought this for my daughter who is only 8 years old.  Only using the scrubber.  My daughter loves it and it makes cleaning her face fun.  The bristles are soft and works great</li>
            <li> I really like this cleaning system -- love the soft brush and the mild exfoliating wash.  I follow it up with hyaluronic acid and moistureizer.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this..especially for being male. I would always have clogged pores on my tzone area which I thought I would never be able to get rid of. I would use all sorts of exfoliates an cleaners, but they would always remain or only partly be removed just to come back in a couple hours. When I first used this product I was completely shocked that my pores were actually empty clean!! My face was so smooth it almost felt like my girlfriends ;) the second day I used it I noticed since my pores weren&#x27;t clogged up they actually became so much more smaller! I thought my pores were naturally big but no, when I looked in the mirror I saw that they became smaller and actually looked normally sized and not jurrasic-ending-meteor-craters. I am beyond satisfied with this product. I use this with aveenos ultra calming cleanser. Great products.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy Olay&#x27;s products and will probably always, but this not so much. It&#x27;s far too weak and I personally do not feel it compares AT ALL to a Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Clarisonic before and I decided to try this since it was far less expensive and I thought if me and the Clariosnic didn&#x27;t work out I could go with Olay&#x27;s Pro-X brush for a fraction of the price. I read the reviews and I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spinning mechanism on it with the batteries is just far too weak.. like, I would rather use my own hands with a wash cloth and I feel that it would be doing more than using this brush. The Clarisonic just feels like it&#x27;s actually getting in there and working into your skin (in my opinion, it does) with the Pro-X it feels so mild like it&#x27;s hardly doing much. It&#x27;s comfortable, light, but I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s actually doing anything or noticed that it took off my make up that well on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotations of the spinning is just also very slow and I even changed the batteries because I thought maybe it was that.. I did that and to no avail, same thing. Mind you, I have moderately sensitive skin so I&#x27;m not a fan of super duper scrubbing action (I can only use the sensitive brush for the Clarisonic), but this just didn&#x27;t do much for me :( :( I wish it did because it&#x27;s such a wonderful price but sadly it doesn&#x27;t compare to the Clarisonic for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s great, I mean it&#x27;s still a nice product and I won&#x27;t completely knock it because maybe some people just have better results, but it doesn&#x27;t nearly compare to the Clarisonic whatsoever in my opinion if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> This is very gentle and works well; looks simple and neat.  There isn&#x27;t much scrubbing soap provided so you&#x27;ll need to go buy some within a few days of this purchase.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a week with the pro-x cleanser it came with. I have not seen any major improvement in my skin but my skin does feel cleaner and fresh.</li>
            <li> Works great, and exactly what I was looking for for the price.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a good face cleaning system!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seven months pregnant and it&#x27;s caused my eczema to be out of control. After reading many reviews about many different facial brushes, I decided to buy this from Target. I couldn&#x27;t wait for Amazon to send it to me. So far, this has been a great buy. It was $100 cheaper than most of the brushes I looked at. It is also soft enough to use wet or dry. The first time I used it, I saw and felt results right away. I used it dry. It immediately got rid of most of my flakes and cleared up my oily nose. If you have jewelry in your nose, take it out unless it&#x27;s L shaped jewelry. Otherwise, the jewelry will be in the way and you won&#x27;t be able to clean that area properly. It also came with batteries. I was pretty stoked about that. Most companies are too cheap to supply you with batteries. You can buy replacement brushes for around 10 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product have very few cons. I don&#x27;t like the small brush because I want to use this all over my body. Getting to the battery area is a pain in the ass. The batteries go into the bottom of the brush. If you don&#x27;t have tools in your house, you will have problems getting the cover off. I used a clamp I have for when I glue wood together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this product four stars. It looses a star for the hard to access battery area and the brush size.</li>
            <li> Great love it its awesome cleans your face and leaves skin so soft and bright. I use it everyday.love it</li>
            <li> I have to say first off that I&#x27;ve never tried the Clairsonic, however. i LOVE this product. Feel like it really gets deep into your pores and my skin has never looked better. I have been using the sample of the Olay cleanser and really like that too. But I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Well after reading tons of reviews for this brush and the Clarisonic one I decided to get the Olay one, Amazon had it for $21.97 and then had a $5 off coupon, so I went for it. Love it! Love it! Love it! There was no amazing overnight miracle for me, not that I expected one. It&#x27;s been about a month or so now and I use it almost every day in the shower, it must be waterproof because I have not had any problems at all with using it in the shower. I have had lots of break outs for the past month though,nothing major. They started out on the right side of my face, then went to my forehead, then went to my chin area. I still have them here and there, they go away quickly though. I&#x27;m assuming this is the \\&quot;purging\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve read about on other reviews from the Clarisonic. So I&#x27;m assuming that it is cleaning out my pores pretty well. After the break outs clear up there is nice smooth skin. My skin is VERY smooth now. Last night I was sitting on the couch watching TV and happen to touch my forehead and just kept rubbing it because it was SO SOFT! I was amazed and knew it was because of the Olay brush, because I&#x27;ve not changed anything else. I will say I am usually oily T zone type and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the change in season&#x27;s here in IA or if it&#x27;s the Olay brush, but I&#x27;m not NEAR as oily, in fact I&#x27;m dry in some areas. So I will be getting some moisturizer for my face, for the first time. Another thing, I can see that my pores are cleaner looking. I would say that some of my pores that were big, to me, are smaller now. I love this little brush. It was super cheap compared to the other one everyone raves about, I&#x27;m not about to spend $100 on a face brush when this one is working quite well for me. It did catch my hair a time or two because the head spins around, but have learned to keep my long curly hair back. I only used the cleanser that came w/ it once, it was fine. I have slightly sensitive skin, comes w/ age I guess and the sample cleanser worked fine. The rest of the time I use Bare Minerals cleansers and make up - love that stuff! You could use it w/ any cleanser. I would say that my makeup goes on nicer though since I&#x27;ve been using the Olay brush. For the price I think it&#x27;s totally worth it. And I think it takes lots of time for your skin to adjust to getting itself all cleaned out better than it has ever been, so I would suggest to wait a while before you make any judgements on the ability of the brush. I&#x27;m 39 and I have forehead lines, it hasn&#x27;t erased those of course, but it has made my skin so soft and it feels healthy now. Hope this review helps. Thanks for the coupon Amazon!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I am a DEVOTED Pro-X user. I use the Age Repair, Eye Restoration and Intensive Wrinkle products all the time, and LOVE them. So I was excited to try out this cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment. My \\&quot;old system\\&quot;- Ivory Soap and a scrubby facial sponge- is much more effective, much less expensive, and doesn&#x27;t require batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this product for a refund today. I&#x27;m not sorry I tried it, but I&#x27;m really glad Olay offers a money-back guarantee.</li>
            <li> For this price this is a very good face cleansing system! The brush is soft which I like because I have sensitive skin, and having 2 speeds is perfect so you can either lightly go over your face for morning cleansing, or do a little deeper cleaning at night when you take your makeup off. You think the brush will be too soft and the little battery operated machine won&#x27;t be powerful enough to clean your face well, but after using it I was amazed at how smooth my skin felt and how much dead skin it removed. Proof you don&#x27;t have to scrub your face raw to get results! I got this because I am about to turn 42 so my once soft skin is so much drier and flakier than it used to be and I&#x27;ve had an adult onset of acne that is driving me nuts, and being in my 40&#x27;s I can&#x27;t use the stuff I used for acne when I was younger or my entire face gets itchy, red and dried out. This is really helping clear up my face and it hasn&#x27;t even been a week of using it yet! My face feels just like it does after I get an $80 facial at the salon, and this is whether I use the Olay cleanser or any other cleanser...they all work great with this product so I am very pleased.  My fiance was so impressed with the results he asked if they make one with a little more power for men so he can get one! :)</li>
            <li> It just can&#x27;t be compared with Clarisonic at all. The spining/movement is very weak</li>
            <li> great way to scrub your face! especially if your feeling lazy! just use a good face wash and moisterizer</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on a Clarisonic system.  I had used Clarisonic for quite awhile.  When my original broke, I purchased another. NEVER AGAIN.  This Olay Pro-X works just as well if not better than the Clarisonic products, and at such a better price point!!!!  I will say that I have normal to combination skin and don&#x27;t know how well this would work for someone with very sensitive skin.  But, for me, it it is wonderful.  The replacement heads are easily acquirable and clean up so nice(much better than my Clarisonic ones ever did)  and the choice of two speeds is nice.  I use this system with a variety of skin cleansers and it was worked great at toning and clarifying my skin.  GO OLAY!!!!! DON&#x27;T SPEND ANOTHER DIME ON CLARISONIC!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Best skin yet.</li>
            <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve been using it every day for 4 months, once in the morning, and my skin feels so smooth and amazing afterwards. My pores have shrunken a considerable amount to where you can hardly even see them! I didn&#x27;t even know that was possible. I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries at all yet. The price is unbeatable - especially compared to the Clarisonic! I feel like it does the same magic for 1/8th of the price. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a facial cleansing brush before, and I must say even after my first use my skin was instantly softer after my shower. I have sensitive skin and the bristles are soft so it&#x27;s not too rough on your face. I&#x27;m a big fan of this product.</li>
            <li> Great price and exactly what I expected.  Best price online.  Works great with two speed rotation options. Keep in mind other products only vibrate vs rotating. My preference was to purchase a rotating cleansing type machine.  It works great, use it in the shower and perfect size for my travels. I suggest buying the two pack of extra brushes as I did because my daughter and family use and love my new Pro-X. Oh Great!!  I recommend this product.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> My face feels a lot cleaner using this vs my hands.  I use the scrubber with my normal face wash and can see and feel a big difference.  I haven&#x27;t used the included face wash yet.  I&#x27;ll try it once I use up my regular face wash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this.  the best product to ever happen to my face! I use any face wash. foaming wash and this do not work well together.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best cleansers I have ever used.  Your face feels completely smooth, clean, fresh just like you stepped out of a salon.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are awesome and having. Two speed setting is great. However , I wish the bristles were a little more tough. I&#x27;m used to a heavy exfoliating skin pad from another brand. This isn&#x27;t bad at all. The trial cleanser on the other hand ... I can&#x27;t say I noticed anything special About it.</li>
            <li> Now if only there were a tool to lift the drooping ,clean, skin I would be completely happy. The ProX is fine.After using it I feel as though I&#x27;ve had a facial.</li>
            <li> Excellent gentle exfoiation--an excellent price--when these items first came out they were uber-expensive at the cosmetic counters in the mall.</li>
            <li> It was very affordable although not as big of a brush as I expected.  It does a good job for at home cleansing but does not compare to professional cleansing.</li>
            <li> I adore my Olay Pro-X brush! I just replaced it with the 3 speed, Microdermabrasion unit. I had to replace because I believe water got into the battery area and I had put it away for a few months after a move. When I went to use it again the power was substantially diminished. I don&#x27;t fault the product for that which is why I order the 3 speed brush. I have not used the clairsonic, but unless this one quits on me because I feel it should, I will stick with the Olay brush. The brush head replacements are cheap too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. I have been keeping it in the shower for 3 weeks now and it has quickly become part of my daily regimen. Really gets my pores squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I wanted one to wash my face efficiently. It delivers way more strokes than washing with your hands possibly can. Depending on the facial wash, it can be used to exfoliate or to simply wash. The bristles are soft but resilient, so it actually can exfoliate but it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin. The head is about the size of a roll of tape.</li>
            <li> I love the Pro-X cleansing system because it really gets into my pores, I only use the cream that comes with it a couple times. If you have the olay pore scrub, the cleansing system really gets your face clean!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect and first time I used it I was afraid it was too weak.&lt;br /&gt;BUT my face loved it!  It&#x27;s exactly what I needed. Thanks</li>
            <li> I use to use my hands to wash my face. As soon as i used the Olay Pro-X with the face wash it came with, my face felt really soft and clean. I noticed the difference instantly and so did other people. However im using it with a Natural face wash and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not come with 2 Brush heads like it said it would. It only brought 1.</li>
            <li> I got this 7 months ago. The first time I used it I was amazed by how soft my skin was! I mean, if I were willing to spend over $100 on a cleansing brush I&#x27;d probably get the Clarisonic, but I&#x27;m not. If you&#x27;re trying to decide whether or not you want an cleansing brush, go for it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the rotating head to provide more powerful scrub action. The scrub head moves at a decent rotation speed on high setting, but once you press it against the facial skin with some pressure the speed dramatically reduced due to friction. Need...more...power... but I suppose it&#x27;s decent for its price.</li>
            <li> Only thing that will help with blackheads that I have found.</li>
            <li> LOVE this. I use it in the shower and it&#x27;s been great. I love how soft my skin feels afterward. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Everyday I use it. It does take away make up without to much of a hassle. All I do is change battery.</li>
            <li> The scrubber and the cleanser are both great. My face feels soft and clean. Well worth the money, which was not a lot.</li>
            <li> wish it would spin a little more aggressively but most people would like it esp if they have sensitive skin. i have very tough skin that can take a lot so i may be a little more picky, bvut such a great price in comparison to the other brands! i would recommend to a friend for sure</li>
            <li> Highly recomended item for all women!!</li>
            <li> This is beyond amazing, I have an acne prone skin.. And I can only use one product for face wash and cream. After I use this for less than a week. I  am in love, my new fave!!!!</li>
            <li> Ehh just by a soft brush and scrub your face with exfoliating face wash... this is for lazy people</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this. I have a  $10 one that I like better and it has more then 1 type of brush. Both speeds seem the same to watch it spin. I expected a lot more from this product.</li>
            <li> I was fall in love with this product. My skin feel so smooth after using this. I purchased 5 more for each one of my best friend. But after a while my skin became so sensitive to UV. I&#x27;m not sure because of this product or my own skin care. So i decided to stop using it for right now.</li>
            <li> The brush is great. Opening it was a bit of a trial, but thanks to youtube, is easily accomplished without breaking it. I think my skin looks improved, which is important as my job requires daily makeup, the extra boost for deep cleaning without drying out is really helpful. It&#x27;s also great that this can be used with any of your preferred facial cleaning product (as the one it comes with does nothing for me).</li>
            <li> I bought this unit at the pharmacy about a month ago and I didn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg on a cleaning brush because I had never tried one before. This one was on sale so I decided to five it a try and I just love it! I use it every morning and every night before bed with La Roche-Posay cleanser and my face, pores and neck have never been cleaner! I just love this little gadget! I even use it in the shower although I haven&#x27;t completely submerged it under water, I have gotten it wet while showering and it still works just fine...I only wish it came with different attachments like other brands so I could use it on my body and feet. Great value for the money compared to other high end units that cost a fortune. This particular unit is a must have!!!!</li>
            <li> I give this cleansing brush 5 stars bc I cannot imagine washing my face without one. I have only been using it for a little over a week but there is definately a difference seen in my skin. I have extremely oily/acne prone skin and occasionally have cystic acne. My pores around my t-zone area are noticeably smaller, my face is starting to look clearer and I think I am going to say it is because of this brush. I&#x27;m finally able to properly clean all the junk out of my pores every day, giving my face a better chance of healing and looking the clearest it has looked in a while. I do not use the PRO X cleanser with it though, I am using my own face wash with it instead. I&#x27;m sure there are other facial cleansing brushes out there that work just as well or maybe better, but this is the only one I have tried and for $20 who can complain.</li>
            <li> Had another product, with a larger head that was discontinued. A bit of an adjustment and takes longer to feel you have covered your whole face properly. Better than not having a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. Really helps exfoliate my face. I use it with Proactive &amp; it really gets my pores clean.</li>
            <li> I got this about a month ago and use it several times a week.  My only regret is, I should have gotten this last year but I was too cheap.  Anyhow, this is great.  I use other cleansers with this.  I only use it 1x a day.  If I use it more than that, then it irritates my skin.  The bristles are medium/soft.  More on the soft side than anything else.  However, if you need really, super soft bristles, this isn&#x27;t for you.  There&#x27;s only two settings, fast and medium/slow.  It also INCLUDES the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m African American with very oily skin.  I&#x27;m also older.  I just wish they&#x27;d had this in my twenties!</li>
            <li> I love the spin brush for my skin. Its soft, but cleanses great. I love the two speeds for comfort.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading reviews from other customers. It is worth every penny. I am a 48 yr old male, and have oily skin. I have only had this for 2 days and the difference is amazing</li>
            <li> This is a well built brush and it works very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just o.k.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is too soft, and the two speeds are pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting little more from O&#x27;lay.</li>
            <li> There are no cons about this item as far as I am concerned. It gets all the dirt deep down in your skin that a washcloth just cant reach. I cant say never, but I Iove this device much more than a wash cloth. I used to have acne. No more. Face is radiant along with moisturizing and spf.</li>
            <li> Good to use to clean off facials. I prefer the clarisonic cleanser brush as it is stronger and better. I gave my ex the cleaning solution it came with and it worked well with him even though it was made for use for targeted older people for aging.</li>
            <li> its good for a quick face cleaner,  I also like the cleanser that is included. it leaves your face looking brighter</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily (in the evening) with the microderm scrub and it has improved by skin tone and decreased oil production through the day. I did find the product to cause dry patches in my skin so I used in every-other-day to start and then increased to daily. Some days I use it with my facewash (CeraVe) instead of the scrub. My skin is less shiny and my pores are smaller since using this (it has been about a month). I would recommend it if you are looking for a low-price skincare microderm abrasion option. Many reviews compare this to the higher priced brands and I cannot speak to that but I do like the product and have had no issues with function so far. The Amazon price is also far cheaper than the in-store prices that I have seen locally.</li>
            <li> This is an unfair review in the sense that I&#x27;ve never had or tried a clarisonic. BUT, I can say that I love his little thing, and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever need a clarisonic. I use it daily for gentle exfoliation and I feel it does exactly what I need it to do. No complaints here!</li>
            <li> bristles could be stiffer.  Slightly stiffer bristles could be more helpful to slough off dead skin cells.  Also product slips in between bristles &amp; doesn&#x27;t scrub your face as much.</li>
            <li> This product is a definite 5 star rating.. It cleanses my face so well, getting rid of most of my blemishes while not drying it out too much!!</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X spin brush is super awesome. It only spins in one direction vs. the clarisonic which goes both ways but it cleans just as well. It cleans super deep down and I never have any leftover makeup to wipe off. The brush itself is also easy to clean. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> love it. if you don&#x27;t want to spend big money on a clarisonic definitely buy this nifty gadget to clean face instead of hands that don&#x27;t do as good of a job! :) so happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and my skin feels very soft. I will continue to use it. Hopefully, I will see even better results!</li>
            <li> This is a great beauty tool, gives my skin a glowing complexion ~ use it with Regenerist detoxifying pore scrub. I get more compliments then ever!</li>
            <li> I love this.  It smooths out my skin beautifully with the lotion and is effortless.&lt;br /&gt;I paid less on Amazon that I would have at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Love this thing. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money for one of these machines, so this was a great way to introduce myself to a whole new world. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll say - be patient with your skin. Don&#x27;t expect it to perform miracles the first night. The first few days you might break out more than you&#x27;re used to. That&#x27;s ok, let it happen. By day 3-5, that&#x27;s when the real magic happens. You&#x27;ll notice that your make up goes on much smoother, that you don&#x27;t have to dab the excess oil off your face in the middle of the day, and your skin will feel so much lighter. It literally takes a full week for the machine to work through the layers and layers of dead skin, dirt, and grime that you never knew you had. My combination skin is now very tame, doesn&#x27;t grease up in the middle of the day, pores look smaller, skin looks clearer, and my skin feels so much lighter. The only warning I give is to only use it once a day. It&#x27;s so much fun to use that you&#x27;ll be tempted to use it every time you wash your face (assuming you wash your face in the morning and night). Stick to doing it once a day so you don&#x27;t overdry your skin and start peeling. End of the day works great for me because it gets rid of the grime from the day and lets my night cream seep in more, but that&#x27;s a personal preference. Highly recommend this product. Works great at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love how this works. It runs smoothly and I can feel it clear the top of my skin from dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> This little brush is gentle yet cleanses very well.  It softly massages your face as it cleans.  I absolutely love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so amazing before. I use Proactiv Plus and it works pretty well but it wasn&#x27;t until I added in this on a daily basis that it really became smoother and rough spots that would come on cold/dry days where I live are completely gone. I used LESS product on my face because it is clearer and I don&#x27;t have to use any moisturizer any more. Love it. Best invention ever for skin!</li>
            <li> No wonder it is a top best seller for years. It is easy to use and very comfortable to my skin. I can spare the money for Clarisonic for other stuff on my list. So great I ordered another one for my mum.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Very easy to use and travel with.  I wish it had a stand to put in the shower or at the sink but other than that, love it!  I have used the cleanser it came with and also another brand and it works well with whatever cleanser I have used so far.</li>
            <li> This is a great little device, my wife and I keep it in our shower and use it 1-2x per week.  I made the mistake of pushing too hard and it ripped my face to shreds so be careful.  Keep it light and it does a great job of exfoliating, minimizing blackheads, and make your face feel super smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days and I love the way it makes my skin feel. I use it each night before going to bed. It is gentle and a great way to remove my makeup. My skin looks so much better. I wish I bought is years ago.</li>
            <li> I have stress/hormonal acne since starting medical school and this system (along with some new products) has really kept my breakouts in check since I started using it. I have fair, very sensitive skin too and it is not irritating in the slightest! I have been using it for over a month without breakouts or issues and the batteries are still going strong (the ones that came with it). I didn&#x27;t have nearly as much trouble inserting them as other people either. I get it pretty wet too and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it yet. I hightly recommend!</li>
            <li> i like it ! made my face smoother from the first time. now i use it on a daily basis .</li>
            <li> I have both and will definitely encourage you to get the pro-x PLUS - it has much better intensity and results.  This is good as well but I prefer the plus for better results - see my review on it</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone. They love the product and it looks like it has worked well with their skin.</li>
            <li> I was thinking about getting the expensive cleansing system (I forget the name) but its upwards of $150!  This is just as good in my opinion and does everything I expected the expensive system to do.  It cleans off your makeup and rinses in a flash.  I love it.  :)</li>
            <li> From the first time I used this, I can tell how clean my face was. It felt so clean, fresh, and soft. Much better compared to washing my face with my hands and soap.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles, i did notice it kept my face clear, easy to use and to clean</li>
            <li> This might sound a little crazy but I carry this little guy practically everywhere with me! It really makes you feel freshened up after you wash and like it really washed your face. Compared to many cleansing systems at this price it is the best of the best. I&#x27;ve bought quite a few different ones and I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to get this one.</li>
            <li> this is awesome! I had been hearing so much about these cleansing systems, but wasn&#x27;t about to pay $100 or more for one, I am so glad that I ordered this, it works great! I wish it had a stand or holder though, to stand it to dry after use  UPDATE: I still love it! BUT Olay, please,please offer a stand or holder for it</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft and the spinning is very light on your skin, I was looking for something a little rougher to really exfoliate so i&#x27;m a little disappointed but only because its not what i was looking for.....its still a nice product--just wish it was a little rougher!</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this! It&#x27;s so easy to use and my face feels cleaner and brighter after using it! It was easy to put together as well. I just love it!</li>
            <li> This is a fair price compared to the other products. it is the ONLY thing that keeps my skin acne free. I know all of the skin specialists cringe when they see people tearing up their skin with this, but this is the single product that keeps acne at bay. I have dropped it twice now in the shower and it broke open, sending the batteries everywhere, and yet it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love it, feels great to wash your face. The best way to use it is to massage cleanser into your face and then use the brush. I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change but my face does feel incredible after I use it. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I realize that this is NOT a Clarisonic. If you are looking for the Olay system to be a cheaper alternative to the Clarisonic, you will be disappointed. This device is small, great for facial scrubbing. It comes with a small tube of exfoliating scrub as well. This is nice for those looking to shed some dry skin (gross, I know) and polish up their face. I have a tendency to have dry skin come spring/summer, so this was my saving grace this year. After the first use, I noticed a significant decrease in dry skin and have noticed some of my dryness-caused redness disappearing. It was amazing. I have owned/been using this guy for 3 weeks now and have noticed that my oily/sensitive skin has become smoother, less irritated, and less oily (fun bonus I wasn&#x27;t even looking for)! Also, I stopped using the provided scrub because I personally think a heavier duty scrub works better. I bought SoftSoap Glow Scrub, which has apricot seeds as the scrubber, and use it with this system. I&#x27;m much happier with the results with that versus with the provided scrub. The Clarisonic is a bit bulkier and more heavy duty. It you feel you need something like that, definitely forgo purchasing this.</li>
            <li> This item lived up to the hype of the ads.  My skin is cleaner and smoother than it has been in ages.</li>
            <li> Only change I would make would be to make the head a little bigger like the original youthful essence product and offer different attachments.</li>
            <li> Bought one for me and one for my daughter. Weak and too soft for my taste. I rarely regret buying stuff bcz i can donate the stuff I don&#x27;t want but this was a waste. At least it was less expensive than what it&#x27;s priced at the pharmacies.</li>
            <li> It gets most of my makeup off. I use it once a day, at night. My skin has clearly improved since I&#x27;ve started using it. You can basically pair it up with any face wash of your choice.</li>
            <li> It works, I still have it and use it. The brush will pop off from time to time, but it is still going strong. Rotation speed could be better.</li>
            <li> Nice tool for home facials. Good priced too. I plan to purchase additional attachments for the skin cleaning system e.g. the exfoliating pad.</li>
            <li> I love this for pore cleaning. It&#x27;s one of the best investments I ever made. It&#x27;s easy to use and not too harsh on sensitive skin. I use it once a week, but when I first received it I used it every day.  It really exfoliates the skin. I have another device for exfoliation but it was too many bristles on my sensitive skin.  The Olay Pro-x is perfect for sensitive skin. It was also a great price.</li>
            <li> Always wanted one of these brushes, but they were always so expensive.  I thought it was such a deal&lt;br /&gt;on amazon.  Use it everyday and sure takes all the make up off nicely.  Love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I looooove this way much better than calrasonic &amp; clinique</li>
            <li> Really cleans the pores of your skin.  Feels great.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants clean skin.  Tthe circular motion of the brush increases and improves blood circulation in your face.  Love the on-time delvery</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted something similar, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the ridiculous amount that others like this cost. After using this for over a year, I have noticed a difference in my skin - it is much softer. The replacement brushes aren&#x27;t too pricey, and they last about 3 months each. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It works just the way I expected it too.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job just fine, may get another one as a gift.</li>
            <li> It works well for removing makeup using the correct face cleaner. It comes with a cleaner in a tube that works great.</li>
            <li> Loved adding this to my nightly routine, only thing I wish is that it came within additional heads or the bristles were slightly rougher but for the price, it makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for quite some time now.  It works well and was able to locate the refill brushes at Wal Mart.</li>
            <li> I like this it feels good on my face, don&#x27;t like where batterey is located but for the price it seemed too work pretty well only used one time.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this little treat.  My face is squeaky clean, I can do it in the shower and just let the water flow and rinse my face.  It&#x27;s soft and gentle also and does the motion for you.  Just slowly guide it over your face.  It comes with a small tube of cleanser and batteries.</li>
            <li> Has made quite a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this. I can&#x27;t go a day without using this or my face doesn&#x27;t feel completely clean.</li>
            <li> Not the quality I was expecting. It tiny and isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go cheap! Just buy the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I love it it makes your face feel rejuvenated stimulated so soft and clean love it love it love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my teen for Christmas. So far it&#x27;s holding up, works well and no complaints</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so I bought this, really makes my skin feel cleaner. It&#x27;s really small but a great price compared to other ones.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s hard to say whether it&#x27;s this product, or the fact that it makes me cleanse daily by being there that has helped my skin, but it&#x27;s definitely been better as of late!</li>
            <li> It gets makeup off even after i have used makeup remover. Smooths dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser brush at a great price. It&#x27;s small and also water resistant which allows it to be used in the shower without any problems. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks now and I&#x27;ve seen great results. My face is much better compared to not using a cleanser brush. It does a great job at cleansing and I recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap and high quality brush.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gold box deal, so the price is a factor in the rating.  For the normal price, I&#x27;d rate it lower just because it is overpriced generally for a little spinning bristle device that must be incredibly cheap to manufacturer.  Perhaps I&#x27;m jealous, however, because when I was a kid I &amp;#34;invented&amp;#34; this thing, wanting to duplicate my dad&#x27;s car washing device for faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans skin well and works fine with any soap.  Both kids share it, despite one being a germaphobe.  He bought the &amp;#34;it self cleans&amp;#34; argument.</li>
            <li> Love the product and price</li>
            <li> Great for removing dead skin off of your face and also removes some impurities that I have. I use this with a dermatologist roller thing and some Benzo Peroxide and it seems to get rid of my acne, in just a few uses</li>
            <li> I had the same problem as many reviews... getting the battery cover off was an exercise.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small and very compact which I appreciate. It&#x27;s really waterproof and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sold that it&#x27;s cleaning my face as well as it claims because I still see marks on the cotton wool when I use my toner.&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I used it at high speed I got a cystic type acne on my upper lip/under nose area which has never happened before and my skin felt really dry. I must be getting used to it because that hasn&#x27;t happened since.&lt;br /&gt;I have started developing tiny bumps on my chin and along my jaw line but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the pro-x or a new hair product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X hand-held tool is awesome.  I have wanted to give one of these gadgets a try for some time, but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money.  This is the ideal alternative - inexpensive, efficient, and effective!  I love how clean my face feels after using this at night.  It makes you rethink regular old soap and water!  I have had considerably less breakouts since using this and to me, that is priceless.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone who is just starting out cleansing their face..It&#x27;s very gentle on your face and it makes me feel refreshed by deep cleansing my face each night before bed...</li>
            <li> This is very gentle on your face and cleans it very well. It is very easy to use.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed by the price cut after i bought it..so not happy..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product i feel is even worth less that 15$, if i talk about the cheep plastic quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years at the other brands that cost $200+. My best friend received this as a gift last year and raved about it. I finally decided to give it a try as it is within my budget. I have dry, sensitive skin and also have mild rosacea. I use this with my Climiwue redness solutions cleanser. I immediately noticed my skin felt so smooth. I use the low setting on my cheeks and they are the most sensitive and the higher setting on my forehead, nose and chin. Over the past few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed the my skin is not a flaky for dryness as it has been and my skin tone looks better. It does not irritate my sensitive skin. I wish I would have bought this sooner.</li>
            <li> I had problem skin for about a year and I tried everything, even prescriptions from my GP. Nothing was working - or it did work but only for a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a product similar to the clarisonic as I had heard about this but it was way too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;When I came across the Olay cleanser I decided to give it a go but didn&#x27;t think it would really do much.&lt;br /&gt;I was so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference after the first use! It got so much makeup off my skin that I didn&#x27;t even know was on there and it properly cleaned and cleansed my face.&lt;br /&gt;It soon became clear that the reason for my bad skin was that I hadn&#x27;t been removing my makeup completely at the end of day. However, I didn&#x27;t know this until I used to Olay cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every night without fail and I have recommended to so many of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;After using this for around 2 months (once or twice a day), I have noticed such a difference in my skin, it is so much clearer and if I do have the occasional spot, this helps it to clear up overnight!&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t take before and after pictures - honestly the results are that good!</li>
            <li> I really love the spinbrush.  I have been using it daily for about a year and a half now and I notice a big difference in breakouts, especially in the Winter.  My skin has improved dramatically.  I do not care for the cleanser that comes with the set so I use with an apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> ♡♥♡♥♡♥♡ its an awesome product I really love it cleans and softens.Its worth the  money I use it everyday love it!</li>
            <li> Pros: cheap, works, can use whatever lotion&#x27;n&#x27;potion you please, battery lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: small (the brush head could be bigger), slow (does not spin as fast as I expected).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Good value for the money. It exfoliates gently and evenly. Not as big or as fast as I expected. You don&#x27;t have to use the recommended bottle of stuff, although it does work well.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  My face feels very clean after use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this cleansing system. It makes my face so soft and glowing. It&#x27;s the perfect way to clean my face before putting on my makeup. I just love it. I also like the product that comes with it for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I got the Pro-X because I am too cheap to buy a Clarisonic. Having never used a Clarisonic, I can&#x27;t say how they compare, but I like the Pro-X. It gets my face cleaner than  just face soap and a washcloth, which is evidenced by the relative lack of make up that comes off my face onto the cotton ball I use to put on another facial product after the shower. My only real complaints about this are finding replacement heads at a reasonable cost and that they don&#x27;t give you more of the face wash.</li>
            <li> Have this a month now and i must admit i am quite impressed. My skin feels cleaner and softer and my blackheads dont seem as noticeable. I havent tried the clarisonic  so couldnt compare these, however if you&#x27;re looking for something similar on a budget then i would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Meh. Not sure it does anything a washcloth wouldn&#x27;t. Save your money, or invest in a sonic face cleaning device.</li>
            <li> I have had blackheads on my nose for the last 8 years since high school that I have tried everything with. I had gone to a dermatologist and all they ever recommend is Retin-A, a mild wash,  and to come in regularly to have them professionally removed which is by no means comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister and mom both have Clarisonics and recommended I try one. I looked and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay 5 times as much for a vibrating face brush. It seems to be a slightly more aggressive and thorough brushing but in my honest opinion, it is way overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has helped me soooooo much with controlling my blackheads. It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of them and I think age/genetics are the only thing that will ever rid me of them. I have an oily T-Zone and when my face starts getting oily they start to slowly come back. By the end of a 10 hour day I can see them slightly starting back up again. Go at it with the brush at the end of the day and I&#x27;m all clear again. It seriously has changed my face and I wish I had tried this sooner.</li>
            <li> Not powerful at all. The faster speed should be the lowest speed. Would be nice if bristles oscillated so I would not have to do so much work.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS MACHINE FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW... IT WAS A GIFT SO I HAD TO TRY IT. I THOUGHT ITS GOING TO BE TO ROUGH FOR MY SKIN....LITTLE TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS NOT. MY SKIN IS COMBINATION AND SENSITIVE WITH AN OCCASIONAL BREAKOUT....I USE IT EVERYOTHER DAY WITH THE RECOMMENDED SCRUB AND IT HAS CLEARED UP MY SKIN AND EVEN THE SMALL ROSACEA SPOT IS IMPROVING. ON THE DAYS I DONT USE THE SCRUB I USE CERAVE CLEANSER WITH THE PRO X MACHINE AND I ALWAYS USE A MILD LOTION AFTERWARDS LIKE CERAVE.... I HAVE TRIED COUNTLESS PRODUCTS THROUGH THE YEARS AND THIS COMBINATION REALLY HELPS!BONUS... ITS AFFORDABLE!!!!!!!!!!!HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE THATS GOING THROUGH WHAT I WENT THROUGH TRYING IN DESPERATION TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS!!!!!</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed b/c everyone has been hooting and hollering about what a great buy this is.  It is slow, even on high speed and brushes are too soft to get much done.  The only time it is useful is if I use an actual salt scrub with it (not the wimpy scrub it comes with).  I like Trader Joe&#x27;s lavender salt scrub.</li>
            <li> This product does worth its price. The brush head feels so soft and works well on my face. And my face did feel smoother and cleaner after using this product.</li>
            <li> I use this cleansing brush everyday! I love it. The facial cleanser it came with is rather harsh with the brush so I substituted it for Aveeno&#x27;s cream based facial cleanser and it leaves my face so clear and radiant!</li>
            <li> This is much better than shelling out $200 for a Clairisonic.  Honestly, if you&#x27;re considering the name brand, you may as well just buy this to give it a try and make sure you want to invest that much.  I&#x27;m not trying to tell you how to spend your money but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d do.</li>
            <li> It cleans the face very good but sometimes when i  use it i get pimples!So i try no to use it to all my face!</li>
            <li> I have oily combination skin and I have been using this on an almost-daily basis for almost a month now. It does make my face feel extra-clean and soft, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my clogged pores or minor breakouts. I will keep using it, as it seems to clean deeper than just fingers, but it isn&#x27;t as good as I hoped. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t pay full retail price for this. I really don&#x27;t know how it compares with a Clarisonic though I would be interested in finding out, but after my disappointing results with this I don&#x27;t plan on forking out over 150 dollars any time soon without knowing that it will work.</li>
            <li> Love this brush so much! It&#x27;s compact, ergonomic and the brush cleans my skin very well without hurting.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great purchase.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than expected.  I purchased one for my teenage daughter and myself and we both use it several times a week.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the bristles would be too hard, but they&#x27;re soft and this does a good job at exfoliating. I still use my exfoliator stuff because it feels great and I tend to get very dry skin, but this works well, especially with the olay face wash.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to my hand,i packed it off to my mum in the town next to my city junst now。</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do much to my skin but to my boyfriends. I am more sensitive so I feel like I got outbreaks of it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all!  It was so slow and I had to keep hitting it to speed it up, it did nothing for me!</li>
            <li> I use this in my face regime, of late I have been using it more often and I like it, I never used another version like the Clarosonic so I cannot compare,  the only thing is I would of liked the brush bristles to be a bit softer as I believe that the face skin is very delicate, but once you use a light hand your good to go. i will keep this as a staple tool in my facial regime</li>
            <li> I wish that this device would have more than one speed, which is very slow. You can tell it cost less than the Clarisonic and the cheap design follows .......you get what you pay for.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, because I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s that effective. When it breaks or if I throw it away; I won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
            <li> It made my acne better the first time i used it</li>
            <li> I really like this Olay Cleansing Brush ... so great to have cleaner, smoother feeling skin!</li>
            <li> This product is doing it&#x27;s job so far. My only con is I wish the brush was a little wider.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you see. Works great. I&#x27;ve had it about a year though, and I need a new one, I have to hold the button down to keep it turned down.</li>
            <li> Great facial brush that&#x27;s so gentle you can use it everyday. It really leaves my skin feeling smoother after using.</li>
            <li> The Pro-X does a nice cleansing job at a good speed you don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable. The bristles are soft but deceiving in that they do the job. At first I thought them too soft, but the effect is less redness on my skin and a polished look that looks like I had a facial at the spa. Very nice product, easy to use. The only negative was trying to get the bottom off to put new batteries in. Otherwise, I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it nightly. My face is so smooth &amp; I rarely have any breakouts.  Most people think I&#x27;m 10 years younger than I am.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I got it. But I used it in the shower and it stopped working. Would recommend, just wouldn&#x27;t buy again because of the price.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once and my skin feels great! It really does scrub off all the gunk on your face and the cleanser that comes with it is pretty effective. My face feels softer and more clean! I&#x27;m very impressed with this product and I totally recommend it. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Good but cheaper at cvs</li>
            <li> i got this few days back. I feel there could be more additional accessories would be great deal. not bad in this price range.</li>
            <li> I had my doubt s but I am going to be a loyal user</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference using this product. My skin remained the same! Will not order again!</li>
            <li> This products leaves your skin feeling clean without damaging it. I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  The rotating brush was so gentle that I felt like I was massaging dirt and makeup into my face instead of scrubbing it off.  I actually ended up breaking out after 2 days of use.  Maybe I should have washed my face first and then used this after for skin refining?  Regardless, just taking a regular washcloth and scrubbing my face with any old cleanser works better than this for cleaning AND exfoliating in one step.  After 2 weeks of really trying to like it, I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite some time.  It does a better job than using hands.  Two different speeds.  I use it with a variety of products.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Leaves my face feeling clean! Got a great deal too!:)</li>
            <li> after seen so many comments and reviews about this thing, i finally decided to get and try it see what&#x27;s so magical about this. overall, i am not sure if helped with my skin or not....i only use it once a week. it feels nice when i used the brush to clean my face though</li>
            <li> This unit was affordable and effective. It scrubs my pores clean and my face is nice and smooth. Once you run out of their cleanser you can use any that you like. I love the motorized brush!</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel so clean...Without feeling like it took off my first layer of skin. I&#x27;m in the beauty business and I find this does a great job on your skin. Some of the other more powerful units out there are just to rough on skin that is 40+ years&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a gentle scrubbing deep cleaning appliance I could use frequently and this is it....Love it!</li>
            <li> Does a decent job. I think i need to find a better goo to go with it. The sample they sent cruds up the brush and doesn&#x27;t work very well to clear pores. I have okay luck with using nutregena body clear with it. I am using it to try and clear up black heads.</li>
            <li> Love this. Use it every single day. Makes my skin smoother and less breakouts.</li>
            <li> A big esperience!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Gently with my skin, deep cleans, removes any dirt, frees the pores, stimulates circulation!&lt;br /&gt;All in one!!!</li>
            <li> Does a good job cleaning my face with a minimum of effort from me.  The attachments and face wash make this a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Works well, just didn&#x27;t use it too much! My grandkids love to use it to clean other parts of the body during play so that&#x27;s ok with me, too! It&#x27;s very sturdy and is still working!</li>
            <li> Not bad ,I thought it was a good price, but while I was at the store i found the same one with a cheaper price ,,,,,,</li>
            <li> Wife used this product, and thought it was great.  Exfoliates her skin and removes makeup with a few minutes of use.  There is two speed setting with a simple on-off switch.  It is a self contained unit and is fairly water-proof.  Can be used in the shower and is easy to operate.  The cleansing soap that comes with it is small, and I would recommend buying an additional tube of the soap separately.</li>
            <li> It is my first facial brush. Works perfectly for me and I have a mixed skin (oily T-zone and dry cheeks). I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> absolutlate 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love this item very much, i only use at night,  it&#x27;s awsome. my skin is so clean and bright after use this.</li>
            <li> Nothing else to base it on, I am quite happy with it especially for the price.  Will I &amp;#34;graduate&amp;#34; to another? Possibly, but not in any hurry.</li>
            <li> Works well, included a trial size face scrub u apply , i&#x27;ve been using loreal face scrub applied to the brush after,  offers 2 speeds  low and medium-low  its gently and soft, batteries have been good so far, i think i&#x27;ve had it for a month  and used it almost daily on face, pair this with a fog free mirror in shower for best use.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I&#x27;d hoped.  It works okay, I&#x27;m keeping it, but it&#x27;s just little bit too soft to really do much exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and helped me clear my skin. I went to get a facial and she said my acne was not that bad. She showed me pictured of stage 1 and she said if I got one of these brushes, I should be fine. Within 1 week my face really started clearing up. Just use the right moisterizer and sunscreen and you should be good.</li>
            <li> Did not do as well of a job as I thought it would. It feels more scratchy than anything and after using it my skin doesn&#x27;t feel smooth like they say. My skin got softer using a mild scrubbing face wash and my hands.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and soft. Just gentle enough and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I like using it with my normal skin care products as well as the Olay wash it comes with. I would for sure recommend this.</li>
            <li> I like to use sturdier brushes, even on my back.  This is a bit too soft.  I&#x27;m using it anyway and I like the tube of cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> I love this product. After reading the reviews and some articles comparing this to the Mia Clarisonic, I am happy I purchased this much less expensive but comparative option. I use it about 5x/week in the shower. It leaves my skin so soft and takes care of any dryness without being too abrasive. I bought this for my mom and mother-in-law for Mother&#x27;s Day and have suggested it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does. Pricing is good and the added $3 coupon is a bonus. Must Buy!</li>
            <li> All I can say is that my daughter purchased a clarasonic and I purchased this.  There Is NO difference in how well it cleans or exfoleates. NONE!  My face is so much softer, way softer, and the hormonal break outs disappeared.  I love my Olay Pro...</li>
            <li> I am used to washing my face with an exfoliating sponge for face and cleaner. The bristles on this head are super soft. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s doing anything positive or negative to my skin. Almost useless? Not sure how this has so many high reviews.</li>
            <li> I have owned this system for one year. I use it every other day and love it. I will not be without it again. My skin feels refreshed, clean and smooth after using it. It&#x27;s a rotating brush, not a &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; brush but I still feel I get a good exfoliation with it. I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no working. I just bought it less than one moth. It&#x27;s broken, I didn&#x27;t  do anyting about it except using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Love it.  No complaints about it, was cheaper than what it is at the store when I bought it. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works fine. As advertised. Need to order more cleanser, but I&#x27;m sure I could use my regular with it. Seems to clean quite well.</li>
            <li> Just started using this. So far I would recommend this product! Great product for a lot less money than other expensive products</li>
            <li> I recommend this cleansing to anyone who can&#x27;t afford the more pricier brands. It works great and leaves my skin so soft and dewy looking. It comes with a little face wash too that I like. I don&#x27;t have any complaints about this product except that it was a little difficult to open the place where the batteries go. But it&#x27;s for good reason, because I keep this in the shower and it&#x27;s still running great. I have even dropped it a few time and it remains the same. It comes with batteries and they last a long time. I got it for a great price on here too. Thanks amazon! Love it!</li>
            <li> WOW! I love the clean feeling and how soft the skin feels afterwards. The system doesn&#x27;t rotate as fast as I expected and the brush is quite soft, but it really does clean wonderfully and even after a long day you can still feel a clean, soft skin. It&#x27;s like a mini-facial for home. Definitely worth the money and I wish it came with different attachments (a little harder brush for spot-cleaning?)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a basis of comparison (clarisonic) but this does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels softer and I feel that the skincare products I use are more effective.</li>
            <li> Never thought something so simple and cheap would work so well on my face! I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and have noticed a HUGE difference in my pores and the texture of my face. Its so smooth now and my pores went from huge to almost invisible. My breakouts are pretty much non existent now and my skin tone has evened out. I love this product. Buying one for my mom as a gift because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Had several compliments since using this too.  I&#x27;m very picky about the products I use, so I use my own facewash.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Cleans my skin properly! Much better than using hands. I use it almost everyday to ensure my skin is cleared before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> I love this little Machine it makes my skin so smooth. I feel it is worth every cent I paid not that it was that much but well worth what I paid and then some.</li>
            <li> Both items are great. Makes skin smooth. Don&#x27;t need to use it daily. Helps clean out pores. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have complex skin which can be both dry and oily at the same time. While I&#x27;ve never really been one to spend a lot of time on a skincare regimen, as I get older, and as winter turns my skin drier, I am working on trying to resolve some issues with my skin. I am totally in love with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System because it has really brought some balance to my complexion without adding any noticeable time to my morning or evening routine. The Pro-X cleanser is very gentle, but it works so well with the brush to provide good exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use, I could see improvement in my complexion, especially across my forehead, where my face is usually quite oily. Instead of looking greasy, my face almost seems to have a matte complexion (not the best explanation, but the most accurate I can think of at the moment). After a couple of weeks, I continue to see improvement in my complexion, and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts at all.</li>
            <li> As always, Amazon Prime rules! Had it in a day. I absolutely love this thing. I feel like it makes my face so much brighter &amp; smoother.</li>
            <li> FACE IS MUCH CLEARER SINCE I STARTED USING THIS. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. NOTHING MUCH ELSE TO SAY EXCEPT IF YOU&#x27;RE THINKING ABOUT IT, BUY IT..</li>
            <li> After seeing a similar product on QVC, I purchased this.  It does a nice job removing make-up but that&#x27;s about it.  I don&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s regenerating my skin or giving me a &amp;#34;youthful glow&amp;#34; that similar products claim to do.  It does keep my washcloth clean but instead of using that to remove my make-up, I use this.</li>
            <li> I cannot compare it to other competitors, but this works just as it should for me. It deeps cleans, gets all of the oil and makeup out of my pores and exfoliates. I also like the cleanser it that came with this, but I will continue to use my Philosophy face washes in conjunction with this to keeps my skin healthy and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this in my arsenal and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this machine with no expectations &amp; it surpass my expectations! My blackheads are a lot lesser on my nose &amp; the whiteheads on my chin is also lesser. With the kind of price, it is doing its job very well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a massager for your face. I tried to use it with the cleanser and regular soap. Both of them work fine and did a job to clean my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like having a feeble-handed 3 year old child, suffering from muscle atrophy, aimlessly scrubbing your face with a soft toothbrush.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Save up for a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> You can use this product with soap or any type of scrub and it cleans your face thoroughly. Although it didn&#x27;t shrink my pores, it does clean my face which is what I needed it for, since I workout a lot and hang around outside and my face gets oily, sweaty and dirty.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleansing brush. It is so useful at getting rid of all the heavy makeup that I wear. The bristles are gentle and feel as if they are massaging my face.&lt;br /&gt;Since I often do facial peels, the brush helps me to exfoliate all the remaining peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a handy tool, and everyone needs to have one!</li>
            <li> I decided to go with the less expensive facial cleanser brush to see if I liked it -- which I do.  I really see no reason to buy the $100+ one.  This one is very easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> I am not one to fuss with facial products, however the Olay Pro-X has helped me change my ways.  Love the brush is easily remove able for cleaning.  Easy to use in the shower.  I now fully enjoy using this product nightly.</li>
            <li> Shipment was great, very good price and work so awesomely love it</li>
            <li> Does what it says but is still rough on sensitive skin.  I might use it once every now and then, but definitely not every day.  I agree with other comments that the cleanser that comes with it is much too rough for any skin type.</li>
            <li> Works really well. I generally use it on the lower setting. I feel as if my face is more squeaky clean but I try not to use it everyday because it tends to over-exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a little dissapointed with the brushes because they are kind of soft. If used with a decent scrub it does the job, but with just regular soap, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to not use exfoliaters with tiny plastic micro beads, these are very bad for the environment.</li>
            <li> Underpowered, cannot clean thoroughly</li>
            <li> Love this thing! Was thinking about the Clarisonic, but a friend who has used both suggested I try this first. Such great advice, so I&#x27;m telling you too!! Just over $20 and my face has never looked better! Sure it doesn&#x27;t time the scrubbing for you and might not get quite as deep, but for the price and it being such a close second to the $200 version...everyone should try this first!!</li>
            <li> I had a higher-end one that worked great before but it conked out after a year. This one is useless comparatively.  It does not have the same power nor does it feel any better after than washing with your hands.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. It makes you feel refreshed. I use it morning and night. Love you can clean the brush easily.</li>
            <li> Had problems with ingrown hairs for years---this really helped clear up my face and quickly. Been using for about 6 mo now--ill still get a few zits but nothing like the giant, impacted ones caused by the ingrowns before. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love it , it removes all the dirt and left over make up on my face  it feels amazing !</li>
            <li> It is good. I am feeling the blackheads around my nose is decreasing. I hope they will disappear in the future.</li>
            <li> I really feel like it does the job well.  I use it about 2 or three times a week but I feel like over time it will help with my skin issues</li>
            <li> Love using this brush for almost a year.  Really seems to keep my skin much cleaner and clearer.  I over 50 and have oily skin with wrinkles and I think my skin has improved using the brush.  I don&#x27;t use the face wash that came with the brush.  I use the sensitive Olay cleanser and success so far.  My daughter&#x27;s have the Clarisonic Mia, and we believe this brush is almost as good.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t powerful enough for my skin type, but would be excellent for very sensitive skin.  The exfoliating cream is very fine grained and I couldn&#x27;t see any real cleaning or refining after many uses.  It might work for others, but not me.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  It&#x27;s a wonderful cleansing brush. Thank You so very much for making it available and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for months.  It is a great product, feel like my face is very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy product. It makes you feel that you have received a facial from a spa. It is very enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this 4 stars and not 5 as it didn&#x27;t come with any instructions stating how much application should be applied to the brush or face, setup, etc. Also while I understand that results may vary from person to person, I havn&#x27;t really noticed a major difference just yet... Could be my skin is pretty fair still, not sure.</li>
            <li> It looks like an affordable alternative to the Clarisonic. However, the Bristles are not firm enough for a deep clean. I would splurge on the Clarisonic instead.</li>
            <li> Just got it in the mail today and so far I love it! I paid $18.99 and in my opinion I&#x27;d pay way more for something with this good in quality, it&#x27;s easy to use and perfect size!</li>
            <li> I just came to the realization that all my life my face has been dirty (literally) I struggled with acne all my life; I&#x27;ve used countless products both over-the-counter and prescription and still had little success with either. I was only cleansing the surface of my skin and not deep down into the pores; since using this system my acne has cleared up drastically and my pores are clear after about 3 use. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much money you spend on a facial cleanser it won&#x27;t work effectively unless you have a cleansing system and for 1/3 the price of a clearosonic it&#x27;s really worth a try. Shipping was fast and I am very pleased with this product; acne or no acne if you want super clean fresh skin then this is worth wild and it&#x27;s starting to diminish my blemishes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  After only using this for a week, my skin began to really improve.  I love how clean my face feels every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I got this Olay Pro-X Advanced cleansing System she loves it , its works very well and the Olay soup it amazing</li>
            <li> What can I say. Great product and when used with Olay cleansing cream, even better. The price is great too because I&#x27;ve seen similar products for over $100, so I say great buy, great product, can&#x27;t go wrong. It does help too. I&#x27;m 45 yrs old, hate to admit it too, and I believe this is helping my skin.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to buy a cleansing brush after reading lots of reviews online and hearing about them from friends. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $200+ on my first brush, since I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work for me so I spent a long time looking for an affordable option with largely positive reviews. The brush spins, it doesn&#x27;t vibrate like other brushes. There are two speeds, high and low, but I typically use the high speed setting. It&#x27;s waterproof so I&#x27;m able to use it in the shower. After two weeks of use, my skin is looking and feeling fantastic. I&#x27;d give it five stars, but for the first week of use, it seemed like it was making my skin worse! I started getting lots of whiteheads and had a few red acne bumps, but I kept using it and the zits went away and my skin is much clearer now. I think it was bringing up some of the nasty old dirt my face was harboring, despite me washing my face twice daily. So I took off one star, only because my skin looked crazy for the first week of use. I recommend using it every other day and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing brush. I still break out because my acne is stress related, but the brush helps get rid of my breakouts so much faster. My skin feels amazing after using it. I use it 1-2 times a day. My only suggestion is make more than 2 variable speed types.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve already gone through my third one in about a year and a half. I like that there are settings for different speeds. However, I bought myself just the regular CVS brand facial brush, and there are more speeds on it than this one. Also, the Olay brush, I noticed, gets water inside of it very easily. I try not getting it wet when washing my face in the sink, and always dry it off if even a tiny drop of water lands on it (by inside, I&#x27;m referring to where the battery goes.. It&#x27;s literally brown/black-corroded). With my CVS brand brush, I actually can use it in the shower and it hasn&#x27;t even shown 1 sign of corrosion. I still clean it out just to make sure.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I use this brush every day! It is perfect! I have sensitive and oily skin all at once, but this rotating brush doesnt irritate my skin at all! If this one breaks, i&#x27;ll definitely be buying another one! and it&#x27;s WAY affordable!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;Got it for my little one and she loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a great price for a great product!...It was delivered in great time...especially since it was during Christmas!  Having a coupon for it also helped on the pricing!</li>
            <li> I already had my doubts when the site or the packaging does not mention this product uses sonic.  I bought Prosonic from groupon for $60 previously and liked it.  After 18 months, my Prosonic broke and it was time to search for another face cleansing brush.  Seeing the glowing reviews and for only $20 I gave this a try.  Here are what I think the pros and cons of this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* smaller brush, easier to maneuver&lt;br /&gt;* the bristle seems more gentle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* the brush only turns round and round and does not vibrate via sonic.  I think it only tucks my skin while it turns and I don&#x27;t think it cleans as well as the other brushes that uses sonic tech.  I think of these face brushes as giant sonic toothbrushes with softer bristles: You use the sonic toothbrushes because it cleans the plague off your teeth better than regular brushes!  Same idea, if it doesn&#x27;t vibrate, I don&#x27;t think it cleans my skin and pores as well.&lt;br /&gt;* not rechargeable and no base.  This is not too bad as you can use rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think you get what you paid for.  Even this is so much cheaper, I generally do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Its great; just try to keep it out of as much water as possible, when you&#x27;re done, dry it off, will last longer.</li>
            <li> It works well. I am peeling due to some prescribed acne medication. This brush is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt my face and is gentle on my skin. I really like it and highly recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;It also cleaned a few blackheads I had so bonus there!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change on my complexion.Also the brush barely does anything.I&#x27;ve use this product before by other co.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you save your $</li>
            <li> Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;But the product is very fragile.&lt;br /&gt;Nice brand, good quality.&lt;br /&gt;The same as the product announced on TV</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. I use it 2-3 times a week while in the shower with the sample size Olay exfoliating cleaner that came with it. My skin can be very sensitive so I only use for the recommended 50-60 secs to avoid over-scrubbing my face. It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Works great, helps smooth skin and exfoliate skin!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction of blackheads, but skin is softer.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve not used any other, I have  really liked using this Cleansing System for the last month, especially using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> The cleansing brush operates as expected and (after limited use at this time) I expect good results.  The cleanser, however, must have been old or in some way tainted.  I put it on my face and was surprised immediately by the foul odor (all over my face!).  I had to wash it off right away, then start over with a cleanser of my own.  A shame.</li>
            <li> Has helped to tame my oily/acne prone skin. I just use the brush, and since I have added it to my regimen my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Works great! Gentle enough for every day use and still leaves skin feeling cleaned and refreshed! I plan to buy one for my mom!</li>
            <li> I haven tried the more expensive brand but I would like to think that the Olay Pro-X do the same job just as well. I was quite surprised how well it worked. After I was done w the brush and rinsing off whatever&#x27;s left on my face, it did feel smoother than before. The difference was significant enough for the touch of my fingers to notice.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the quality and performance of this product. Brush head does not secure on properly. Overall, I much preferred the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> I bought it for a test and I was really surprised by its efficiency&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it, without doubt!</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least five of these.  I used this for six months before switching to the aria.  A simple way to improve your skincare routine.</li>
            <li> After 61 years of daily cleansing with with a cloth, I never realized that my face was never really clean until I used this brush. I no longer have enlarged, clogged pores and best of all, I look younger because my skin is better able to absorb all the anti-aging products I use.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Cleans very well.  Requires very little cleanser to be effective.  Would definitely recommend.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is b/c I would like a bit more power in the spin brush- that&#x27;s why I will be ordering the microdermabrasion model which has 3 speeds.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife (at her suggestion) a year and a half ago.  I asked her recently if she still uses it at all.  She told me that she can&#x27;t imagine going a day without it.  She loves it!  She has asked me to change batteries on it only once in all that time and she has put a new head on it only once as well.  Considering the price of other products similar to this one, this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System is an effective and well built bargain!</li>
            <li> Love it&#x27;s portability! Small yet perfect! My face feels so much cleaner since I have been using this awesome product!</li>
            <li> another Olay product I love, gives your skin a silky feel like you just stepped out from a spa, I am going to order one for my daughter on her Birthday, So she will stop using mine.</li>
            <li> This product is just like Sonicare, but a lot cheaper. You can buy it most large grocery stores and sometimes at WalMart.</li>
            <li> Does the job, isn&#x27;t a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> My face is finally clean!</li>
            <li> I used this several times and like it.  Did everything as stayed.  Would recommend for first time users.  Did not have any problems with batteries so far.</li>
            <li> Is it weird that I think the bristles are TOO soft? Haha. I was hoping to use this as an exfoliator a couple times per week but I feel like it moves a bit too slowly and it isn&#x27;t getting rid of the dry skin I sometimes develop.  It isn&#x27;t bad for just cleaning your face although I would like a bit more pressure to clean my face.</li>
            <li> I was giving a spa treatment as a gift, and I had a professional use a \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; cleanser on my face.  My face was so clear, bright and soft after, I wanted to be able to do this at home.  I looked at models similar to what the spa used, but $200?  No way I can afford that.  Then I found this system, and for something under $25, this does a job almost equal to the treatment in the spa.  As I get a little more proficient at working it, I think my results will be better, just as good as my spa treatment (although the spa has wonderful tea, and the bathrobes are to die for!)  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  You won&#x27;t find anything better at a better price, and yes, you will get results like you would get at a fancy spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  A friend of mine invested in the Clarisonic.  She swears by it, but she hasn&#x27;t used the Olay product.  I tried the Clarisonic, and I can say that you will get results that are as good with the Olay as you will with Clarisonic.  I didn&#x27;t find any difference in results on my skin, but there is a BIG difference in price.  I also travel a bit, so I prefer the battery operated Olay product because it&#x27;s easier to pack and use on the go (a little tricky when you first change the batteries, but after that, you&#x27;re good to go).  The Clarisonic is a little heavier, so you can get a little rough on the skin.  The Olay is lighter, so you can control the force on your face better.  And you still get good results, so again, for the price, the Olay wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note - don&#x27;t \\&quot;grind\\&quot; it into your face.  It doesn&#x27;t make it work better, just go easily over your face and you will have the best results.  It&#x27;s meant to exfoliate the top layer(s) of your skin, so pressing down on it as you go over your face will not do any more for your skin.  I tried difference pressures, and less is more.  It&#x27;s better to use a light touch and go over your face a couple of times than to push the brush into your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also works very wellon your body too.  I use it on my legs, and I get a really smooth result.  It also helps with shaving or waxing, because the fine hairs that don&#x27;t always grow completely out get released from the skin so your waxing or shaving is more effective.  Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANOTHER UPDATE:  Best results with this product comes when you use a great cream.  Can&#x27;t stress this enough.  When you exfoliate the old skin, you need to take care of the new skin coming up.  I use the Olay cleanser because it is a really good exfoliator and works well with the pro x, but I don&#x27;t use their cream.  I get the best results with a different cream -[[ASIN:B00BD822BI Bel Essence Anti Aging Treatment - Intensive All Natural Anti-Wrinkle, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]].  I love this because it&#x27;s all natural and it has a better result than the creams I was buying at Sephora at 100+ a jar.  Just goes to show that the more expensive product isn&#x27;t necessarily the best.  The effect of this cream on my skin is incredible.  My skin is softer, smoother, and the fine lines around my eyes and lips are gone, and my skin is always hydrated.  I have dark spots on my face, and they have faded to the point where minimal make up covers them up completely.  The same for the deeper lines on my forehead and between my brows - they are shorter, not as deep and barely noticeable with a little foundation.  I also have dry spots on my face and some oily spots - this cream has evened it all out.  No more small red patches where the dry skin is, and even though the cream has oils in it, my break outs are less.  This pro really cleans my skin and exfoliates it really well too.  Then when I add the cream, my face just glows.  I feel like I have taken 10 years of living off my face after using it, and then with the Bel Essence, my skin is even softer, line free, even toned and firmer.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing thingy (what do you even call this thing?). It works so well. I started out using it twice a day but that was too much for my skin to handle so now I just use it once. I use it in the shower every single day and this product has proved itself to be as waterproof as the makers claim. Also, I&#x27;ve had this for 2ish months and haven&#x27;t had to replace the brush head or batteries yet. Also the face cleanser that they sent with the cleansing thingy is really nice. It has very fine particles so it exfoliates but isn&#x27;t too harsh. I use Neutrogena oil free acne wash daily with the brush and once or twice a week, I&#x27;ll use the face cleanser that came with the brush. I would recommend rinsing thoroughly after every use, don&#x27;t use it for too many minutes because it&#x27;ll make your face raw, and don&#x27;t use it more times daily than your skin can handle because that will also make your skin raw and when it gets raw it produces more oil which causes more acne. I would buy this a million times over because I&#x27;m so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone their skin, anyone who is looking for any type of exfoliation for their skin.</li>
            <li> This product just arrived today. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. It was everything I hoped it to be. The soft brushes cleaned my face softly, but thoroughly. Very good product.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews, I had no problem buying this item. I have dry skin and this helps remove all the dirt from my face. Plus I love that it&#x27;s waterproof so there&#x27;s no fear for water damage. My skin feels great after!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these over the years. Both of them wore out &amp; started smoking in the shower. Otherwise, I thought I liked it until I purchased a Clarisonic instead. The Clarisonic is much more gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Loving this. I wish it had different heads (like a pumice stone attachment or a big body brush attachment) I feel like I was at the spa after I use it. I can bring it in the shower with me too which is great</li>
            <li> I can see and feel a big difference after only a week so its a winner for me………..my face feels smooth and super clean</li>
            <li> I feel that for the price this is a wonderful exfoliate.  I feel that it is improving my skin tone.  I have a lot of dark spots from years of smoking.  I&#x27;m 41 and quit 5 years ago but the damage was done.  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It really helps clean my pores more on my chin and nose which is what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my face. I just listen to the skin and know if it was irritated before washing. Angling the device allows the bristles to clean more and damage less on the skin, or drying out sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make sure to use a toner and than moisturizer, whats the point of shedding the old skin off and cleaning the pores if your not going to take care of the new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works better than the neutrogena sonic wave cleaners however they are softer on your skin and only vibrates (so you can use them frequently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the device seems the same the acne-free brand when a friend let me used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important note- I thought by trying this and making sure my pores were cleaned better I would get less break outs. It didn&#x27;t turn out to be the case but my face has a natural nice glow to it where my skin is clear.</li>
            <li> every time I use it, it just hurt my face. the brush isn&#x27;t soft enough to my face. don&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;And work well&lt;br /&gt;The color is also beautiful&lt;br /&gt;My sister and I love it&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this product (even on lowest setting) feels to rough. It also leaves my skin feeling very dry, rather than very clean and as a result I need moisturizer now more than ever. I will only use this product once a week if that. Overall I think I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This product works great. However, my system did not come with a cleanser although the product is advertised with a cleanser. I dont know what is the issue. Did they forget to put the cleanser in the package? Need some answers or refund.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  My face never felt so clean. My pores were completely clear every time I used it! I felt wonderful.  I would still be using it if I weren&#x27;t to lazy to buy more of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so clean!  I use it in the shower all the time, with the scrubber that came with it or with face soap.</li>
            <li> Olay has out done themselves again....Why spend ridiculous ammount&#x27;s of money when you have Olay&lt;br /&gt;gentle cleansing and when your done hydrate your face with mositurizer of your choice</li>
            <li> This product may work for some but not for me I used it everyday for 2 months with no results</li>
            <li> This system came at a great price, much less then even at Wal-Mart and I love the results on my face.</li>
            <li> I liked this when I first bought it, but got lazy and didn&#x27;t use it for a long time. When I turned it on to start using it again, it was still working. Decided to change the batteries, it was almost impossible to get the cover off. When I did eventually get it off, it was so difficult to pull the batteries out,  they were so tightly wedged in, I was tempted to throw it in the trash. but I managed in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the two AA batteries with new ones. It didn&#x27;t work, so I tried another set of batteries, they didn&#x27;t work either. I then threw it in the trash. Waste of money, wish I&#x27;d never seen it.</li>
            <li> the quality is really good and its convenient. i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;it can wash my face really clean!!now i use it every day</li>
            <li> This works perfectly. It isn&#x27;t expensive, the brush is soft and has two settings. Very comfortable to use! My face is so soft after washing!</li>
            <li> I feel stupid for buying this. Use a washcloth. It&#x27;s just as good and probably better. The disc is so soft you don&#x27;t get a good scrub.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Pro-X Cleansing System. I use this about every 2-3 days, and my face looks great! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months now. The tube of cleanser it came with lasted me a while, but after I emptied that I&#x27;ve been using other exfoliating cleanser brands. The latest one I&#x27;ve used is St. Ives Gentle Apricot Scrub. If you do decide to buy another cleanser brand, try to find one that isn&#x27;t too harsh. The Olay Pro-X cleanser has some exfoliating beads, but not too much since the system does some exfoliating as well. I also like the two speeds. I started off with the low speed the first few weeks to get used to it, then I switched to the fast speed. My face never hurt afterward. I&#x27;m still using the batteries that came in the box, and they don&#x27;t seem like they will die anytime soon. Overall, a great buy! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I purchased this item. I saw comments where people believed the brush was too rough on their face - not true at all! For someone like me with black heads and combination skin, this product worked wonders. I even have a nose piercing and it did not bother it or cause any swelling to that area. The cleanser that is included is also an exfoliating cream, and if that is too much exfoliation, just use a regular facewash. I keep it in the shower too and it stays perfectly clean and is water tight. Happy customer :)</li>
            <li> Everyone raves about their Clarisonics, but I just couldn&#x27;t justify the high price tag for essentially what is just a motorized brush. Granted it has its perks, but nonetheless, too pricey. I heard some great reviews of the Olay cleaning system, and decided to invest in one - knowing that if it didn&#x27;t work, I wasn&#x27;t out $200. Luckily, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about that! I would go as far as saying this works as good as the more expensive alternatives. I tried a friend&#x27;s Clarisonic (with a new brush head, of course), so I&#x27;m able to make the comparison. The Olay brush was just as effective, and less than a quarter of the price! It&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain, is gentle yet tough on makeup and cleans pores like nothing else. Plus, replacement brush heads aren&#x27;t expensive, so you don&#x27;t have to stretch out the life of the brush just to be able to afford to replace it. Overall, an unexpectedly great product!</li>
            <li> I love it! works really well so far...my face feels so clean and healthy after each use. Gentle enough to use twice a day!</li>
            <li> The handheld cleansing system works great.  I feel like it gets my skin really clean without causing irritation.  I have sensitive combination skin and it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me.  The size is perfect for a handheld device and it is easier to clean around your nose with it.  I tried the cleanser that came with it and was less impressed.  It was fine, but nothing I would buy again.  I didn&#x27;t feel like the cleanser exfoliated enough.  I really love the device and use it everyday with another cleanser.  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> A gift for my wife who wanted this after seeing an ad and talking with a friend! She loves the cleansing and exfoliating quality if this product!</li>
            <li> I was completely amazed at how much of a difference I saw in just a few days. My 45 year old skin is so soft now! I really didn&#x27;t expect to see such a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product to use on a daily base. I will purchase one for my daughter in the near future.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over a month and it truly does open and clean my pores better than hands alone.</li>
            <li> Product is as effective as the other high price systems would definitely recommend to a friend it&#x27;s a must buy if your looking for a great  face cleaning system</li>
            <li> Cleans face better than just washing it. Makes skin feel refreshed. I would recommend to anyone who is interested in purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Cheaper here than walmart.com and I love how easy it is and it makes my skin seems younger and softer. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its the cleanser that was included or the actual tool that makes my face feel &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; after use.  But I like it.  I have roscaea but its not too abrasive for my skin but I dont use it every day... but I might.  I cant tell much difference between the two speeds but it doesnt matter to me.  I was tempted to buy the expensive different brand but thought I should see if i liked using a device before putting out the cash.  I think this works fine and am not sure I would invest in a more expensive version.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. The brushes are pretty soft and good for a pre-teen with sensitive skin. But, the spinning brush comes off entirely too easily.  I thought it was just that brush, but others come off just as easily. I strongly considered returning it, but she does use it, so I kept it since it was not that expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be a nice product if they made the spinhead clamp on more securely.  It is battery operated, but would definitely benefit from a rechargeable version - even if it would be more expensive.  I recommend this for a young person, or someone with very sensitive skin.  But, I think for most people this would not clean good enough.  Even slight pressure really slows down the spinning brush, even with new batteries.  I also on the Pretika brush (see my review) , which is, in my opinion, a better product, but not for the very young just learning how to properly care for their face as it would be too abrasive. I also don&#x27;t recommend the exfoliating cream that comes with this to the younger ones either as I think it would be to harsh also.</li>
            <li> This product i haven&#x27;t try it before.  It is good,  easy to operate and very handy when you clean your face everyday use your daily xleaning product!&lt;br /&gt;You can feel your face clean and flash!!</li>
            <li> Great concept, ineffective because of the loss of power with the tiniest pressure.  If they came out with another version that did not lose power, I would be all over it for the price, but without power, it was sadly a waste of money and landfill space..</li>
            <li> The brush heads constantly fall off, no matter what kind you get. I didnt feel like it was getting my face any cleaner than my hands did. I thought it would be a cheaper but just as reliable as a clairsonic. if you are looking for a face cleaner just spend the money and go with clairsonic, i did and wish i wouldnt have wasted the money on this one first.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro x advance system is a wonderful addition, if you have some skin issues! The cleansing agent really gets in to the pores and cleans well! I used to have clogged pores, which in turn made them appear larger, when it was just gunk built up inside! The Pro cleaner is able to exfoliate and clean in between the cracks! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love that me face feels so clean after I use this. I love using this! Great way to keep a clean face and look youthful.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my granddaughter and when she opened it she screamed!  She loved it.  Glad I order it!</li>
            <li> it seems quite fun to use at first but the interest dies down after a while as it is quite rough on my facial skin. I tried using on other parts of my body but gave up as it is kinda small. like the fact that it is waterproof and have 2 speed settings. would prefer to just use my fingers to clean my face.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! You can&#x27;t go wrong fellas! I bought it for my wife for Christmas and she can&#x27;t stop talking about how clean her face feels.</li>
            <li> good product, good price, much better price that the other name brand, cleanes well use it often to keep pores clean</li>
            <li> I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of thie instrument of the cleansing system for Olay. Came d today  We have put the batteries in each way, none work, and it is extremely difficult to open to insert the batteries.  I will keep trying, but i will never purchase another one of these by Olay</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System. I also ordered one for my Mom because this works great! I used to have a Clairsonic and I love this much better plus the Clairsonic is way to expensive. I don&#x27;t see any difference in the two products. I actually think the Pro works better.</li>
            <li> She approves so therefore I approve. Much cheaper than some of the name more popular ones, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> I use other cleansers including soap with the brush, occasionally use the Olay scrub.  I never use any scrub above my eyes because the granules get in my eyes.</li>
            <li> this was on my daughter&#x27;s Christmas wish list and looks forward to using it many times.  She looks forward to using it.</li>
            <li> i have heard great things about this cleansing system - thought i would gift it to a friend - it arrived on time but the box all smashed and torn - embarassing</li>
            <li> I have had a professional microdermabrasion procedure and this at home kit is just as good. Plus you can do it in the shower making it very convenient.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Olay cleansing brush. A friend recommended it and wow it is great. I have rather dry skin and like to exfoliate a few times a week so I actually keep mine in the shower to use in the mornings.  I use it with the Olay cleanser and also with a Clinique scrub cream which is a mild exfoliator. I used to use a harsher scrub (one with the apricot ) but I find that it&#x27;s actually more efficient with a milder one. Sometimes I just use a little mild facial soap with it if I just want to clean. This really makes a difference to the smoothness of you skin and your make up really glides on smoothly after you use it. Great before an evening out. Get it, you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> I planned to buy a cleansing foam at first. I didn&#x27;t pay attention that it is a machine. But it is very nice to get rid of the dust on my face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the more expensive versions, but I can&#x27;t imagine they would work much better than this. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> My mother loves it! she uses it like almost everyday!</li>
            <li> My skin feels different and I dont have as many breakouts as I used too. Just one thing I am not so sure about it. Since it is made in China.. the cleanser that comes with it is also made in China and I am afraid to use on my skin. So I just opted for some other cleanser.</li>
            <li> I did not use the cream provided. Instead I use honey and use the brush to kinda buff the face.</li>
            <li> Love it! Super affordable for a quality product! Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this facial brush 3 months ago and have been using it once a day with a gel cleanser.  My 60+ year old skin has not looked this good in decades.  Think this soft- bristled brush has a lot to do with it.  It&#x27;s like an electric toothbrush.  Somehow it is way easier to brush longer when it feels good and soothing, is effortless, maybe even a little fun, and you see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, in my experience, almost all the products I love and rely on get discontinued, or reappear as some new, improved version - at twice the price and half the capability.  As this product has been available for &amp;#62;3 years, it is only a question of when, not if, it will disappear from the market.  Or re-emerge as a substandard replacement.  That&#x27;s why I have already ordered a second one, plus replacement brush heads, to make sure I can continue using this proven version for years to come.</li>
            <li> I  have only had it for a week but I am pleased with it.  It seems to do the job</li>
            <li> Edit( October 18, 2015)  Thought I&#x27;d give an accurate review now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few months. My face is now 95% clear! I&#x27;ve been BB cream and makeup free for a week  now since it finally cleared. it&#x27;s not perfect but let&#x27;s face it no one has perfect clear skin. this has just cleared my red spots from picking, scabs, and overall redness, it&#x27;s evened out my skin tone as well, that it looks as if I&#x27;m wearing makeup. I haven&#x27;t seen my skin this clear since I was a kid. I can go makeup free!! I&#x27;ve cut down my getting ready for work by 12 minted from being nit picky, making sure makeup is evenly spread etc.  I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for 2 months! it doesn&#x27;t stop acne it&#x27;s just made it manageable.   my routine:  morning: Wash hands in warm water mild soap, clean under nails (even short ones) rigorously with nail clipper file thing lol. wash hands one more time to get nail gunk I missed off.  Apply my routine face lotion.   Night: After I&#x27;m doing most of my eating and stuff  for the day( only reason is food particles get caught on your face even if you wipe and clean anything just from eating neatly etc, also because of dry skin, sweat, dead skin, pollutants in the air we can&#x27;t see. that gets caught in them.    1) wash hands, Turn water on HOT. Apply the exfoliant it comes with or your own. turn on high setting(your preferred speed). Spend five minutes clearing everything, Rinse brush with hot water every 1-2 minutes till complete.  2- Rinse brush thoroughly directly with hot water while on, takes 30 seconds.  3- Dab brush dry, wipe and put away brush. Turn water on warm. Rinse face with warm water.  4- Pat face dry (preferably on fairly clean towel)  5- Clean under fingernails again , wash hands. wipe dry.  6- Apply moisturizer same from morning.    Original review  (August 2015)   I haven&#x27;t been using this product all that long but I wanted share my rave review all because I got results so fast it was like day and night. I almost feel like those proactive people on TV lol!  anyways, I had great skin as a kid. then of course the teens years settle in, insecurity, stress and sensitive skin became my nightmare. If your like me and began to wear makeup to cover up breakouts only for the makeup to cause those breakouts this product may be for you. my skin got worse and worse, luckily I&#x27;m in my 20s now and hormones have settled and my sensitive skin went away. however I&#x27;m left with acne impossible to get rid of. I&#x27;ve tried everything, blackhead removers, eating better, acne cleansing systems, sacyclic acid nothing helped. didn&#x27;t change anything but I felt my face turned into a in-penetrable war zone. nothing got in or out. I wasn&#x27;t willing to give up my love of the occasional junk food and soft drinks in favour of veggies and water to keep my skin clear. I&#x27;ve done it , life sucks always worrying about food destroying my skin. I just clean it better now. food isn&#x27;t the issue. I was looking to get rid of my acne enough so wouldn&#x27;t need to wear a foundation anymore to cover my blemishes. so foundation would not cause breakouts and I could break free from the catch -22 .  This product changed that. it was my last hope. my days of wishing I could rip off my face and scrub the inside are gone. gory sounding I know. I used it same day I got the product. I bought it at my local drug store on sale though. I used my apricot scrub but I actually like the softer exfoliant it comes with. it&#x27;s optional. anyways I use it for 15-20 min a session everyday a bit excessive but I&#x27;ve got bad skin I figure I&#x27;ll spend less time once my skin gets better. I can see it pushing blackheads out I&#x27;ve got the ridiculously deep ones, and it removing dead skin cells. and my skin is softer, clearer, and absorbs moisturizing  lotion better. it would never do that before. it&#x27;s my miracle worker. and it&#x27;s only been a week. products don&#x27;t have that day and night difference for me ever. I now use a light BBcream to cover up the minor blemishes left.  my routine; 1.remove makeup with makeup removing cleanser dry face 2. add exfoliant to the brush dampen brush with warm water run along face on high setting 3. pat face dry with clean cloth</li>
            <li> Love this product. After being in debate of whether I should get the clarasonic or not I decided to try something cheaper instead. This was perfect, it cleaned amazingly and lasted months. Ive never been happier with a product.</li>
            <li> this is great for the price</li>
            <li> So many products I have received from Amazon have been great!! This facial brush is one of them.  I have blemishes even at age 62 &amp; it helps me scrub my face without irritation.  Every women should have this facial brush.  It also calmed me while the brush cleaned my face from all makeup.  Another product I enjoy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean good and I really liked it the first time i used it my face looked so radiant but I&#x27;ve been using it almost ever night for a month and not sure I see much of a difference. It does make me wash my face more often. I think the pores on my nose are clearer. It was a good price and I&#x27;ll keep using it for a deep clean.</li>
            <li> I love this new tool in my new regime. I wanted to get the clarisonic MIA2 but they were either too expensive or not in stock. This one did the job and was super affordable. It came with a creamy exfoliate cleanser sample from Olay which I will now use as part of my regime as well. The first time I used it, I definitely saw a difference. I also use it during my oil cleansing and which I had it from the beginning. It&#x27;s great for any cleanser. Just be careful if you are going to do any face peeling treatments. The flakes are hard to clean from the brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my niece and she loves it. Its helping her control her teenage acne. Very affordable compared to many other brands and work as good as expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star cause its a nice machine but it does not have that power im looking for. Well you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week, and I can already see positive changes in my skin that make this cleansing system worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I get into my review- I want to explain that even as a teenager, I have never had major acne, and I only rarely get one or two pimples as an adult, but I have a lot of blackheads on my nose and chin. I bought the expensive nose blackhead strips and even did at-home DIY remedies, and yet I still continued to have SO many blackheads. Usually, when I break out, it is one of these blackheads on my chin that has manifested itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first few days of using this, some of the blackheads formed into pimples, because the dirt was being lifted out of the pore, basically. A few of the blackheads on my cheeks became bumps too, but they went away within a couple days, because I did not pop them and just continued to use the brush. If you have more acne, you will probably go through a longer process of new breakouts caused by this brush, but in a lot of cases, it is a necessary step to getting better skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been very strict with my skin care routine. I always remove my makeup, wash, and moisturize my face at night with a wash cloth. I have also bought a lot of different cleansers- both high-end brands and drug store, trying to find the best fit for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;On Day One, i used this brush to take my makeup off, and when I woke up the next morning, I was shocked to see that my face was still as soft and clean as it had been the night before. Normally, no matter how well I cleaned my face with a wash cloth, and no matter how expensive the cleanser,  I always wake up with an oily face, so seeing myself in the mirror without any grease at all in the morning feels life-changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks more radiant, and my makeup goes on smoother. If I use it again in the morning, I can go throughout the day without worrying if I need to get an oil blotting sheet, or check in the mirror to see if my makeup has slid off my face. It is such a deep clean that I can now go throughout my day feeling more confident in my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;The blackheads on my nose are noticeably less dark in only one week. They look like the dirt is being scrubbed out of them, and I can only hope that the pores will get smaller if I continue to use this brush, since one week is not really long enough to show major results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush only has two settings- low and high. The low setting is basically worthless. There is something about the high speed that helps create suds to carry the cleaning product around your entire face. It also works better in the shower. Just take it out of the shower when you are done. Don&#x27;t leave it in there, because other people gave negative reviews saying how water got into the battery compartment. I just leave mine in a cup standing up on my vanity next to the rest of my products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olay product that you get with the brush kit is very, very small. It is convenient for traveling, but the full-size bottle is almost as expensive as the brush kit itself! I have tried dozens of products over the years, and several with this brush. The drug store cleansers I recommend using with this brush are Simple Moisturizing Cleanser and L&#x27;Oreal 360. For more high-end cleansers, I recommend Clinique face soap and Philosophy Purity Made Simple, because these cleansers alone, even with a wash cloth, did wonders for my skin, and would be even better combined with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also remember to get a good moisturizer! After exfoliating, lotions with perfume may also sting, cause redness, and possible breakouts. So I recommend anything fragrance free and natural. Target Up&amp;Up brand makes a really good Oatmeal extract lotion that is an Aveeno dupe. Burts Bees also makes great natural lotions that work well on sensitive, raw skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I do not have major skin problems, I could see my results right away, but not everyonemight. If you have a lot of problems going on with your skin that need some TLC, it may take longer. Also, if you know for a face that your skin is extremely sensitive to exfoliating, this may not be for you. You may want to start off with something more mild, like the L&#x27;Oreal 360 scrubbing tool before graduating to this type of cleaning system.might.

            <li> I love how smooth feels after washing with this brush. I love olay products.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this brush!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this brand name item.  I had previously purchased a battery-powered facial brush for one-half the price of the Olay model, and it broke within three weeks.  I replaced the broken model with this one by Olay because it was reasonably priced and received great reviews.  I preferred the stiffer bristles of the other model and felt like my face was squeaky clean and glowing after using it.  I don&#x27;t feel that way with this model.  I intend to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I purchased this last year because I didn&#x27;t want to shell out the money for the clarisonic. I have used it for over a year now and just recently purchased a clarisonic plus. WOW! There are NO words. There is a huge difference in quality to say the least. I read all these great reviews on the Olay knock off and I agree, it&#x27;s great for a $30 product, however IT DOES NOT COMPARE TO CARISONIC. If that is what your expectation is, then just spend the money in the real deal. If you&#x27;re fine with mediocre, then this is probably just fine.</li>
            <li> The brush feels rough on my face, but it does a good job cleaning.  I would not use it daily, perhaps 2-3 times a week is max.  I cannot say that it does a superb job cleaning, as makeup residues still deposit on my towels after makeup remover, face cleanser, and using this product as indicated.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> the device is so small!  the bristles are very soft and it runs slow to where it does not remove my make up all the way.  waste of money. arrived earlier than it was stated, nothing against seller.  just a poor product.  Revlon makes one that costs about the same and the bristles moved fast enough and were the texture to where it did remove all my makeup.  However, it only lasted a year before it died.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It works perfect and really cleans all the dead cells and dirt also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the slowest moving brush ever. The slow speed is pretty much useless. The fast speed does exfoliate noticeably, but it sure is slow. Especially when the batteries are starting to die...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clarisonic is definitely sturdier and much more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the price, you can get the Olay if you want something that cleaned much better than your fingertips and helps to exfoliate the surface. However, just know that it is a flimsier product, much less powerful, and slow!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this everyday because it is a little bit too time consuming, but after using it for 3-4 a week, my skin has a glow that I love. Worth the monty.</li>
            <li> This is such an inexpensive, fantastic beauty find! it is amazing how much more makeup comes off of my face with using this rather than just washing my face with my hands. have recommended to a number of my friends!</li>
            <li> I bought this and used it for about 6 months then my mother got me a Clairsonic.  WHOA.  What a difference!  Seriously, this thing is just pushing dirt around your face.  If you want a true, amazing cleansing experience, get a Clarisonic.  Your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> I love to use this brush. It gets my face really clean and smooth. It comes with a sample of the olay cream and has two speeds.</li>
            <li> Unit has two speeds, slow &amp; medium, but spins well enough to do the job.  Waterproof allows for use in the shower where I typically wash my face.  Brush head is soft and not overly abrasive.  Brush head fits onto the unit rather loosely allowing for the brush to fall off during use if not careful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I&#x27;m not really sure it does anything. Not really convinced. I try to use it consistently, but its hard when you don&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li> I have heard fabulous things about the clarisonic and knew I couldn&#x27;t justify spending over a hundred dollars on one, so I went looking...  I found the Olay pro-x and am so happy with it!  I am not a big chemical product user, so I use it with my homemade washes and scrubs and love how glowing my skin is!</li>
            <li> I have been using my Olay Pro-X Advanced for about 3-4 months now and can tell a huge difference in my skin. I use mine nightly and have fewer fine lines, glowing skin and look rejuvenated. I loved this so much, I bought it for a friend for her birthday!</li>
            <li> This little gizmo is a life changer. I don&#x27;t know how my face survived before without it. My skin cleared up within days of using it and will continue to use this gazmo for ever. I&#x27;m soooo sold.</li>
            <li> I have the ProActive brush but dropped it and broke it. :-( I bought this one to see how different it was and it felt great. It has a smaller brush size than the ProActive and can get in the corner of the nose area and feels like a great exfoliating massage. I love my ProActive brush too but this is a cheaper comparison and works great.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I can wash my face regularly, and then wash my face with this and makeup will still come off onto this brush. My face feels so clean when I use it and if I&#x27;m breaking out, I notice my skin clearing up the day after I use this.</li>
            <li> good product. it keeps my face clean</li>
            <li> i was really pleased with this and would highly recommend it to others. It exfoliated well, was comfortable on my skin, and has lasted a year now without any problems. The brushes are soft enough- although when I was in a store and felt the Clarisonic brushes, wow, those things are INCREDIBLY soft, so that&#x27;s the only reason I took a star off- I wish the brushes were a bit softer. But I love this thing and would buy another if it broker down.</li>
            <li> One for my mom - all 4 sisters and a cousin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product with make you baby smooth. I had some annoying spots on my nose and lucky enough to (borrow) the product and cream. Let me tell you that every facial &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; you have ever had will be gone in two weeks. Makes you clean and feel clean. Works in the shower and anywhere else you can wet your face.&lt;br /&gt;!Olay! You did a great job!</li>
            <li> ...just started to use it ,however I am already having doubts based on the efficiency of the bristles .&lt;br /&gt;I can scrub my face better with my own fingers !......or even a small sponge !</li>
            <li> I love this!  My intention was to use this 2x a week with the included cleanser.  I used it a few times, then switched to my Neutrogena face wash.  I absolutely love it and my skin feels so clean!</li>
            <li> New fav face product!</li>
            <li> I tried this product based off of other good reviews. I have been very happy with the results, it definitely does everything it promises.  I have not tried any of the higher end cleansing brushes but this brush works great and the price is right. It rejuvenates your skin and makes it glow. I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wish the brush twisted a little faster.  Lasted a good week while I used it in the shower!  My batteries rusted out, and not it will not work!</li>
            <li> I love this!  It&#x27;s not too abrasive and there are 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is my first cleansing system and I have to say I feel the clean.  My face feels so silky smooth once I&#x27;m done, and I followed the reviewers suggestion of not apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be highly ineffective.  I developed acne in my forehead.  As a result, I when back to my rice based exfoliant.</li>
            <li> Works great! I use it in the shower so it holds up well in water. I&#x27;ve never used the Clarisonic so I don&#x27;t have a means of comparison but I think this one works well. It comes with a battery. It does not come with another facial cleansing pad.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hopes were set too high, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be that amazing. Nothing  good cleanser wouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  Can&#x27;t wait to try tonight.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is easy to use and it makes my face feel nice and smooth. For the price it is a nice complement to my nightly facial care.</li>
            <li> Since using this I have been told my skin looks clearer and brighter. My skin feels silky smooth immediately after using, I have little to none dead skin, which was a problem I had from just using a washcloth. I can&#x27;t comment on the products because I use my own soaps. The sponge didn&#x27;t really work for me, but the brush is amazing-it fits in all the small crevices of my face. I recommend using baking soda as an exfoliiant, works way better than the expensive stuff. HTH!</li>
            <li> Do not bother buying this. The product has no power. You would be better off just using a washcloth or just get ProActiv and get on with your life.</li>
            <li> This device is decent. my face feels very clean and fresh ! I highly recommend it for anyone whether boys or girls</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase the Clarisonic for $150 b/c this product does exactly what you need it to do. Scrub your face at a moderate pace. Not soft not to harsh. Also, I got a great deal on Amazin for it $12.99 in comparison to the one I bought from Target in sale for $24.08. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> it works great, havent any problems. this is one of the tools that you must have at home. great product and sell</li>
            <li> The difference between this cheaper brand vs the expensive brand is the head on this one rotates and the other ones vibrate. I would much rather have the vibrate one to clean the skin off better but I don&#x27;t think that this cheaper brand deserves to be rated bad for still doing a good job. I tried the expensive one from a friend and loved it better but I can&#x27;t afford it so this one will do and it really does make my skin look better after using it.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, Ive been using it daily since I got it...I want to order the microdermabrasion replacement head...The brush is a lil soft &amp; I want to be able to slough off some dead skin on my face....It does leave my skin soft...I have been using my own face stuff with it, not the product it came with.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser - my face feels so refreshed and clean afterwards. It does a great job on exfoliating and the price definitely makes it worth it! I was so happy I could buy this cleanser instead of paying the $200 for the Clarisonic version.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago and use it twice a day (morning and night). I use a different cleanser brand, but this brush is amazing! I can actually feel the difference in my skin, my face feels so much cleaner. I change the brush every 3-4 months and the replacement brush heads are not expensive. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Despite others saying that it doesn&#x27;t really do anything, the point of it is to keep at it. It&#x27;s meant to be used continuously every night (or morning). My nose likes to... peel really isn&#x27;t the right word for it, but flake off dead skin and it&#x27;ll stay partially attached if I don&#x27;t scrub my nose vigorously (not the same as simply washing my face every night) at least once every two weeks. It&#x27;s probably due to my glasses and the build up of oil under them, but when I started using this thing it was great! It scrubbed and opened my pores cleaning them out.</li>
            <li> I would give this cleaning brush ten stars if I could.  Having never had an ongoing skin care regimen and heading into my 45th year on this earth, I thought maybe I would give my face some attention, so I bought this brush along with several other skin care items.  I love this thing!  It&#x27;s super easy to use, feels good when you are using it, and my face is smoother than it has ever been.  I was suffering from a migraine yesterday and I used it just to feel some relief from that!  I swear my skin is smoother and brighter and I dare say I might just look a year or two younger!</li>
            <li> Love it ! I&#x27;m gay and my skin feels better</li>
            <li> One word  I will tell you about this product AMAZING !!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its very lightweight very easy to use I will recommend it to anyone :)</li>
            <li> This cleanser is fabulous! It comes with a little beaded wash thingie, like the st ives apricot scrub that I gently massaged into my face and neck,  I then used the rotating soft bristle device and my skin has never felt smoother or looked more even in tone... and that is after just 1 use!! This is a definite must!</li>
            <li> This is a small device. Water proof. Used with Olay scrubs, it is effective. Good grip on shower and had no issues using it. battery also comes for a long time.</li>
            <li> Pretty good but doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans my skin significantly more than without it</li>
            <li> Awesome tool, have had it 5 years and it just keeps working. Cleanser is great too</li>
            <li> It face wash very clean, compact, easy to carry.I bought a again, for the family.I hope she&#x27;ll like them.I like it.</li>
            <li> Simple design, great product for the price; the inside of the device has an oily residue designed to create a better seal to keep the batteries dryer from moisture. Needs stiffer pads.</li>
            <li> The device is very good, but the cream was not that good. so I bought another scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works under the shower, nice and quite operation, long battery life, smooth on face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like it, we bought anther two for our home.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this item. It works so well on the skin and is so gentle!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. It spins and cleanses. Gets my nose soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean the face well, but if you move the brush around too quickly, it hurts a little. It feels as if it&#x27;s actually hurting your skin. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product. The quality is good. It&#x27;s easy to clean. No problem using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> At first I felt like I was buffing my car, except I&#x27;m exfoliating, and its my face not my car. It feels nice, increases circulation I&#x27;m sure, makes my skin feel soft and glowing.  I bought one for my mom too, along with the Oil of Olay Regenerist starter trio.</li>
            <li> this brush is gentle yet it leaves your skin very clean. my pores have never been cleaner. this is a great product</li>
            <li> I liked the price and quality, and are also very safe products.&lt;br /&gt;Quality, price and excellent presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> This is the holy grail facial cleansing tool. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months and I cannot stray from using this now. I have huge pores, oily skin, and frequent breakouts. Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my pores have reduced dramatically, my face is now clearer more often than having breakouts, and my skin throughout the day is less oily (probably due to the decrease in poor size). My makeup goes on A LOT better and it wears longer because I&#x27;m not sweating it off with my huge pores. It does take batteries instead of being rechargeable, but I have not had to replace the batteries since I got it. I use it on the lower setting. I do use it everyday with the Pro-X cleansing wash which is not a foaming cleanser and it has micro beads in it for exfoliating. I know some exfoliating products recommend to NOT use everyday but this facial cleanser states that it is safe for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nightly facial cleansing routine: Wash first with a gentle non-foaming facial cleanser (without the brush). Then use the Pro-X facial cleanser with the brush to wash for about 2 minutes. Rinse. Then I use Albolene to take my eye makeup off and to moisturize my face at night. (use Albolene at night only because it is really greasy). This routine, along with having the Pro-X brush has changed my skin&#x27;s life!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it almost every night!</li>
            <li> Good for the price, came with batteries</li>
            <li> This works great and is a really good value. My face always feels good and clean after using it and I have less problems with acne if I use it every day. I keep it in the shower on a shelf and the water doesn&#x27;t seem to bother it. I have also dropped it many times on the floor and in a full tub of water. One time I dropped it and the batteries came out from the impact. I put it back together and it worked fine. Very durable product.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quick, just what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> worked ok for less than 7 months.  It stopped working and I found the batteries corroded and item permanently broken...</li>
            <li> I am known for being frugal, but not when it comes to my appearance.  I will spend it if it works.  But the way I figure it - in spending  $20 vs. $200, if the $20 item is half as good as the $200 one, for a 1/10th of the price - I&#x27;m that much ahead.  I love my Olay Pro-X ACS!  Saw brighter skin after just one use.</li>
            <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve been suffering from moderate acne due to hard water in my house. I just found out that I&#x27;ve been using hard water for the past 7 months!! I used to have absolutely flawless skin, now it just looks tired, dry, oily, and just uneven. After 2 uses, my SKIN GLOWS. I still have acne, but the areas that don&#x27;t have acne have smoothed out. My SKIN once again is at equilibrium, I don&#x27;t use any more products with this. I just wash with water. My acne is slowly drying up and falling off. I can&#x27;t wait to have perfect skin again! Don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the purpose of using the  spin brush and NOT the cleanser.The prouduct arrived in  a amazon prime box, nice packing with bubble paper. When i first opened the product i was very satisfied with the look because it had reached my expetations. Finding the battery campartment and actully opening it was th eonly hard part about it but the brush workes great! Yes it is actully water proof becuase i would use it in the shower and no damage was done</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job for a minimal price. The smaller sized head fits comfortably around my nose and is gentle enough to be used everyday. Very happy with quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Love the product. Just didn&#x27;t like how it was sent to the wrong address. I live in apartment complex and they sent to the wrong building.was very mad about that and hoping it doesn&#x27;t happen with my other things. Nervous about ordering anything else:/</li>
            <li> needed a special gift for someone who has everything. turned out perfect.  Will think about getting more for each daughter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned the more expensive type to compare it to, but I love it. I&#x27;ve used everyday for about 2 weeks and like how refreshed my skin feels. My pores are shrinking and skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li> Ok let me start by saying I am a 28 year old male and when this arrived at my doorstep my wife looked at me and laughed. This thing really works and i get a good clean face after using it. My face is much smoother. I put a little st ives facial scrub on it and use it 2 or 3 times a week. Works like a charm and the black heads on my nose are finally gone!!!!</li>
            <li> It does the job, though it isn&#x27;t as powerful as some of the more expensive ones.  Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Always wanted this product and it did not disappoint. I like olay products anyway and most things that I use from them are good.</li>
            <li> Tkank you just what I wanted as per description very content with the product I have not heard anything wrong about it</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune to what you need from a face scrubber.  This is all you need.</li>
            <li> It does a great job!  I use is once or twice a week together with Olay&#x27;s exfoliating renewal cleanser!  Skin feels thoroughly clean.  Don&#x27;t use is more than two times a week.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my GF and she is happy with it&lt;br /&gt;its really good (as she said) and the good think this thing its not available in TURKEY yet so it was a good present for her :)</li>
            <li> This little thing is excellent quality with two speed settings. It is simple to use and can be used in the shower or at the sink. Your face feels super clean after use and it is has very gentle bristles.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for me and one for my son.  We both suffer from exceptionally dry skin and keratosis pilaris, and in the winter, the redness and tiny bumps on my son hurt my heart.  Both of us love this brush and the cleansing cream, and I can see a difference in my son&#x27;s face already.</li>
            <li> I like the brush for gentle non-abrasive cleaning.  I only used the brush with my own cleanser, not the one that comes with this item, so can&#x27;t comment on the cleanser</li>
            <li> I have been using the Olay Pro-x  cleaning system for about 5 months now and really like it.  I usually use it about every other day and feel that it gets my face very clean.  It is easy to use and so far, the batteries are still going strong.  I have been using a non-Olay liquid soap with it and have had no problems at all.</li>
            <li> i had been contemplating buying the clarisonic for years but couldnt see myself spending $200-300 on a face washer. Dont get me wrong the reviews are amaxing for the clarisonic but is a very big gamble. I figured id purchase the olay pro x and try it out and if all else fails i will be more confident in the clarisonic. My skin has always had these bumps that were not pimples or allergies that were basically a normal thing for me. after 3 months of using the cleaning system they are gone! for me that is a huge deal! my make up application is flawless and my skin has this radiance its never had before! i have never been confident in my skin and now i am because of a $20 cleaning system. i am so happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 39 &amp; have been lucky to have nice skin, except for a few blackheads around nose &amp; some stress acne. This product took it from nice to fantastic! My skin has never been softer. Blemishes are mostly gone &amp; skin has a nice glow to it. Better than it my 20&#x27;s! It&#x27;s very easy to use in sink or shower. Very gentle, good for sensative skin. I only use it 3-4x a week and still get great results, can&#x27;t believe how soft my face is! I&#x27;m very frugal, cut &amp; color own hair, make own jewelry,etc &amp; this is worth every penny. So glad I splurged! It has even cut down amount of foundation I use, just a little on dark circles &amp; age spots, or a sweep of powder &amp; that&#x27;s it. Love, love it!</li>
            <li> I like the polisher, it&#x27;s relatively affordable, and gives me a great deep clean. The ProX line is way overpriced though in my opinion. I use it with a Neutrogena pore refining cream, to get something a little bit more natural. I didn&#x27;t get the sample cleanser it apparently comes with however, and it&#x27;s not worth sending it back just to get it. I feel like Olay was cheap about it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a little more power. The way the cream gets stuck in between the bristles bothers me.  It&#x27;s kind of hard to clean.</li>
            <li> No need to pay $100+ when this does the job for a fraction of the cost!  Plus I received the order very quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear a full set of makeup (foundation, concealer, loose powder &amp; etc.) almost everyday so it is very important that I wash my face thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;The ProX is very efficient in cleaning up whatever my face wipes didn&#x27;t get off and more!&lt;br /&gt;I loveee that the bristles &amp; the motion of the cleaner is so gentle! It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling all scratched up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results I see after a few weeks of using ProX:&lt;br /&gt;- tightened pores&lt;br /&gt;- glowing skin&lt;br /&gt;- less dry patches (provided that you also moisturize)&lt;br /&gt;- less white heads &amp; acnes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Its been a couple of months since my purchase and still no complaints!</li>
            <li> This little machine is awesome. I used it for the first time and my face felt so much cleaner. I have been using this machine for a couple of weeks and I love it. it is perfect. It has two settings slow and one that is a bit faster. I will recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> What a great clean feeling I&#x27;m left with once I&#x27;ve used this scrubber! Only thing annoying about it is that is you put the cream directly on the brush (or have too much on your face) it can make a bit of a mess as it gets flung everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed the brush, and the cleanser is very refreshing without being too harsh.  It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel as dried out as several other products.  Comparable to higher priced items, but without the expense.</li>
            <li> I used to have the clarasonic, but I swear I feel like I saw results here way quicker! I get so excited to use this thing. I  use my own obagi cleanser with it, and OMG, I love how my skin feels and looks. I do have somewhat problematic skin, but i get a lot of congestion on my face, no matter how great the products I am using are. This completely cleanses it deeply, and I LOVE IT! You wont regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product! cleanse face properly. Not as gentle as clarsonic but for the price i think it is a good start to cleansing device.</li>
            <li> Good product I like it. I wish it had an extra head that has deeper stronger bristles yet! Otherwise it&#x27;d get a 5 star. Works well without issue. Soft relaxing bristles.</li>
            <li> Love this product. The dual speed allows one to get a vigorous scrub or soothing massage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine since 2013 and it works great.  I was debating on whether to buy the more expensive systems but this does the job and saved me money.</li>
            <li> Its alright. I don&#x27;t feel my face is any cleaner than if I had used a washcloth. MY daughter loves playing with it in the bath tub.</li>
            <li> it really did kept my skin from breaking out!</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this to replace a much more expensive brush that died.  This one is the perfect replacement but for a lot less money.  She has oily skin and find this brush gets her face much cleaner than just washing it.</li>
            <li> Good price for something that is part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully.  Cant see the value in paying for the $125 version (Clairsonic) this exfoliates nicely and leaves skin glowing after 1st use.</li>
            <li> Initially I was skeptical about this little rotating brush thingie.  Just didn&#x27;t seem like it would really do anything.  Boy was I wrong.  I workout a lot and use a ton of sunscreen when I&#x27;m outside &#x3D; clogged pours and rough skin.  After a month of using this 3x a week I can def say that my skin tone and texture has improved.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS AND WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Gentle on the face and does the job well without irritation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this to exfoliate for the last few months.  It works wonderfully,  Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok &amp; only $20 , but it&#x27;s very soft &amp; slow. I wanted a bit more deeper cleansing &amp; if you press harder it stops. I&#x27;m not paying $200+ for the high end, so this is good for my 12 yr old. A bit more power would be nice.</li>
            <li> As one who likes to take good care of her skin this cleansing system was perfect for my needs.  Easy to operate, small but perfect for facial care.  Extremely happy with the product and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in 2011 - when I really wanted a Clarisonic but just couldn&#x27;t justify the ridiculous price tag of the Clarisonic and bought this instead. Almost immediately I noticed a huge difference in my skin. I get stress breakouts fairly easily but this helped to clear my skin up and kept my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. It was easy to travel with and never had any complaints. In 4 years I only had to replace the batteries of handful of times and never found myself hoping I had a Clarisonic instead. It is definitely worth the price tag. That being said, 4 years later it completely stopped working and wouldn&#x27;t power on. I tried to wash my face traditionally and was plagued with awful breakouts for months. I ended up upgrading to the newer model with the microdermabrasion brush and am pleased with that one as well.</li>
            <li> After dreamily looking at images of the Clarisonic for a few weeks and then sadly looking at my bank statement, I started my search for a more affordable alternative that could still get the job done. I found the Olay system, and the price seemed right. I always take reviews with a grain of salt (irony not lost on me, thank you) so I ignored the poor reviews and ordered the cleaning system. I received it in the mail quickly and got to work using it.     Okay, I give this product five stars because it is a convenient, well made, inexpensive product with quality that exceeds its price. That said, the cleanser is really terrible for my particular skin so I absolutely looked terrible after a week of use. Something about the cleanser and my skin created a terrible reaction, which is now gone thanks to the healing love of my own products and a lot of water. Anyway, I absolutely love the brush, I use just a teeny bit of my [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar) (4 Oz)]] and it leaves my skin feeling taut, clearer, and it somehow makes existing pimples shrink under its power.     I loved this sulfur mask before I tried the cleansing system, but these two products totally belong together, and attention should be made to that point. It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that using a bit of [[ASIN:B00LFT0CEO TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back! (60ml)]]as a spot treatment and moisturizer after using the cleansing system is really good for rejuvenating the skin after that treatment. Definitely get the Olay pro-x, it&#x27;s really easy to carry around and it works really well. Great value.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a face scrubber like this one. It is so gentle, I can use it every day with my favorite face wash. I love that I don&#x27;t have to replace with a new pad every single time I use it. No replacing anything, just use what I have and wash. I have to tell you though, I DO love the exfoliating renewal cleanser. It came with a nice sized sample and I like it so much that I went back and bought some more. Feels heavenly with a nice gentle scrub. Thanks Olay. I can always count on you.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Now, my skin is soft and clean. I use my Olay PRO-X Advanced Cleasing System everyday!!!</li>
            <li> Let me say that I have troubled skin and always have. I&#x27;ve suffered from persistent acne , sometimes cystic, off and on since puberty 12 years ago. My skin is oily, I have sensitive areas and some rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of thing and never expect miracles. My skin is changing with age and I&#x27;m always looking for something new.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve only used this for a little while but I loved it from the very first use. I saw immediate positive results. My skin was glowing, felt firm and soft. By the second use that evening I noticed a significant reduction in my pores.&lt;br /&gt; I use a heavier foundation and I think it&#x27;s crucial to remove all of this gunk. It&#x27;s sometimes hard to remove it all. After the first use I noticed a huge improvement on how this makeup applied. Due to the more even texture of my skin, I got nice smooth coverage with less make up. My makeup looks fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;I love how it feels on my face. That, for me, would have been enough to keep using this. It&#x27;s like getting a nice invigorating facial message. I use an appropriately gentle touch to the skin so that I&#x27;m getting the tips buy not bending the bristles. This is key. If you press down the bristles bend and you are getting the sides of the bristles and the only thing you accomplish is wearing the head out.&lt;br /&gt;Most people know that skin brushing for the entire body is known to improve circulation and clarify. I&#x27;m positive that this helps get circulation going in the face as you will see the flush you get after it&#x27;s use, also known as the glow.&lt;br /&gt;I hate that this product is being compared to the clarisonic but Olay started that, didn&#x27;t they? This product may only be half as good( for all I know it&#x27;s JUST as good)  but is 90% less! For those who say that you can do what this does with a wash cloth- you&#x27;re crazy. You couldn&#x27;t get this gentle touch with maximum exfoliation with a &amp;#34;rag.&amp;#34; Plus it would take a long time to get the number of passes over the skin that this machine will accomplish in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it, don&#x27;t care about replacing the heads or the batteries. This is a given and rechargeable batteries may be a solution.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this and love the cleanser too.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value for twenty bucks.h in a short time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it, don&#x27;t care about replacing the heads or the batteries. This is a given and rechargeable batteries may be a solution.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this and love the cleanser too.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value for twenty bucks.</li>
            <li> First of all I wish this was softer and this pulls on your face in circles. For example, when using this product below your eyes it will pull your bottom eyelid down and is pretty painful in that retrospect. Then why the three stars? Because my friend, it is exactly as pictured and I have also noticed my face getting clear.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It works wonders on my skin so much so that even my esthetician made a comment about my skin quality when she was doing my facial. This is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  Feels great and could see the difference in my skin in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the clarisonic system that&#x27;s more expensive. Use once a week, not daily if you have acne prone skin. Good stuff. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get any real skin problems anymore. Wearing makeup can feel really caked on and even when you wash your face you can still feel your foundation rooting it&#x27;s way into your pores. This makes you feel so clean. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> really makes a difference in the overall texture of your skin. never tried clarisonic, but this is terrific... and affordable!</li>
            <li> While I could not take this product seriously at first (Mr. and I were going through a bag of goodies we were gifted and this was included), I absolutely love it. If you&#x27;ve never used a brush before, expect a lot of giggles, because the feeling is a bit odd, and watching yourself brush-wash your face is hilarious. My skin feels incredible after using this though, and I highly recommend it. I couldn&#x27;t handle using the exfoliating  cleanser and sponge though, it&#x27;s too much for my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll keep it just for the normal cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humor: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliating: (I&#x27;ll give it a 9/10, if only because it&#x27;s super scrubby, far too much for my sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li> WORKS REALLY WELL AT ALLEVIATING DARK SPOTS AND ACNE !!</li>
            <li> Cleans so gentle. I can&#x27;t use the exfoliating cream that came with it but I use Oil of Olay and it works great!</li>
            <li> thousands of great reviews but ill add my own because im bored. ive had this for well over a year and came back on here to figure out how to change the battery (just pull down the bottom piece) and it takes two AAs. I use it a few times  week and it does a good job of cleansing your face with tugging your skin around compared to using a wash cloth. saves you time and provides a more thorough clean. and for around $20 this is so worth it. I was prepared to buy it again if mine was dead for good. pair this with your favorite quality cleanser for best results</li>
            <li> The order came on time and is being used with no problem.</li>
            <li> All my life I have had trouble with black heads and I wanted something that would actually scrub.  This brush gets deep in the pores of my skin and really cleans.</li>
            <li> Works well but not much different than other ones out there.</li>
            <li> Got one for myself and my daughter.  I use it every day.  We both love the brush cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Works great! Great price and shipping</li>
            <li> This product is great! I used it once daily and I feel my skin is clean. Black head are slowly going away.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! Perfect handheld size and after used ur face will b as smooth as a babies bottom</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this cleansing brush for about 2 months and I love it.  It leaves my skin feeling very clean and so soft.  I was debating between purchasing this or the clarisonic and Im so glad I I got this one and saved myself some money!</li>
            <li> It worked okay, but it scrubs too gently for me so I have to leave it cleaning my face for a long time.</li>
            <li> I got this because a friend recommended a Clairsonic but I wasn&#x27;t ready to sink the cash into that without trying a face brush first. The design is good and the bristles aren&#x27;t too hard. It definitely makes my skin smoother, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of an extra &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; like some found. I think it might be because I&#x27;ve already been exfoliating regularly (Aveda&#x27;s tourmaline scrub), and so there might not be as much of a difference due to that. It does make my moisturizer absorb easier and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it wasn&#x27;t a miracle worker for me, but it&#x27;s nice to use!</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose that fill up easily and this product works great to clear them and keep them clear.  I tried using it after washing my face at the sink but stopped because I found it works much better if you use it in the shower. The warm water opens up your pores making it more effective.  I have changed the head on it twice. When you change it you realize how hard the bristles got after three months.  Edit: Exactly 1 year after purchase the power button won&#x27;t stay in. I have to hold it down to get it to run. I still have three spare heads for it and it cleans very well so I will probably end up buying another but one year and dead isn&#x27;t good quality.</li>
            <li> Neat little product. I use it every other day and notice that it is nicer that I expected. Not a real scrubbing feel like I expected but still ok.</li>
            <li> Wonderful wonderful wonderful! I absolutely love it. Great for use in shower too. After just a few uses my face was softer and smoother! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Again, the wife loves this and I must say...as a man it feels really great on my face!! We will buy again!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this with my regular cleanser about 3 X a week, and w/ the exfoliant that comes with it 2 times a week. Skin feels much softer and smoother with regular use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this everyday for he last week. So far, so good. It has two speed settings and came with batteries. My peeling dry skin is under control and my skin is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical to try this product but after having a professional facial with the brush being used I was sold.  Love the brush and over time my skin gets better and better.</li>
            <li> this should be  a must have in everybodys routine.. i cant live without it now.. youre going to see and feel a change in your skin inmediatly</li>
            <li> I was looking at investing in a Clairsonic and read reviews about the Olay Pro-X. Although I do not use the Pro-X cleanser (product shy because of sensitive skin), the took works fabulously with my cleanser! My pores are getting smaller by the day and my skin feels really clean after I use it. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am a 32 year old woman with 3 kids who really has never had much of a regimen. I wash my face, usually with Morning Burst from Clean and Clear, or if I feel like splurging, Bliss fave wash is my favorite. I rarely use a wash cloth or scrubs. My skin isn&#x27;t in poor shape but it&#x27;s not that great either, no &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; other than the oily, slightly bumpy T zone, and a few dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have decided it&#x27;s time to grow up and develop a skin regimen. I just purchased this and received it today, and and OH MY GOSH I look and feel like I have had a facial! My skin has been glowy al day, feels much smoother, and I was able to clean out my pres really easily after I used it. I used it again tonight, and just love it! It feels good too. I was afraid it would be scratchy on my skin and I would feel raw after using it but it&#x27;s just the perfect brush, it doesn&#x27;t rotate too fast...It just scrubs and doesn&#x27;t scratch like I was afraid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited about this stuff that I will be ordering some of the rest of the pro-x line - I saw that they have a microdermabrasion set too to go with this, and other skin creams and serums. I found a starter pack with 3 items on amazon and will definitely be ordering that in the next couple of days. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in a couple of weeks, as some of the other reviewers saw such dramatic results!</li>
            <li> I definitely like the brush. It works well, the battery lasts ages in there. Also, if you are careful to store the device so that nothing touches the brushhead -- the head will last a loooong time. Literally over a year and still on the same brushhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is okay, but not worth buying on it&#x27;s own. I just use a polishing/exfoliating cleanser with the brush and have had no problems. If you use it at least once a day, it really makes breakouts less frequent (in my experience anyway). Also, it works well to prevent scarring when a breakout does occur. I am a sufferer of deep cystic acne, so when breakouts do happen (often due to a systemic issue) ... they are deep &amp; they erupt as horrible looking spots that take a while to heal. Using this brush does make the healing go faster, and prevents scars from forming. Definitely worth the cost here on Amazon</li>
            <li> The Olay cleansing system delivers what&#x27;s promised. The brush rotates just fine, and cleans very well, better than I can do with my bare hands. The dual speed is a bonus, sometimes I use the deeper one, especially after a heavy make-up day.&lt;br /&gt;I found the sample cleanser that came with the device somewhat harsh, and my face is not even sensitive. So, I use it with my Derma e Glycolic acid cleanser, and I am okay with both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now ordered the replacement brush, and hope that I can keep using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> With all the great reviews I thought this product would be great! Honestly it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Olay has a hit with this one. I&#x27;ve tried Clariosonic, which I still have and use for rest of body, but I thought it was too big and too rough for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the Olay cleaner that came with this cleaning system ( I have sensitive acne prone skin), but I absolutely love the brush, its small, so its easier to clean near the nose, and the bristles are very soft, and the speed isn&#x27;t too massively high like with the Clarisonic, so I don&#x27;t feel its too abrasive for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying the cleaning product, but I will definitely be buying the brush replacements, I do wish they did sell the brush by itself, I am planning on buying this for Christmas for some people,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the brush is really a great great product! Olay, please don&#x27;t stop making the brush or its replacements!</li>
            <li> Love this for the price compared to much higher price tag models. Good size to travel with as well.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as though every time I buy a beauty product I expect it to change my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This won&#x27;t change your life but it will give your face a nice, gentle scrub.  The bristles are very soft so it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re taking an orbital sander to your face or anything.  I don&#x27;t use it every day... more like once a week because I&#x27;m incredibly lax about my facial regime.  Thank the stars I have good skin.  I would say you could use it every day without it really having any ill effects that exfoliating every day wouldn&#x27;t have given you anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two speeds.  Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, the head pops right off.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in the way my face feels since I started using the Pro-X. I can&#x27;t compare it to a Clairsonic as I have never used one, but if you&#x27;re looking to start somewhere at a reasonable price, I would definitely choose this!</li>
            <li> I would never pay $200 for the fancier brand. This brush from Olay works just fine. My skin feels really clean after I use it and I absolutely love it. It gives the equivalent feeling of getting your teeth cleaned...but for your face.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Pro-X.  My skin is sensitive and I do not use the product that came with it.  I use my regular facial cleanser with it and I&#x27;ve gotten a deeper cleanse with it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I really the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System. My skin looks and feels so much better. I don&#x27;t care for the cleansing cream that came with this brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay instead of the pricery models as I suspected it would do the job and it does. My skin is clearer and softer and belmishes are at an all time low.  My face looks and feels better.  I am very pleased with this product!  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Excellent buy, excellent for your face, keep your skin looking very smooth. I use it twice a week. try it!</li>
            <li> Love this. It makes my skin so soft and smooth. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s improving my skin, but I love the way my skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using another cleanser with it, because the Pro-X exfoliating cleanser is a bit pricey, but the others just weren&#x27;t the same. I ended up buying a large bottle of the pro-x face cleanser!</li>
            <li> as a gift, very nice! my roommate seems like it~ Highly recommended for young and lazy girls! Very convenient tool.</li>
            <li> I love it I use an exfoliation cleanser with it and my skin says thank you</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think the brush and power are strong enough to do much to my skin. It feels clean but not but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the smoothness of your skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion, easy to operate, and works as promised.  The Olay skin care product line is one of my favorites and the applicator makes it feel invigorating to apply the cleanser and then skin is very soft to the touch afterwards.  It&#x27;s not as effective as the $100-$200 competitors from Clarisonic, but it does a lovely job for a product that costs &amp;#60;25%.</li>
            <li> I love their products but was expecting a deeper cleaning with this system.  Not sure it cleans deep enough.  I like the ease of using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Not much power in this machine, but I now think that may be true of all such facial cleansing system devices.  I&#x27;ve since looked at some in-house pharmacy brand units that have almost the identical design, but at a cheaper price.  One pays for the Olay label.&lt;br /&gt;Still, what I got is &amp;#34;as advertised,&amp;#34; and it arrived in good condition and promptly.</li>
            <li> It was okay the first couple of times.  I used it only once a week and as per recommended time amount ( 60 secs).  After the third week of use and immediately putting on my normal facial moisturizer after the shower use, I would wake up the next day with a sore spot on my chin and around mouth.  It was those deeeep pimples!  This happened twice in a matter of 2 months.  Mind you, i have never had the deep pimples for over a year.  If it works for you, fine.. great product.  But for me, I threw it away after it irritated my sensitive acne prone skin too much!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cleansing system. I have not really used the cleanser it came with but my own facial cleanser. I love the fact that you don&#x27;t have to use their cleanser in order to use the system. My face feels super clean after using it every time. I use it only once a day though (at night) becoz i do find using it twice is a little too much for my own skin, but i guess everyone is different. Will def recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is a very gentle yet thorough cleansing system.  I thought at first it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;hard&#x27; enough on my face but my fine lines are slowly disappearing!  I use the cleanser as well as a scrub with this and am very very happy.</li>
            <li> This works just as good at the one&#x27;s over $100.00.</li>
            <li> good price +good work</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling so soft afterwards!! I normally have visible dry flaky skin but this seemed to buff it right off. I use it in the shower it seems to work better than using it just to wash your face in the sink. After about 2 weeks of using this every other day I have noticed my pores are smaller, blackheads are fewer, and a healthy glow on my face (not shiny). The facewash is nice but nothing remarkable I prefer my exfoliating creme while using this. I would say that the Pro-X is a good first step or alternative to more expensive facial cleansers since it worked well and in reasonably priced (believe me I did a tons of review research on cleansing systems before I purchased this one it&#x27;s the best bang for your buck).</li>
            <li> Bought this product after reading all the reviews.  It is very good.  I wash my face and it feels really clean right after.  It is gentle on your skin and you will feel the difference right away.  I will recommend this product to everybody.</li>
            <li> A great product, again very easy on the pocket and works wonders. If you are still looking get this one.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. It provides a much cleaner feeling that using hands alone. The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is that I am not sure how well the product will last. To a certain degree it does feel a little on the cheaply constructed side. So only time will tell how truly well made the product is.</li>
            <li> Even my first time using the product, I noticed a difference right away. It is gentle, has two speed settings. For me, it may be a little too gentle. I would prefer a more exfoliating brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy because it effectively keeps adult acne away when I use it 1-2 times a week. I can tell because as soon as I stop using it, the acne comes back. I use it also at the hairline (but be careful, hair can get tangled up in it) and jaw/neck area. I haven&#x27;t tried using it on my back since it&#x27;s really small and I&#x27;m worried that it&#x27;ll get waterlogged if I take it into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Mix the exfoliating gel that comes with the brush with a little of your own facewash product to get more coverage. I use a 1:1 ratio of the exfoliating gel w/ my own face wash. Work your way up; less is more.</li>
            <li> My skin gets squeaky clean after I use it and looks really great. But I don´t feel the need to use it everyday because it really takes all the natural oils from the skin.</li>
            <li> There are tons of electronic face washing systems to choose from but i came down between the Olay PROx &amp; Clairsonics (Mia, aria, whichever).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research, ultimately i decided that i would prefer to pay a little less to test something out &amp; call it a loss if it wasn&#x27;t for me. Or end up purchasing something i really love for an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t typically experiment a lot with facial cleansing systems like scrubs or exfoliators or even cleansers - afterall it is your FACE.&lt;br /&gt;But i really, REALLY try to stay away from exfoliators but decided an electronic cleanser would be ok with my mild daily face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came as advertised with all necessary tools for the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;&amp; I loved it instantly. I like to think that the way this is designed and engineered is for those who want the luxe spa treatment without the luxe spa dollar! I use the softer setting on my face and particularly the nose area, while the faster setting i use on my neck area.&lt;br /&gt;The scrubber heads are gentle enough but get the job done. I&#x27;ve always trusted Olay as a brand and they did not let down.&lt;br /&gt;Way to go OLAY!!!!!</li>
            <li> I never tried a clarasonic, so I can&#x27;t compare the two, but I really like this brush.  2 speeds and easy to use.  My first one broke after about a year, so I contacted Olay and they sent me a certificate for a free replacement.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and other products made my skin feel like a greased paper towel. This completely leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This products works just as well as the expensive model and costs so much less.  I recommend it for anyone before dishing out the dollars.</li>
            <li> I LOVE me Pro-X brush!</li>
            <li> I have always been afraid to try something like this since I have very sensitive skin.  It is oily and dry.  Not much doesn&#x27;t affect it without having some kind of red sploshes coming up.  I decided to go ahead and buy this since I know that Olay is a trusted manufacturer.  My mom has been using it for years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked to find that after a week of using it twice a day that my skin was softer and more firm then it has ever been.  Family and friends were asking what I was doing to my skin since it was glowing.  I am using the Regenerist skin care with it.  I&#x27;m one happy camper and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> nice product. Meets my expectation. Easy &amp; safe to use</li>
            <li> Loved this so much I ordered a second for my son.his skin very dry and this has helped his complexion.</li>
            <li> My skin texture and over all appearance has improved greatly since using this exfoliator. It is soo gentle yet soo effective.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this. Im glad I found it for such a great price.  I sent one to my sister as a gift too.</li>
            <li> Scrub a dub-dub with great results. This definitely beats a washcloth and it clears you up right quick! Looks and feels like the commercials you see for the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand name product. Best part is I do not have to buy all the other products in order to get this as a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; gift from the TV ad!</li>
            <li> IT WAS FINE SINCE APRIL 2014, BUT, NOW THE BRUSH WILL NOT STAY ON.  DON&#x27;T KNOW IF ANY WARRANTY</li>
            <li> I like this system. I wish it spun a little quicker and more intensely, but it does the job. You do not get very much cleaner either, so be prepared to have to buy more quickly. I use this a few times a week and it leaves my face feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Perfect to exfoliate the face i love using it. Def no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the first battery powered facial brush I&#x27;ve owned, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other types,but I&#x27;m pleased with the way it cleans my face.  The price was right so it will work for me for the time being.</li>
            <li> I just love it, my skin feels real clean after I use it, I had a manual one, but I love the electric one better.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I did lots of research and decided on this over the Mia2. It was a fraction of the price and is doing a great job. I really like the way it feels as I am cleaning my face and have noticed a difference in my breakouts after only using it a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Great cost x benefit!  To be perfect it should spin a little faster.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> face feels clean and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I started using the Pro-X Cleansing System about two weeks ago.  My complexion looks better already.  My pores are smaller, my skin brighter and smoother and my makeup looks smoother.  I am very pleased with this product for the price.  I haven&#x27;t used the higher prices systems that people talk about but this system serves my purposes.</li>
            <li> This is good for its cost. I bought for my wife and she is quiet happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been lusting for the Clarisonic for awhile now but $150 was way out of my budget for skincare. I am a college student in my really early 20&#x27;s and I bought the olay cleansing tool for several reasons: 1. I wanted to begin my preventative care early on, 2. I wanted to rid my T-zone of blackheads and 3. it&#x27;s really affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the machine for 3 days now and I feel like it has really made a difference in the texture and cleanliness of my skin. My skin immediately felt smoother and free of dead cell debris and my moisturizer absorbed a lot faster and better upon application. In buying Olay&#x27;s machine, I was really really hoping that it would be the solution to my blackhead conundrum!! I&#x27;ve been plagued with blackheads for as long as I can remember and it&#x27;s just been a chronic and STRESSFUL concern of mine. In the past, I tried many products that claimed to dissolve blackheads but nothing worked. After using Olay&#x27;s cleansing system, I could tell that some of my blackheads have already disappeared after only 3 days of use. Furthermore, I could also see that much of the gunk that has been clogged deep in my pores of  are also surfacing. I&#x27;ve been having a much easier time extracting my blackheads with a blackhead extractor thanks to Olay&#x27;s cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would really recommend this product to anyone. Now it&#x27;s not a magic bullet.  I didn&#x27;t wake up the next day having amazing skin but the subtle improvements in the texture of my skin was enough for me to say that buying this product was well worth it! Many of us often overlook the simple step of washing our face, when little do we know it can make all the difference. There is no way our own hands are capable of achieving what a machine can do. For $30 bucks, Olay cleansing system is a great investment.</li>
            <li> Compared to the professional style that you have to spend 6x more on, this is not worth the money or the time wasted.  Invest in a good one to get the results that matter to your skin and your appearance.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks.  I never knew what it was like for a product to actually \\&quot;make my pores look smaller\\&quot; but that is exactly what this has done.  I had some scarring from previous acne and it is starting to fade.  My skin feels smooth and soft.  I really like this product so far and I think it is worth the money.  My skin has never felt cleaner.    Make sure that your face is very moist when you apply it because that way it makes mores suds.  :)  I love it!</li>
            <li> The pro-x is definitely not as nice as the clarisonic, but it does, basically, the same job for a lot less money. It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> This product works. I previously used a HomeMedics version of the same thing and had to keep sending it to back on warranty because after limited use it would stop working. The item was eventually discontinued. The Olay Advanced Cleaning System cleans very well and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of the [[ASIN:B0009F402K CLARISONIC Skin Care System 1 ea]], so I may be a little biased, but the people who think this is comparable may not have used the other brush.&lt;br /&gt;If you are comparing in cost, it is about 20% comparable for about 15% of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;The motion of the brush head is different- this one rotates and the Clarisonic uses a sonic pulse.&lt;br /&gt;You have to replace the brush heads in both, and the Olay ones are about half the price of the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;With this brush, it seems easy to tear my face up, and with the Clarisonic it seems nearly impossible. I can use my Clarisonic brush on a daily basis, but I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using this one more than a few times a week if I was using it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;I also found it surprising that they recommend you use it (it actually comes with it) with an abrasive face wash, when my Clarisonic specifically tells you NOT to use it with abrasive cleansers. I&#x27;m kind of cringing at the idea of gradually tearing my face up with the abrasive cleanser and the brush.. not a pretty picture! I guess if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and really need some serious exfoliation its OK??&lt;br /&gt;Waterproofing- It has a gasket on the inside that makes it hard to replace the batteries, and over repeated battery replacements you would kill the gasket. The more expensive brand uses inductance to recharge, so it will never get water on the inside. I think this gasket would probably last you a year if you use the brush on a daily basis and replace the batteries regularly. I&#x27;ve been using my other brush for 2 years. Also, I feel I need to mention it was pretty tough for me to figure out how to replace the batteries. They have about a sentence on it, and it doesn&#x27;t do justice to what a pain it really is, which is why I think this little gasket will actually wear out from the pressure fit.&lt;br /&gt;I Actually think this brush is better to use on my body than my face because its pretty abrasive compared to my Clarisonic. I&#x27;m planning to keep it just for that.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think you get what you pay for. If you are willing to make an investment and think a brush for your face is something worth springing for, go for the more expensive brand.p it just for that.  All in all, I think you get what you pay for. If you are willing to make an investment and think a brush for your face is something worth springing for, go for the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase. For the price it is totally worth it!! Mine does not leak (I read that in someone else&#x27;s review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take time away, but it definitely leaves my skin feeling and looking great. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the ease and feel of this simple machine.  Thought I was cleansing well, but this is super &amp; gentle!</li>
            <li> So at first when I bought this I was skectipcal. I&#x27;m a 21 year old college student with combination skin and I wash my face every morning and night to no avail. My Mom was talking about buying this for her anti-aging stuff so I bought one too to give it a try. I have a problem with my t-zone being too dry or oily and finding products to scrub my face till I actually feel clean. But with this I don&#x27;t have to use my apricot scrub anymore, it feels clean. My makeup goes on so smoothly and my face has completely cleared up and Ive had it for a week. I use it in the am with my neutrogena pink grapefruit face wash and at night with the pro-x cleanser. It truley works my face is so soft and my complextion is even. I dont have dry spots anymore, its great. I would defiently recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this facial  cleanser system..after I use it my face feels baby soft and really clean..thanks olay for another affordable product</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got this for me after hearing me talk about it for months, wondering if it was worth the hype, and noticed I hadn&#x27;t bought one. It may sound like an odd gift. But I was more happy about the oxy pro cleaning system then any other gift I got (b-day). I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t bother to read the back of the cleanser bottle (apply to wet/moist face) and I used it on dry skin. Oops. Even so, it still worked wonderfully and even better the next morning WITH wet/moist face. That day I went without foundation, just sunscreen and mousturizer. My face felt new! The texture was incredible. I could even see some improvment in tone after the 1st 24 hours (2 uses). I can&#x27;t remember last time my face felt so clean. (I normally use biore foaming facial cleaner which is good but has nothing on this) No fine line reduction but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. I was hopeful for a smooth face with better tone and I have it. I think this is very much worth a $45 investment.</li>
            <li> I am near 40, have pretty clear skin, and have tried both the Clairsonic and the Olay product.  Please dont be brainwashed into thinking that you need to spend $150 plus to get good results!!! I ve used the Pro-x for a few weeks now, and have gotten excellant results. My skin is smoother and was glowing after the first use! If you have problem skin and can afford to buy the clairsonic....by all means.  I however, would rather spend the extra money on a quality cleanser and moisturizer and continue to use the pro-x.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this product and decided to try it instead of purchasing the more expensive brand, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. This little machine works great! It is keeping my skin cleaner than I was able to do with just make-up remover and cleanser with a washcloth. I find it gentle on my skin, easy to use and easy to clean after using. I am so glad I purchased it, I feel that it does a great job and just makes taking off make-up and getting my skin clean easier.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT! it prevented new acne from occurring and it helped cleaned my face in maximum of 2 days (using this product 3 times a day)1.Morning, 2.Evening, 3.before sleeping. Most importantly It cleans like a lot better than normal cleaning.I Love Olay products and this is my first time using this :). Besides I ordered the facial treatment (its awesome!),I also ordered the day time moisturizer+night time cream which closes the pores in your faces and sooths the skin as new and doesnt let any bacteria into the pores :). Instead of wasting over 300$ in facial why not get this stuff and use all these products for months :p. RATE THIS 5 STARS IF YOU AGREE!! THANKS YOU FOR READING THIS! :)</li>
            <li> I love it.  Not too abrasive but gets the job done.  The tube sample you get in the box is extremely small, so it&#x27;s good that you can use it with any product you want.  only comes with one brush.  the battery cover was a little difficult to get off but other than those few complaints i&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to a friend or a stranger ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be completely honest, I&#x27;ve heard and been wanting to purchase the Clarisonic Mia forever because so many people praised at how good it works. My one concern? The price. I then saw a youtube video with someone doing a comparison between the Clarisonic Mia and the Olay Pro-X System. It turns out the Clarisonic Mia bristles in the middle of the machine rotates while the outside layer doesn&#x27;t as opposed to the Olay&#x27;s entire bristles rotating in circles. They literally put them against each other and said they both work equally the same but then felt they got a bit more from the Pro-X. I&#x27;ve heard plently of people comparing this to the Clarisonic regarding quality and all reviews have been positive. If its being compared that well, I&#x27;m obviously going to save my money and give it a try. If it doesn&#x27;t turn out fine then I&#x27;de just save up for the Clarisonic Mia for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried the Clarisonic Mia and after this purchase, I definitely will not have to. This brush is AMAZING. You can literally feel the difference after the first try. You can tell your skin feels about 10x&#x27;s smoother and with the right cleanser, your skin will come out flawless from time to time. I&#x27;m so happy with how soft the bristles actually are because I have very sensitive skin. I give nothing but 5 stars to this product. Works probably just as good as any other professional system while also saving a lot less. One recommendation, batteries die fast so I suggest one buys RECHARGEABLE batteries. You&#x27;d just save a lot more money in the end. Great product, great price, great skin:.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Date: 4-7-2011</li>
            <li> I love this device. I use MAC Pro Longwear foundation, and it does not come off with normal makeup remover. The only things that worked before I started using this device were oil-based cleansers or makeup remover with alcohol, both of which my skin does not like. The Olay Pro-X brush takes it all off - I can see the color of the foundation on the brush head (which rinses off with water) and when I use toner afterward, there is not a trace of foundation left. I used it with the Olay cleanser sample in the box, and it was working well, so I went back and bought a full-sized one when I ran out.</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s appearance has radically improved since I started using this little device two months ago. In fact, I could see improvement within the first week. Although, I was exfoliating my skin with cleansers every day, the Olay brush does a much better job. The little bumps and congestions are gone (or nearly so), and discolorations are reduced. My skin is not sensitive, but is aging (sigh) and oily. The exfoliating cleanser included in the package works very well and I will buy it again, but I suspect any exfoliating cleaning product would work okay. This is such a great product, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but decided to try the facial brush anyway. After just one use, my skin was glowing. Now, weeks later, my skine looks and feels better than ever! I occasionally use the Olay cleanser that comes with it, but usually use Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser. The only thing I wonder is how often I should change the brush.</li>
            <li> I bought the Clarisonic Mia and was using it for about 2 months when I started looking for something more effective. I was using it as an exfoliator, and while it was cleaning and exfoliating my face, it wasn&#x27;t leaving my skin as smooth and blemish-free as I had imagined it would for having paid $149, so I had decided to trade the Mia in for the Clarisonic Plus ($225), hoping that having one with 3 speeds would give me the skin I wanted. That&#x27;s when I found out about the Pro-X, so before dropping another $75 dollars into a better Clarisonic I gave the Pro-x a try. I am amazed! On the first use I found my skin to be 10x softer and smoother than before. I was soo impressed that I immediately returned my Clarisonic. The Pro-x is battery operated, but I&#x27;ve been using it 2x a day for over a month and have not had to change them yet, as opposed to the Mia which had to be charged every 10 days. I use my Pro-x in the shower, but am a little more careful not to leave it under the water stream as much as I would with the Clarisonic. Also, while the Pro-x brush rotates it doesn&#x27;t have the outer vibrating bristles that the Mia has, which I don&#x27;t think makes a difference except it makes the Mia brush head a bit bigger than the Pro-x, but to make my Pro-x really effective sometimes I will move it in a circular motion in the opposite direction than the brush head is rotating. All in all, if you&#x27;re looking for something that cleanses and exfoliates your face very effectively, then Pro-x is for you. I found it to be better than the Mia at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Love this little thing!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it a little over a month and I like this product, cleans my face and removes flaky dead skin cells better than hand washing. The only negative part is that I noticed the soft brush head is already fraying a little and bending at some spots.  Another drawback is the batteries. The motor is running weaker and the AAs are draining (only been a month.) I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cost effective to change batteries so frequently on this product. It would be a 5 star review if they incorporated a rechargeable battery system.</li>
            <li> it does a great job scrubbing.  i use it at the end of the day after i take off my makeup.  it makes my skin super clean and soft....and the price is right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of exfoliation, because I have found that exfoliation helps my acne-prone, sensitive skin the most.  I started using this device a few weeks ago, and it has already become an indispensable part of my skin care routine. I use it twice daily, and have found that using it with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean, Anti-Breakout Facial Cleanser works best for me.  Extremely helpful in keeping dry parts of my face smooth and not flaky.  For under $30, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I love the Pro-X system.  My facial cleaning routine has been lax for many years. Now that I&#x27;m getting older, I discovered that I needed to do a little more to reduce signs of aging.  The Pro-X system works to remove dead skin cells and hopefully will help to reduce signs of aging as I continue to use it.  Its a soft scrub - not irrating to the skin.</li>
            <li> When I turned 24, I became a freak about caring for my skin. I use a very expensive facial care system twice a day. My breakouts did improve and my blackheads became lighter, but did not disappear.  My aunt bought me this product and O-M-G. What a difference in my skin! I have used this product for 4 days (twice a day) and it is amazing how smooth my make up goes on now.  However, I did use the cream that came with it and it seemed a bit rough. I only use that as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the expensive pro cleaning systems.  Honestly, it&#x27;s great, I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.  I was going to buy the $150 one, but the Olay one is awesome, I&#x27;m going to get it for my friends for their birthdays!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to try the Pro-X and I&#x27;m VERY glad I did. My skin is softer and my complexion is clearer. It&#x27;s absolutely worth the money! It&#x27;s very easy to put together and I can use exfoliaters and cleansers with this brush. I recommend you try it yourself.      NOTE ON INSTRUCTIONS  I&#x27;ve notice that some comments state there are no instructions on how to take the battery case off or how often the brush should be changed. Instructions for both are on the side of the box. There are also instructions for how to install the brush head.  I had no problem at all removing the battery cover or putting it together.     For those who have tossed the box it says:    INSTALLING BRUSH HEAD: Press the brush head onto the connection pin until it locks into position with a click. For best results, replace the brush head every 3 months or sooner if bristles become deformed.    INSTALLING BATTERIES: Gently rock the battery compartment side to side while pulling to release the battery cover. Insert 2AA batteries aligning  /- symbols. Replace battery cover. Replace batteries as needed. Do not mix old and new batteries as unit may be damaged.</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because although I love the pro-x, I wish the speed of it were a little faster. There are two speeds, the low speed isn&#x27;t even worth using. The high speed is what I keep it on, but it seems it could be a little better. Otherwise, my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected with this item.  I do know I anticipated my face would feel much smoother than it does.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times with 2 different exfoliant creams but, regardless, the end result is not the &amp;#34;baby bottom&amp;#34; feel that I&#x27;d like.  Also, I wish there was a micro-dermabrasion head available for this appliance.  Apparently the foam heads offered on their products do not fit this one.  Figures that they&#x27;d want you to buy multiple products for multiple purposes.  I&#x27;m on the fence with this one.</li>
            <li> Pros:    I like this product.  It has a spinning brush head.  Works better than just a standard brush.  I liked it so much i bought a second one for my travel bag.      Cons:    After using the first one for a couple months, the on/off button does not respond as well and can be difficult to turn off.</li>
            <li> I like this cleansing brush, it leaves my face feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Pro-X about 3 weeks ago from Costco (about $36 with the full-size cleanser), and it has really worked wonders on my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had oily skin and regularly have acne breakouts.  I&#x27;ve really tired of using oral medications to manage it, so have used topical (OTC with benzol peroxide or salicylic acid, as well as prescription with clindamyacin, etc) for a while now with mixed results.  For several months I&#x27;ve had a constant breakout area on my left cheek that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.  As soon as I thought the area was clearing up, it&#x27;d break out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Pro-X and the cleanser, and was so surprised with how effective it was.  It really exfoliates nicely.  It took about a week for that problem area on my left cheek to completely disappear.  Prior to use I also started developing the type of deep-seeded blackhead that looks like dirt (versus the more whitehead type), but that seems to have come to a halt since I&#x27;ve been using the Pro-X.  Depending on the day and my skin (or how lazy I am), I alternate the Pro-X with my AcneFree (generic Pro-Activ), the Pro-X cleanser, Cetaphil, or just my bath soap.  The tone of my skin has also greatly improved - it&#x27;s more even.  I&#x27;ve stopped using concealer and foundation(something I&#x27;ve NEVER done!), and now just use a tinted moisturizer and loose powder.  So awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended and easy on the pocketbook!</li>
            <li> I chose this to try out a electric face brush, as the data published says that using such a device increases cleaning efficiency by 6 times over normal washing by hand. Easy to use, feels nice, although messy to use, thus I use it only in the shower. Hard to tell if it makes a difference, but for the very small price, I FEEL like I am getting my face, neck and décolleté cleaner and exfoliated, so I think it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the Olay Pro-X. I thought the speed of the brushes were slow. Some people may like this.</li>
            <li> I use this several times a week.  Seems like a good one, but sometimes I wish that it felt stronger.  Maybe I will change the batteries.</li>
            <li> makes me feel like i really cleaned out my oily facial pores. foamy and bubbley and lathery. it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I really like it! Had first ordered the Clarisonic Plus from another site (good discount) but it would not charge. They sent me another and it too would not take a charge. I was so disappointed, decided to not try a third time. Chalking it up to fate. I ordered this instead and am very happy. I can not compare this to the Clarisonic as far as cleaning but the price is 1/10th!  My skin is brighter and my pores seem to be shrinking. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I feel my complexion looks better since I have been using this product. It even feels smoother. I just really like using this cleaner.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve had it for two weeks and my skin has seemed smoother! the biggest thing I&#x27;ve noticed is the blackheads I can never seem to conquer on my nose have almost completely disappeared! The first time I used this I forgot that I was about to, so I had already done my regular face washing routine and washed my face. THEN I get this out and used the scrub it came with, and I can&#x27;t believe how much makeup was on the brush! I thought I had already taken my makeup off! So I definitely recommend this every night for a truly clean face!</li>
            <li> I bought two of this product: one for my daughter and one for me.  My face feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom.  The brush is the perfect size for petite faces and the price is incredible.  We keep them in the shower so we do not leave a mess on the bathroom vanities.  I would highly recommend you buy this system!</li>
            <li> This cleansing system is gentler than a wash cloth, but powerful like a facial. It is easy to use &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels like my skin is getting cleaner and it really helps exfoliate and deep cleanse.  No complaints.  I like this for my face, neck and chest.  I use this with other face wash products that I use also.  Good price and I like that it works in the shower!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the other expensive brand like Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;Still use occasionally.  Very soft and would prefer a deeper scrub.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harsh on my sensitive skin, not for everyday use. If your skin is tougher it might work.</li>
            <li> My skin feel good after using this brush.  I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but this brush removes it well.  I use it with the exfoliant it comes with 2-3 times a week.  In between, I use it with Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser.  My skin just feel cleaner after using this brush.</li>
            <li> This is so wonderful, leaves your skin soft. I use it with an apricot scrub( Or natuural ) because I dont like using micro beads because they contain plastic. I also use it to clean my rings!</li>
            <li> Works best with the Olay &amp;#34;designed&amp;#34; cream, which I do not particularly like...I rather use a different cleansing agent but ...</li>
            <li> After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to purchase the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System.  I have not had it a month, and the battery compartment is completely rusted.  It even specifies that it is safe for use in shower.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people complain the battery gasket will wear out or they&#x27;re hard to replace. I&#x27;ve had mine almost 3 years, use it daily and have changed the battery once! ONCE! I change the head about twice a year. I can&#x27;t compare it to Clarisonic because I&#x27;ve never had one, but I think it works great. I use a homemade scrub that&#x27;s just 8 oz. face wash with 2T baking soda. My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> awesome price, fast shipping! :)</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my skin.  Just wish it had a little more power and didn&#x27;t go through batteries as fast as it seems to.</li>
            <li> Just received the kit 2 days ago so far have notice my skin completely different much more clean and bright loving it♥</li>
            <li> Ok but the electric is better</li>
            <li> Great little tool. Does the same work as the Clarisonic at a fraction of the price. Well worth the price</li>
            <li> This product arrived in record time.  I&#x27;m so happy with the ProX face cleaner, it leaves your face feeling clean and baby soft.  The exfoliating renewal cleanser is also great, I&#x27;m still using the sample that came with the product.</li>
            <li> What can I say that hasn&#x27;t been said about this product before.  It is a wonderful little system that has truly made a major change for the better in my skin.  I have very sensitive skin and was afraid this type of brush would be harmful for my skin. Boy, I was wrong.  It is wonderful to have really clean skin every morning with a gentle brush.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> This brush is really great.  Surpassed my expectations!</li>
            <li> I have had a battery powered face cleaner for 10 years. My old one has a buffer as well as a face massager. This Olay product is different. It cleans better than anything I have used, including the Clairsonic.(Sells for over $100) Your face will look and feel cleaner. Using the Olay products is a plus. The exfoliating lotion will leave your skin soft and youthful. I have very sensitive skin so this will work for anyone.</li>
            <li> This facial cleansing system does a really good, but unfortunately, the motor broke after a month. I used it just three times per week on my face. First, I thought the batteries ran out, so I changed them. Then with the new batteries it wouldn&#x27;t spin unless I spun it. Finally got tired of manually spinning something that&#x27;s supposed to work automatically and so I parked it on my bathroom tray. It&#x27;s my second order from amazon that has been faulty. The third time will be it for me.</li>
            <li> I can tell that it really cleans my face after use. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but I like this.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, really cleans the skin very well, easy to use in the shower and the price is great value - prices</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and I have seen an improvement . I may buy more for my granddaughters as then tend to neglect their skin</li>
            <li> I bought this and love the results so much have reordered the cleaner twice.  Highly recommend to anyone.  Really helps clean deep pores.</li>
            <li> Great little cleansing b rush and very reasonable.  Not a lot of power but I guess that is done on purpose to not really scrub your face too hard.</li>
            <li> After my daughter used a similar product at a friends house and I noticed how her skin glowed I read reviews for both high end moderately priced products.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a crazy amount for something that I may not care for.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks with my regular cleanser and the sample provided a few times a week and my skin is looking much better. (A little history, my skin although not terrible is prone to cystic type pimples sometimes)  I&#x27;ve used other products that have cost way more for the monthly membership and didn&#x27;t make my face look as good.  I love how the brush head feels on my face and feels super clean after. So far I&#x27;m happy with it and will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I can figure out the point of this device. Can I not just scrub around exfoliating face wash without it and get the same result...? I think so.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to find the best face scrubber, the clearasonic was named the best but I don&#x27;t have $250 to spend on something so small. So this is by far named the second best, it&#x27;s water proof which is amazing because you can wash your face in the shower which I find cleans better because your pores are open due to the steam from the hot water. My skin has improved so much and with the warm weather coming I can&#x27;t wait to wash all the oil and dirt off!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Hard core top of pores soften and then are gone after a few days.  Then because that hard core is gone, the cleaning can begin.  After the cleaning is kept up for a while, the pores get smaller, and smaller.  This is coming from a 53 year old woman who has had hard cored, large pores all of her life.  Now I have a soft face, and I am so happy.  Something simple like that can make a woman feel sooooo good.  Plus a clean face shows the wrinkles less, or a dirty face shows the wrinkles a lot more.  Younger looking and soft skin.  Win Win</li>
            <li> I like this system very much.  Very easy to use and the brush head lasted as expected for normal use.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my blackheads, and honestly I do better with a washcloth and STRONGER exfoliate than the one they give you with this product. I recommend the Apricot Scrub you can get at any drug store.</li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s prone to acne and breakouts, and has discoloration.  I purchased this 4 days ago along with the OZ Natural Vitamin C Serum and have used it approx. 7 times.    I washed my face with my usual cleaner, and applied the Serum.  The results are remarkable.  My tone is slowly becoming more even and my face feels cleaner.  I can only imagine how my skin will look in a few more weeks!</li>
            <li> My face feels really, really clean, haven&#x27;t felt that way in years!</li>
            <li> Really nice and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;I have used mine for more than a year and my skin looks clean and Healthy</li>
            <li> Although I had wanted the Pro-X for sometime I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the drug store price.  Was super happy to find it on amazon.  My face has never felt cleaner at the end of the day.  I love this product and look forward to long use.</li>
            <li> I loved this product it made my face feel great hope to find more olay products that work as good as this</li>
            <li> I really like my new Olay Cleansing System for it seems to make my skin feel softer and more radiant and also is helping me keep down any problems I may have with acne, I would recommend the purchasing of it.</li>
            <li> Cleans the skin throughly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this facial cleaner. I have combination skin, and this works for both. It makes my face feel super soft and gets almost all the pores. It also arrived very swiftly! Highly recommend it to anyone. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive ones, this one works just as well!</li>
            <li> Feels great while you are cleaning your face and it feels great afterwards as well as your face definitely feels cleaner. I used up the cleanser so I am using the product I normally use and it works just as well.  My pores do seem to be smaller.  I like it so much I tend to wash a little longer in certain places where the pores are bigger (especially in the summer because of oily skin). I feel that it helps get the oils out and keeps the pores smaller.</li>
            <li> My wife loves, works very well.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser, works perfectly I use it every day no issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin smooth and cleans perfectly. Very happy with the worthy buy.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to receiving this product.  It feels really good when you use it.  I have sensitive skin but don&#x27;t normally have problems with breakouts.  Ever since using this product, I have had breakouts from the second time I used it.  I thought maybe it would get better but it is actually getting worse.  I am going to have to discontinue using it.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower every other day on my face and neck.  Two weeks after using this product two coworkers asked me what i am doing lately on my face - &amp;#34;it looks so smooth, and fresh and healthy&amp;#34;.  No lie.  this is a great product. Only wish they would give three brush heads and charge us a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Use it every day over the sink and in the shower. I use it along with my proactive xout and those stubborn black heads that I&#x27;ve been fighting with for years have been going away ( knock on wood) and staying away.  My skin looks the best it  has since I started breaking out at the age of 15 I&#x27;m 28 now. I&#x27;ve tried every product out on the market since the age 15. The proactive xout works great but with the olay face brush my skin looks amazing. Thanks Olay for making a great product.  Worth the money!  Even if any thing goes wrong with the product I would buy again!</li>
            <li> This brush is so useful and amazing! You can feel it clean through your skin and just exfoliate your pores! It&#x27;s $29.99 at target and sometimes the price on amazon waivers up and down, right now it&#x27;s $23.99 and I bought it for $21.99! Buy it when it&#x27;s cheap, not like it&#x27;s already cheap compared to other brands like the Clarisonic that is over $100!!! You do not need to spend that much on a machine and goes in circles!!!! I&#x27;m just disappointed about the pricing about the replacement brushes for this product. It&#x27;s $8 for 2 and I just think that&#x27;s a little over charge thinking that the product I bought for $21.99. for $8 I would expect 3 heads replacements not 2. They last 3 months per replacement too, and if you use it every day it might actually only last you 2 months! In the long run it&#x27;s definitely cheaper than the other brands!!!</li>
            <li> Must have!  Came on time and works well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the clarisonic and now the olay pro x.&lt;br /&gt;I like the clarisonic better  but the difference doesn&#x27;t justify the difference in cost.</li>
            <li> I was amazed by the amount of dirt this picked up the first time I used it! Better than my facial wipes or my washcloth. But the best part is the massage that my face gets - it feels like a spa treatment every time I use it. I don&#x27;t use the recommended cleaner with it, just Yes to Cucumber Daily Gentle Cleanser because my face is sensitive to chemicals. Since I&#x27;ve been using this tool, my skin is smoother and softer. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face the way I like it. Couldn&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the Pro-X because I also own a Clarisonic Pro and thought my opinion may be useful to some buyers. First off, I originally purchased a Pro-X at my local Walmart but then returned it after seeing the price of this one on Amazon. It was $15 cheaper on Amazon and included batteries and a second brush head. I also received a red Pro-X and not a white one as pictured in the product description. The red is attractive and I don&#x27;t store my Pro-X out on my bathroom counter so the color wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my Clarisonic Pro (for body and face) about 11 months ago. I bought it on Clarisonic&#x27;s website on sale. It came with a 2-year guarantee. Well it stopped working after 11 months. I called Clarisonic and waited over 30 minutes on hold before speaking to a Customer Service rep. Clarisonic replaced it but would only issue a new 90-day warranty, which was a little upsetting to me. If it stops working after 90 days I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy another one. Their customer service was really lacking. When I asked them why my warranty wasn&#x27;t 1 year on the replacement device they told me that was because they only have a 1% failure rate. If they claim their failure rate is so low then why not provide a reasonable warranty on a product that I spent upwards of $200 on?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Pro-X because I had to return my broken Clarisonic (they paid postage) and was waiting for them to mail me the replacement. My reaction when using the Pro-X for the first time was how different it is from the Clarisonic. The Clarisonic pulsates. The Pro-X rotates. Because the Pro-X rotates clockwise I found that I had to gently move the Pro-X in a counterclockwise motion or it would walk right off my face. The Clarisonic is clearly the luxury item with the Pro-X being the standard item but was the Clarisonic really that much better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the question became, which unit better cleaned my face? To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure if the Clarisonic cleansbetter. In fact, I use the sensitive brushes on my Clarisonic and they still feel somewhat abrasive. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but the Clarisonic feels very aggressive. I liked my Clarisonic best when using about it only about every 2 or 3 days. On the other hand, the Pro-X had a gentler brush which I really like. I grew to really like using the Pro-X during the 2 weeks I was waiting for my Clarisonic replacement. It was smaller, lighter and more gentle than the Clarisonic. I could use it every day without irritating my skin and I still felt that it was cleaning my skin and removing any dry or flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of using the Pro-X at least once a day, it really started to grow on me. As I said before the Clarisonic is very different and definitely feels like a high end luxury product, but I couldn&#x27;t stop wondering if it was really a better product than the Pro-X. In the end, now that my replacement Clarisonic has arrived in the mail, I will continue to use the Pro-X and the Clarisonic alternating the two. If you&#x27;re on the fence about which one to buy I would say if you have the money and like luxury items buy the Clarisonic. Keep in mind that because Clarisonic is so popular right now you may find their Customer Service really lacking if your unit stops working. But if you want a good cleaning brush for an affordable price then definitely go with the Olay Pro-X.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel softer and cleaner, but still not sure it&#x27;s doing much for my acne.</li>
            <li> I like this little brush, it does wonders!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical buying one of these.  After TONS of research, I decided to go with this one -- as it has great reviews.  I saw some people saying that the brush is too harsh for their face, but I felt it was super soft...maybe a little too soft, but you can change that with the pressure you apply it with.  I&#x27;ve used it in the shower and it&#x27;s definitely water proof, although I don&#x27;t drench it under the running water.  It&#x27;s small and portable which is nice.  I wish it came with a little bag, but a plastic baggie works just as good if you are traveling.  The mini cleanser that comes with it is nicer than I thought.  I like the tiny granules in it.  I feel like my face it getting cleaner.  All in all, I feel like when I use this, my face feels cleaner and softer (and I use my own cleansers).  Many people say to use foaming cleansers, but I&#x27;ve used all kinds.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> My skin gets smoother after i use this product!!! I really love it! Doing it everyday...</li>
            <li> Great price! I bought one for both my mom and I, we both use it daily now and would not consider washing our faces without it!</li>
            <li> Works great, love this product!!</li>
            <li> At first I loved this and used it daily.  Then I noticed my skin was getting worse.  I used the appropriate Olay expensive soap and the recommended frequency so I was confused.  I even purchased the brand name replacement heads thinking that maybe I was just using dirty heads.  Why was my 30 year old skin reverting to my teenage years?  I thought maybe it was exfoliating off and it was all part of the process so I gave it so more time.  I&#x27;m not sure why.  I&#x27;m apparently a sucker for marketing.  Don&#x27;t be a sucker for marketing.  I later learned that all this stupid thing does is push the dirt down deeper into your skin!  So for my acne prone skin, it just basically brought the acne out.  I now use it to clean tough spots on my tub so it&#x27;s not a total waste;-)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good cleaning system and I love this one because I can use it in the shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally bought this.  I&#x27;ve always wanted one but afraid to spend the money on it.  I really enjoy it and I can&#x27;t tell you that it gives great results but it is great for cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> This product seriously did wonders to my skin</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend because she has one at her house and I wanted her to have one at my house. It is what it says it is, and does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I am totally disappointed in this item. The batteries don&#x27;t last very long and I was having a hard time getting the button to hit the right spot before it would turn on.</li>
            <li> Great for the price.  Will hold up against the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Skin is so smooth!</li>
            <li> I loved the brush, but the cleansing system made my face break out. I guess the produce was too strong for my face.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied...I had a similar one several years ago...but am more satisfied with item...works very well..And feels very good on my skin</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the quality of this product when comparing the price to others but it is great!  My 13 year old keeps &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; it so I am going to have to buy another.</li>
            <li> This cleans my face better than ever before and I am still using Cetaphil (which is not expensive).  I have cleaner and smoother skin.  It works in the shower just fine.  This is a wonderful product.  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> This is a great value for a cleansing brush. There are two speed settings, but neither one is too strong. I have sensitive skin, so it is pretty good for me. However, I wouldn&#x27;t mind one faster setting for exfoliating my nose area. This was about $21. Where as the Clarisonic is over $100 - some models are even close to $200. To me, that is ridiculous to spend that much on a cleansing brush, when you can get a nice one or $21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish it could stand up by itself on the counter. The round bottom makes that impossible. I enjoy the small size. I think it will travel nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the clarisonic and this and there is no noticeable difference. Oh yeah -the inflated price of the clarisonic. Skip the pricier version-you&#x27;ll get the same cleaning and exfoliation but at a drugstore rather than department store price. Refill brushes are much cheaper too.</li>
            <li> saved so much buying this online!! sooo glad and it came so quickly!! and brand new in the box!! it works beautifully and  love the way my face is looking and feeling!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it once a day, every other day with my own face soap. Due to the fact that I have sensitive skin everyday use would be too harsh on it. But this product gives you a great clean and leaves your skin feeling soft. I have seen a (good) difference in the appearance of my skin with the use of this product among others. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Olay is one of my favorite facial products.  I purchased this item in hopes of getting better results removing make-up and deep clean pores.  I like it and it works, but I thought the “head” would move a little faster.  I also don’t feel like I am getting a deep down clean as I thought I would, but it does give a good cleaning.  You can’t rely only on a brush.  The cleanser you use is important too.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It is priced just right and does what I want it to do. My face feels cleaner and softer and I really appreciated the face wash that was included in the package.</li>
            <li> I have a really oily face with a lot of black spots, using it on a daily basis has help reduce both problems, very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> really good product, love it!!! easy to use, and it is comfort when touch the skin, clean the skin pretty good</li>
            <li> This was fairly priced and seems to work well to help clean out pores and keep blemishes away.  Make sure you keep the brush itself clean.</li>
            <li> The brushes were very soft, and i don&#x27;t feel like it was any better than using my own hand to clean my face.</li>
            <li> it is good but the brush it&#x27;s a little bit  hard for my face..but the price is very nice comparing to Clar..</li>
            <li> good product really work leave my skin looking clean and soft and youthful looking I even purchase my husband one Thx</li>
            <li> For the money, works just as well as high priced cleaners. After use your skin feels fresh &amp; clean &amp; renewed!</li>
            <li> This product is so great and Amazon has a great price.  I saw the same package at Costco for $10 more.  The brush is very soft, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  It took me almost four months before I felt like I needed to replace it because the bristles were wearing out.  I have acne-prone skin so I use the cleaning system with Neutrogena&#x27;s Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub.  The texture of that wash is comparable to the Pro-X cleanser that comes with it but it is medicated.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and I feel like my pores are a lot clearer.  It&#x27;s also great to use just with warm water to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> Love it- super easy to travel with, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I also think it&#x27;s just the right amount of cleansing/exfoliating for sensitive skin. I also have the Clarisonic, but prefer this because you can use it in the am and pm without making your skin feeling like you&#x27;re over-doing the cleansing/exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I use this system once a day and I definitely have cleaner, brighter, softer skin.  My pores on my nose are clear and my face seems to have less blemishes and has a brighter appearance. Being in my 40&#x27;s I don&#x27;t have acne issues, but I do notice an overall healthier looking complexion.</li>
            <li> This cleansing brush is compact and perfect for my facial cleansing routine. I use one regularly at home, and as I travel fairly frequently and do not wish to pack the brush I use at home, I bought a second brush and gave myself the indulgent pleasure of brush I use exclusively for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike another more expensive brush I also have for my home use, this brush is lightweight and requires little space in my luggage. It is gentle on my skin and very effective, and a fraction of the price of my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The package arrived on time, well packaged, great price, and me and my daughters use it.  So far I have had it a few months, it is used alot and we have had no problems with it.  We keep it in the shower most of the time just switching heads for each person and our faces have never looked better.  We haven&#x27;t even had to change the batteries yet.  Which now that you mention it is the only problem.  Trying to get the battery compartment open is a challenge, but a problem that we can overcome.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; I use it all the time! It&#x27;s easy to clean out the brush. I couldn&#x27;t beat the price either. I found it here for $20, it sells for at least $30 at target &amp; walmart.</li>
            <li> Everything it said it was!! A great price compared to the other retailers!! Makes my complexion smooth and clean.....love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the Clarisonic and I seriously love it. I&#x27;ve never had any skin issues but after months of using this daily I&#x27;ve noticed such a difference in the brightness of my skin. I would repurchase again in a heartbeat</li>
            <li> the first i used it i can see the difference, it made my face a lot smoother and not many acne appears as they usually do. So i love this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Clarisonic yet so my review won&#x27;t help those out with which one to buy. But like me, who couldn&#x27;t and will not(maybe) pay $200 for Clarisonic, then this is a device for you. Pro-X works extremely well with 1/6 of what you pay Clarisonic. Honestly, this works better than washing with my two hands. My skin felt so smooth the few times I washed them. It&#x27;s a cheaper alternative! Better than washing with your bare hands or paying almost $200 for cleansing device.</li>
            <li> Not anything close to brand name alternatives. Battery charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough to give any real scrub.</li>
            <li> Two years later I&#x27;m still using it. Wish it rotated a little faster, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this product. It is totally bang for the buck; easy to use, cleans and declogs the skin, so my skin feels fresher, brighter and smoother. Works well on getting rid of blackheads and whiteheads too.</li>
            <li> Love Olay products. I use the system every 2nd or 3rd day at night. My skin looks and feels wonderful afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great product, I love it. I&#x27;m very grateful, it&#x27;s cleaning my face very well. Easy to use. Super price. Fast and careful shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend this product and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> that´s ok, a good piece, grand seller</li>
            <li> good help my skin to get smooth but the black spot in the noise not remove</li>
            <li> Awsome how it cleans my face</li>
            <li> love this brush....better deal than the $200 ones</li>
            <li> Its nice and works great</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush for acne prone skin. Gets rid of dirt and make up left over from thoroughly washing the face. Great on sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> Just received mines and im in love with it already. I highly recommend you get this</li>
            <li> It was ok for the price. Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> Great price for these and they make your face feel so clean and smooth after using it!</li>
            <li> very nice for dairy use.</li>
            <li> Works great, makes my face feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> Hahaha, I love this product! I am so grateful I found it at a cheaper price because I would not have bought it at a regular price initially. However, seeing how well it works, I would be more than willing to pay full price if I had to. It does a great job rejuvenating my skin and making my dull skin look alive!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it out of the box, put it in my bathroom drawer and went to use it this morning and the brush keeps falling off and wont stay on. It&#x27;s obviously broken but it totally sucks this happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to get a replacement :(</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT WILL LOVE TO GET ALL MY BEAUTY THINGS HERE LOVE YOUR SITE WILL STAY WITH YOUR SITE</li>
            <li> I use it every day and my skin is left with a clean shine. My skin appears younger and less dry.</li>
            <li> I always thought these were a gimmick but then my dermatologist told me to get one. She didn&#x27;t say which kind so I went for the cheaper version and it has been amazing. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 12 year old granddaughter. I have a Clairisonic and she loved it so I thought I would give this one a try. Well worth the money!! Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, and it works, but I wonder what the Clarisonic is like because supposedly with the Clarisonic, the bristles move so fast that you can&#x27;t see them move with the human eye.  When I watch the demos on QVC, the Clarisonic (Mia) seems to work super fast on waterproof makeup.  The makeup is completely gone within a matter of seconds.  I&#x27;ve not been able to achieve the same results with this though.  Who&#x27;s to say that the same results would be duplicated with a Clarisonic?  (I might be upgrading, and keeping this as a body brush.)  I must say that I was happy with the price, which makes experimentation affordable, especially with Prime Shipping.  The Clarisonic that I wanted was about $150, it was nice to be able to try the Olay before committing to the Clarisonic. I do experience a little sensitivity/dryness, but I can handle the Clarisonic (at least I think I can).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olay has two settings, a slower setting and a fast setting, but not so fast that you can&#x27;t detect movement of the bristles (like the Clarisonic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it works, and it&#x27;s better than using paper towels (better for the environment/less trash), which is what I normally use because wash clothes aren&#x27;t supposed to be good for your face (unless you bleach them).</li>
            <li> I like this do hicky its great makes my skin smooth and doesn&#x27;t irate it. I need to buy the whole Olay skin system</li>
            <li> Ok i really like this. It cleans my face and for the price i think it&#x27;s perfect for the daily routine. I&#x27;ve seen it selling regular price $35 and up and no way im spending that much less $150 for a clarisonic. This does the job, get my pores clean and i&#x27;ve seen and felt a difference since. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare this to the Clarisonic because I don&#x27;t own one.......yet. My backstory: I&#x27;ve always used a hand scrubbing pad to exfoliate my face. I&#x27;ve used the Oil of Olay Pro X for 10 days now and yes I see a difference in my skin. I have good skin to start with, no major issues, don&#x27;t have too many blackheads but I do have a few areas that get the start of blackheads and get dull. In 10 days it&#x27;s all gone but I&#x27;ve also washed my face day and night for 10 days so that might also have something to do with it. When I was going between the $150 Clarisonic and this I decided to try this first and if it worked and I stuck with it after a year then I would upgrade to the Clarisonic. My friend has a Clarisonic and I tried hers 2 weeks ago, that&#x27;s what got me started on this quest as I watched her stand there as she held this thing on her face and it was magically clean. It&#x27;s face washing for dummies. I tell you I am tired at night with kids, husband, house and job. The last thing I want to do is wash my face. With this I just hold my hand up to my face and I think about first world problems. Why is moving my hand with a washcloth so much effort when I exercise for an hour a day? I don&#x27;t understand it myself. This brush moves around in a circle and it does pull your under eye skin if you get it to close. The Clarisonic vibrated its brushes back and forth so I don&#x27;t think there was as much pulling. I&#x27;ve gotten used to the circling of the brushes and overall think my face is cleaner and I&#x27;m happy I went with this first to make sure it&#x27;s what I wanted as well as me sticking with it.&lt;br /&gt;I believe I&#x27;ll purchase a Clarisonic in the future after this dies or after a year. I think it does a much better, and much quicker job at getting the job dome.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is amazing. It leaves my skin soft and clean looking after every use. I use it twice a day on my skin and the heaviness of makeup and oil completely disappears!</li>
            <li> I like this brush for gentle everyday cleaning. Just not good enough for an exfoliator. My opinion. I have been using it for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this, I was using the Clarisonic Mia2. Wow, I am so glad I returned the Clarisonic and bought the Olay Cleansing System. They are a but different. But the differences are what made me keep the Olay cleaning system. The Clarisonic is a bit more harsh (which may work for some people) but for me personally, it would dry my skin a bit too much. It also doesn&#x27;t spin! Oh ya and its ridiculously expensive! The Olay SPINS! It is a bit more gentle but somehow my skin feels way more clean and polished than it did the other. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone. Even if you don&#x27;t have any skin issues, for the price its so worth it to have this little luxury that is so inexpensive. I love it and couldn&#x27;t imagine not having it.</li>
            <li> I feel my face gets clear using a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highest setting isn&#x27;t that high. I had one of the original Olay face cleaners and that was so much better.</li>
            <li> Affordable and has good quality,! Its a little bit smaller than the other brands but its ok since its just for the face.</li>
            <li> My spouse uses.  It seems to work.  Good price.</li>
            <li> This product is a joke.  I thought I was getting a cleaner with two brush heads when it cam I only had one.  I had already thrown the box away or I would have sent the product back.  You could go to Walmart or Kmart and see what you&#x27;re getting and probably save money at the same time.</li>
            <li> I will order this product again. It made my face feel refreshed and clean. I would reccomend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> The head is just about the right toughness, it&#x27;s simple to use. I purchased it to keep pimple away from my face and it worked like a charm. I use it twice a day and also find that the makeup (I only put makeup on occasionally) actually stay on better. Did I mention if you want to get rid of makeup, this works great too?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks now and I love it! It makes my face look so much brighter and feels so much cleaner. A little cleanser goes a long way. I have been using this everyday and I feel it really deep cleans. I purchased the cleanser and 3 replacement brushes when I ordered the Olay Pro X. I would highly recommend this to anyone. I like the fact that you can use it in the shower and not have to worry about it getting wet. I am going to get my daughter one for her birthday.</li>
            <li> It is amazing for on the skin, and your skin becomes super soft. Amazing product, would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay $200.00 for that \\&quot;famous\\&quot; brand one so I bought this. I LOVE it. I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and I have great skin to begin with and this makes my skin feel SO soft. The motion of the brush feels great on my face and it feels like I&#x27;m being pampered. I also love the cleanser that came with the kit. I plan to buy it in full size when the generous \\&quot;trial size\\&quot; runs low. The motor is quiet so it&#x27;s not loud. I think for $30.00 this is a great product!!</li>
            <li> Really impressed with this product.  Its v quick and easy to use and I noticed an amazing difference the first time I used it.  No need to use harsh exfoliators or masks anymore, the brush is just the best.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day. It is much softer and gentler than I thought it would be. My skin feels great after using it. The tube of cleanser that came with it seemed very skimpy but I also use St. Ives Green Tea Scrub which I prefer. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase the Olay cleaner. It has two speeds and I use the faster one. It is so gentle I don&#x27;t think it would irritate skin unless there was a problem to begin with. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System (spin brush) is a jewel!  I absolutely love, love, love it!!  The bristles are soft against your skin and leaves your face feeling clean, smooth and refreshed.  Easy, too, I use it in the shower.  It is compact and battery operated; very convenient.  I feel as if I just had a facial whenever I am finished using the brush.  Thanks, Olay, for this great product!</li>
            <li> The brush is perfect! I had been using apricot srubs to get my face clean, but they started hurting my facial skin and so I had to stop using them. This brush is gentle for the facial skin and cleans perfectly. I have just used it for two days, but I am already in love with this product. I used it with the Olay definity Illuminating cleanser as my skin tends to be dry sometimes. The combination seems to be excellent - this brush and the cleanser. I shall use this brush as long as I can and would recommend it to all who need a clean face without trating the tender facial skin harshly.</li>
            <li> I have used it - I like it.. It&#x27;s very much like the buffer I was using from Susan Lucci.  I also think you could use it with other cleansers. I also like that you can use this one in the shower - that&#x27;s a nice feature.  Also, I think anything that massages your face will probably have to help flex your skin and give it more elasticity which will in turn help to moisturize and lighten your wrinkles. However, I think the cleansing solution is a bit high at around $20 per tube (6oz) and I think the replacement brushes are not that cheap either - they go for roughly $5 a brush. Over all I recommend it.  Marilyn Riggs</li>
            <li> I could never afford the clarisonic facial brush, so I figured I would try the Olay one. Good choice, the brush is soft and I massage it all over my face...works wonderful. So glad I bought it:)</li>
            <li> Fiddling with my skin isn&#x27;t really my thing; a drug-store cleanser and moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go.  But sometimes gadgets just call my name, and this one did. I wish I could tell you ITS name--what is it, anyhow? Yes, an Advanced Cleansing System, but I wish it had a easier-to-grasp  and more descriptive name. I suppose it&#x27;s an exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naming issues aside, it DOES have an easy-to-grasp handle, feels good and solid in the hand. It&#x27;s got a soft, flat brush that rotates at two speeds, and it&#x27;s easy to turn on and off.  It runs on two AA batteries and getting that organized was a challenge: you have to guess where the batteries go, and the directions say \\&quot;Gently rock the battery compartment side to side while pulling to release battery cover ...\\&quot; There is no \\&quot;gently\\&quot; about it, you have to work hard to get it open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it odd that there was no product insert, only the rather brief instructions on the box. But once I got using it, I realized there&#x27;s not that much more to say. You wet your face and the brush, use a bit of the cleanser that&#x27;s included (or, of course, your own), turn the brush on and \\&quot;gently move it around the face for approximately 60 seconds.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire .... cleansing system ... is supposedly shower-proof, which is why the battery compartment is sealed so tightly. I am not a fan of mixing batteries and water so I&#x27;m exfoliating at the sink, and will continue to do so. Running the brush over my face is quite relaxing and pleasant, not harsh at all as long as I pay attention.  I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s done anything dramatic for my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t harmed it that I can see, and it&#x27;s a nice bedtime ritual that makes me feel pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare it to any other product, but if you want a gentle massage and exfoliation without getting into it in a big expensive way, this Olay Professionals product is a good entree. I&#x27;m surprised at how much I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda Bulger, 2011</li>
            <li> I had not use a cleansing system with an automatic brush on my face before. I do have very sensitive normal skin and this was just not the feel I was responding well to. I used the cleansing creme that came with the Olay product and after applying, I started to motion this all over my face. It was tingly but not in a pleasant way. I only used it a few times. Hmmm. Nothing wrong with it just didn&#x27;t enjoy the feeling. Also, boy was it a hassle to get that battery in there.</li>
            <li> I have problems with adult achy and this produce has help clear up my face very well. I am finding I have less break outs and a bonus...my skin feels and looks great!</li>
            <li> I decided to order this product because I heard so much about it from my co-workers and on blogs.  I&#x27;ve seen the Clairsonic but could not justify spending $200 in this economy.  So I purchased the Pro X Cleansing System.    I can say I am very, very PLEASED and SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE.  This little machine works gently but very effectively, my face feels extremely clean but not \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; after use.  And I&#x27;ve paired it with the Olay Serum right after cleansing and it has made a HUGE difference in my skin in just a week.    I would HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Olay Pro-X cleansing system I must have overdone it a bit because I had some irritation the next day. And I haven&#x27;t had a problem since.  I use it 2-3 times per week at night and rarely 2 days in a row.   It leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.  The batteries seem to be holding up well and I like that it&#x27;s waterproof.  It&#x27;s been such a great product that I can&#x27;t imagine what the Clarisonic must be like because this is all I need at a 10th of the price.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to have a stronger or more stiff brush head.  I use it twice a week, using the pads on the other days.  The pads are too soft, too.  It is refreshing and soothing and I use it with with massaging, cleansing cream to give me the \\&quot;crisper, more invigorating\\&quot; massage.  I feel that gives me a deeper cleanse.  I miss the Total Effects cleansing cloths -the ones without the blue design on them.  Wish I could find them somewhere.  The blue design ones are soft and I don&#x27;t feel that they exfoliate enough.  Just my opinion.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is an impressive looking  device and it works fairly well, my wife took over it and has used it quite faithfully  and although she says her face feels great after each use, cosmetically it has not done a lot. She still uses it and has tried a few different Olay cleansers but hopes it would be better.  Seems to help deep clean the face and my wife says it really does feel clean! Thus is one product you will have to try to see if it works for you!</li>
            <li> You will really see a difference in your skin right away!  I too used another product like this that was VERY expensive.  This is better, less expensive, and you don&#x27;t have to sign up for automatic delivery.  I started with the sample of the exfoliant that was provided before I spent money on the big tube, but after using it for two weeks, ordered the big tube.  In the several weeks that I have been using this product, at least 5 or 6 people have commented on how great my skin looks.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Just a heads up, this pictures for this product are false.  It shows a 5oz bottle of the cleanser, but when I got the product, it has a 0.68 ounce bottle in the box.  Costco has this same product for about the same price, but a large bottle of the cleanser.  I gave it 3 stars because this review is on the vendor, not the product.</li>
            <li> I got my Cleansing System about 10 days ago, and use it every night with the exfoliating cream that came with it. Over the weekend, I noticed my skin was looking really, really good and after some thought, it occurred to me that the only thing I was doing differently was using the System. I am plagued with small regular breakouts and clogged pores even though I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s, and now I&#x27;m seeing a vast improvement in my skin. Olay has put out a terrific product here and it&#x27;s worth every penny of the very reasonable price. If you want to see your skin look brighter, smoother, and several years younger, order this system and use it daily. I can&#x27;t believe the improvement, I won&#x27;t be without this product ever!!!!</li>
            <li> This review is for the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System. This is an excellent product for cleansing your face, leaving it fresh, rejuvenated, and with a healthy glow. The machine runs on 2 AA batteries, and is intended to be used with Olay facial cleanser. One nice point is that this product can be used in the shower, because it is water-proof. The speed of the rotating bristles is just right so that it removes dirt but is still smooth and gentle to your face. Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of this product.</li>
            <li> I am what you would call a naturally pizza faced programmer. Or at least I was until college and I&#x27;ve since been able to avoid pimples like the plague (which I suppose is a far worse fate than a few red bumps). So I was pleasantly surprised to see how well this product worked to keep my face feeling smooth and clean. I&#x27;m not someone who really does any of that exfoiliating stuff -- when I was under the power of the red bumps I used to try everything to no avail so I grew detestful of them. This, however, isn&#x27;t that invasive so I don&#x27;t really mind it and it gets the job done well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general I&#x27;d say give it a try and see how it feels on your skin -- don&#x27;t just take my word for it.</li>
            <li> Good tool for facial cleaning. However not suggested to use it everyday. Once per week should be a nice interval to use it</li>
            <li> I decided to try this cleansing system after years of not being able to achieve clear skin. I&#x27;ve tried proactive and every over the counter brand and nothing worked. So after watching a shopping channel show on the Clarisonic Mia, I began researching that product and more budget friendly versions. After only one day I could see a difference and two weeks later even a bigger change! I&#x27;ve never been so excited to wash my face. My skin just glows now plus the ache and unevenness has cleared up. I&#x27;ve been able to use less makeup now because I don&#x27;t have to worry about covering up blemishes. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to clear up their skin once and for all. I haven&#x27;t had to purchase any new cleansing cream yet, but I think I can use my Mary Kay cleanser since the Pro-X is what seems to bring about the better skin not so much the cream you use.</li>
            <li> I love it.........  after a few weeks I&#x27;ve seen great improvement on my skin....less breakouts and smoother skin  Great for removing makeup</li>
            <li> Works great! Not too coarse on the face.</li>
            <li> I sent this to a truly beautiful 15 year old who has a lovely complexion in the hope that she&#x27;ll continue with that beaufitul skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use mine with low environmental long life rechargeable batteries in it.  I&#x27;m 65; and this has cleaned my skin, left the live skin soft and clean enoughh to moisturize, and now beginning facial wrinkles are less noticeable on my forehead and around my mouth and between my eyebrows.  The tube cleaner is lovely.  It has just enough abrasives to slough off residual dead skin and, if you wear makeup daily at my age, removed ALL traces of makeup.  I use firming creams and moisturizers.,as well as skin tightening preparations round my eyes.  You don&#x27;t use this near your eyes, but oh, the delicious things this does to your face and neck and skin.  WELL worth the money.  It&#x27;s great and I use it morning and evening, usinga nonabrasive PH adjusted facial cleansing bar in the morning before moisturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is WELL worth your money, ,at any age!  Just stock up on spare brush heads and use rechargeable batteries. And CONTACT OLAY AND REMIND THEM TO KEEP MAKING THE BRUSH REPLACEMENTS.  It&#x27;s THAT good!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on skin.  Saved my acne-prone skin.  I now get compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  She wanted something that would help with her acne but&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t afford the expensive one.  I  bought this as a gift and the brushing system is exactly what she wanted and it works great.  The whole box contained everything including the batteries.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love my Olay Pro-X brush! It has really helped clear up my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush isn&#x27;t too harsh on my sensitive skin. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really a fan of the cleanser that came with it, hence the 4 out of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spend $200 on a Clarisonic! Get this one! You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care that it seems a bit girly to use it. I had a beard and was having a hard time getting things nice and clean through the hair. This worked great and I stopped getting zits underneath.</li>
            <li> Really nice brush! I don&#x27;t own a Clearasonic so can&#x27;t really compare, but I&#x27;m really satisfied with this one. And the price..! I use it 4-5 times a week with a gentle face wash and I can already see my skin improve after 2 weeks! It&#x27;s soft, no dry patches anymore, and no impurities. My skin looks healthier and fresh and youthfull!</li>
            <li> This is my first face brush and it&#x27;s really great! I got it for a great price as well. Love it!</li>
            <li> Got this for my g/f for christmas because she had a lot of cheapy face cleaner things to try and really exfoliate.  And figure there had to be something better out there. While she wasnt overly excited to get it as a gift, she does use it every day and says thats its the best she has ever used.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and large pores. I did break out at first but my skin is now looking better. You might have to go through a time of looking worse before you look better.</li>
            <li> useful cleansing brush with soft bristles.</li>
            <li> It seemes a little weak but actually it does a good job at teasing awat dead skin and ingrained dirt. Suprised me so would ecommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is the first one I have ever purchased. The disappointment is my lack of experience with these brushed I think. I was expecting sturdier bristles and the head to move faster.... but it&#x27;s doing the job!</li>
            <li> Works as well as the more expensive brand. I bought this for my son and it helped clear up his acne!</li>
            <li> I had a clarisonic given to me as a gift, but it broke &amp; as much as I loved it I couldn&#x27;t afford a replacement. So I bought this instead. It doesn&#x27;t work as well. It seems like my skin is too dry &amp; the brush head is too soft so it doesn&#x27;t slough off all the dry skin. I use a buf puff pad in the morning now so my face looks fresh &amp; I only use this at night to take off my makeup so it still serves a purpose.</li>
            <li> It is tiny and easy to use it during shower! I was worried about my face would feel uncomfortable, but thats not a problem at all. My face became much cleaner after using it. The Olay cleansing system definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my doctor because I have very sensitive skin. I used it with the sample cleanser that was provided and was very surprised with my skin after one use. I&#x27;m the type of person that reads reviews and will continue to do so because it really does help when a product has the backing of so many other people.</li>
            <li> I love this so much!! It really does wonders for my face! I loved it so much I bought my grandmother one and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> My sister relieve her gift through mail on a Sunday. The shipping was great n fast.  I bought my own Olay brush and I must say, it works. Also the price is affordable. I use my own cleanser</li>
            <li> Made my face so red, I will not use this product again. I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t hurt just made it really red. It worked as specified, but not for me.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not gonna say it&#x27;s better than clarisonic but it&#x27;s nice alternative. I just think it should be cheaper.. nothing special about the brush, it&#x27;s simply a rotating machine operated by AA batteries with a horrible smell exfoliate cleanser sample. think about those cheap simple machine (kids toy or mini fan) you can buy from street vendors or hardware store. Even Home depot would have some simple equipment like this under 10 bucks only difference is it&#x27;s not the brush that would be rotating...so yeah it&#x27;s little overpriced.. msrp should be like $7.99</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I wanted to get this to see if it helped my skin. I am pleased with this cleansing system. I wanted to see if this was a good product &amp; if it made a visible difference so I could decide if I wanted to purchase the Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> I felt l my face was never washed this clean before! I&#x27;m gonna buy more for my sisters and friends as gifts when I see them next year in summer!</li>
            <li> really good product! and cheap. certainly  worth for recommendation. I highly recommend with Olay cleaning product. no need to buy other, more expensive cleaning brush....</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the clarsonic based on cost. Im very glad I did because I used this everyday to help work in my facewash! I dont use the pro-x cream that it came with just my own face washes. It leaves my skin so soft and smooth. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Anyone serious about skincare, whether you&#x27;re 15 or 65, should really consider at least trying this Olay brush. As a female in her early 30s, I&#x27;ve tried so many products that have rarely made good on their claims. I wish I had tried this brush sooner!!! It is extremely gentle even on the higher speed (just be careful around your eyelids!), very compact, and does a near-perfect job of cleansing and polishing your skin (really should be used twice daily for the absolute best results). Skin is definitely rejuvenated, shiny from the cleaning, and amazingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the current subscribe-and-save price, this little baby is unbeatable and the negatives are pretty much completely forgotten about. That being said, this brush is by NO means a Clairsonic.  The Olay brush bristles are very soft and are not available in a \\&quot;deep clean\\&quot; option (although the higher speed DOES get a little deeper into the skin). The brush also does not have a splatter guard as the Clairsonic does - this means that the higher speed splatters water a bit. Not a problem if you use this in the shower, but if you&#x27;re in front of a mirror then it can be a bit of a hassle. I also am not really enamored with the way the brush sits apart from the base (maybe I received a defective model?).  And while one could (and should!) choose rechargable batteries to use in their Olay brush, the battery compartment can be difficult to open (obviously intentional so that water doesn&#x27;t get in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Olay ever updates this product, or if I ever need to replace the entire gizmo, I will not hesitate to get another for myself.  As it stands, I&#x27;ve already found holiday gifts for my mom and mother and sister in laws!</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old woman with sensitive skin with a touch of Roseacea. I really haven&#x27;t had many skin problems. It gets kind of oily in the summer and kind of dry in the winter but nothing serious. I am on a budget and cannot afford a fortune on skincare. My main moisturizer is coconot oil. I have also been using a few drops of Bio oil as a night moisturizer and it has worked quite well. What I really wanted was something to clean my skin and exfoliate without irritating my Roseacea. I tried the Nutrogena Wave and was really unhappy with that. It really sucked and the cleansing pads were just horrible and hard to find to replace. I decided to give the Olay ProX. I am SO happy with this! The sample of cleanser is a decent sized sample and a little goes a long way. The brush has two speeds and does a very thorough job. It is waterproof, so I can use it in the bath or shower without worrying about it getting ruined. One of my favorite things is that I have the option to use any cleanser that I choose, not just Olay&#x27;s, unlike the Nutrogena Wave. This machine really delivered what it promises. My skin got a deep and thorough cleansing. It is so soft, dewey and glowing. I really do like the cleanser that it came with. The exfolating beads are not too harsh and when my skin is properly exfoliated, my skin is much more receptive to any product that I use afterwards. This exceedeed my expectations. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> not use much, but it is ok</li>
            <li> I love this little brush! My face feels so clean and smooth after using the Pro-X cleansing system.  I&#x27;ve had mine for a month now and use it twice daily - morning and night. It cleanses thoroughly without being abrasive. I use the higher speed setting and it&#x27;s still very gentle and does an amazing job at removing all my face makeup and eye gunk. I am very pleased with my purchase and will definitely be ordering the refill brushes. Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it now.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one of these. You skin feels so clean and fresh after using it. Five star in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My face has never been cleaner. However, it doesn&#x27;t get rid of dead skin as much as I had hoped (and why I purchased it in the first place). I am going to continue using it though, because it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Only received my Olay Pro X three days ago. On the first night, I opened the thing up, put the batteries in and turned it on. Looking at it, I thought, \\&quot;Well, this isn&#x27;t going to be much, is it?\\&quot;   In fact, I took the batteries out and put them back in again, wondering if they weren&#x27;t seated just perfectly or something.   I&#x27;m not really sure what I expected; but the brush seemed to turn so slowly that I doubted its effectiveness immediately. After having actually used the thing, however, for three days now, I find that I like it quite well, and wouldn&#x27;t want the brush to turn any faster.   I do not like it well enough to imagine that I would ever want to spend more on a better replacement down the road; but if I continue to like it, I&#x27;d probably purchase another Pro X when this one has spun its last spin.  One thing that really attracted me to this product--other than the low cost--was the fact that you can use it with any cleanser you like. I haven&#x27;t yet tried the sample bottle of Olay cleanser that came with it. I guess I will sometime, but I&#x27;m kind of partial to my own soap, homemade with my choice of oils and other ingredients.  Probably, I will do as I&#x27;ve read that several others recommend, and will limit my use of the Pro X to three or four times a week--after I&#x27;ve used it every day for a just a little while.  It really does feel very good on my skin.  The size is right, too. Easy to handle and store.  One more thing, I don&#x27;t get the problem people are having with opening the battery compartment. The directions are clear. Just read them, otherwise you&#x27;ll probably be trying to twist where it doesn&#x27;t twist--it rocks.   Glad I bought it. :)</li>
            <li> It is gentle, and my face feels adequately exfoliated. I have had a clarisonic previously and I like it just as much, and the value is better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping that it would work just as good as the clarisonic mia. While the pro-x is alright, you get what you pay for. Compared to the MIA this one feels cheap and the battery compartment mechanism is in a super annoying spot. I found myself accidentally popping it open during use on several occasions (one time it happened in the shower. NOT GOOD!). I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, yet I found the pro-x brush to be very very rough on my face. The mia \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush works a lot better and is gentle  The BIGGEST reason why I only gave it 3 stars is that the pro-x brush head only spins, while the clarisonic oscillates. I felt as though all the pro-x did was push dirt around my face, as gross as that sounds. I got better results using an exfoliating cloth.   Overall, the pro-x is just ok, but if you can splurge on the clarisonic</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product for myself and also one for my 22 yr. old daughter. I am completely satisfied with the way this product works, i have seen a drastic change in my complection after using it for only a month. A lot of the damage caused from using Proactive is completely disappearing. I couldn&#x27;t be happier...</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES GET YOUR FACE AND PORES CLEANS FOR A FRACTION OF THE PRICE OF THE CLARISONIC.  I THINK IT WORKS WELL SO I HAVE NO NEED FOR THE OTHER ONE.  I RECOMMEND THIS ONE.</li>
            <li> Having never owned a Clarisonic, I can&#x27;t really compare the two, although I based my decision to buy on another fantastic, in depth review given by a woman who owns both. She says the Olay is a great option for those disinterested in paying $100+. The most common complaints I read from other reviewers were as follows: the Olay version only has two speeds and it&#x27;s too small. I occasionally read that others considered it to be too cheap and poorly manufactured, but that was pretty rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I am unsure as to why you would need more than two speeds. I prefer the faster of the two, but the slower is nice for more sensitive areas. They&#x27;re both reasonable speeds and get the job done. As far as the size, I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s so compact and therefore easy to tote around for trips. It is specifically made for the face, so for those wanting something larger they can use on other body areas, this is probably not right for them. However, I only wanted it for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently using the exfoliating cleanser sample that came with the brush, but will return to using the Olay ProX Acne cleanser I use when I run out. The exfoliating cleanser is very gentle and I have probably the most sensitive skin in the world. The combination of the cleanser + the brush makes my skin insanely soft! I can&#x27;t really speak to how well it will take care of my adult onset acne, but I don&#x27;t see that it will do any harm since it does such a great job of deep cleaning. I would highly recommend this item to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> I have had this little gadget for about 2 months now.  I honestly saw results the day after the first use.  It unclogged pores I didn&#x27;t know were blocked.  As soon as you use it - especially the first time - you can really feel the blood circulating in your face.  It&#x27;s soft enough to not tug the skin, but powerful enough to do its job.  It also helps to open pores in your face if you want to use it on your brows to pluck them.  I have also used it using other facial cleansers with great results too.  I keep mine in the shower, hooked behind the grip hand bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it on a trans-Atlantic flight recently, just removing the head first.  It was completely undamaged.  The only issue is figuring out how to load the batteries, but the most popular review covers that.  It takes a little more force than expected.  I would recommend this to anyone, male or female.  It could be very useful to teens as well.</li>
            <li> This system and brush works well for me. My skin is on the dryer side of normal and feels smoother, but not raw, and looks more even after using the spinning brush head with an oil-based cleanser (not part of the system).  I think my moisturizer does a better job of sinking in after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this because I was looking for an exfoliation product. Friends recommended Clarisonic, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money.  This seemed to be a reasonable alternative.  However, I can&#x27;t compare apples to apples here since I&#x27;ve never tried the more expensive/popular brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it about 2 to 3 times a week, mainly because it takes a little more time in the shower when i use this.  The brush head lasts a pretty long time, i replaced it after about 100 uses (2-3 months).  I haven&#x27;t had to replace the battery yet.  It has 2 speeds, but I&#x27;ve always used the faster of the two.  I wish it spun faster.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by confessing how much I love face brushes. I received this as a gift after already owning the [[ASIN:B001SERK9G Pretika SonicDermabrasion Facial Brush]] and Dermatouch Skin Perfecting System (also sold as [[ASIN:B004BASKAC g-maher Waterproof Rotating Face and Body Cleaning Kit]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can&#x27;t really be compared to the Pretika because this one spins instead of vibrates. Compared to the Dermatouch/g maher/TEI Spa rotating brush, this one is smaller and less abrasive. I like that it is smaller and has the option of two speeds. The low speed is useless to me, but I would use it if I was able to use the pumice stone attachment from the TEI Spa brush set (doesn&#x27;t fit....boooooooo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay really needs to step up to the competition and offer different textures of brush heads. This one is soft and gentle. I doubt that it exfoliates much, if at all. I used it one time to remove makeup and then followed with the Pretika. The Pretika brush head was still a beige color even after washing with the Olay brush. A firmer brush would do a better job at scrubbing. I can understand wanting to err on the side of being too gentle for the masses, but it sucks for people who are already used to using a face brush. I&#x27;m glad I have it and am not disappointed enough to try to return it, but am definitely eagerly waiting until Olay comes out with different brush heads. Then it will probably turn into my first choice face brush. Also, they could very easily and cheaply come out with accessories such as a simple stand and a brush cap to protect the bristles for travel/storage. I mean....even dollar store face brushes come with a plastic cap. Come on, Olay. Get to work!</li>
            <li> The brush is soft so it is great for my pre-teens sensitive skin. Using it once a day cleared up her acne in a week.</li>
            <li> good product...good price</li>
            <li> This is a great buy. Can&#x27;t believe the Clarisonic could be any better. It&#x27;s the basic soft brush attachment, but all I need.</li>
            <li> This item is not what I expected.  It is a very slow, weak motor powered by batteries with a flimsy brush.  It did come with some facial cleanser which is nice but paying this much money for what I got was a disappointment.  I would like to try the more expensive units but I fear they will be a letdown as well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product; but, after using it my face is left red and irritated.  I always use witch hazel after I wash my face and was dissapointed that makeup and dirt were left on my face after washing with this product.  I don&#x27;t think this is worth the $$ if it is leaving my face still dirty.</li>
            <li> Overtime, it clean close to the pores. love it!! The only bad thing is that the head needs to be replaced every couple months.</li>
            <li> Love it. you can go gentile or the faster speed on your skin. Completely exfoliates.  I have a lot of acne and the faster pace sometimes rips the skin. but when my skin starts to dry and peel, it completely gets rid of it, and it cleans my face much better than by hands alone. I recommend it</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a affordable alternative to the Clarisonic, this is it.  It is effective in cleaning all the dirt and grime from your face using your favorite cleanser.  It does not dry out your skin or leave it felling dry.</li>
            <li> For me the Olay Professional brush is a downgrade so to speak.  I bought and owned a Clarisonic for about a year, however after I went on Retin-A, the combination of the two products made my face really raw.  I ended up giving away my Clarisonic to my mom a year ago.  Having been on Retin-A for a year now, my skin has for the most part adjusted to it.  However, I noticed that I had really stubborn clogged pores in certain areas of my face that just would NOT go away no matter what I did.  My face cleared up tremendously with the Retin-A, except for those darn spots.  I also noticed that my skin was looking rather dull and even using salicylic peels and glycolic peels weren&#x27;t helping to exfoliate my skin.  I considered getting another Clarisonic, but really who wants to pay $200 for something to wash your face?  After seeing all the positive reviews here on Amazon, I thought I would try the Olay.  I have to say I am impressed that a cleansing tool this inexpensive really does work and it is gentler than the Clarisonic.  My skin looks fresher, the clogged pores have managed to stay unclogged (after initial help with an extraction tool to expedite the process), and it didn&#x27;t break the bank.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but I hope with continued use, my skin will stay clear!</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget, money well spent.  I may consider using another cleanser as the Olay cleanser tends to dry out my skin.  This also works well removing eye make-up.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product! Daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> my face never felt so good!!</li>
            <li> I bought one for my husband and one for myself.  Let me start by saying that the Olay Pro-X is working beautifully for my husband&#x27;s skin. He has acne prone \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin and this system seems to really deliver.  Me on the other hand, I had such high hopes but it made my sensitive skin much worse.  I have hormonal adult acne with lots of dry patches and i thought the Pro-X would really help get my face clean and buff away some of the dead skin. Well, it certainly did that. I was shocked with how clean my face was. But after 2 weeks of daily use, my face started to get really red and blotchy. It stung to put moisturizer on. My face was shiny (not from oil) and tight. Anything that touched my face made my face turn red and itchy.  I have discontinued the Pro-x for about 2 weeks now and things are going back to normal. My dermatologist recommends Ivory soap and a baby washcloth which seems to be working just as well without the painful side effects.  Anyways, all you sensitive skin people out there, use caution. Maybe use it every other day? or skip it entirely? If you have normal skin, I think you will like this product.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than others I have seen and works fine!</li>
            <li> I have bought this same cleaning system 3 times. I love the way it works, but I use it in the shower (never fully submerged in water) and I have to replace it every year to a year and a half. It stops working or starts works very slowly. It&#x27;s still cheaper than the Clearsonic so I would suggest buying this but be aware you may have to replace it sooner than later.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and it works wonderful. Perfect power for rotation and not weak like I expected it to be. A steal of a bargain quality product compared to the similar $150 models sold through Macys. One of the best buys you could ever make.</li>
            <li> This was well worth the money! It really helps to cleanse my face without being harsh or too abrasive. I love using it each night and my skin has never looked better. I use it with the cleanser it comes with occasionally but still use my basic cetaphil face wash with it and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I see is that because it is battery powered and it gets a lot of use, after a month I&#x27;ve already had to change the batteries twice.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and love how my skin feels. Works great!!</li>
            <li> I have used this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and NutraSonic. First I purchased a NutraSonic from Amazon years ago, and I loved the way it deep cleaned my skin and my enlarged pores and blackheads on my nose. I used it happily for quite awhile, and even a friend had noticed how good my nose looked, and I told her I was using a NutraSonic brush. After awhile my NutraSonic brush did not work anymore. When I pressed the on button, it did not come on or rotate. So I thought, ok, I just need to let it charge up. The NutraSonic plugs into a regular outlet to charge up, not a battery powered brush like the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System. I let it charge for awhile, and it still did not work. I was so bummed because I had gotten such good results with it, but I did not want to throw it out since it was pretty expensive (not as expensive as the Clarisonic, I don&#x27;t think,) but it was still an investment. I figured I could have my dad, who&#x27;s good with electronics since he used to be an electronic technician, take a look at it and hopefully fix it. He did, after all, bring an expensive hairdryer back from the dead for me before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, in the meantime I wanted to go a cheaper route and hopefully at least get some of the same benefits as the NutraSonic. I checked on Amazon for something more affordable, and I came across this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System. It got amazing reviews and a lot of reviewers said it performed as well as a Clarisonic, so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive reviews are right. This Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System works just as well as my NutraSonic did. I was very happy with the performance and results. What you get in the box is the actual handheld device, a brush head that easily pops on and off the handheld device (they also sell brush heads separately so you can change those out when needed,) a small travel sized Olay cleanser, and 2 AA batteries. For the price, it is so worth it. The handheld device is on the smaller size, smaller than my NutraSonic brush, and it&#x27;s pretty lightweight, even with the two AA batteries in it. Meaning you can brush and cleanse your face to your hearts desire without getting a tired arm. The brush head rotates, and the bristles are of the perfect density, not too stiff, not too soft. They get the job done well of deep cleaning (skin, pores, and blackheads,) and gently exfoliating the skin.  The battery life lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s nice that you can just turn it on and cleanse, unlike with the NutraSonic, where you have to plug it in and make sure it&#x27;s charged up. The travel sized Olay cleanser included is a nice cleanser. It&#x27;s got microbeads in it, which paired with the brush is great for gentle exfoliation and cleansing. I keep mine with my travel sized products so I can use it if I run out of regular sized cleanser or while I&#x27;m traveling. It&#x27;s really handy to have on hand. I also love that since it is battery operated, it comes with 2 AA batteries! How thoughtful. I wish all battery operated things came with batteries included. The nice thing about this package is that the batteries are included in the package, but not physically in the handheld device, so you know that the batteries are new and fresh, not sitting in the device just dying. The bottom part of the handheld device is easy to push off and put the batteries in. I read in some other reviews that it was hard to open. I don&#x27;t think so. You just have to know how to open it. Just hold the device with your non-dominant hand at the top of the device (the top part near where the brush head is attached,) and put your dominant hand on the bottom part where you see the separation is, and just pull down. It&#x27;s not hard. It pulls right out, and you can put the batteries in. It&#x27;s marked on the device which side is positive up and which side is negative up. Easy and done. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually gone through two of these Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing Systems now, andI still find that they are worth it. The first one I purchased after my NutraSonic died served me well. It fascinated my young daughter who loved turning it on and watching it rotate, and she \\&quot;brushed\\&quot; her hair with it while it was on and rotating. Since it was rotating, it got caught in her long hair and made some of her hair come out and it got twisted around the part where the brush head attaches to the handheld device. She also liked to give me \\&quot;a makeup\\&quot; which consisted of her turning on the brush and brushing my face with it gently (just the brush, no water or cleanser.) Since she got close to my hairline, some of my hair got tangled in the device too. So needless to say, she loved the brush. So much that due to her hair and my hair being tangled around the part where the brush head attaches to the handheld device, that eventually, the brush died. It was still dead when I tried new batteries. So I had my dad check it out. He opened it up and said that our hair caught around it made the motor burn out, and he couldn&#x27;t fix it. So sadly, I threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty bummed, and I thought my NutraSonic was still dead, so I had to look for another cheaper but still effective replacement. I also shop at Sephora, so I checked out their supply of facial cleansing devices. They don&#x27;t sell NutraSonic, but they have all kinds of Clarisonics and other expensive options. I wasn&#x27;t ready to shell out big bucks for another system, but I knew that my skin, blackheads, and pores needed something effective. So I tried a few of their cheaper offerings. First being the Boscia Konjac Cleansing Sponge with Bamboo Charcoal. That did nothing for my skin, pores, or blackheads. I mean, it cleaned my skin ok, and it was pretty cool since it was a natural sponge, but I needed something with oomph that provided results. Plus the back of the sponge tore and opened up where I held it to clean my face (no mechanism to hold it, since it&#x27;s a natural sponge.) It just had a thin string looped through it so you could hang it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my search continued. Next at Sephora I tried the Sephora Collection Precision Pore Cleansing Pad. I thought, hey, it says in its name it&#x27;s good for pores. I was pretty excited to try it. It&#x27;s a small oval rubber pad with a place on the back to hold it while you&#x27;re cleansing the face, and it has short, little rubber nubs (like short bristles) over most of the surface with a small section at the bottom of raised circular things. I was pretty surprised how small it was, but I gave it a shot. Sadly, I found that it also did nothing for my skin, pores, and blackheads. It also cleaned my skin ok, but like I said, I need results. On the up side of this product, I found that given it&#x27;s small size, it is perfect for cleaning behind your ears. Shamefully, I must admit that while I&#x27;m bordering on fanatical about the skin on my face, I don&#x27;t pay much attention to cleaning behind my ears. That&#x27;s changed since I found another use for this cleansing pad. It is very effective for cleaning behind my ears, and they have never been cleaner. :) I just put facial cleanser or body wash on the pad and clean behind the ears. So while I&#x27;ll probably never use it on my face again, it has found a new life. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, back to Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System. After two failed attempts at trying to find a good, cheaper alternative to the results I desire, I finally broke down and came back to Amazon for this amazing system. Being an avid couponer, I was so happy to see that when I bought this system the second time, there was a digital coupon for $2 off this product! Yay! Sold! I have been happy with this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System ever since. It provides the same ease of use and results that I had found the first time around. It still deep cleans my skin, gently exfoliates, and does great things for the pores and blackheads on my nose. I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, guess what?! My parents are visiting, andI plugged in my old NutraSonic for my dad to take apart and see if it&#x27;s something he could fix for me. To my surprise, after charging up for awhile, I pressed the on button, and lo and behold, it started rotating! It&#x27;s alive! After all these years, I was so surprised in a good way. Without my dad even looking at it! So I told him about it, and he said it was probably because the memory of the battery. I guess it had to be dead for awhile, charge all the way back up, then it would work again. Nice! So now I have my NutraSonic back, and I have this Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System! Win win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, from someone who&#x27;s tried a lot of different things, if you&#x27;re on the fence about this product, and you need a cheaper brush that will provide results, just get this brush set. You and your skin will be happy with it. Good luck, and thanks for reading my review, I hope it was helpful.hang it in the shower.    So my search continued.

            <li> Weak motor, only two batteries,&lt;br /&gt;Buy one with four batteries like gruin</li>
            <li> i LOVE IT makes you feel like your face is not clogged</li>
            <li> My wife and I love it so much. nice product to purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I change my brush heads monthly, which was way faster than recommended, but I dont know, it just seems that with bacteria and whatnot, it should be changed often. MY face feels great, a nice way to exfoliate gently but thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Love it! Skin improved!</li>
            <li> Great product and gift for any lady.  Its a salon facial everyday!</li>
            <li> it is AWESOME and my skin because I&#x27;m a girl is totally smooth</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; at a great price</li>
            <li> Water seeped into my first unit and corroded the batteries, but I liked it so much I bought this replacement.</li>
            <li> Gift to granddaughter and she LOVES it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  My skins feels healthier, smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, especially for the $13 I paid for it. I would not wanted to have spent more however, as it the spinning feature is not very strong and does not come with a variety of heads. It is perfect for the price though and would be good to keep in luggage for traveling, etc. but not sure about relying on it for weekly use.</li>
            <li> Great item my wife loves  it</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this product and it is amazing! I have combination skin, but it is more on the dryer side. After using the olay pro x with my neatrageana oil free face wash my skin feels so soft and clean. My skin literally glows and feels great. I would recommend using the exfoliater cleanser once a week because it is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product 3 times. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 nights. So far, I really like it. I feel like it really cleans my face without irritating it or being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend removing eye makeup first before using it. Because your eye skin is so sensitive, I don&#x27;t use it around my eyes. The first time I used it, I hadn&#x27;t removed my mascara (I usually just wash it off all at the same time)... Well this time I couldn&#x27;t unless I was going to use my hands. I ended up with runny mascara on my face. So lesson learned and removed mascara and eyeshadow first the next day. Much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t use a lot of pressure.  Consider it more of massage for your face. Seems to work better when not pressed hard.  Feels better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews indicate it is difficult to get the batteries in. The box instructions say to rock the battery door compartment back and forth and it will come off. It was simple and not an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash out any left over face wash from the brush. I found that there is less residue in the bristles when you apply the face wash directly to your face than to the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update with further use.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little more powerful. but worked nicely all the same.</li>
            <li> It is very well made.  I find it to do a terrific job in cleaning&lt;br /&gt;my face without any irritation.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does a great job keeping my face clean, refills are cheap too if you wait for sales!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the cleansing effect is good!</li>
            <li> Its really about that sophisticated. Batteries run out often increasing the overall cost to own it. Skin doesn&#x27;t really feel that different. Nothing your hand and some apricot scrub can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> Using it everyday and it works great. I like that It has a spin speed control button.</li>
            <li> Well, I have been using this product for a month. I do not think it is bad product because it is just facial brush and it works well with facial scrap.however I have been using it with netrogina daily scrap and I have not noticed any differences. May be if I change my facial cleaner I may notice differences.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month and it works as expected.  It makes my face feel cleaner and I like that I can use it with just about any cleanser.  I was hoping to reduce the size of my facial pores but it does not seem to do that, though I do feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product! I can see a difference in my skin once I started using this. It&#x27;s amazing too see how much dirt I still have on my skin after removing my makeup. If you&#x27;re like me, and don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a clarasonic, get this! I would say it&#x27;s an outstanding alternative. It went above and beyond my expectation.</li>
            <li> I love this face brush, I&#x27;m amazed I&#x27;ve had the same one for possibly five years. I use it every night, best way to remove makeup. I had to purchase a replacement only because I was changing the battery after a few years use, while I was taking a shower, which I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. I did not let water get inside but the humidity was too much for the inside of the machine. I would  definitely recommend this for your cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have dry skin that flakes and i wanted a way to scrape it off. Washcloths that I used to use would pull my skin and not get all the dead skin off. So this works pretty well, it just spins in circles and doesn&#x27;t tug on the skin. I bought this to make cleaning my face more efficient and I believe this does the job. I don&#x27;t give it five stars because it doesn&#x27;t blow me away like I was kind of hoping for. But my skin is brighter and cleaner and I use this almost every day so I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the tube of exfoliating stuff they give you is tiny, it looks bigger on the picture on the box than it really is, so don&#x27;t be fooled like I was expecting a good sized tube.</li>
            <li> This does the job for some extra exfoliation. I dont recommend using the product that comes with the brush though. It is a kinda microdermabrasion type product and along with the brush is WAY TO HARSH - and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I use it with a cream cleanser like clean and clear or neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected. Worth the price compared to the pricey alternatives. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, my skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while, and I have also been testing out different brushes for the purpose of clearing the skin. I think it worked fine, and I did end up looking better because of it, but there are other brushes on amazon, one of which I tried that is about $12 by Pixnor, that does the same exact thing, and the $12 one in my opinion is actually better, not only because it is the same value for a better price, but because it is a BETTER value for a BETTER price. it comes with multiple heads for exfoliating, cleaning, makeup removal, massaging, and even a pumice one for feet!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it... that is good enough for me. She uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time! It has made my skin wonderful, as good as a the clarasonic</li>
            <li> This little brush is what i expected. It seems too soft at first but when it spin it&#x27;s just perfect. I use it on my face and cleavage and my skin is all soft and absorb moisturizer quick. The lotion that comes with it is too aggressive for my skin so I don&#x27;t use it, but I am satisfied with the brush itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful facial cleaning and gets along well with my sensitive skin!  It&#x27;s quite pricy but well worth it and lasts long.</li>
            <li> Very nice, it helps clean the hidden spot.</li>
            <li> Brush is so soft on the face..and it really cleans.  It is good for circulation and will keep skin healthy looking</li>
            <li> I do really, really like this system. As another reviewer noted, the battery compartment is tricky to get to. However, it&#x27;s worth it - I&#x27;ve had this about two months, and I can see an improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have very, very oily skin - especially if I am lax in my Retin-A use. I don&#x27;t usually have whiteheads, however, I am prone to frequent blackheads and occasional cystic acne. The extra exfoliation helps my medicine reach further down in my pores, and I do notice an improvement in skin tone over the last two months. &amp;#34;Icepick&amp;#34; scars are still there, but discoloration seems better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s not magic. You can use your favorite soap or scrub with it, so your mileage may vary. The included Olay cleanser isn&#x27;t bad, but I won&#x27;t be buying more. Because my skin likes to medicate separately from my cleansers, I prefer Cetaphil or gentle, salicylic acid-free soaps. And if you have delicate skin, I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this really does anything special, but my skin feels very clean when I use the cleaner</li>
            <li> clean skin very efficiently, it does a peeling and is also useful to remove make up using  face cleaning. To use everyday.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the quality and pleasantly surprised with all it could do. Such a wonderful little product! It also doubles as a vibrator!</li>
            <li> I have never received received the product from the seller here. Then I went and bought it from CVS. I used it twice then my face started to break out. At first I thought it&#x27;s the cleanser it came it...I let me skin recover for 2 weeks then I used the brush again with my face wash I have been using for months very successfully. My skin broke out again and this time worse than before. So I figure out it&#x27;s the brush. Maybe the bristles are too harsh or there is something in them that breaks out my skin. Once I stopped using it, my skin recovered and went back to normal. Now I do not have a sensitive skin at all and this was the first time a product irritated and broke out my skin this  badly. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product, I&#x27;d rather stick to scrubbing pads instead which are amazing.</li>
            <li> Love it. Really cheap and work just as much as the 100 bucks one. Buy it and you wont regret it</li>
            <li> This product did not clear my 12 yo daughter&#x27;s acne, but i think it helped, and it definitely gave her skin a dewier, glowy appearance.  It&#x27;s not the end all answer, but it was worth the money.  She also uses it on her chest and back in the shower, which is helping the less severe breakouts she would get in those places.  It is very easy to use in the shower and at the sink, doesn&#x27;t make a mess (I was a little afraid it would be like an electric toothbrush and droplets would fly everywhere), and her skin is brighter.  It&#x27;s a good product for someone her age with acne, since she is not quite old enough to always want to clean her skin thoroughly, even though she desperately wants the acne to be gone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old grand daughter to use because she has acne on her back and shoulders. so far she reports to me that it is awesome . She likes that she can buy lots of products to use with it......Olay made a good product here</li>
            <li> For about three years, I have used St. Ives Apricot Scrub for my face. I love how it cleanses and makes my skin feel! Yet, I was curious about these facial cleansing brushes. Starting a new job was the added boost I needed to look my best. I ventured into Wal*Mart and found the correct aisle. I saw the Olay X-Pro and saw the value was great! I picked this one up and took it home. Later that night, I took my shower and then tried this baby out. I was shocked to see my skin afterwards. It was vibrant and silky smooth. It was easy to use and not uncomfortable at all. The bristles were smooth and did not hurt my sensitive skin. I used the included cleanser and loved it as well. I have used St. Ives Timeless Skin moisturizer for a few years and I can&#x27;t give it up! So, I used it afterwards and the feeling was spa like!&lt;br /&gt;I will also continue to use the St. Ives scrub off and on. I can&#x27;t give it up either! :)</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for a long time, and now into my adult years, I was sometimes embarrassed because of how my face looked. I have very oily skin, which has caused black heads, and white heads. For a while, I would just cover it up with make up, BUT NOW I am not afraid to go out with out make up because of this device.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many products (proactive, dermalogica, prescription medications, microdermabrasions, etc.) And nothing gave me the results like the Olay pro-x brush. I was so hesitant about purchasing a spin brush, because some are very pricey, and reading reviews I could not tell if it was going to be another waste of my money. So after doing research, I went to Ulta (I didn&#x27;t want to wait for shipping), and bought it, took it home and used it right away. It was so great the first time I used it. My face felt so clean! I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it again. The box said to use it 2-3 times daily. I used it 3-4 times a day for the first week, just because it was very calming and relaxing. :) But now I use it no less than 2 times daily. My skin looks and feels amazing. I recommend this product to everyone. The best part is, you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it. I would rather spend a couple bucks on extra batteries, than worry about the device dying.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is has improved drastically within a month of using it, and I now have added confidence! I am not ashamed of my beautiful skin!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I regret, is not purchasing this sooner!!!</li>
            <li> I use this with my own cleanser, but it works very well.  The bristles are nice and soft, and the two-speed function is great.  Good quality overall.  I definitely notice a difference with my skin being smoother and feeling cleaner.</li>
            <li> Well made. Durable. would recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but finding rotating pads that fit well is difficult.</li>
            <li> I am 29 and still prone to oily skin.  I used this for the first time in the shower and there&#x27;s no comparing this to a washcloth and soap!  The bristles are soft (feels good on your face).  It&#x27;s a quiet, lightweight tool. Best yet, my face feels very soft and awake.  In addition to sloughing off dead skin cells and daily buildup, it seems to also stimulate circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably would not want to use it too long (even if it does feel good) because I can imagine that it could be abrasive if over-used.  Use it for 30 seconds and it&#x27;ll be the best 30 bucks you ever spent on your face.</li>
            <li> This thing does make my skin feel really nice after using it in the morning, but by the evening, I&#x27;ve noticed that I always end up with a few small breakouts.  They don&#x27;t last very long, so I&#x27;m not going to quit using it because of them.  The tube of exfoliating cleanser that&#x27;s included is pretty pitiful in size, but I&#x27;m finding that I like using the Pro X with my normal face wash better anyway, so I&#x27;m glad I went with this one for half the price instead of the one that you can get with the large bottle of cleanser.  The bristles are very soft and comfortable on my face and I love that I can use it in the shower. All in all, I think this is a pretty decent affordable version of the Clarisonic-type electronic cleansers.  Feels good without being hard on the wallet.</li>
            <li> I had been considering buying a facial cleanser for a while but the cost was always a turn-off.  I figured that I would try this one first and if I liked it I could always invest in a higher end product.  Well, I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months and don&#x27;t see any need to upgrade.  I was pleasantly surprised to see my skin texture show visible improvement after the first couple uses. Definitely a must-have.</li>
            <li> Got this for my teen aged son who has some keratosis pilaris on his face and he was hoping it would help that and smooth it a bit.  I haven&#x27;t used it as I got it for him but he really likes it. :) This is a really great price too. It&#x27;s around 30 bucks locally in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My face comes and goes with breakouts - there&#x27;s just so many factors that decide if one day is going to be good and another not so good. I&#x27;m not a fan of a big daily face routine so this certainly helps out. I don&#x27;t use their cleanser with the product because I like more natural cleaners but I do use the exfoliator every so often for extra action. It&#x27;s easy to handle, even when you have soap in your eyes. It says &#x27;water resistant&#x27; so I&#x27;m a little nervous about that but so far so good. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s from my natural cleanser but I noticed some...scum? Build up between the bristles early on...kinda gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batteries...I had to watch a video to figure it out and I won&#x27;t launch into how to do it here in my review, just go find a video. I felt like an idiot when I realized how simple it was.</li>
            <li> This is the first facial cleaner I have tried and I wish I had done it long before now. It made my face look and feel so clean. I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this so far... It really makes my face soft and enjoy washing my face every night.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Olay Pro-X advanced Cleansing System a few weeks ago because I&#x27;ve heard great things. Well the item was supposed to get to me at the latest by today and i never received anything. I emailed the seller and got a refund minutes later which I was glad to get. But the sellers reasoning for the refund is they were out of stock. This information would have been nice to know weeks ago but I at least can be happy I got the full refund and only my time was wasted.</li>
            <li> It feels like my face is getting a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told by the user of this, whom I bought it for, this is great! She likes it very much. Not sure of the particulars or what she considered as alternates, but this has apparently worked out for her.</li>
            <li> Love this so much. Leaves my face feeling so fresh. I use it everyday in the shower.</li>
            <li> Soft but does a good job so far.</li>
            <li> A great and reasonable cleansing system.  Use it every day!</li>
            <li> Let me be clear, this product hasn&#x27;t given me any issues. My three star rating is here because the product is weak. There is no strength in it when it touches your face. It just kind of feels like a gentle kaleidoscope of butterflies fluttering on your skin. It probably does clean your skin to an extent, but If I had the chance, I would just save up and buy one of the sturdier ones that will last a long long time.</li>
            <li> great product, very cheap and is the same exact thing as the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> Pay more for one with a better brush for your face.  Great for hands and feet.</li>
            <li> By far the worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. If I could give it 0 stars I would. My combination skin usually only has minor breakouts every now and then. Figured I&#x27;d give this a try to get a deeper clear. Almost immediately after using this I developed horrible cystic acne worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. Had no idea it was due to this device so I kept using it but my face wouldn&#x27;t clear up. After my skin continued to get worse I finally stopped using this brush. After 2 weeks of my skin starting to clear up, I tried using it again. The next day my skin had huge cystic acne all over the lower half of my face. Biggest waste of money. Only used it a couple times and will never use it again. Don&#x27;t even want to give it away to a friend or family member for fear of the same thing happening to them. Be cautious buying this device. Will definitely question buying anything from Olay again.</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate difference in my skin after only a few uses-much softer.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mom, and she loves it. She says she feels like her circulation has improved and that her skin feels better.</li>
            <li> My face has cleared up so fast and my blemishes have gone away. I love love love this. Its a must buy. I feel like it is also making my skin more firm. I am a 26 year old AA female.</li>
            <li> Has already stopped working.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this product.</li>
            <li> So, being a guy I don&#x27;t particularly care for lots of products &amp; messing about with exfoliating, cleansing, &amp; dry skin issues BUT I&#x27;ve been working regularly outdoors for nearly 4 years. I&#x27;ve seen subtle differences in complexion &amp; mainly dry skin so I picked this bugger up. For $20...why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve been using once a day, usually in the morning but sometimes at night as well, &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed a softer smoother skin on my forehead, nose, &amp; around my eyes. I was really impressed at the quick results especially with reduction in blackheads on my nose. I&#x27;ve only used the supplies Olay cleanser but have just purchased the Naturgo Men&#x27;s Clay Face (Black Label) Wash to try once the Olay stuff is used up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use, guy friendly, waterproof, excellent results to date, &amp; makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something significant to keep myself up without a lot of effort.</li>
            <li> I got this to help me exfoliate and cleanse my skin. It works well and hasn&#x27;t broken down on me yet. Only thing I wished was different is the speeds. It has two speeds and the highest one is still slow. I wanted a higher speed to exfoliate my dead skin. But this get the job done if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has been very smooth and fewer black spots on the nose now.</li>
            <li> Amazing! This was indeed worth the prize.</li>
            <li> I love this. I found it a cheaper and comparable (at least, in my opinion) alternative to the Clarisonics.</li>
            <li> I use it all of the time!</li>
            <li> Broke after few times of use...  next time i need to think what to buy</li>
            <li> used this everyday, should have bought it sooner</li>
            <li> I got this product as it had so many great reviews and was at a very affordable price point. I really like it and feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth. My skin feels softer and smoother, however, I don&#x27;t see any noticeable visible difference like some other users experienced. I wasn&#x27;t willing to drop $200+ on a Clarisonic, so this was the next best option I could find, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like the Olay brush. I have used my mother&#x27;s Clarisonic before and it would irritate my sensitive sinuses. I am highly prone to sinus headaches, even an electric tooth brush will make me cringe. Olay&#x27;s brush is an amazing deal and allows me to get my face clean without the negative vibrating annoyance. My skin has never been smoother. Only negative, the face cleanser that comes with it is pretty small. Just wishing it was slightly bigger so that I know if I want to buy the full size or not.</li>
            <li> i like it, my skin feels softer and pores way smaller, i use it at nite time only, they just don&#x27;t mention when to change the brush .</li>
            <li> First try and I&#x27;m hooked! I have very sensitive skin and any kind of facial exfoliant makes me sorry I tried it in the first place but I&#x27;ve been dying to exfoliate. I have combination skin so I have dry patches while some areas are very oily.  Needless to say, I have very dull skin as all the scrubs I have tried (and believe me there are MANY) aggravated my sensitive skin so I cannot continue to use them. I was kind of expecting that this will be another disappointment because I cannot imagine using a facial scrub AND a brush at the same time without it resulting in allergies, redness and everything else. But every time I came across this and read the reviews, I was getting more and more tempted. Lo and behold, it worked! I even scrubbed on the allergy prone areas of my face. This is a miracle! And it truly does seem to make my face cream more effective from the first try. The brush and the exfoliating cleaser, 5 stars each!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, no extra charges, safely packaged. Very pleased with the delivery services.&lt;br /&gt;About the product: it&#x27;s just amazing. My acne is going away from my face finally, clean and small pores! A fair priced replacement of clarisonic. My only concern is in the exfoliating gel, I believe u can replace it with any other. However, 100% positively satisfied</li>
            <li> Have used this product just a couple of times and didn&#x27;t seem to dry my face out. Still too early to tell if it works, but is very gentle and as I said, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and its ok. It does the job but goes pretty slow and I wonder if I could have done better with a slightly more advanced product. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the machine didn&#x27;t last more than two weeks so I don&#x27;t know the benefit. I would say it has only two speeds and neither are powerful. I guess if you are using a grainy scrub you may feel the results. I can&#x27;t see a good clean face with the enclosed wash unless you have a new born baby&#x27;s skin. After 8_10 hours in makeup and city pollutants this didn&#x27;t work for ME. I found a wash cloth worked better. Good luck. One star for the idea.</li>
            <li> Its awesome, cheaper and does that same thing the other brand does that is like 150. I always feel clean and it is so relaxing, plus you can take it in the shower!</li>
            <li> Cheap copy of the real Olay, minimal uses, plan on returning this item . Inexpensive but not very useful or&lt;br /&gt;easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!! Didn&#x27;t wanna splurge on the Clarisonic version before at least testing out this style of cleansing. I use this item with Murad clarifying cleanser. It has worked wonders on my skin so far! I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time</li>
            <li> I suffered from severe acne for a long time. I searched for products that would help. Then I found this product along with [[ASIN:B000V3J4MQ Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Anti-Blemish Daily Cleanser-5 oz]].  My Acne AND the scars from it cleared up almost overnight! I would recommend Olay products to anyone!</li>
            <li> Was nervous about trying it in comparison to clarisonic.  That was my first choice but because I have very sensitive skin I was afraid of brush abrasions.  I prefer to lift with aha&#x27;s.  However this is very pleasant and does not cause any abrasions in my face.  I use it three times a week and will add an extra day after each two weeks.  My pores are tighter even though they were pretty good before the product I can still notice the difference after using.  My skin looks less congested the next day and I&#x27;m not producting as much oil.  Love the system and bought more brushes to keep using.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Better to use a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after using this cleaning system.  Wish I had had it years ago.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the same unit as can be purchased in a store (like Target).  Yes, I paid less on Amazon:  But my unit worked for less than 30 days.  Unit is defective, but the its packaging for return is long gone.  I have totally wasted &amp;#62;$20. on this item!  BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> This product is exceptional! I have used similar products but none compared. My face is so much smoother in this short time. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> I literally just ran from thebathroom sink to write this review!  For almost two months I&#x27;ve been doing research on the best cleansing brush out there. I finally came across a Olay ProX coupon &amp; figured why not... it beats paying $100.00+ &amp; a crowded mall trip!  Well I must say my face feels AMAZING! &amp; I look &amp; feel relaxed, clean &amp; exfoliated! It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny. With or without a coupon!</li>
            <li> I was under the impression with the name Olay on it, it would be more feminine more durable...it&#x27;s just a small handheld one attachable brush with no real power for scrubbing. I expected more for something costing almost 30 dollars, it&#x27;s worth more like $11.99</li>
            <li> Whoa... This thing is tiny, and the bristles are too soft and the whole thing is like a toy...on fast mode it hardly goes... It&#x27;s awful!  I see now the major difference between this and the previous $100 one I bought at the spa.  I feel like this is nearly worthless and I would highly recommend paying for high quality plugin type product... Those kind that vibrate are incredible and amazingly effective.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any spectacular results but nothing bad either. I&#x27;m Not sure that I would  buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love Oil of Olay products and I was not disappointed with this one. My face feels so good after using this product!</li>
            <li> slow spin... wanted something more.</li>
            <li> PRICE:&lt;br /&gt;I looked around and found Amazon had the cheapest price compared to Target, Walmart, and typical drugstores like Walgreens and CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTROGENA vs OLAY:&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Olay&#x27;s brush head to the Neutrogena sponge, which needs replacing every month. This brush recommends replacing every 3 months. And it is MUCH easier to clean. Just give it a good scrub with your fingernails between bristles every once in a while. I also ordered the Olay microdermabrasion head. Not as thrilling but I like the option of switching heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GUYS:&lt;br /&gt;I also got one for my little brother. He really likes it and has helped a LOT with his skin. He says its easy, likes that he can avoid his eyes. Im just happy to see him washing his face ;)</li>
            <li> It does ok but it&#x27;s a lot faster to wash my face with soap, washcloth and water. It does however get my face stImulated and feels cleaner. I am a busy person so it&#x27;s a treat to relax in the tub and use this device on my face, it&#x27;s relaxing</li>
            <li> Now that I am a forty-something, I need the added exfoliation and polishing that this product provides.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t use a washcloth on my face ever again.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted this product to work. I&#x27;m a 23-year-old woman with mild to moderate acne, and every pimple I get leaves a hyperpigmented mark that can last for upwards of 2 years! I didn&#x27;t want to fork over all the cash for a Clarisonic just yet, so I decided I&#x27;d try this based on the wonderful reviews and reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, what a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first began using this shortly after purchasing it in November. I immediately noticed I began breaking out more, with deep, beneath-the-skin lumps. Not good! I figured this was the initial purging stage, and eventually things would get better, but it got to the point that I had to stop using it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip to a few days ago when I decided, after a few months of giving my skin a break, I&#x27;d try this again. I had been on two new topical prescriptions from my dermatologist (Retin-a Micro and Finacea) for about 1.5 months, and figured those would have purged my skin enough to not experience purging with this like I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m sitting here typing this right now with a bunch of new acne all across my chin, with a few of those wonderful, beneath the skin bumps the size of M&amp;Ms. Within two days of starting to use this product again, I began breaking out badly. Now, I used this ONCE per day at night, and after EVERY USE I soaked the head in hydrogen peroxide for at least 2 hours. I also wash my face with an antibacterial cleanser, which also should have helped reduce any bacteria on the head. This thing was more than clean - it was totally sterile! So that&#x27;s not what was causing my breakouts. I can only assume it&#x27;s too irritating for my skin. Bottom line is, I can&#x27;t use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this product has worked for many people, so I won&#x27;t tell you not to buy it. Just be warned that your skin may not be pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I just received this item today, so I can&#x27;t give a full review yet, but I will update if there is anything I learn that hasn&#x27;t been posted elsewhere. I used it right away, with the product it came with. It has been about 8 hours since I used it. I do not have sensitive skin at all, but I do notice all day my skin feels irritated and itchy. Maybe I am just not used to it. As I use it more, time will tell. I did notice right away that my skin was extremely soft and just felt deep down clean. Maybe tomorrow when I use it, I will use my own cleanser that I am used to. (neutrogena deep clean face wash) It may be the face product and not the cleansing system that bothered me. It did seem kind of harsh, but the brush itself felt great! I am very happy that it is waterproof, it is easier for me just to do it in the shower. My opinion, is that this is going to be great, but if your skin is sensitive, just use the face cleanser that you know works with your skin and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> The majority of the people reviewing this item are correct, it&#x27;s a fantastic little skin exfoliator. It&#x27;s a great price, when compared to the more expensive options. The brush is easy to assemble and disassemble. Brushes are soft and gentle, even with a little pressure, it just feels good. The cleansing liquid is soft and not irritating, and my skin feels clean and smooth after using it. I love the fact that you can use it in the shower, and it&#x27;s small enough to tote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;ve read that I disagree with is the fact that so many people have had a difficult time removing the battery casing. Seriously? It took about 2 seconds to pull it apart properly, with minimal effort. Then the batteries were installed and it was put back together with ease. If you have half a brain, I promise, you can figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ THE SIDE OF THE BOX. It tells you everything you need to know: how to remove the battery casing, when and how often to replace the brushes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these reviews force me to imagine them ripping open the package, throwing the box behind them, pulling out the item and smashing it against the counter, grunting (unga-bunga!). Honestly, it&#x27;s not hard to find and follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with the Olay Pro-X Cleaning System, you will be too.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, yay! The brush is soft and feels good on the skin, without being too abrasive. My skin feels squeaky clean after using this. It&#x27;s waterproof and battery operated.The battery compartment is hard to open..but I managed to open it..I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I saw the great reviews for this product and bought it.I have been using it for over a month now and I must say I love it! I had expected the motor to be more powerful - it isn&#x27;t but it doesn&#x27;t need to be! It works great the way it is. I have dryness and peeling around my nose and this has helped make it so much better.It really smoothes and exfoliates very well and the medicated moisturizer works so much better. For the price I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It leaves your face looking great after using it.</li>
            <li> Super cheap and effective, my wife loves it！</li>
            <li> Purchased a Christmas present for a relative. This item gets rave reviews! You can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay skin care. A name you can trust!</li>
            <li> I love it for cleaning my face and getting all the dirt out, It is good for other things as well, I like it as it is soft on your skin as well as it gets into places a sponge or washcloth might not be able to, the con&#x27;s might be if it gets too wet it splashes on everything, and keep it from your eyes unless you have them closed really tight, But for the price and convenience one can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter as an option instead of the Clarisonic, which she really was wanting. We just could not justify the price of the Clarisonic, and after reading the online review for it through Amazon, we decided the Olay Pro -X had alot better track record, for a fraction of the cost. So far she is very pleased with the results she has seen using the Pro-X. Her skin is alot smoother, and the texture has improved. She has pretty flawless skin anyway, but this just get&#x27;s all those impurities out and leaves her face clean and clear. This set only came with the bristle looking heads. She was really wanting to use the foam scrub heads. I will have to buy those separately. It looks like they are available in the higher price Cleansing system from Olay Pro-X. She is very happy with the results, we just wish it came with a better variety of heads and more cleanser. Hence the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> I ordered this first because I didn&#x27;t want to pay the price for Clarisonic. It worked well in terms of cleansing off makeup, but it is so HARSH on my skin (maybe because I have sensitive skin). I could only use it twice a week, but even then, my skin felt very dry and flaky (I have combination skin).&lt;br /&gt;Then Sephora had the 15% sale, I decided to buy the Clarisonic Mia (the $119 one), after discount the price was durable. As soon as Mia arrived I tried it -- what a drastic difference!&lt;br /&gt;It is much nicer to the skin, if anything it just feels like a gentle message. After using it for 2 minutes, my face felt soooo ridiculously skin. I even showed it to my boyfriend, and he noticed the difference too - how clean and SOFT my skin is. With Olay Pro-X it is simply clean, but feels rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you have sensitive skin, this probably won&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I used my normal cleanser, not the Olay cleanser it came with. I have acne prone skin and this was too rough for it. I&#x27;ve since learned, I need to be very gentle to my skin when cleansing. I purchased this item a year ago and used it to wash my face and remove makeup every night.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well.  I usually use it a few times a week and seems to be working.  No instant results, but I am going to try to use it on a daily basis to see if results improve. Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Unless you have exceptionally strong hands, don&#x27;t even think about ordering this brush. I have arthritis, but usually I can do anything I need to with my hands. Opening the battery case to insert required batteries is the one exception. I followed the directions given by one of the reviewers, but it doesn&#x27;t budge. This makes it a fatal flaw for me. How difficult would it be to design the brush with a simple release mechanism for the battery cover? Until now, I have liked Olay products, but this experience makes me loathe the brand name. Unless customer service can give me the secret code for opening the battery case, this product goes back to Amazon. Shame on Proctor and Gamble!</li>
            <li> It works alright. I don&#x27;t know how well it&#x27;s affecting my skin though, it worked very well the first few weeks, but my skin may also be a result of my diet, etc.  Can&#x27;t expect this to make magic happen :)</li>
            <li> I love this product anyway. The spin brush worked beautifully on my skin and I could feel some results immediately.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews...I was convinced that the Olay Pro-X was for me instead of the Mio. After I managed to open the battery compartment on the brush, I noticed there was a sticky, clear gel that covered the metal contacts where the batteries were supposed to go. I put the batteries in and it worked, but I was concerned about the presence of that gel. After calling Olay, they said that it was not supposed to be there and sent me a voucher to get a new one. After opening the battery compartment today....it still has the clear gel in the compartment! Has anyone else encountered this? I&#x27;m only giving this product 2 stars since I can&#x27;t seem to get a product that does not seem defective. Your thoughts and opinions are very much appreciated to help me out with this!!</li>
            <li> Price was less then I could find in any store this is my second one and I would higher recommend it</li>
            <li> Absolutely NOT!  Spend the extra money and get the Clarisonic Mia.  This Olay product will do zero for your skin.  Got it, and not only did it not work but it fell apart.  Got the clarisonic a week later ~ my skin looks and feels amazing.  No comparison.</li>
            <li> pretty expensive for no more power than it has, not one of my better investments</li>
            <li> Glad I settled for this instead of a more expensive brand.  Just don&#x27;t take the time to use it.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one since my kids took over my first one :)  LOVE this!</li>
            <li> Made a hit - seems to be well liked by spouse</li>
            <li> The brush is too soft, had I known prier to purchasing, I would have not bought it.</li>
            <li> This little thing cleans off all your facial dirt.  Nice.</li>
            <li> Love this. Works like magic.</li>
            <li> Did not see too much of a different on skin...</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally and its great, just wish the speed was higher</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for a while now, and am glad I got it.  It&#x27;s very soft and gentle on sensitive skin, but does a thorough job of cleansing.  I was amazed that the batteries were included and that they were Duracel of all things!</li>
            <li> For the price you cannot complain.  It does a good job for an average facial electronic cleaner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made a little cheap but it good for the price.</li>
            <li> Other similar units are $100.00&lt;br /&gt;This unit surpassed my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Each night I do a mini-facial during one set of commercials&lt;br /&gt;Voila I am all set for bed.&lt;br /&gt;Just hate that getting more of the Pro-X exfoliate cream is so pricey.&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great little gift for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for offering the Amazon &#x27;deal&#x27;</li>
            <li> When I started to use this, I consider this to be good. I don&#x27;t know if it was before or after I changed the brush, that I started to break out under my chin and jawline area. When I stopped, my face went back to normal.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price. I used this after makeup removal to make sure there is no residue on my face. It removes everything but is still gentle on my sensitive skin. I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the exfoliator that it comes with but you can use whatever cleanser you want.</li>
            <li> My face is a lot smoother since I began using the cleansing system!😊</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Using this got rid of my dry flaky skin, but I plan on buying the clarosonic</li>
            <li> This did nothing! The brissels hardly moved! It wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is quite good for the money.  I would have preferred stiffer bristles - I don&#x27;t get that lovely deep down clean feeling that I&#x27;ve had with other similar products.  But it&#x27;s OK for now.</li>
            <li> I like it BUT the cleanser enclosed is a little too moisturizing for me for the summer.  The brush is good and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it more in the winter.  A gel cleanser would be terrific.  Is there such a thing?</li>
            <li> Did not buy from Amazon, bit wanted to check reviews to find out if anyone was experience the problems, I was. My face broke out horribly and I got those painful cysts. I didn&#x27;t  have problems with acne, I just wanted something to clean my pores. I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It leaves my skin glowing and it gets rid of all dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> This works very well for the price!</li>
            <li> Easy to use / cleans your face well</li>
            <li> This definitely made me break out. I believe it works for some people but it did not work for me. It was just a bit too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> Best product you could possibly invest in for skin care. Great quality brush! Excellent cleansing power , brushes are gentle and get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy</li>
            <li> Product came in earlier than expected and in mint condition. Did wonders for my face! My skin feels so clean and smooth and for the first time in forever, I&#x27;ve been able to go outside with no BB cream&lt;br /&gt;or foundation :D</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s small and compact. Does the job well. And it&#x27;s not very expensive. I can feel the difference in my skin from the time I started using it. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is a fraction of the cost of a Clarisonic but works just as well. The battery life is surprisingly good and I leave it on the shower shelf with no problems. It&#x27;s strong enough to cleanse well but not so harsh that you feel as though you are ripping your face off. Olay has never let me down!</li>
            <li> Ehh, not too crazy about this product. I had an old brush (not from Olay) that would pulsate and  I applied the pressure to get deep down into my pores. So I thought this would be the same, it&#x27;s not. The brush spins around and when you go to apply the slightest pressure to get a deeper clean, the brush stops working. If I hold it up to my face and let it spin it feels like someone is ticking me. I can&#x27;t see how this can get deep down into your pores and exfoliate. Used it once and never again.</li>
            <li> really cleans the face. Skin feels much softer especially around the nose area and forehead which are usually my problem areas. the brush is soooo soft and the equipment so small and handy. Really worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> Compared to the Neutrogena pad cleanser, the Olay offers better value for money. Since you don&#x27;t need to replace pads and can use the cream cleanser, you save atleast $5 per month. That is $60 per year.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more is that you are not stuck to the Olay brand. You can visit your local pharmacy and use something they carry (cheaper and more effective) and still get results. The speed control sets it apart.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, manage and maintain.</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these for the wife for Christmas several years back. She loved it, but unfortunately after dropping it a number of times it stopped working. I searched high and low for a replacement until I found it here on Amazon. The wife has used it a few times already and is happy as a lark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok but wush I had bought a more stronger one</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing system. The brush is nice and soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin. It leaves my face feeling soft and clean. Works as good as those priced 3x more. Smooth transaction, ty seller.</li>
            <li> easy to use，very efficient！</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this Cleansing system for the last month.  Almost a month.  And I don&#x27;t always use the micro-dermabrasion cleanser that came with it.  I also use it in the shower.  My face always feels so clean, soft and smooth afterwards.  And it stimulates the cells in your skin to produce new skin cells, so it is always flawless and firm.  I&#x27;m in my early 30s and I hate the pores on my nose!  HUGE gynormous pores that you can see all the way to China!  The brushes feel great cleaning out my pores and I feel like it&#x27;s minimizing the size of them even though it&#x27;s been less than a month.  I&#x27;ve even got my husband to start using it.&lt;br /&gt;I use to use a cheap electric tooth brush but all it did was just vibrate.  I didn&#x27;t think it was doing much.  This brush rotates at two speed settings and the bristles are soft and gentle on your skin.  And it&#x27;s water-proof!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given up on using this. I don&#x27;t like the way it felt on my skin- it burns a little and is slightly irritating. I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference in my skin. I feel like I get better results using a washcloth. I tried this hoping for a cheaper alternative to a Clarisonic. I recommend trying a washcloth or if you feel like dropping the money, a Clarisonic. Tell me how it works! I also really did not like the cleanser it came with. Combined with the brush made it irritating on my skin.</li>
            <li> Although I have been shopping with Amazon for several years, and really appreciate the product reviews when making a buying decision (whether or not I ultimately buy the product from Amazon), this is the first review I&#x27;ve been absolutely compelled to write.  I was absolutely compelled to share the great results after a bad day under the sun.  I had been driving several hours in hot Texas with the top down on my convertible and, of course, came home to a peeling forehead. I initially washed my face with my tried and true face cleansing regimine, which left peeling skin on my face and on my toner. I then used the pro-x machine with my own cleanser, which produced better results, but not great. I had a little bit of the Olay sample cleanser remaining, so I tried that with the pro-x machine and the results were A-mazing. The flakes just came off, producing a smooth, clean, face with no trace of peeling or sunburn. It was gentle, yet effective. I immediately purchased replacement brushes and cleanser on Amazon, and my face has been the better for it. I have not been convinced to change my toner and moisturizer, however, because the pro-x machine and olay cleanser seem to do the deed on their own.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, pleased with purchase. Would recommend. I would easily purchase this again if ever needed before purchasing those HIGH PRICED similar items that don&#x27;t clean your skin and cleaner than this on does.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing system. Works well with any cleansing product. Will continue to use and possibly buy another for my children.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. My skin is so smooth and clean after using it. I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, because it is pretty powerful, but it is great for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this product and it actually is better than i expected so i am glad i ordered it. I am now saving my amazon gift cards to order some of the face creams. These products are so much cheaper from amazon.</li>
            <li> Not too bad for a cheaper version of the Clearsonic. I use it pretty much every day. My skin feels cleaner after use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a problem with breakouts, so I can&#x27;t say if it helps with that, either way. But I do like using it &amp; it works well.</li>
            <li> The Olay cleansing system is a great product. It really seems like you get a deep clean after you&#x27;ve used it. Without a doubt it&#x27;s more efficient than using your hands or a towel. What I like most is that it&#x27;s really useful in opening up your pores, cleaning deep, and ultimately providing the best prep for any facial product that your may want to reach deep into your pores such as acne medication, moisturizer, or wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who finds the rotary action distracting - you have to try hard to keep this thing \\&quot;on track.\\&quot;  So I&#x27;m going back to a Clarisonic - costs way too much, but at this point it&#x27;s worth it.  I had high hopes but just can&#x27;t deal with the rotary spinning that makes you work harder.  I think it cleans just as well, but Clarisonic is really on to something with the other kind of brush action.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite measure up to the Clarisonic, which I think is still the gold standard of facial brushes. The rotating brush head feels cheaper. The comparison would be a Crest Spin brush(this) to the Sonicare (Clarisonic). It always tends to pull and tug on the skin in an annoying way when brushing in a circular fashion, almost like it catches the skin. Having said that, it does do a decent job of cleaning. Perhaps one more speed higher that the 2 preset ones. (Not sure why anyone would use the slowest speed--feels like a tickle against the skin)</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time and I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like the fact that it does not come with instructions but other then that it is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;When ordering this product remember to also order extra brushes as it only comes with one.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with batteries but butteries run out fast. Good product. tre brush hairs are very soft and they&lt;br /&gt;do not harm your skin.</li>
            <li> This is now the third of these devices I have owned.  I like it very much but find they have a shorter life span than I would expect.  First one had a switch go bad, second time rust got into the battery compartment.  Still when I compare, the price is right and I can buy many of these before I reach the cost of the higher end competitors.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves the price on this item. She has look in many different retail outlets and none compares to this price. Great product.</li>
            <li> Why spend up to $200 on a facial cleansing brush, when this was under $20, and it is fantastic! My skin glows when I use this, and I recommend it to everyone who loves that spotlessly clean feeling on their skin.</li>
            <li> I was on a budget and decided not to get a clarisonic, instead i purchased this product after reading reviews and I LOVE IT! IT&#x27;s not too tough on your skin and it has 2 speeds for your desire. I squeeze my facial cleanser onto the brush head, pad my face with a bit of water and start! MY face feels very clean afterwards and it does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty SWEET!!!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is very easy to use, I use it daily. My skin is dry skin, and when I use it, my skin gets clearer, brighter and softer. I also have some lines around my eyes. Now it just gone. I am very happy with this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the price in here is so much cheaper than in store price, not to mention their competitor. Their competitor cost like $250, and here only cost $28.50, and the result can be done as good as treatment. It really is a good option for low- price skin care cleansing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my pores after reading that these cleansing systems could help with this issue. I got this instead of the Clarsonic due to the prices being astronomically different and the reviews being comparable. I use this with Avalon Organics Vitamin C Gel Cleanser. I only use the cleansing system about 3 times a week. It definitely seems to make my skin smoother and my pores do look smaller. Although I am not sure that the change in my skin is completely due to using this product, I am sure it has helped. My skin definitely feels smoother after using it. I would caution against over use. I found that it was too much for my skin every day and it had better effects when used every now and then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used this product before and loved it so much i decided to buy another one to bring with me on holidays. The brush is soft, doesn&#x27;t irritate skin and manages to keep skin clean. The cleanser included in the package is exfoliating and helps clean your skin even better. There are two speeds for the brush so that you can quicken or slow down the brush revolving speed to your preference. Your skin feels so soft and smooth after using this so overall I recommend this product! (:</li>
            <li> This is very nice and a reasonable price.  I would have given it 5 stars if the battery container harder been easier to open!  It took me 15 minutes to wiggle it open in order to install the batteries.</li>
            <li> I personally just kind of think that these contraptions strip my skin. I bought this to see if my skin would get along with machines like the Clarsonic. This wasn&#x27;t for me. It dried me out and left my skin looking dull. I did use it with the exfoliate one time, skin looked great for a day and then it was dry and blotchy. My skin doesn&#x27;t really ever have issues, period. It wasn&#x27;t a purge, it was dry, blotchy-ness. I could maybe see this working really well for someone with oily skin or skin that is prone to breakouts, however, those of you with dry skin, steer far away from this one.</li>
            <li> face glowed after just one time but i lost a chunk of hair from behind my ear, put up all hair before using this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System. I have not used any other products like this, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to. It makes my face feel so clean and smooth after using it. They&#x27;re exfoliating cream works well, but any other cleanser works too. Just try it for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I even purchased one for my mother as part of her Birthday gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my teenage son who started showing signs of acne.  He&#x27;s been using it a few times a week with an over the counter acne wash and his little pimples are in check.  Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> My mom has been angling for me to get a clarisonic, (and yes I tried hers) but I just couldn&#x27;t justify the cost for something I may not use, so I bought this.  The pro-x has been the only thing I use every morning and night with my own cleanser to wash my face and I can definitely tell a difference on how clean my skin is.  I no longer have any adult acne breakouts and I also know that I don&#x27;t need to spend $200 to get a great cleansing brush. This one is great!    *update January 2014.  My mom bought me the Clarionic Mia 2 for Christmas.   It really is amazing and I actually do prefer it over the Olay product.  If you can afford it, get it, otherwise this us better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Love it! Ive been using it everyday! Great thing about this is that its portable, not as expensive as the rest of them out there!</li>
            <li> This product is great for the price.  It has a high/low speed and it&#x27;s easy to use right out the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used the Clarisonic, so I can&#x27;t compare, but this one works well. The low-speed is pointless and if it had a higher speed I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> It made my skin break out more, and didn&#x27;t help my complexion, even when I sanitized it in alcohol. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and it cleans so much better than your hands and makes your face really soft by exfoliation. I&#x27;m going to tell my sister an mom to buy one. I didn&#x27;t know you need to buy replacement brushes for it which is a let down but other than that I would recommend this. It also gives you a small sample size of exfoliating cleanser but you can use anything with this.</li>
            <li> Seems like it works well for everyday use, and it doesnt leave red marks or seem like its too harsh for your skin.  best part is you can use with any exfoliator or cleanser that you want.</li>
            <li> after my wife got several facials and looked at this before in the stores at a much higher price - i got this for her at a great amazon price.  she loves it - and it will probably save her some money on facials as this exfoliates really well!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> EDIT: I unfairly gave this a bad one-star review but I realize now this wasn&#x27;t what caused my breakout. It&#x27;s just a simple scrubber. But I do have some advice on how to use it: mimic the motion that the Clarisonic does, side-to-side. Just ocellate your hand from side to side, along with the circular motion of the motor brush, this helps dig out blackheads and gunk. I actually saw black heads lifted after doing it this way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a skeptic but based on other reviews I tried it and I am shocked at the improvement.  After a few weeks, my face has quit breaking out, my pores are smaller, and my fine lines are reduced. I have dry skin and this really seems to keep my face fresh.</li>
            <li> Good product but not awesome</li>
            <li> Gave it to my granddaughter thought she could make better use of it</li>
            <li> you definetly dont need to buy a $60 scrub brush to get the same results. This thing is priced great and does the job the more expresnsive one  that i have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a Clarisonic, but honestly, this was so much less money. I read some reviews online comparing the two and went with this. Afterall, if it doesn&#x27;t work (1) Olay offers refunds and (2) I can still get a Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It comes with everything you need - even batteries&lt;br /&gt;2) Batteries seem to last forever. I&#x27;ve had it for months and it&#x27;s still using the same batteries it came with. No idea how much longer I have with them, but still. I&#x27;m impressed&lt;br /&gt;3) It works! (For me at least). As a 26 year old, I would get an occasional pimple or whatnot, but since using the cleanser, I haven&#x27;t had any. It also removes make-up much better than just scrubbing with my hands. I haven&#x27;t noticed any other benefits that others mention (like smoother make-up application or better skin absorbance of lotion), but I do believe that the others did experience those benefits.&lt;br /&gt;4) Functions the same even after dropping. Dropped it in the shower once and the battery cap popped off. I let it dry out and then put it back together. Has been working the same. Yay.&lt;br /&gt;5) No problems with use in the shower. I haven&#x27;t submerged it in water, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with using it in the shower. I just keep it stored in our shower caddy and use it when I&#x27;m showering. It doesn&#x27;t show any water/moisture issues.</li>
            <li> update 10/5/2014&lt;br /&gt;This is my skin regimen now:&lt;br /&gt;daily:&lt;br /&gt;- take off makeup with boscia makeup breakup oil, it washes off with water&lt;br /&gt;- wash face with philosophy purity cleansing soap&lt;br /&gt;- wash face gently with sulfur soap (I think my face likes to be very clean, but gently)&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;&gt;weekly: wash face with olay pro-x brush + exfoliating creme (right now I&#x27;m using korres rose scrub)&lt;br /&gt;-&gt;&gt;weekly:  aztec indian clay mask, 1 tbsp clay + 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar is enough for me&lt;br /&gt;- wipe face gently with cotton ball and well soaked thayer&#x27;s witch hazel rose toner&lt;br /&gt;- put on moisturizer: Dior hydra life creme sorbet&lt;br /&gt;- do a spot treatment with sulfur ointment (FYI ,sulfur ointment works GREAT for ingrown hairs in your bikini area)&lt;br /&gt;This has helped my face clear up greatly, plus no more peeling skin.&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING!!! :D Really glad I didn&#x27;t buy the clarisonic. The high speed is good enough for me. My face has never felt so soft :) I use it with sulfur soap w/ lanolin b/c it helps my acne.</li>
            <li> It does what it says.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it!</li>
            <li> This was my first brush of this kind. It works well and has just the right amount of pressure. I like it so far!</li>
            <li> Product provides a great cleansing. Wish more speeds were available but overall it saves on having to wash face towels constantly and provides a clean feeling when done.</li>
            <li> I love it. Ever since I started using it I feel that face is a lot cleaner and I get less acne. I am happy that I bought it.</li>
            <li> Great product, very easy to use, and if automatic heating to dry the better ...</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Love how soft and clean it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> i use it and i got beautiful skin</li>
            <li> I was expecting a hardier brush.  Does not actually have much strength.</li>
            <li> My skin is AMAZINGLY soft after using this, great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I own a Clarisonic, but it&#x27;s inconvenient for travel because it&#x27;s big and has a bulky charger. I figured this would be a reasonable stand in on a short term basis. I was wrong.  It doesn&#x27;t spin fast enough and the brush head is all wobbly. I knew a drugstore brand couldn&#x27;t be as nice as a $200 one, but I&#x27;m surprised at just how bad this product is--it doesn&#x27;t remove dead skin and irritates my face.  So I&#x27;m flaky, dry, and red. Between a hotel washcloth and this, I&#x27;m going with the hotel washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I have very dry, sensitive skin, so maybe this works better for other skin types. But if your skin is like mine, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and very effective. I can tell that my face a lot cleaner when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I read a gazillion reviews comparing this to the expensive Mia one before purchasing.  Unfortunately, I now want to buy the Mia just to see...feel the difference for myself!  There is nothing wrong with the Olay one.  Overall it is a nice gadget, especially for the price - but two things to think about, and I guess this goes for any beauty product: (1) Is it really that great, or would you get the same results from using anything other than your fingers to wash your face?  For example, would a basic washcloth have the same scrubbing effect? (2) Also, is it really making our skin look better or is it the fact that we tend to wash our faces more frequently when we have a new product?  I know if I could CONSISTENTLY keep up any routine, I would achieve the results I want without needing all the bells and whistles to do so.</li>
            <li> Every woman needs this. Worth the &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34;. Forgot how I survived without it. ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a couple of times so far, but I like it! It definitely cleans better than with just face wash alone and the brush is not abrasive or harsh. I have pretty sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t been irritated by it, so that&#x27;s always a plus. I don&#x27;t know if I like the cleanser that it comes with yet, so I&#x27;ll continue to use my original cleanser with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, for something at this cost it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I enjoy washing my face with it.</li>
            <li> After reading the glowing reviews here, I bought this in September. I have been using it almost every day since then and my skin looks worse. I cut back to using it every other day because it felt like it was drying out my skin too much. I used it with the cleanser it comes with and for the amount of time recommended.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks much worse now, so I am going back to using facial cleanser, exfoliator a few days a week, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this thing! It&#x27;s worked miracles on my skin!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this purchase. My face is extremely smooth after using this product and I will continue to use this until something better comes out.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I am a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I debated giving this a 3-star but ended up with a 2.  I should have known better... the product is pretty much as advertised!  I had a Clarisonic and after many years it would no longer accept a charge so I looked for a less expensive replacement. Yes this is less expensive, NO this is not a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, once it doesn&#x27;t deliver the sonic component what are you really getting... a rotating brush. A rotating brush that is driven by two AA batteries. Wimpy.  I am CERTAIN that I can provide a very similar cleansing experience with a face brush (which I am about to buy next) and a little elbow grease. I mean really if the power isn&#x27;t to drive something that I can&#x27;t recreate (sonic) then am I/we really too lazy to scrub your own face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after my first use I figured I might at least have a new laundry stain scrubber... and after trying it a few more times not sure I&#x27;d even use it for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---- PART II  ----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, several months later I have changed my review from 2 to 3 stars. I replaced the batteries that were sent with the product and put in some Lithium batteries; this, I fee, improved the performance and should make you less a slave to replacing batteries. I am also upgrading my rating because after acquiring a face brush I can say the ProX does a decidedly better job around the nose. Cleaning the rest of the face is as good/easy in all other parts but the circular rotation of the ProX is an advantage in the small areas around the nose.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for the past few days and i really like it.  Its super quick, easy and not very messy so it makes me enjoy the whole process a little better.</li>
            <li> Installing the batteries was a test of patience, but the side of the box, in very small print, gave instructions on how to do so. Once that was taken care of, I tried it and it worked like a charm, and didn&#x27;t hurt my face at all.</li>
            <li> Bought thise as gifts because I love the way it works.  Nothing else makes your skin feel so clean and smooth in an at home treatment.  No problems with it and don&#x27;t expect any.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. It feels wonderful to use and really makes my face feel great. I use it once a day. My skin is getting older and this seems to keep it fresher looking. I&#x27;m 64.</li>
            <li> This cleansing brush is invigorating but gentle. I love the clean, fresh feeling it gives me</li>
            <li> This helps scrub off all those stubborn dead skin cells clinging to the surface. Getting rid of the flaking dry skin makes the skin look healthier and even clearer.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system wakes and refreshes my skin. I gave the prdouct 5/5 stars because it seems to help make my face look younger and tighter. Love this product!</li>
            <li> After reviewing some reviews of Olay ProX product, I decided to purchase this item. It is so incredibly awesome! After one use, I can feel my skin refreshed and smooth. Recommending for daily use to have a deep clean and healthy skin!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading other reviews that it was comparable to the Clarsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the product and it is not very messy to use (I use it in the shower and at the sink at night). I use it twice a day and noticed an improvement in my skin after one week especially where I had dark spots. Good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was confused on how to open the battery compartment but it is actually quite simple. Just hold the device horizontally (with the brush facing away from you) and then gently wiggle the battery compartment up and down and it comes right off.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a Clarisonic for a while because I heard my friends talk about the wonders it did for their skin, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend the cash.  I saw the Pro-X in the store, but just assumed it was an inferior product until I saw the strong rating on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  I have been so impressed with the results!  I&#x27;m in my 20s, I have okay skin except I always wished I could get rid of the oil buildup that made my nose area look rough from clogged pores, and of course the dreaded monthly menstrual zit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro-X exfoliates all of that away and I am enjoying clear, smooth looking skin! I occasionally use the included cleaner when I want something gentler, but usually I just use a tiny pea-sized amount of my Alba Acnedote scrub (which is all natural and my all-time favorite scrub) for about a minute before going to bed every day.  When I finish, my face does feel a bit dry, so I use a lavender-infused vitamin E oil (lavender promotes cell renewal and smells great), and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my skin! :)  I think the key is using it daily, but it adds very little time to my regimen and is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> battery is not powerful enough for the real polishing and cell renewal I am looking for. It cleans and that is all that matters</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was not  wonderful but it wasn&#x27;t bad either I think it was okay , but My face is much softer now!</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT FIT VERY WELL IN YOUR HAND. THE HAIR BROSSE IS VERY SOFT. DEPENDS OF YOUR SKIN, IF YOU NEED HARD HAIR BROSSE OR SOFT ONE;</li>
            <li> I was going to get the Clarisonic before I did some research. So far I&lt;br /&gt;am glad I purchased the Pro X instead bc it saved me some $$. My skin&lt;br /&gt;is smoother and have used for a week. I also read that some of the Clarisonics&lt;br /&gt;loose charge after about a year. The Pro X requires 2 AA batteries, so I am hoping&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t have a problem. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Works just as good as a $200 product for cheaper . Didn&#x27;t use cleanser that came with it .</li>
            <li> I have noticed changes in my skin using only after couple of days. My skin feels and looks smoother, fresh and bright.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to order this, I had been wanting this system for the longest but kept putting it off, what a difference this brush makes on my skin.</li>
            <li> Wash clean and very comfortable</li>
            <li> Since buying Olay Pro-X- Advaced Cleamsomg System I have seen a big differnce in smaller pores and fewer break outs.  I  wish I had had not waiting so long.  Great.....</li>
            <li> This product was once again for my wife. She always was a favorite of Olay products, it seem to work for her&lt;br /&gt;and this is why she always purchase Olay products.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Have used it only a few days but my skin feels super soft. I use it once a day. I was worried first that it would be too much but not at all.</li>
            <li> Used twice, already loving it.  Cleans thoroughly but not harshly.  My skin feels softer already, and I think I see it pulling junk to the surface, too.  Possibly, it&#x27;s lightening the appearance of my rosacea - can&#x27;t tell for sure yet.  Am expecting smoother, clearer skin with continued use.</li>
            <li> Great product for your face.  It keeps my face feeling and looking great.  I think everyone needs one of these.  Thanks !</li>
            <li> I just have start off by saying that I am an 18 year old guy who has had extremely stubborn acne for years. I have gone to the dermatologist and have tried so many topical creams and oral medications. None of them have done anything to help clear up my face. I just bought this at target about a week ago, and honestly, my skin felt so much smoother and cleaner just after the first use. Since I have started using it, I have not had a single pimple. My skin feels really soft and smooth now. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this face brush. It makes my face so nice and soft and is way better than any micro-bead exfoliator. I especially like that I can use it in the shower and with my own face wash. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling smooth and clean.  Like a jellybean.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product and makes a nice gift! Gave it to my mother for Christmas and see loves it and loves the way her skin looks...</li>
            <li> We Love this!  I would highly recommend this as a part of your beauty routine.  It&#x27;s a great skincare system.</li>
            <li> It works really well. However there were no instructions on how to use it and I was left to the internet to figure it out. Another things is since I have really greasy skin it works well and you can notice the results right away but after 8 hours the blackheads show up again.</li>
            <li> This is okay to use on your face. :(  Glad I did not spend to much for this product. I is not as strong as I would like, I bought it based on reviews but once I got the product opened, found out not that great. Trust me do not spend your money.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  It feels like a &amp;#34;face massage&amp;#34; after you use it.  I have dropped it twice and it still keeps working.  I have recommended this to my friends</li>
            <li> Good, good and good. Cleans and really cleans!!</li>
            <li> Very nice cleansing - leaves my face very soft.  Great price. Allergic to the Olay creams but I&#x27;m allergic to most face products so that part of it is just me.</li>
            <li> My skin is the clearest its ever been. Not to mention this product makes it very fun and easy. i&#x27;ve been using it religiously for 2 weeks and my skin is super soft with no break outs at all.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny I spent on it. DO NOT buy this from the store because on Amazon it&#x27;s cheaper. I love it and have had it for a couple months now and it cleans myself so well. No overdrying, but I use it like every other day or 3 days since I have sensitive/oily skin. My acne has greatly cleared up.</li>
            <li> Nice cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;Skin is soft and smooth</li>
            <li> This cleansing system has given me back my smooth skin.  I&#x27;m 46 and was starting to have a really uneven texture to my skin.  Using this 2x weekly for the last couple of months has really improved the look and feel of my skin.  All the little blackheads and blocked pores are really diminished and I have fewer random acne spots too.  An unexpected upside has been better management of those unsightly stray hairs that pop up on my chin.  The exfoliation has made those easier to pluck and has reduced any ingrowns.  This was well worth the price!  I do pair it with a gentle exfoliating scrub and absolutely love the way my skin feels and looks when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I use this brush every single day for over a year now and I miss it terribly if I go somewhere and don&#x27;t bring it. I wonder how much better the expensive versions can be (even though I love it, could never bring myself to spend $199 on &#x27;those&#x27;). This one does an awesome job, lasts a very long time even though I use it in the shower every day.</li>
            <li> I have only just started using this but so far it seems to be good, and I hope the quality of my skin will continue to improve!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was in need of something to even out my skin. I have a combination skin type and was bothered with the occasional breakout (not wanted in my mid 40&#x27;s) around my chin. I&#x27;ve been using this device for the past 2 weeks and see a significant difference in how my skin is acting. The breakouts have disappeared and my skin is soft and clear. I started at every other day for the 1st week and now do it every 2 days. It&#x27;s very quick and easy. I highly recommend this to anyone having skin \\&quot;issues\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Been over a month now and I&#x27;m still extremely happy with this product. My complexion is clearer now than it&#x27;s ever been, I&#x27;m very happy about that. This product has so easily become part of the weekly maintenance for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2: This product has been a tremendous success. Any little complexion issues I had have disappeared. I credit this device and the 3 times a week I use it. The lotion lasts forever too. I&#x27;m still using the original bottle.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, to every one who have acne. I tried different cheap and expensive face cleaning supply and none of them cleaned my face from acne, they are even didn&#x27;t make them smaller. And then i&#x27;m accidentally bought this product, and I can&#x27;t believe in it, but after using this cleansing system for a couple days, my face becomes cleaner and cleaner, and almost all acne are gone. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> When the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System arrived, I opened the box to examine it thoroughly. Just at first glance, I had formed an opinion without using it.  I said to myself, this looks like a toy, the brush looks very delicate and it feels too soft to get the job done.  My husband suggested that I give it a try, just by looking at it, I was feeling not so good about it.  I decided to give it a try and I realized that the opinion I had formed was unjustifiable.  That rotating brush had just the right amount of softness, as the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System has 2 speeds which feels great on the skin.  It does not rough the skin up.  If the brushes were any rougher, it would peel your skin instead of exfoliate it.  Now, I use it everyday, I&#x27;m satisfied with the results I&#x27;ve seen so far and it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks.  I would recommend this cleaning system to others, as well.</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t spend a hundred bucks on other brush cleanser devices. This does the job and is gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do not buy into all the beauty products out there. But, when this was on a deal of the deal I broke down. Now like my water pic and electric toothbrush it&#x27;s a daily ritual. I use it while I wait for my hair to condition while showering.  After just one week my complexion had improved.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay Pro-x advanced cleaning system after seeing the facial scrubber that pro active offered.  After doing some research on that and the subsonic facial scrubber I discovered that they just vibrate.  I wanted a facial scrubber that spins.  This one does spin in circles and at two different setting.  The scrubber takes replaceable batteries with seems to last longer than the rechargable ones.  After one use of this product I could tell a difference.  My pores seemed to look smaller and my face was a lot smoother.  Ive only used the provided face wash a couple time.  Whats good is you can use your own face wash with this product.  I reccommend this facial scrubber over the vibrating ones as it seems it does a better scrubbing job. My only minor complaint is I wish it was a little bigger.  It along with the head is pretty small, therefore it takes a while to do your whole face.</li>
            <li> Estoy usando este cepillo para limpiar la cara todas las noche y es increible la cantidad de maquillaje que sale a lavarme la cara. Puedo senti la diferecia a cuando no usaba mas que jabon para lavarme el rostro.. Selo recminedo a cualuier persona que este interesado en tener una piel limpa y natural.</li>
            <li> To start off, I do not have awful skin besides the occasional zit here and there but I was hoping that the Olay Pro-X would help with blackheads and removing dead dry skin.  It did not get rid of my blackheads, nothing will, but it does help removed dry skin.  I do wish it had more power and would scrub a little harder but it is good if you have sensitive skin.  I also have tried the Clarisonic and think the Olay Pro-X is just as good for much lower price.  The Clarisonic scrubs a lot harder but is like 5x the price.  I would say give the Olay Pro-X a shot before you go spend a lot of money on other similar products.  Overall, I like this product but am not dependent on it by any means.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast. I love this device! I use it every other day as an exfoliator and then as a massager. The only wish is to have more gel sent with the device.</li>
            <li> mommy like it&lt;br /&gt;I clean my face with it once, I feel my face is more smoothly, ^_^&lt;br /&gt;so good</li>
            <li> I hate having to post a negative review of something I had such high hopes for.  I had wanted this (or a similar, more expensive version of this) for many months before I purchased it.  I really thought it would help my skin, which has a hard time exfoliating itself now that I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties.  However, it broke me out BIG-TIME!  It couldn&#x27;t possibly have been just a temporary purge, because I was getting clogged pores in places I never get them, like on my temples and above my upper lip.  I had to stop using it.  I&#x27;m glad it works for so many other people, though--it&#x27;s nice that there&#x27;s an inexpensive cleaning brush out there for those of us who can&#x27;t afford to spend hundreds on one.  And I would have been severely upset if I spent that much on a brush that wrecked my skin.  No worries, though--I find I&#x27;m getting super-clean skin and great results with my Aqua Glycolic toner.  And I&#x27;ve recently found another product for adult acne--Clearasil Adult Daily Clear, with resorcinol and sulfur--these two products seem to be doing what I hoped the Olay brush would do for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product more in hopes of keeping my face cleaner and in hopes of getting rid of black heads. I never been one for having much acne at all. After using this for a few days, once a day, my face broke out quite a bit from it. It does make my face feel super clean and smooth, but I guess the creme is no good for someone like me. I&#x27;ve never had acne under my lips on my chin before and after using this, I&#x27;ve gotten acne and redness really bad there. I don&#x27;t know what is in the creme that would cause someone to break out like this. I&#x27;ve have since stopped using it because just rinsing my face every morning is better at keeping my face clear of any acne. It did not clear my black heads or anything either. I&#x27;m rather disappointed. I&#x27;m going to let me sister, who always seems to have acne, try it out herself.</li>
            <li> I brought this product mainly because everyone talked about the big name brand competitor and how amazing it was. I was not going to pay over $100 for something like that I did not see it being worth it. So I thought I owuld try out this Olay Pro- X product thinking if it does not work hey I only wasted around $20 for it. I love this item I use it all the time when I take a shower and you can tell a noticeable difference after you use it. I also used the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore scrub with is and it works flawlessly. The only comment I would make on this product is that the brush for it I wish it had either more bristles or stronger ones. When you put this brush to your face all the bristles seem to almost flatten out without you even pushing on them. I would reccomend this product as a good alternative to the over priced competitors!</li>
            <li> The Pro-x works very well at cleasing my face.  My face is very soft and still moist after using the Pro-x.  It is very resonably priced.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay Professional Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System and have been using it for about 2 weeks now.  I have dry, sensitive, over 50 skin.  My skin actually does feel softer and smoother.  I use this in the shower too on my legs and arms.  I&#x27;ll probably kill the little motor very quickly doing this, but that skin feels smoother, too, so I will continue.  The item itself feels a bit cheap-the little motor sounds overly-taxed as you run it across your skin, as if it doesn&#x27;t have quite the energy to keep working. But other than the sound, it works well. As other reviewers noted there are no instructions as to where to insert the batteries or how to open the compartment (end of handle) once you&#x27;ve found it (just keep pulling until it opens).  All in all, I would recommend this to a friend.  It is inexpensive and does what it is supposed to do.  If it lasts for even 6 months I&#x27;ll have gotten my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> Daily, I put on acne medication, sunscreen and make up on my face and was looking for a product to take it all off to prep my face for my nightly retin A treatment. Tonight, before taking off ANY of my make up off, I used the pro x for the first time with my alpha hydrox foaming face wash (also used for the first time)and boy, my face was glowing after I patted it dry! I used my awesome Delon cotton rounds (sold on amazon) to remove what the face wash and pro x didn&#x27;t remove and NOTHING showed up on my still white and clean rounds. AND I used toner on the pad. Basically the combination of the pro x and alpha hydrox clarifying cleanser has replaced my St. Ives (which I&#x27;ve heard tears skin) and all my other cleansers! It massages the face and is gentle yet effective. Great quality and ergonomic. Good buy!</li>
            <li> Just after two minutes of cleansing with this product, my face feels and seems different!  I feel as if I had a facial treatment.  You have to try it out to find out what this cleanser can do for you! GOOD JOB OLAY.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when looking at the item. It seemed like such a simple concept and wondered if it would make that much of a difference. I was surprised at how soft this makes my skin feel. I do feel like my moisturizers work better due to the cleaning from the pro. I plan to get some for gifts for Christmas just because I think every gal should have one!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but either the brushes are too delicate that I don&#x27;t feel a thorough cleansing. But for the price it&#x27;s acceptable.</li>
            <li> The cream that comes with the system is just okay, and the tube is so small it is really only a sample. I prefer a simpler and more gentle cleaning gel. I also only use this a couple of times per week. This is a better system than the larger and more high powered cleansers, because you really don&#x27;t need to scrub so hard to gt the face clean. This costs less than the others and does just as good a job.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working well. I do an at home chemical peel and follow it up 48 hours later with the pro x brush. It helps to slough off the peeling skin. I use it only twice a week. The exfoliating cleanser will last for quite a while as a little goes a long way. I had a TIME of it setting the battery compartment free and was so scared I would destroy the device with all the pulling but I eventually figured it out. Just gently rock the bottom part left and right while pulling at the top. It&#x27;ll come loose eventually.</li>
            <li> Loved the product it worked as expected the exfoliating cream was the perfect size for just a trail to see if I would like the product. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 41yo dude, but I have skin problems on my face too. \\&quot;T zone,\\&quot; \\&quot;combination skin,\\&quot; whatever. I&#x27;m not exactly sure what those are, but I get dry skin at the junction of my eyebrows and nose area. I also get the dreaded eyebrow dandruff. Gross and embarrassing, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using Cetaphil and a washcloth forever, and I lube up afterwards. But still never completely satisfied with the amount of dry skin always hanging around. So I took a shot and bought this. Definitely cheap enough to take a chance on, especially considering my wife just purchased the \\&quot;other one.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, and while it definitely is working I&#x27;m still not in the land of silky smooth skin. I&#x27;m hoping that it is still just working through the mess of dead skin and stuff. After my shower and scrubbing my face with this (with Cetaphil, was afraid to use the gritty stuff), there is still a fine fuzz of dried skin on the surface. I slap on some Neutrogena (oil free!) after the shower so at least I don&#x27;t look like a reanimated mummy or something. It&#x27;s not as bad as before, so there is improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;m still not completely sold yet, but I have high hopes. I&#x27;ll give it another couple weeks to be safe. Hopefully I&#x27;ll be in the babyface zone soon.</li>
            <li> This is such a great tool for healthy skin! I have skin that is not oily or dry, but acne prone. I use this daily with a mild facial cleanser and I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean my face and pores were! I noticed smaller pores and cleaner complexion within a couple of weeks. Not only do the bristles clean the face, but they help in removing dead skin cells and promoting circulation and the growth of healthy new cells. This should be in every woman&#x27;s (or man&#x27;s!) tool kit!</li>
            <li> Great investment in this automatic cleansing scrubber.  All you have to do is put on a dab of the cleanser all over your face and then let the scrubber do its job.  It makes your skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get something like this product for awhile because I very dry, flaky skin on my face and no matter how much I moisturize, it still flakes and makes my foundation look horrible when applied. I read the reviews on this cheaper version and decided to try it. I thought the brush would move faster but it still gets the job done. My flaking has cleared up so much! I still have a little around the brow area, but I have only been using it 1 week. I am also prone to black and white heads in my chin area and nose really bad, but those are even getting better. My face is so soft and I love it! I highly recommend the pro-x...I have never used the more expensive product, but why spend $100 when this product for $30 is getting the job done :) In case you are wondering I am using the exfoliator cleaner that comes with the product, then I apply witch hazel for my astringent, and the Olay regenerist deep hydration cream after. Try it first before spending the extra money on a similar product, I don&#x27;t think you will regret it!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from blackheads around my nose for years. I&#x27;ve tried so many different creams, prescription medications and pore strips. Nothing worked and I just accepted that trying to cover those nasty little things up was just going to be a way of life. When I found a good deal on th Olay Profressional Pro-X, I figured, what do I have to lose? I ordered it and didn&#x27;t have my hopes up very high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving it, I began using it and noticed immediate results. My face felt so smooth and clean! After a couple of days, my nose looked so clear! Of course I still had a couple of blackheads, but that&#x27;s much easier to clear than the many I had days before.&lt;br /&gt;I became too busy with life and let this little gem sit on the edge of the counter for a while. Guess what? My blackheads came back and I was breaking out again. I started using this again and remembered exactly why it&#x27;s worth the few minutes of time it takes to use each day. I won&#x27;t let this product go to the back of my list again. My face shows it when I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the face wash that goes along with it, but I also use another face wash and they both seem just fine. I don&#x27;t think it matters as much what you use with the Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> After breaking out I thought that perhaps my pores just needed to be cleaned more thoroughly.  I bought the cleansing system to help get my skin CLEAR and get that deep clean it suggests it does.  Well...  THE OPPOSITE is what occurs from using this device.  I don&#x27;t get acne very often and I almost NEVER get cystic acne.  Guess what?  That is EXACTLY what happened right after using this product.  I consulted with my dermatologist and she nearly freaked out that I had used this!  In fact, this machine actually was the root of the problem.  It caused serious problems and I intend on calling the manufacturer, Oil of Olay to get my money back.  This is NOT recommended if you actually want clear, problem free faces!</li>
            <li> I cannot compare this to the Clarsonic because I have never used it, but if you are like me and wanted one and couldnt afford it, this cleansing system is an awesome alternative. I&#x27;ve had my eye on the Clarsonic for a while, but it was something I just couldnt afford right now. It had been my plan to purchase this one until after the holidays and then get a Clarsonic as a gift to myself. However, after using this for a couple of weeks, I really love it.  My pores are visibly smaller, my skin is much clearer and the fine wrinkles that just recently started to develop on my lower cheeks have all but dissappeared.  My skin feels so much smoother and firmer after I use it and  my makeup just glides right on.  My skin has not looked this good in years. I also purchased the Olay Pro-X Exfoliating Cleanser to use with it and it is a great companion to the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is lightweight, and runs on batteries.  It is not rechargeable which is the only downside I could find with the unit.  It does have a &amp;#34;plasticky&amp;#34; feel to it and can get a little slippery when wet, but I have yet to drop it.  The heads are easy to clean and fairly inexpensive to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now up in the air as to whether or not I will still purchase the Clarsonic.  It would have to be 8 times better than the Olay version, because it costs eight times as much.  But if it is that good, it would be the holy grail of skin care. As for the Olay, I definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This system works great. I considered purchasing the clarisonic product but couldn&#x27;t justify the price. I decided to start off with this cleansing system to determine whether the more expensive product was worth it. I am so happy with this system that I&#x27;m not sure whether</li>
            <li> Had to wait till I used it awhile before reviewing. It works perfect, I love that its water proof, feels great and what a great price.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin nice and smooth.  Also works well on the chest and neck.  This product is a good value.</li>
            <li> Bought this out of sheer curiosity. I have lots of students and clients (i am an esthetics instructor) that swear by the big brand version of this cleansing system, but there was no way I was going to shell out the money for one, so I decided to try this one, its almost the same as the fancy, expensive rotary brush I use in my professional treatments (part of an 8-in1, not a cheap piece of equipment, that&#x27;s for sure). This brush seems to work well for what it is. It could use a few improvements, but that may make it more expensive. I wish you could reverse the spin, and have a more customizable speed setting, the low and high is has just isn&#x27;t enough. The battery compartment was near impossible to open, thank goodness for my husband or I never would have gotten it open. I get why, it has a seal that keeps it tight so you can use it in the shower, but the design of the handle doesn&#x27;t give you much to grip when trying to remove the battery cover. I have used it a few times, and I see it more as a novelty than a must have tool. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel any smoother with this than my normal routine. But, if this gets you to wash your face every night, then use it, it doesn&#x27;t seem like its too harsh to cause any long term damage to your skin. Just be aware that over-exfoliation leads to premature aging!</li>
            <li> I love this cleaning system. My face has never felt better, and I am a grandma. If it works on me it will work for anyone...</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little more than a month and I am really pleased with this cleaning system. My face feels smoother, my skin looks brighter, it does what it stated it would do, and all at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and was so pleased, I bought another as a gift. Brushes are soft enough for all but perhaps the most sensitve. Especially recommend for pre-teens and teens.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this until I used it and now I wonder how I&#x27;ve gone without it. My skin truly feels and looks better. I know it&#x27;s cleaner. I like the two speeds of the brush. It&#x27;s not too abrasive. It&#x27;s gentle, but effective. I really don&#x27;t want to go without it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while back.  I had high hopes for this product but it did not last.  Within 60 days the button quit working and I had to hold it in to get it to run and finally after about 90 days it stopped altogether.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with this product so far. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and I feel like it&#x27;s made my regular cleanser work a little better. I keep it in the shower and have not had any issues with water getting in it or impacting how I use it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It is worth your money. It does exactly what is described. I wanted to try this brush before I brought the more expensive brand. I think. I will stick with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. gentle but effective from the first use. i have sensitive skin and this is gentle but invigorating and i use all kinds of cleaners with it. really great</li>
            <li> I Love it!  Don&#x27;t buy an expensive model, this one works great and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Great gift idea!</li>
            <li> I like this product. I think it could use more power. But for my budget, and until I can spring for the pricier name-brand model, this absolutely satisfies me and I think everyone should get one as it is essential to my beauty routine now. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Started using this religiously after the Holidays and my skin looks better than ever!  I wish I started earlier.  I bought great products to work with the brush and it has done wonders already.</li>
            <li> Twin granddaughters just turned 11 years old.  This is a great and useful present for that age.  It is like an electric toothbrush for the face.  The Olay is very inexpensive compared to Clarisonic and it does the job and encourages the girls to really clean their skin.  The Olay Pro-X was a &amp;#34;winner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial cleansing brush.  It makes my skin very soft and clean.  I love the price and quality of the product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> Have not found this product to be as good as the hype surrounding it.  The product  falls apart when you use it and it is too slow.</li>
            <li> My face feels incredibly clean after I use this. I&#x27;m not too sure if my face is much clearer than before, I&#x27;ve always had mild to moderate acne, and it still is, maaaayybbeee more mild, but I can&#x27;t be sure. However, I really enjoy how clean my face feels, so I&#x27;ll keep using it until I know otherwise. I have noticed that it kills my spray tan. But I&#x27;ll trade an acne free face for a tan face any day.</li>
            <li> I love this!  It leaves my face both soft and smooth.  It is easy and quick to use every day.</li>
            <li> i saw this product on a youtube review, and i absolutely loved it! my skin got brighter, more elastic and it cleaned it better than any other product ive used! i recommend it wholeheartedly!</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft. Soft enough for the face and it gets the job done right. I have oily skin that gets a lot of build up and this definitely helps with that a lot. It removes all that dirt and leaves me with a clean healthy complexion. Its great for when I come home after a long day. Fits perfectly in your hand and you can use in the shower. I do however wish that It brought more cream exfoliate with it. And YES you can use it with different face washes! Overall great. I would definitely recommend!! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after talking to someone at the Mac counter about their expensive option. I immediately ran home and began doing some research. With the high reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase this model with the cleanser. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It&#x27;s amazing how well this works for how much it costs. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It washed face gently and made my face smoother. I used it three times a week and I can feel my face brighter then before.</li>
            <li> Love this! Affordable and works good.I recommend this to anybody who needs a good scrub and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li> Caused me to break out into small red spots and caused white heads. I found it to be too harsh and abrasive.</li>
            <li> Excellent feeling after washing face. Leaves a nice clear feeling even using other soaps.. Recommending for the price.. Good buy</li>
            <li> I have been eyeballing the Clairisonic for quite sometime when I ran across this Olay brush...I wanted one that had a rotating head not just a vibrating head...This Olay not only rotates it has 2 speeds...I use the high speed and it is not overly harsh at all...The brush head that is included is just the right firmness...Not too soft and absolutely not to hard...This is waterproof so you can use it in the shower...It takes 2 AA batteries and they are included!!! - (just 1 more thing to love about this little beauty)...My skin feels so soft and clean after using this..</li>
            <li> After extensive reading of reviews and comparisons of products - this is amazing without breaking the bank!  After just two uses, my skin feels amazing and actually has a glow.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!  Don&#x27;t hesitate - wonderful purchase.  I love the fact that you can use it with basically any Olay cleaning product!  How easy does that make it!  You cannot go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> I would reccond this product for any age, after all I am near60! I purchased this product with the hope of discovering cleaner feeling skin and along with this came unexpected smoothness and a healthier look to my skin. I have even been using other skin products that I own with the scrubber and am pleased with the results....wish I had owned this 40 years ago!</li>
            <li> Great product and especially at the price</li>
            <li> Its a nice brush... nothing fantastic and its pretty big. but for the price its a good value</li>
            <li> Love it. Good value for the money, and my face has never felt this clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the product (and keeping it clean) seems easy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the product is easy. On and off button with 2 speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the product (I use my own face wash on a daily basis and use the Olay&#x27;s micro abrasion stuff once a week)</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne prone skin that devloped in my mid-20s. I have tried a lot of products and became frustrated; however, nothing has worked better than this product. I use it with the Neutrogena Oil Free Cleanser twice daily and my skin is less oily, does not break out as often, and my pores have gotten smaller.  I would buy this product over any other type of similar facial brush in a heartbeat. I am very happy with my decision and glad I bought it. I would highly recommend this product due the soft bristles that do not irritate my skin and the simplicity of using it. I was on the fence about buying it, but I am certainly glad I did!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product just to try how I would like cleaning my face with an oscillating brush, didn&#x27;t want to pay $200, and then possibly finding it too harsh. I did not expect the results to be so dramatic! I am a 48 year old female; I take good care of my combination skin, exfoliate several times a week, use retinol products. I have used this product twice so far, at night in the shower, to clean my face thoroughly, and I am very impressed with the results. My skin feels very smooth, but without being overly tight after I use it, and the best part: my pores are significantly smaller in size, something I never thought would be possible. I will now buy another brush for my teenage daughter, who has very sensitive skin, and tends to break out. I think this will be great for her, too! I can highly recommend the Olay Pro-X brush!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to add a boost to my cleaning routine. I use purity made simple and this product works great with it. I keep in my shower and use every time. My face feels cleaner and my moisturizer is more effective with a clean face. thanks!</li>
            <li> This thing does its job perfectly.  Since everyone seems to be comparing it to the Clarsonic model that costs five times as much, I&#x27;ll weigh in.  My usually thrifty mother has the clarsonic model, which is pretty much exactly the same except that it pulses instead of rotates.  Does this make a difference?  I don&#x27;t think so.  The clarsonic also has a self-timed shut off, but again, how hard is it to estimate how long one minute is?  I use this bad boy in the shower to exfoliate in the mornings, and it does just fine.  I don&#x27;t press down too hard--just softly let it roll over my face.  I see no downside to it, and the price is so much better than the clarsonic.  It also comes with a small exfoliating scrub.  It is pretty much like any of those other micro-bead scrubber fash washes.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to exfoliate their skin to help look clean and keep acne at bay.  Just be sure to moisturize and apply sunscreen afterwards.</li>
            <li> This little gadget works ok I guess. Not enough power in it to really do much. I have been using it for over a month..and dont see much difference in how my skin looks. I guess you get what you pay for. I got this thinking it would help with the occasional breakouts and to clean the pores a bit...but did not notice any difference after using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;Spend some extra money on something better.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth it. After my very first use, my skin was incredibly soft and felt so much cleaner than it did just using a washcloth. I had it on the higher spin setting and used it for about one minute. The cleanser sample you get is small and it was gone within one week but I&#x27;ve found this works great with just about any cleanser (exfoliating or cream). I love that its battery powered and easy to tote between the sink and shower. After the first few days, I immediately bought one for my mom too. I have been using mine for three weeks now and really do see and feel a difference in my skin. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase the Clarisonic version of this product but I didnt want to spend the money for it.  After reading many of the reviews, I decided to try the Olay PROx  version.  Delivery through Amazon was fast...super fast, so I was pleased about that!  I read in a lot of reviews that people were having trouble figuring out that they could remove the bottom of the device to insert that batteries.  I have to say that based on the way the product is constructed it was not hard for me to figure out that the bottom was removable, however, it did require a little bit of force to get it off.  This product is waterproof so its understandable that the bottom which contains the batteries would be sealed tight and be slightly difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the PROx with the included cleanser, I have to say I was very pleased.  I felt a difference in my skin immediately.  It was smoother and softer after the first use.  Other reviewers said that they thought the brush was a little harsh for their skin. I noticed if I applied too much pressure and concentrated on one area and did not move in circular motions as the bush rotated, then it would feel a little abrasive on that area.  This should not be a problem if you gently press it against your skin and keep it moving around your face then it should not be too harsh against your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my opinion of this product is that it is a good alternative to the more expensive Clarisonic brand.  Someday I will probably shell out the dough to buy the Clarisonic but for now this one will do just fine.  It gets my skin clean and makes it smooth and soft.  I use a Sonicare toothbrush and I must say its phenomenal, so I can only imagine how the Clarisonic would feel after the first use.  But again, I&#x27;m sticking with my Olay PROx now.</li>
            <li> I thought it would help clear up the small blackheads around my lips, but it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s okay for a cleaner and the price.</li>
            <li> The Olay professional scrubber for the face is good the very best.  I use it twice a day.  It is just as good as  the $200 model.  I am planning on purchasing more for holiday presents. The face becomes sparkling clean.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Works well. Much less money than other products but very functional.</li>
            <li> really helps get rid of dry skin!</li>
            <li> works well she is pleased, says it is exactly what she needed, small compact so good for traveling and storage</li>
            <li> This hurt my face and made my acne worse.  It is not a clarisonic.  The clarisonic is much more gentle and doesn&#x27;t rotate, it vibrates which cleans deep down without upsetting your skin.  If you can&#x27;t afford a clarisonic, I understand but I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying one of these because it is not remotely close to the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these, and they both broke after a couple months of use.  I liked the results though.</li>
            <li> Great for washing your face and removing heavy make up. Love this product</li>
            <li> Great product. I use my own facial cleanser, but the brush leaves my skin feeling remarkably soft, especially after the first usage. Feels good to get a good facial scrub! I use mine in the shower, too... not sure if it&#x27;s water proof, but so far it is! :o)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Not very impressive. But it&#x27;s a good product to try if you don&#x27;t want to spend near $100 on more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> very nice and I can see the effect on the face....</li>
            <li> I really love it!! It arrivated in Italy very quick!!! Love this product and the shippment! Thank you</li>
            <li> I love how it works, but using it every day kinda makes my face feel raw and burning, so I do it like every other day or something like that.  the bristles are very soft.  I don&#x27;t like the feel of the cleanser, not very lathery, so I use my shiseido one, which is great.</li>
            <li> Found this tucked away in Amazon. Most are high priced and I really wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like one. This is great! My face feels so wonderful and clean after I use this and I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the smoothness and tone of my skin. It looks much brighter and healthier too. It&#x27;s got a nice heft to it, doesn&#x27;t feel at all cheap. I&#x27;m 54 so I can&#x27;t say how it would do with acne but it&#x27;s been great for my skin.</li>
            <li> nice product face feels clean</li>
            <li> Poor rotation, doesn&#x27;t stand up like clarisonic, gave to my 9 year old</li>
            <li> Meh. Your skin will be the same and you know that.</li>
            <li> Does the job without the hefty price tag of the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Great easy to use product.</li>
            <li> Do not use skin sensitive people.&lt;br /&gt;Skin burning sensation when used for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;However, exfoliation is a certain effect.&lt;br /&gt;The skin becomes smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I I like.</li>
            <li> I love this!  It&#x27;s the perfect size for taking with you when you travel.</li>
            <li> First off, Amazon was definitely the cheapest place I could find this, and they allowed me to use a coupon.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was going to get a clarisonic but I didn&#x27;t want to shell out $100+ dollars just to exfoliate my face. I have the Ulta rotating brush, but it&#x27;s very rough on my skin and I&#x27;m acne prone so my skin gets irritated with it. I decided to look up clarisonic dupes, and the Olay brush came up. Bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Its very gentle on my face and gets th e job done. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is even with the 2 speed settings it doesn&#x27;t go fast enough to really get rid of dead skin sometimes. Other than than, its a good cheap investment.</li>
            <li> Love how it&#x27;s small, can have it in your shower just like I do ... I&#x27;ve been looking for a good one like this , glad I found it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over a year, it works great in and out of the shower. The brush isn&#x27;t super rough or too easy, it&#x27;s just right and leaves your face feeling clean &amp; refreshed. I&#x27;d definitely purchase this item again (if mine ever dies lol) &amp; recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this item.  It worked less than 2 months &amp; just quit.  I tried to replace it, but it says not eligible.  So......it&#x27;s guaranteed to last less than 60 days?  Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to cut corners by getting a cheaper option to the Clarisonic.  Guess what...I ended up getting the Clarisonic anyway.  After 3 weeks of using Olay&#x27;s I had rough skin that was breaking out.  That may have something to do with how much pressure I apply when using the system.  When using the Clarisonic I haven&#x27;t had those results.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Pro-X five times a week for about a month and am very happy with the results.  I use the Pro-X in the shower each evening.  I rub cleanser on my face, and then use the Pro-X for about a minute or two, circling around my neck, face, and collar line.  My skin tends to be normal/dry and sensitive, but personally I have not had any bad reactions to the Pro-X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed 2 big changes:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Right from the start, I felt my skin getting much softer.  I think this is because the exfoliation allows my moisturizer to sink more deeply into my skin, so it&#x27;s overall moisture level has increased.&lt;br /&gt;(2) After about a week and a half of using this, I began to notice a good improvement in my skin tone.  I have fairly good skin (no acne, for example), but the Pro-X has made my complexion much brighter and my pores have gotten a little bit smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I ran out of the Olay cleanser, I decided to see how things went using my current favorite cleanser, [[ASIN:B00GLS5DCU Biore Deep Pore Charcoal Cleanser, 6.77 Ounce]].  That cleanser has charcoal (a natural exfoliant), so I figured that it would work well with the Pro-X.  And I have not noticed any difference in the results since I stopped using the Olay cleanser, so I&#x27;m going to stick with the Biore, which will also save me money.</li>
            <li> I love this my face feels awesome</li>
            <li> I cant believe how much better my face looks and feels since buying this product. I use it with the Olay Pore Scrub and my face has never looked better. I will buy this over and over again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, for a great price! I was going to get the clairisonic Mia but over $100!!! I do with their was a brush cap though. But still an awesome product!</li>
            <li> The brush is softer than I expected, but it does a great job. Can be used with any facial cleanser after the scrub that came with it is used up. My skin is soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with this product, and I hope that it will last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is like a massage for your face. My face doesn&#x27;t feel clean when I don&#x27;t use it now. This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> An affordable clarisonic! Skin looks and feels great! Tons of compliments after only one week!</li>
            <li> i heard lots of good things about this product ..so wanted to try it....it is really good. u feel smooth sking after using this product...like baby skin. love it</li>
            <li> My Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System arrived about a week/week and a half ago, and just from the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using it I can already see/feel a huge difference. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to work so well, as I have tried other cleansers with no success, but this thing is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a week of using the cleanser, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed how well my face has been clearing up; it&#x27;s so much smoother and just looks great. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone considering it!</li>
            <li> The brush works well and cleans easily.  The cleaner works well but has a slightly &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; smell.  It does sem to help with blemishes.</li>
            <li> can easily start using with no manual guide. But at the first you have to pull the battery part out really hard! My facial cleansing foam is always gentle so the facial scrub slightly but visibly improve my skin condition.</li>
            <li> It really gets makeup off and makes your face smooth. It is small but really works for a nice face cleaning.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BROUGHT OTHER PRODUCTS LIKE THIS ONE BUT NEVER LIKE THEM.BUT SINCE OLAY HAS GREAT PRODUCTS I WENT AHEAD AND GOT ONE. AND ITS GREAT. YOU CAN USED ANY KIND OF FACE CLEANSING WITH THIS PRODUCT.ITS SO SOFE ON YOUR FACE. AND REALLY CLEAN GREAT.THE PRICE IS GOOD ALSO. OTHERS STORES COST MORE.</li>
            <li> Now that these things are being advertised as the #1 way to keep your skin looking younger, I&#x27;m glad i bought one.  This is easy to use, it uses batteries, can get wet, and leaves your skin nice and soft.  I would highly recommend one of these.</li>
            <li> this is so easy to use &amp; is a must have. it comes with the batteries as well as the head. the head is easy to put on &amp; change when needed. it works so easy this is better than doing it with a manual brush. works for both women &amp; men. i also bought the following with this: Olay Pro-X Replacement Brush Heads  (have not had to change heads but i wanted to have some on hand), Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash 6.5 Fl Oz,Olay Regenerist Regenerating Cream Cleanser Skin Care 5 Fl Oz. both are great for detoxifying pores &amp; the cream cleanser skin care is great for getting rid of fine lines &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li> very gentle brush.&lt;br /&gt;I never use this kind of product before, so no comparison. But i like it. It feels good when I hand it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I purchased this instead of the clarisonic because there were far less reports of the pro x causing acne. Exfoliation usually causes one of 2 things for me more oil or more pimples. However i was pleasantly surprised by the pro x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Big improvement across my checks and nose with regard to black heads and little white head. Around my chin not so much. I will mention I switch to Cerave foaming face wash and moisturizer when i started using the pro x so that might have helped as well.</li>
            <li> For several months I weighed buying a Clarisonic system; however, I was concerned about the costs and whether it was worth the splurge.  I ultimately decided to give the Olay Pro-X a test run, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Here are the pros I have uncovered:&lt;br /&gt;1) Cost - at $18.00 here on Amazon with the coupon available this was a no brainer.  It is the best money I have spent on a face product in ages.  Also, thankfully the replacement heads are so reasonable that I won&#x27;t continually feel guilty about the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;2) Cleaning - I love the super clean feel this product gives my face.  I have used it daily for about a month now, and I can tell the difference.  I started out originally using it just once a day at night to clean off the makeup and daily grind.  After a week, I switched to using it twice daily in the morning to exfoliate and at night.  I love how my moisturizer now really sinks in after cleaning with an exfoliant in the morning, and I love the totally clean feeling my skin has at night after getting rid of all the day&#x27;s make-up, oil, ect.&lt;br /&gt;3) Batteries - I love that this product uses batteries instead of charging.&lt;br /&gt;4) Size - I would say this is one of the best selling points for me over the Clarisonic.  I just wanted a product to wash my face with so I wasn&#x27;t concerned about the body brush.  Plus I wanted to use it in the shower without it feeling bulky and taking up too much space.  It is the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;5) Versatile - I have used all types of cleaners with this and had no problems.  I have used cream cleaners, exfoliating cleaners, bar soaps, foaming cleaners.  I love that I can use whatever I want to get my skin clean with this product.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, I AM A HAPPY CONSUMER OF THS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I bought her this as a present, and was hoping she wouldn&#x27;t want to return it for the more expensive one... lucky me, she loves it!  Not wanting her to think it meant she needed any help in the beauty department, I also bought her this... [[ASIN:B004Q6WO3K Dr. Laura Berman Delilah Massager + Ultimate Sex Guide DVD]]  and she likes this even better!  wink wink!</li>
            <li> I was trying not to spend hundreds of dollars for the more expensive facial brushes but I&#x27;m glad I chose this one. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this spin brush! It makes my skin feel so clean, and it makes such a difference in my complexion. It&#x27;s my favorite part of my skin care routine!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I use it daily in the shower at night and feel that it thoroughly cleans and exfoliates off all the make up, oil and whatever else from my face and neck. My face actually tingles when I rinse it off, which does not happen if I just use soap and water with my hands. I don&#x27;t know if my skin glows,  but I think this helps tighten it a little bit too. You can&#x27;t beat the price,  and I think this cleaning system does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to give something 5 stars unless I absolute love it and it has changed my life in a million positive ways. I am glad I bought this, and I&#x27;ve been using it about a month or more. I do feel like my face is a little smoother, and I may have less acne over all, but I stil get the occasional pimple and I haven&#x27;t stopped using my acne lotions and toners. So far I&#x27;ve only used this facial brush with my usual cleanser. I have not tried the cleanser that it came with. Part of me wonders if I should invest the money in the clarisonic and see if I could get even better results.</li>
            <li> product works as advertised but be careful not to over use, can easily cause dry skin problems, would be great if Olay included some type of instructions as to Novato properly use.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap little brush by Olay that is very overpriced.  I did not find anything special about it, and I hardly use it now.</li>
            <li> So I am very particular with the skincare products I use and thankfully it pays off, I have clear smooth skin - aside from that week of the month, just working on ridding myself of some scars from my younger days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had anticipated forking out the £120 for a Clarisonic cleansing brush this month, but the more times I went to the website, the more I didn&#x27;t want to. Cut long, dramatic story short - I did my usual rooting around and found the Olay Pro-X Cleansing System alternative....and with raving reviews from caio.com and makeupalley.com and some were even saying they preferred it to the clarisonic, I bought one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am chuffed with the results! I have been using it for just over two weeks now and it is definitely worth every penny! It comes with the base unit, 1 regular brush head attachment (They recommend you change the brush head every three months), x2 AA batteries and a 20ml sample of their exfoliating renewal cleanser, which I am yet to try (I love my skincare regimen as it stands and I don&#x27;t want to deviate from what works for me!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal skin except for my t-zone, where it&#x27;s pretty oily. I use Avon Anew 2-1 cleanser and I have been using this since I was 19 and will never change it! I use that in the evenings or when I want to remove my make-up and I use Clean and Clear&#x27;s Truly Gentle Facial Wash in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started off using the Olay Pro-X brush morning and evening and after 2 days I had phenomenal results, to the point that I received several compliments on the third day from both male and female colleagues on my &#x60;glowing skin&#x27; at work! I guess this may have been because it was digging out all the crap that had been in my skin lol - but by the end of my first week&#x27;s use I was starting to get the pesky little whiteheads which is a sure sign of over-exfoliation. I love using it, but have now cut it back to using it only in the evenings when washing away my make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say this is better than a clarisonic as I have never used it, but I have no desire to get one now, because it works so well. It may indeed have additional benefits, but my skin is now in the best condition it has been in almost a year and so I&#x27;m more than happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MaameRose&lt;br /&gt;X</li>
            <li> Love this! No complaints- would recommend to a friend. I have been using this ever since I got pregnant and my face was breaking out all the time and my face feels so much better!</li>
            <li> I noticed a drastic change in the appearance of my skin with continued use (twice a day, daily). It&#x27;s clearer, smoother, and brighter. My makeup goes on better now, and I&#x27;ve also noticed that I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much as I use to.</li>
            <li> This item is small enough for the hand but lacks a stiff enough brush for what I want to use it for .It comes with 2 brushes and batteries that are not rechargeable ,and rechargeable batteries don&#x27;t fit in the compartment .Batteries don&#x27;t last long so the scrubbing action is lacking .I&#x27;m thinking an electical one would be better and a choice of brushes would be nice .I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> is good but with poor power, is better is you use your hands, the batery ends inmediatly, I don´t like it</li>
            <li> Feeling smooth after each use....</li>
            <li> Great way to scrub. It is nice getting my face nice and smooth and soft. I think my daughter is addicted to it.</li>
            <li> The low speed is too weak, the high speed made my face turning red. Not so good.</li>
            <li> Very good. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Its ok nothing special if I would have known I would have purchased a manual face brush im sure you would get the same results. So  no I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product！Excellent seller！</li>
            <li> works great for my daughter, price was the best feature</li>
            <li> Does not appear to do the work, not a strong device.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for several years.  It has made a difference! I often get compliments on my skin, and I know that the Olay Pro-X Cleansing System is the major part of my skin staying clear and having good texture.  Using it twice a day has kept my skin free of breakouts (yes, breakouts even over 70!).  I have recommended this brush to my much younger friends.  I do not always use the Pro-X cleanser, and have tried different facial cleansers (other brands as well) But it is the brush that is so great in doing a through job of cleansing off dirt and make-up. I have never tried the far more expensive Clarins brush, but I cannot imagine any better results.  An &amp;#34;essential&amp;#34; for a great price</li>
            <li> Works well. Skin feels softer and clean, gets a thorough cleaning. Use it few times a week. The scrubber does all the work for you. The cleanser that is included foams up well. Brush head easy to clean. Gadget easy to operate.</li>
            <li> I really like this! The bristles are way too soft for my skin though. I was looking for something a little bit more rough, but besides that it is AWESOME! It has been 3 months and I still haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries!</li>
            <li> This item I received super fast and it works wonders my skin has felt this great in years !!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it does all it says it does. Will have to wait and see! Feels like I&#x27;m at least doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li> dropped once.  broke.</li>
            <li> Clean face happy face. Works great in getting face feeling and looking clean. Easy to use, battery are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper the Mio and if you have normal skin, like myself, I don&#x27;t need to use the cleansing brush every night. I use a few times a week and it makes my skin smooth!</li>
            <li> My face feels instantly better</li>
            <li> Is working fine after a few months. Got it for my wife and she is happy with it. Not a bad price for fairly good quality.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this everyday and just loves the feeling her skin has afterwards. Very good quality and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product use with my own natural cleaning products... had for some time.  Gave one to my teenage granddaughter....</li>
            <li> I originally owned a Clarisonic and Loved it.  High price and broke within the year.  I am not willing to pay that much again. I have owned the Olay pro X before. It does not have the power of the clarisonic or the other tools, but it does a decent job if you use a granular type exfoliating scrub. Great price and easier to travel with and you just have to change batteries.</li>
            <li> Love Oil of Olay products but this one is not so good.  Bought first one from Amazon &amp; it lasted about 8 weeks.  Really liked the way it made my face feel so decided to buy a second one from Walmart since I got a coupon from the purchase of first one.  6 weeks later this one also quit working.  Would not recommend buyin this product at all.  I really like the way these work so going to look for a different brand.</li>
            <li> I do not own a Clarisonic so I can not compare it to anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting much more exfoliating properties from this gadget but it&#x27;s so weak.  A 1 year old baby could scrub harder then this contraption.  Luckily I purchased it during amazon deals or else i would have returned it quicker then I opened the box.  I used it only once and now I still stick to my wash cloth routine.  It just doesn&#x27;t scrub hard enough for my satisfaction.  I read countless reviews about different products before purchasing this one and i&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would love having a facial exfoliator but many of my friends raved about their &#x27;name brand&#x27; ones. So, I thought I would start with this Olay version and upgrade if I liked it. Well, I love it and I don&#x27;t see ANY reason to upgrade. I&#x27;ve played with the name brand version at the store and don&#x27;t see many differences that would make me need to stray from this Olay two-speed version.... the size alone seals the deal- it&#x27;s perfect, lightweight and easy to hold compared to the name brand version. I&#x27;m very pleased and love the way it makes my skin feel and look. How many more times can I possibly say &#x27;name brand&#x27; in a review?!! Anywho, Try it!</li>
            <li> I like this unit.  It feels well made and I hope it will last.  Its nice to have 2 speeds.  The brush comes off easily for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were no instructions in the box but I think it is pretty straightforward.  I like that they not only included batteries...but Duracell batteries.</li>
            <li> I have looked at these things for a long time. Now that I have one I wonder why I didn&#x27;t get it before.</li>
            <li> my skin feels soother after using it, however i have very sensitive skin, so i can only use 2 to 3 times a week so my skin won&#x27;t get red.</li>
            <li> I got this after reading tons of reviews on the Clairsonic and this Pro-x. I found that most of the reviewers who had both actually preferred the Clarisonic, but they also said that for the money, this worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the Olay Pro-X. It works in the shower, and leaves my face smooth and clean. I found the motor to be adequate for the spinning brush, and enjoy using this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may change my mind and get the Clairsonic someday, but this is still a great product at a really great price.</li>
            <li> I am 24 up . I start using Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System .The low price of the Olay product influenced my decision to try it. Since I haven&#x27;t used the Clari sonic. I can&#x27;t compare the two. when I bought it i was so excited about it bcoz i saw better review.In the most essential part for me that is \\&quot;blackheads\\&quot; . this is a bad thing blackheads didn&#x27;t remove by Olay Pro-X- advanced cleansing system &amp; May be it also depends on how sensitive your skin is. I think it depends a bit on your cleansing routine.Otherwise , everything is good .I actually wash my face with soap/cleanser and preferably a brush. So, I really loved having olay pro X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Point :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. skin feels softer and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;2. good change on face within 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;3. it&#x27;s help for blood circulation .&lt;br /&gt;4. the Olay brush doesn&#x27;t come with different brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;5. doesn&#x27;t sound quite right to me.&lt;br /&gt;6. Olay&#x27;s system is powered by 2 AA batteries (which are included)&lt;br /&gt;7. blackheads didn&#x27;t remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with a lot of breakouts and dry skin on my nose and cheeks lately.  I have tried everything to try and reduce both.  Oil free and sensitive skin lotions, exfoliating face washes, special toners, etc.  I finally starting looking into getting one of the brush-type cleansing systems.  I looked at the Clarisonic and after deciding it was too expensive to just see if it might fix my problem, I found this reasonably priced alternative.  I have been using this for about a month and have noticeably less breakouts and my skin is not nearly as dry....thank goodness!!  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a brush-type system.  I use this with my own face wash and it is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address some other users concerns with no instructions, I found the instructions on how to insert the batteries and use the brush on the side of the box.  Maybe this is something they just starting printing on there?</li>
            <li> At first glance this scrubber doesn&#x27;t seem to spin so fast or seem so powerful, but it turns out it&#x27;s fast enough and a fairly strong, reliable motor.  Having used it for 6 months, it is not a toy and works great. It works nice to exfoliate and prep my beard before shaving. I dropped it accidentally from like 2m high and it hit the shower floor and not a scratch and it kept working just fine.  For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a change for the better since using this product.  The price was affordable and it&#x27;s nice that I can use it with whatever face product I want.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter. She love this product. She use it everyday and is seeing good results ever time she se it. Good product!</li>
            <li> Was initially hesitant in purchasing this item, once it came in I started using it it is the best beauty secret I now own!  Thought that it would damage my skin causing irritation and scarring, but contrary to some reviews I found it gentle and effective. My skin now glows and pores are visibly smaller. Less break outs and fades away scars very gently. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It works fine to clean your face but I find I can do the same thing with just a scrub cleanser and my fingers.</li>
            <li> Works great, wish the bristles were a little bit harsher but definitely helped my skin a ton and left it very exfoliated. Gentle enough to use daily.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be more abrasive than it turned out to be. The scrubbing didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> for the price this is an effective  and easy to use cleanser option. i would recommend it. i have used it since dec 2012 and found my skin feels softer..</li>
            <li> I always wanted to get one of these but was skeptical . I was going to get the expensive one but came across this one&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews  and decided to give it a try. Was very surprise of the result . This little thing did a great job my face felt smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> I bought this product to see if it would help with my enlarged pores. I am amazed that it worked even better than I imagined and faster than I had dared hope. I have only used it for 4 days and I have already seen a huge improvement in the size of my pores. I still see them around the sides of my nose but I am hopeful that they will disappear with time. The  pores on my cheeks, chin and forehead are small enough that when I use makeup they can hardly be seen.&lt;br /&gt;The added bonus is how clean and soft my face feels. I have used an exfoliating cleanser for a few years so I was surprised at how much cleaner my face could be!&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased many many products from Amazon and this is the first review I have writen, that&#x27;s how much I  love this product!For anyone on the fence I highly recommend this product. Give it a try, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend, and had to use all tricks and persuasion to make him use it - but once I did I see the effect. It really cleans the skin, gets rid of those awful blackheads that I so hate - mostly. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but for the price I paid for it - it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I loved this device . It  really works. My skin is smooth. The size is so great ,i can carry it with me everywhere even when i travel . Love it</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this cleansing brush at all.  It feels like it barely moves and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement from using it.  I really expected so much more based on all the 4 and 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> THE BRUSH ACTUALLY SPINS, WHICH ISNT ALWAYS THE CASE.  SO MANY ARRIVE AND AFTER I ORDER THEM THEY JUST VIBRATE.  THIS IS A QUALITY ITEM.</li>
            <li> This product is nice, however, I did not note much of a difference compared to just using my hands to wash my face. I cannot comment on the face wash that came with it, as I did not use it.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the Clarisonic Mia 2 and this product, and for the value, I choose Olay Pro-X.  I caveat, I have pretty clear skin, and it is sensitive to boot (Asian skin).  I was nervous to try a stimulator head like a rotating brush head (vs the clarisonic), but Amazon had a \\&quot;coupon\\&quot; that made the final price point $12.  For a chance at smoother skin, I figured, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using the included cleanser, as I am only using 3 times a week, but after 2 uses, I noticed sustained, smooth/soft skin.  Combined with a overnight cream, I have been rocking the smooth/soft face for 3 weeks now - even the BF noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this as a very great alternative to the $100+ Clarisonic, especially if you are only bridging a minor gap to fabulous skin.  If I had more demanding skin needs, I would certainly spring for the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> This product already has tons of 5 stars. Im not going to stay something new, but i have to say i love it. It works wonders on the face. And the most important thing i got it for 17 $ with the coupon. Thank u Amazon :)</li>
            <li> easy to use.  comfortable  not harsh. gives me a clean feeling that is better than I can get with other methods.</li>
            <li> This little cleanser system is amazing, nothing I was doing was getting rid of the blackheads, and mini pimples on my face. Before I deployed to Afghanistan I had decent skin, no pimple breakouts unless I was under serious stress and my face was clear. Once I got here my skin went into a fit, pimples everywhere, blackheads everywhere,and dark marks from those blackheads. I was using the neutrogena grapefruit scrub and it did absolutely nothing for me, this little system is definatley getting my face back on track and clear, I do believe that this cleanses 6x better than the average cleaner. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, twice a day, soft setting in the morning and the harder second setting in the evening. It&#x27;s getting the job done and was well worth the money spent on it. I use the cleanser that came with it but I also bought a bigger sized bottle of it. Its great also.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin is much smoother and brighter since I started using this brush.  I use it once a day with my own gentle cleanser - worth the $!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that is prone to blemishes. I also get flaky skin in certain areas.  No matter how carefully I cleanse my face of makeup, my pores are susceptible to blockage. Now I use my normal facial cleansing product to wash my face of makeup, but I use the Olay pro-x cleansing system with my cleanser at the end to help with deep pore cleansing.  I also periodically use the pro-x cleansing system with a gentle exfoliating lotion to eliminate flaky skin.  My face feels very clean after using, but sometimes a little dry, so I will apply a light moisturizer afterwards as needed.  I would not use this product in the delicate eye area, and I would not use it more than a few times a week. It is probably too harsh for anyone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recently was the recipient of a very generous gift - a full blown spa facial. They used a clarisonic for the exfoliation part of it which was awesome. I felt like i had to have one  but the clarisonic is sooooo expensive. I read the reviews about the Olay and got a positive recommendation from my daughter-in-law so I bought it. I love, love, love it. Your skin feels so smooth and it only takes a few seconds. Just as good and you save $100+ bucks.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Super clean face, feels great!! Couldn&#x27;t say enough great things about this! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I chose this product after years of wasting money on the Wave where you had to replace face pads each time you cleaned your face, it ended up being wasteful and very expensive.  Love how this product works, have had great results.</li>
            <li> I just got it and was very satisfied withe result and the comfort of use on my face.....I only had a problem opening  the handle to put batteries in !!I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about two weeks ago and wanted to use it for a while to see if I could notice any difference and I do! I am a 50+ year-old woman who still has combination skin and some pimple (!) issues, I have noticed a reduction in breakouts and faster recovery from the ones I do have. The texture of my skin is smoother and brighter, the product is easy to use and seems to effectively do the job. I went through the sample of exfoliator pretty quickly and use a Clinique facial cleanser with it and follow up with Clinique moisturizer but I think any facial cleansing product would work just fine and that any moisturizer would be more effective after cleansing with this device. The head has two speeds and I use it on the lower speed for daily cleansing, it is not rough on my skin even using it every day. I am not giving it 5 stars only because the battery installation should not be that difficult (thank you to all who wrote on how to do that) and because it does not come with even one replacement head, seems like there ought to be one thrown in with purchase. I am very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing but make my face even more irritated. Would return but a family member through the box away. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This product is a great value. Smooths and cleanses skin removing excess dirt and makeup. I have had it for a week and really enjoy how clean and soft my skin is already. I have hormonal issues and acne and this product has made a big difference. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with an extra cleansing head, but overall I like it. It works as advertised. I&#x27;ll continue to use it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a month and wonder how long it will last since I use it in the shower. But so far it works fine.</li>
            <li> I just used it  and all I can say it&#x27;s WOWWW!!!! I didn&#x27;t expected to work from the very first use. My face is soooo smooth and clear. OH MY GOD, I LOVE IT! 5 more stars</li>
            <li> After having made it through my teens and early early adolescence pretty much pimple free -- at 28 years old my skin started to take a turn for the worst. It may be that I&#x27;m in my &amp;#34;baby making&amp;#34; prime or the result of recently discovered food allergies, but either way I seemingly never had been able to maintain a clear complexion. I bought this in an attempt to establish a routine rather than always changing products and this thing has done wonders. It&#x27;s gentle, yet effective. After a month of using I have minimal breakouts and my skin looks glowing despite the harsh Minnesota winter that lasts for 5+ months. It doesn&#x27;t cause overdrying, irritation, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s tearing at your skin but leaves it smooth, soft, and refreshed. I switch between using my normal face wash with it and using the olay exfoliator that came with it to prevent &amp;#34;overdoing it&amp;#34;. For a fraction of the cost in comparison to some of the spendier version this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> After trying this product, I never wash my face with hands and soap. I use 3 times a week while taking a shower and my skin is clear than ever and I don&#x27;t have acnes anymore. Hooray~!</li>
            <li> Gives a through cleansing, love it saved a ton of money.  Makes my face feel really great.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it religiously now. It makes a big difference with how you clean your face, you feel like you are really exfoliating with it.</li>
            <li> My skin is a darker complexion and I have moderate acne issues with lots of scars. I feel like this product is making my face so clean. You can use it with any soap and it will scrub so well. My face feels softer, I don&#x27;t break out nearly as much anymore, and I feel like my skin is so healthy now.</li>
            <li> I left my clarisonic brush back in my hometown so i decided to give this one a try. It&#x27;s okay, considering its price. The brush is tiny and it feels funny when it rotates. It takes longer to wash off all the foams if you are using a foaming cleanser, and it leaves your skin kinda of not completely washed...</li>
            <li> I use the cleansing system first time this morning and wow,I didn&#x27;t knw my face was soooo dirty I actually saw the dirt on the brush after years of washing my face with my hands I will never use my hands again to wash my face. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I had acne for a long time.  Of course tried everything ( except internal medication in form of pills). Even had a baby! But still have acne. I decided to try this product and I think it is pretty good. I use it almost everyday and apply salicylic acid once a week (30%). Well, I definitely see a huge progress. I can&#x27;t say if it is this product clears my pores or it is an acid, but the combination of both works for me! So for people who is struggling with acne, I know what it is like. Give it a try, it might be the thing that will save you.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product! It&#x27;s practically the clarisonic, but a lot more affordable and within my price range. It leaves my skin feeling very smooth and clean. I use this about 3-4 times every week because if used everyday, you WILL over exfoliate your face!</li>
            <li> I use this maybe once a week with my face soap. It appears to work and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend alot.  I think I would be upset had I spent more on the other type that is popular.  So, if your new to the whole brush thing.. I&#x27;d give this one a try before you overspend.</li>
            <li> brush a little too soft. Doesn&#x27;t exfoliate like I thought.It does stimulate the blood to the  surface&lt;br /&gt;of the skin</li>
            <li> I love using this to clean my face. The only reason its my third one is I keep it in the shower and sometimes it gets dropped and sometimes it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for a couple weeks and I really like it.  My skin feels much cleaner and smoother than before when I was just hand-washing.  I&#x27;ve always had acne, and while I have had a few more breakouts lately, this brush also seems to help smooth the places over.  I am hoping that my skin will continue to clear and my acne will eventually be more under control.  After each use, I wash the brush head with Hibiclens to sterilize the bristles, along with warm water.  I am also thinking of washing it (the brush head) in the dishwasher once a month.  We shall see!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son.  He needed something a little more for his acne.  It is perfect because he can run it over his face and it does the dirty work.  He was using my clarisonic, but he was too rough on it.  I got him this cheaper alternative and he uses it every night.</li>
            <li> I had never had a problem with acne until I got pregnant.  Then my face exploded and nothing I tried did anything for it.  I tried all sorts of expensive face creams and treatments, and I got no results.  Then I saw a review of a Clarisonic Mia on Youtube, and I decided to loo into it. It&#x27;s 100 dollars, and I really didn&#x27;t want to shell out that much if it probably wouldn&#x27;t work for me anyway. While researching, I stumbled upon this and thought it would be a good thing to try out.  And it worked! The first night I used it, my skin felt so soft and clean,  cleaner than it had ever felt.  The next morning, I didn&#x27;t have any new zits, which hadn&#x27;t happened for me in over a year.  I was very excited. I use this every night to get all the makeup out of my pores and exfoliate, and my skin is looking great.  I still get an occasional small break out, but the zits are much smaller and last for a day or less.  Before, I was suffering from horrible cystic acne.  The heads that come with it last about a month each with daily use, and I just use my own St. Ive&#x27;s apricot scrub with it.  I definitely recommend to anyone with skin problems or anyone who is thinking about getting a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> have always wanted a cleaning system for my face. This is great. It makes my face feel so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This past winter really took a toll on my face. My skin was dull, blotchy, and so dry that it was flaky in areas. To make it worse, I had a test done where I had probes adhered to my face. The gel adhesive they used caused a reaction and I ended up with extremely dry, red patches. So I bought the Pro-X to exfoliate to give my skin a major overhaul. I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Pro-X system for a few weeks now and I love it. I use it at night in the shower with the included cleanser to remove my makeup, then I moisturize. I feel like my moisturizer penetrates deeper and I&#x27;m seeing improved hydration and tone overall. If I don&#x27;t wear makeup, I either don&#x27;t use the brush or I use it very gently on the slow setting. I have noticed that I don&#x27;t need to wear as much foundation because my skin is so clear and even. Two of my friends have bought the Olay Pro-X system because they saw for themselves how much better my skin is. I get compliments all the time on how my skin looks and I always tell people that it&#x27;s thanks to the Pro-X. I also want to point out that the cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but still does a good job of removing my makeup.</li>
            <li> I like this cleaning system a lot. my face feels alot more cleaner than hand washed. and it is affordable.</li>
            <li> its fine it did give some changes on my face so good product :) but the wash cleanser bottle is like half way empty so thats weird but other then that good product</li>
            <li> The verdict isn&#x27;t in yet. pulls your hair in if you get it too close.</li>
            <li> I use this nearly daily in the shower but not for as long as I probably should.  Morning routines...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I loved it so much I bought one for my sink as well.  For those days I can devote more time to my face.  Mind you, my sink is 6 feet from my shower, tops.  But I hate, hated, hate when I forget to put it back and it was affordable enough I could justify a second.  I mean, risk management says I should avoid walking wet and barefoot across any wet tiled surface...right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it in combination with Freeman&#x27;s Feeling Beautiful Pineapple Enzyme Facial Mask I get soft glowing skin that is very similar to what happens post expensive facial but without the cash drain.  I follow with a basic face moisturizer (usually whatever I have handy)that doesn&#x27;t have an expired date on it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this! It feels soooo good to use and improves the look and feel of my face.</li>
            <li> it really works great. i use it every morning and my face is starting to clear up slowly. the battery last a long time, I have not changed mine since I first started using it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Skin seems clearer.</li>
            <li> This simple device, which you can use in the shower, removes only the lightest amount of skin, which you then replenish with moisturizing lotion or deep night cream. This system is truely the only one to have! Among other things, you need only the smallest amount of the exfoliating cream on the bristles of the brush; a little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> This system does exactly what I hoped it would - it cleans my face better than anything I&#x27;ve tried thus far. It feels great, isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (and I have used it with several different cleansers so it doesn&#x27;t just work with the one it comes with), and my breakouts have reduced for sure. One note: if you do have a current breakout/pimple, you don&#x27;t want to use this on it because it can irritate that and/or spread ickiness. Just saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t show obvious improvement for my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin nor make break outs. I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> I bought this product figuring it would be good for the circulation of the skin, which it is. I still prefer a washcloth for the complete cleansing process</li>
            <li> Great little machine! Quick way to thoroughly wash your face. I love mine. Only thing is the face wash it comes with is SO small. Mine ran out after about two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Really cleans, on my first use - I noticed that the bristles had a brown tinge to them :( . As a person with excema, it&#x27;s super important to get all the dirt out of my pores at the end of the day and this really does the trick without drying or irritating my skin. Love it &amp; will definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> I feel that this product can over expose your skin if you use it to much.  I have gone down to using it about once or twice a week.  After using this product it does make my skin feel softer.  So, I really do like that.  I just am very prone to breakouts and it seems to not help that.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive ones when you can get this one.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect facial cleansing brush for my teenage son. He is autistic, so he&#x27;s VERY picky about what touches his skin. This brush is small, soft , and easy to use. He LIKES using it! The price is great.  After one week of use, I can already see his skin clearing.</li>
            <li> I have not had an opportunity to use this item yet, but I have read great reviews everywhere!  The price that I was able to get this item for was les than I could have purchased at any retail store.  I will update this review once I have actually started using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great clean well and leave my skin so soft,love I made a good choice . I would recommend this product and I am buying another one for a gift .</li>
            <li> This thing really cleans your face well! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 months and I absolutely love it! My skin is so much softer and it feels so much cleaner than just using a regular face wash.</li>
            <li> This is an essential tool for all skin types.  It has worked well for me since the first use.  You&#x27;ll be amazed how necessary it is.</li>
            <li> so soft~its made in china，his material feels very soft，small and exquisite。very good ~！Exfoliate once a week to go on the list。</li>
            <li> Great face system! soft bristles and water proof. comes with batteries, just as good as the super expensive ones!</li>
            <li> I really, really was looking forward to getting this.  I&#x27;ve wanted one since I saw it featured in an infomercial.  Not Olay brand, just one of those ones that comes with a product for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always like Olay products so when I saw this, I was excited.  When it arrived, I immediately took it into the bathroom and tried it out with the sample scrub it came with, then tried it with Regenerist scrub I ordered with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I&#x27;m not impressed.  The brush head is pretty small.  The power is minimal.  Press it too much on your skin and it will stop spinning.  Doesn&#x27;t take much pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read other reviews and many people said they had a problem with the batteries.  That was a really simple bit for me.  Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the design, but I had zero problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, what this comes down to is, to me, is that it&#x27;s all just a trendy new beauty product.  Know what works FAR better?  Hot water, soap, a washcloth, and your own hands.  Then finish it all off with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  ESPECIALLY do not waste your money on those brushes that cost over $100.  That&#x27;s a ridiculous scam right there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Buff Puff and Dove soap.  I don&#x27;t get acne, nor blemishes.  I got this brush because I figured as I was getting older my skin would change.  And it has gotten more oily in the T-zone.  But no one needs these brushes.  Just don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough:  Washcloth, water, soap.  It&#x27;s worked for centuries.</li>
            <li> Lov this thing so much!</li>
            <li> I have one and love it.  It works great and is inexpensive.  I am buying this one for my son for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Since the very day I started to use this product my face has felt more alive and fresh!  It&#x27;s been only a few weeks and I get complements daily on how I look!  Working full time, nursing school full time and having twin toddler Grandbabies living in our home , a simple product pampers me daily!  I love it!</li>
            <li> my skin feels smoother and i can feel my facial cleanser tingling deep down in my pores so i know that it&#x27;s cleaning my face better than before. not as many breakouts i think it&#x27;s because i&#x27;m not touching my face as much to wash it. overall good product</li>
            <li> I bought this because my skin has changed a LOT over the past 4 years (since becoming pregnant with my son). It felt dry and looked dull. I looked tired all the time. This has made a huge difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance. I don&#x27;t have blackheads anymore. My zits are almost non-existent. My skin feels and looks so much better. My husband (works construction) uses it after work to get the cement out of his facial pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of Tips: I used up the tube of cleaner that it came with really fast. I use a goat&#x27;s milk soap now, and I actually like the way that makes my skin feel better. I can use it to take off my mascara and eyebrow makeup faster without it hurting.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush works better when it&#x27;s wet. I fill up my skin with hot water, rinse my face, dunk the brush, and apply the soap/cleanser directly to the brush.&lt;br /&gt;- use it on your neck and chest too.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X Cleansing Brush is a great alternative and value to other high-end devices out there (aka Clairsonic). I&#x27;m fortunate to have decent skin to begin with, but I was looking for something that would help scrub off the excess oil and grime that would build up throughout the day. I have occasional breakouts, so I was looking for something to keep that at bay while not having to spend $100+. Using has it been great, and I have gotten a lot of compliments on the look of my skin and its texture. I only use it a few times a week, but I feel like that&#x27;s enough. I&#x27;ve used the included sample exfoliating wash, which lasts a while, and alternate that with my regular face or anti-acne face wash (both are by Every Man Jack).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device itself is compact and battery powered, so it&#x27;s easy to travel and not have to pack a charger. The brush is interchangeable, so you can replace it once it gets a little grimy like how you would replace your toothbrush. Since I don&#x27;t use mine as often, I&#x27;m going on roughly six months on the same brush, and it&#x27;s still in good condition. Although, I did purchase the extra brush heads, so I&#x27;ll be ready when the time comes. Don&#x27;t expect a variety of brush heads like Clairsonic, this one looks basic compared to the competitor, but I think it does it&#x27;s duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this a great product if you&#x27;re looking for something to boost the efficacy of your usual face wash. It&#x27;s very inexpensive, and depending on how often you use it, it can do your skin wonders. It&#x27;s great for guys, too, so don&#x27;t be turned off by the fact that it&#x27;s made by Olay and generally marketed towards women.</li>
            <li> I love this product! leaves your face clean without the over-drying feel. It removes all traces of make up and dirt and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and i have sensitive skin. Honestly, if i wouldn&#x27;t feel so sleepy(Right now as i am typing this) i would write all kinds of wonderful things about this product! Shrinks pores and improves skin overtime. I use with the sample cream it came with and i am VERY happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I like it. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face red.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to every one who has sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a gift off a wish list.  The giftee was very very happty to receive it.</li>
            <li> This is great.  My skin is very sensitive and I use this with the Aveeno facial cleanser.  It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this, I was hesitant because its SO much cheaper than the clairsonic.  Its not too harsh on my face at all.  I llke that I can use my own cleansers with it</li>
            <li> I really like this product and enjoy using it. I love to have received more of the cleanser or maybe a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I own one and bought two more for daughters as stocking stuffers!  This little powerful, handy brush has totally changed the skin on my face.  Definitely worth the small investment and great results delivered as promised!</li>
            <li> This item makes your skin feel cleaner and softer than when you use a wipe or wash cloth. I would reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself and my sister and we both love it. It is better than i expected it to be. Would order it again if required.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is a bad product, it&#x27;s OK and I guess it does what it says. I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s any better than using a regular washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;I am a long time fan of the Olay products and I bought this because I heard it was comparable to the clarisonic system.&lt;br /&gt;If this is comparable to the more expensive system, I am glad I didn&#x27;t spend more money! I will still use this item but the bottom line for me is that I think it&#x27;s hard to beat a good old fashioned washcloth. Plus, washcloths don&#x27;t need batteries!</li>
            <li> I bought this and I love it.Works really well.Cheap and does a great job just as good as the higher priced ones.I do recomend this product.Love it.Great.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product.  I felt it got my face really clean.  I lost it while traveling and ended up getting a Clarisonic but if I hadn&#x27;t I would have repurchased.  It was really clean feeling and I would recommend as a cheaper option to the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It is more gentle than my hands when using my scrubby acne cleanser. When using my hands (gently) with my face wash I get a slight rosacea flare up, but with using this brush, I get no flare up and my pores are becoming more clean and are shrinking! I&#x27;m so amazed! I like how this has a normal and high speed button, I haven&#x27;t used the high speed yet since I don&#x27;t feel I need it. But I&#x27;m I got this brush system for Christmas! It&#x27;s fun to wash my face now, and it feel so good on my skin. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I purchased this cleansing brush. I think it does a great job cleansing my face, clearing out my pores and removing dead cells. The brush moves in a circular motion and this seems to aid in cleansing but, for me, in no way makes it hard to control. The brush is gentle enough not to feel like you are &amp;#34;over-scrubbing&amp;#34; your skin but strong enough to make you feel you are getting a truly thorough cleaning (a great balance). I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> At 28 my fair skin still is very sensitive, and I break out often. I got the Olay Pro X because I had heard good things about Clarisonic&#x27;s Mia from my sister (who has similar skin) but wasn&#x27;t ready to commit to buying a clarisonic yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using the pro x I would wash my face with my hands, and I would experience breakouts I would say often. I used the same facewash (sebamed) through all of my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got the Pro X I started using it once a day every day, and used it for over a month. I noticed my skin was softer, and my breakouts weren&#x27;t as bad. The Pro X has a rotating brush that spins to clean your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I saw a little improvement, I caved in and bought a Clarisonic Mia, which I have been using for two days now. I love it! My face feels clean - like that deep clean you feel after a facial. My skin also gets a little red (but goes away) after using the Mia, much like when I have gotten facials in the past (because of your skin being stimulated and the blood rushing to the skin to heal). Because of this, I usually use it at night before bed. Instead of a rotating brush, the brush vibrates sending sonic waves (much like a sonicare) into your skin as you rotated it around your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, the pro x is comparible to the difference between using a regular toothbrush and then stepping it up to using a vibrating battery powered toothbrush. Then, the clarisonic would be like the sonicare. Sure, the pro x/battery powered tooth brush does a better job and makes a difference, but the clarisonic/sonicare simply does the best job.</li>
            <li> I had been interested in buying a face cleanser for quite some time. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune but I also wanted one that did the job. it works great and leaves my face feeling silky smooth. I love this product and I recommend it to any man or woman who wants a fantastic face cleanser without emptying your wallet!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as great as I expected, I mean it cleans my face, but I honestly don&#x27;t really feel the difference? Maybe it&#x27;s the face wash i replaced it with (which is from clarins btw). I didn&#x27;t like the facewash that came with the box, only because it didn&#x27;t really feel like it was cleaning off the dead skin, oily-ness, etc. I like the concept, but I think I&#x27;ll save up for another product other than this one. I don&#x27;t know what to do with it now because who wants to use a used face-cleanser..gross &amp;#62;&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> My daughters loved the brush but the switch started to not work after 1 week. After 6 weeks it can\\&quot;t be tuened on.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these - one for my son who has acne trouble, and one for myself, hoping it would be a fast way to wash my face in the shower. It is wonderful!  I have used it for a week now, and am already seeing improvement in my skin texture, coloring and overall appearance. For the price - it can&#x27;t be beat!  my son is also having great success with keeping his acne at bay.  He doesn&#x27;t like to spend time washing his face, but he WILL take this into the shower and use it.</li>
            <li> I love using this.  My face always feels so smooth and clean when I&#x27;m done.  However, it&#x27;s a little rough so I try not to use it every day.  I can&#x27;t say if I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in break outs since using it, but I definitely enjoy the effects.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products!  I have to say that I was ready to head to Ulta to buy the Clarisonic for a lot of money when I came across this.  I decided to give it a try and I have not been disappointed.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months now and it&#x27;s still going strong on the original battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this compared to the Clarisonic is this one actually turns in circles rather than pulse.  It gets my pores clean, the bristles are soft, I use it in the tub or shower and run in under water to rinse.  No problems getting it soaking wet.  I often forget it has two speeds as I just use one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the oil of olay cleanser one day which is a cream and the other day I use an acne bar with it.  It works great for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another one if and when this dies.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at Costco for about $38.  It came with cleansing brush system, cleansing gel, batteries and an extra head.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. The skin on my face feels so nice with the gentle daily exfoliation. A must have</li>
            <li> Using this cleansing system I have been looking forward to washing my face every night! My face is so soft and clean! It has been preventing my chronic breakouts AND this can be used in the shower because the batteries don&#x27;t become wet! The best product anyone can buy for their face. You will not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I would like it to be. But, it&#x27;s okay. Just don&#x27;t pay full price for it. I got mine on sale.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for its value compared to other costly products in the market. I usually use an exfoliator scrub so I felt it wasn&#x27;t as effective as using my hands to exfoliate my face. But first use usually wouldn&#x27;t show much effect, so will wait after a longer use to give final verdict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: price, decent quality, waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: as of now, not as effective</li>
            <li> Just save up for a Clarisonic. This was not even close to being anywhere near comparable.</li>
            <li> Loooove it. I keep it in my shower and use it on my face. I apply cleanser, and facial scrub. It is fantastic.</li>
            <li> As great a product and the advertisements claim.very pleased.</li>
            <li> Gave as gift.  Recipient loves it!</li>
            <li> I love all Olay products</li>
            <li> Still works after over 6 months</li>
            <li> Purchase this now!!!!!!!! it is really cheap compared to proactive&#x27;s model. use it with like a biore pore cleanser and i swear to god it will change your life. I used to just wash my face but this shit EXFOLIATeS. You don’t even realize how gross your face is. My acne seemed to be deteriorating and I became so frustrated and sad until i used this. god sent this down to earth i s2g&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mild/moderate acne and I&#x27;ve been on Epiduo and this cleanser did more for me in 1 week than Epiduo did in 5 months. THIS IS A MUST HAVE I CANT STRESS IT ENOUGH. I swear by this product you will NOT regret it. The fist time you use it, your skin is so smooth and clean. It takes away the dried, dead skin you dont even realize is on your face to help rectify inflammation and discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: always make sure you moisturize after you use this (even if you have oily skin - use an oil free moisturizer) to prevent it from becoming flaky.</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  The first one lost the seal around the battery compartment.  I will try one again</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for a long time, but some of them are pricey. I bought this one at a great price on Prime day.  I used it with the facial scrub that was included in the package.  I was very impressed with my results.  My face was noticeable brighter, smooth and soft after one use.  I plan to continue using the cleansing system on a regular basis.  It&#x27;s definitely a product worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> One of the best brush for daily routines, you can notice the difference within a week</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine how this differs from the $100+ version. This does the job!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really seem to work. I would not recommend this product. I used this every other day but didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 3 weeks now and they feel great. I noticed my skin being a lot smoother and cleaner too. You can switch between two speeds (fast and slow) but the difference isn&#x27;t as noticeable. I would recommend the slow setting for those with sensitive skin. Definitely recommend these for those looking to exfoliate and keeping their skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Basically the bristles are so fine they do nothing except push everything you are trying to wash off your face even further down into your pores. You will get better results from an average wash cloth.</li>
            <li> WORKS AND ITS A LOT CHEAPER THEN LOCAL STORES</li>
            <li> Only complain is that I wish a larger cleanser came with it. Other then that, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I rarely feel like I got a good buy when purchasing facial cleansing products. However, this product is worth every penny. Prior to using this product, I noticed that face wash did not remove all of my make-up . This was an issue because I am prone to breakouts. I would try to get my make-up off with toner, etc., but this became costly. This product not only removes all my makeup, but has helped reduce the amount of break outs that I get (still have acne, just not quite as bad). I also noticed that my make-up goes on much smoother than it did in the past. I do not have wrinkles yet, so I am unsure if it helps minimize them. I would imagine it help keep skin looking youthful because it really exfoliates well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have mentioned that they do not use the cleaser that comes with it. Despite its cost, I highly recommend the cleanser. When I added the Pro X Cleanser to the brush after using a different cleanser, I saw that it removed make-up that the other face wash missed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as opposed to the more expensive Clairsonic to see if these little machines really worked.  I found out it does and it works wonders.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but literally after the first use, my skin looked healthier, more vibrant/less dull, and my fine lines on my forehead were definitely minimized.  I use it after I wash my face at night and my skin looks great the next day.  It has two speeds and I find the brush to be soft and non-irritating and I find that one use per day is enough.  You can get it wet which is great and it has two speeds.  I know it&#x27;s working because I see the results not only on my face but on the brush because the leftover makeup soap left on my face shows up on the brush.  I think this product is fabulous and well worth the price.  I plan to stick with this one as opposed to the more expensive versions because the results are great.  Very happy I purchased and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This works great I have wanted it forever and it is totally worth the $$$.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your face feeling great.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wasn&#x27;t getting all of the makeup off of my face with just the normal face cloth and soap.  It has been great for deep cleaning. It really gets down in the pores and cleans good. My sister has a much more expensive one but this one works just as good as her more expensive one.  The more expensive one has a larger cleaning surface but I don&#x27;t find that to be worth all that extra money. I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate my face at all.  I still use cleansers for sensitive skin with it because I need it but the scrub brush doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I use it in the shower because it is water proof and I can get all of the soap off of my face after using the cleansing system. I have not used the cleaning sample that comes with it yet because I am afraid to use something I have not tried yet. I will update when I use the sample.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Takes all of my makeup off very easily and my face feels so clean when I am done using it!</li>
            <li> I think it is a great product. Use it on a daily basis. Battery lasts a long time. Ideal for the shower too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many many years. Just ordered a new one because the old one was getting pretty yucky with mold and it wasn&#x27;t cleaning up as it used to. I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin as an adult and this brush along with my own cleansers have done the trick to control outbreaks</li>
            <li> Item as described. It is water proof and can be used anywhere. But it will take time to see whether it is beneficial. Good customer service, but somehow I cannot comment on that, or the review cannot be posted..</li>
            <li> This product is a decent one for the price I paid, however I had some issues... It took a great amount of wrestling to put the batteries in. I also noticed my skin became a lot dry and had break outs in the following days of using it. So its going back.</li>
            <li> Purchased 06/15/2013 and received item 5 days later 06/20/13; to that I give 5***** stars speedy delivery. It&#x27;s light weight, cute, easy use.&lt;br /&gt;For the price as a first time owner/user of a facial exfoliating system it&#x27;s a good buy not bad;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY criticism is that the brush is TOO SOFT! I&#x27;ve been surfing cyber space trying to find any additional STIFFER bristle brush-heads to switch out. It would have been nice to have had a soft and a firm bristle brush to interchange with according to ones personal needs. Although I do have to admit that what I&#x27;m about to say no one is probably going to believe me; and that&#x27;s Ok if you don&#x27;t but I know in my heart that this is the honest truth people I squat you not.&lt;br /&gt;While in the shower getting ready for work, OK I exfoliated/ used the Olay Pro-X for approximately 2 minutes give or take.  Got to work and received all kinds of compliments that I looked: Refreshed, Well-Rested, Bright, Cheerful and Glowing.  WOW! now that&#x27;s pretty amazing, Only good / positive remarks that I can add to that is - That the proof is in the product &amp; little handy dandy durable machine (lol).&lt;br /&gt;I am a 46 year old African American Female and to receive such compliments from my co-workers that made me feel REALLY good,&lt;br /&gt;No complaints about the Olay Pro-X I only wished there was an additional Harder Bristle/Brush and a (3) THREE SPEED instead of a (2) two speeder.  I&#x27;M SATISFIED BUT WILL KEEP CYBER-SPACE SEARCHING UNTIL I FIND A COMPATIBLE COARSER BRUSH(s)&#x27;... Too sum it up **Yes** I would highly recommend the purchase especially if your new to the whole facial exfoliating thing like I&#x27;am.</li>
            <li> I brought this product as requested by my wife. She was a satisfied user of the product and she actually recommended to many of her friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have since ordered more than 30 sets of the same product due to highly demand by her friends. We will continue recommend the same to the rest of of friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cheers and thanks</li>
            <li> I saw the more expensive version of this product by a different manufacturer and it had sparked my interest. But being a fan of Olay for 30 years I knew going in that the chances were pretty darn good that this product would meet or exceed my expectations. The professionals at Olay teamed with dermatologists and designed a product that makes you \\&quot;rethink your daily cleansing routine\\&quot;. The Advanced Cleansing System cleans 6 times better than basic cleansing with a cloth or your hands.  My face feels terrific after I use it and the best part is I can keep it on the shelf in my shower so no fancy set up is needed. The rotating bristle brush is soft and the exfoliating wash is terrific too. Olay comes through with shining stars. My face feels great and I know it&#x27;s clean. The only thing I would change about this product is that I would like a stand to put it in so it can sit upright in the shower. This does not deter me however from giving it a five star rating.

            <li> Great product and unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> I hesitate to penalize the product for the peculiarities of the user, but I thought my experience would be valuable.  I think this brush is well constructed, and it felt great to use.  Unfortunately, it made me break out within a few days of starting to use it.  I got pimples in weird places, like just above my lip and between my eyes.  When I discontinued use, my skin went back to its usual state of a blemish or two now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to see my dermatologist on another matter as this was happening and he told me that in 60% of cases, washing makes acne worse.  Not a message we see too often in the media, as it&#x27;s hard to make a buck advocating that someone refrain from using a product.  Food for thought.</li>
            <li> I love this product! At first my face was a little sensitive to it but after a couple of uses I could tell a difference! I usually get acne from not properly taking off all of my make-up, but this really helped. I could see on the cleaning pad all of my foundation i missed. My face started clearing up and it really makes my skin feel smooth. I love it and use it everyday before bed. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> it works perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I saw results the first time I used this!  My skin was tighter and my pores small.  I can&#x27;t imagine getting any better results with the more expensive brands.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am really not sure how a good a job this does as compared to my regular cleansing with my face cloth.</li>
            <li> This brush is not as powerful as I would have liked, but I am keeping for the price.  I previously had the Clairsonic brush, so hard to compare the two. Because the Clairsonic was just very powerful, you felt like your face was getting a better cleaning, but battery went dead just out of warranty and it was pricey!</li>
            <li> really good  my face is much better now  but the cleaner is smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> Spediione velocissima...in 3 giorni è arrivato a casa!L&#x27;ho provato subito ed è fantastico!!!!</li>
            <li> This is not even remotely close to the clarisonic.  I bought this based on reviews on Amazon saying it was similar to it, but nope.  Not even close.  I think I could get a cleaner face by using a wash cloth and cleanser :(</li>
            <li> Super happy with this purchase, it has two speeds, the brush rotates fast and cleans well but still gentle enough with the skin, I think this is something you can use everyday as part of your cleansing routine and it won&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small compared to my old one but I like it</li>
            <li> This works well, but bacteria will build up in the bristles if you don&#x27;t sanitize it regularly.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would be more like my daughter&#x27;s Clinique cleansing brush...but what did I expect at less than $20 vs. her $100 unit!  Works okay but not exactly powerful.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be to harsh on my skin, but it seems more gentle than a washcloth.  I use very light pressure and it still gets my skin very clean and smooth and ready for moisturizer and makeup.  Also, my makeup looks much smoother on my skin.  I feel like my skin glows.  After using this a few times, I ordered another one for my son, and a package of replacement brushes.  He is a typical teenager who has a few skin problems.  Hopefully this will help him get his skin squeaky clean.  He tried mine out and said he liked what it did for his skin and is looking forward to getting his own.  We like the fact that it is a sturdy little machine that can be kept in the shower.  I would highly recommend this for anyone, and seems gentle enough for the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what a difference this makes versus just regular face scrub. My face has been break-out free in the couple months since I&#x27;ve started using this (every other day). Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It works amazing, my brother loves it. The machine cleans deep into your pores. In other words, you need this machine to clean your skin! You can&#x27;t clean as deep with just your hands. He has been using it for several months now and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I love this. Feels great on my skin. I use my regular cleanser with it. Like the 2 speeds. My daughter wants one.</li>
            <li> It good to help with daily cleaning, I am not sure the durability of the brush. But I can see the difference in my son face</li>
            <li> Nice deep cleansing system. The brush heads are not too stiff. Would be cautious about using it daily if you have sensitive skin. Even though the brush heads are very soft, you can over scrub if used for more than a minute or so. Important to moisturize right after cleansing. Works great on your back as well.</li>
            <li> I gave the product three stars because it works as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this review as a warning to others that it may not be what your particular skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive, flaky skin. I wash with gentle products (Cetaphil type cleanser and Philosophy moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this product would be PERFECT for dealing with flaky skin. I could just imagine the wonderful exfoliating properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a week using my regular Cetaphil type cleanser rather than the cleanser that comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush feels good but afterwards my skin felt rather raw - even when being gentle with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the week I used it I felt my skin got WORSE. What had been some peeling/flaking turned into what I imagined to be a fine web of damaged looking skin that peeled and flaked constantly. I perservered thinking I&#x27;d get through it and improve it but it never cleared up.</li>
            <li> My wife told me she does like Olay for her face and love Olay for a christmas present from me and told me to buy olay for Christmas this year.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for the price I just wish it came with an extra refill brush to use. I use it twice a daily really cleans my face good</li>
            <li> I am often told I look young for my age (48 years old) and I have spent decades merely using a mild cleanser and rich moisturizing cream (both less than $10 each) my dermatologist recommended. Both were purchased at the drug store. Another dermatologist suggested the Pro-X line, but after going so long spending next to nothing on skin care, I balked at the prices. But my face is looking older and I broke down and bought this WONDERFUL little gadget (with the cleaner) -- the two together work great! My skin is the smoothest and softest it&#x27;s been in years. My skin looks younger and less wrinkled. Well worth the price!  FYI, I have sensitive part-Asian skin and found no irritation from this system nor the cleanser. Sometimes I find myself touching my face to see if it&#x27;s still really so smooth and yes it is.  I used the Clairsonic once and it was great, tingly almost irritatingly ticklish, but for the price this Pro-X is the clear winner. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this with the cleanser and you can expect super clean and smooth skin. After cleansing I sometimes put a few drops of vitamin E oil and a touch of rich moisturizer and swirl that around my face for a minute. My skin looks so great, I am so happy with this little gadget!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after having had the chance to use a clarisonic. Some reviews convinced me this was comparable and with the great price I couldn&#x27;t resist. It is a very nice system for the price, but if you are buying because you think you will have the same results as the more expensive clairsonic, you are wrong. Skin was not left as smooth, has only 1 cleaning head, uses batteries with no charger, and has no case. The head also seems to slow down a bit when slight pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> I really like this item. It does a great job at deep cleaning my face no matter what face cleanser I use. I also like the exfoliating face cleanser that&#x27;s included with the product. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this item is that the brush is a bit too ruff for my skin, so it&#x27;s too uncomfortable for me to use on a daily basis. However, even with just using this system 2-3 times a week I have seen visible improvement in my skin. My skin feels cleaner and less weighed down but not dried out immediately after I use it. I have been experiencing less break-outs (actually no new break-outs since using this. YAY!)</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself, and liked it so much I bought one for my daughters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had some complexion problems and needed to try some way to maintain healthy clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I started with a product and saw some benefit, then I picked one of these up at Costco.&lt;br /&gt; (where I paid more than this price,btw ,Costco no longer carries it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Use it about 3 times a day, and &amp;#34;my secret&#x27; I use it once a week with a clay mask, WOW!&lt;br /&gt; Anyway, my face is looking great now, and I&#x27;m a believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND....I am still using the original batteries! (not rechargeable)&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it runs on batteries and you can take it with you in your luggage, it&#x27;s small.&lt;br /&gt;It just keeps plugging along, (pun intended)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I have used it on my feet and hands too with good results, cuticles looking better on hands, and heels are smoother than before!</li>
            <li> i love this for the price! its way cheaper than the ones i see at the mall. its easy to clean and easy to store.</li>
            <li> This product gets two thumbs up from me. It doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune and it works really well. It works like a charm. First time I used it I saw the difference right away. My skin felt smoother and cleaner. I&#x27;ve used other products and they always left me feeling like I still had the whole day on my face. I recommend this product to those of you are are looking for an affordable cleansing product that won&#x27;t hurt your pocket.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay Professional Advanced Cleansing System in order to help with exfoliating dry skin and getting rid of black heads. All I can say is that after years of trying to fight off black heads with every exfoliating soap out there, this is the only product so far where the black heads have actually gone away, I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results! The brush always helps remove dry skin effectively. I think the effectiveness is due in part equally to the cream and the brush combined. Use it in the shower when possible, especially if you plan on rinsing it during your wash or you&#x27;ll get water all over the mirror. Be sure to also check for buildup of soap in the brush if you want the brush to last a decent amount of time. I&#x27;ve also found its really important to moisturize right after using the system or my skin tends to dry out pretty quickly. Overall this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now and my skin has never looked or felt better since I was a kid.  It&#x27;s gentle and effective - especially for those with combination skin.  My cheeks and nose are always dry (live in the Northeast) but my chin is oily and tends to break out.  Since using this product my foundation doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s been caked on and my moisturizer seems to have soaked into my skin much better.  My skin is so smooth and has a healthly glow to it.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and highly recommend others to buy it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I tried this with the Pro-X cleanser but I think it works just as well with other face washes such as Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I was debating about Clarisonic but couldn&#x27;t get past the huge price tag.  Bought this cleansing \\&quot;system\\&quot; and am very happy with the results.  I have very oily skin and have frequent crusty patches on my face . . . the little rotating brush did wonders on the very first use--I noticed a difference immediately.  It works well with the little tube of exfoliating cleanser that comes with it, or with my usual Neutrogena cleanser.  My skin feels so clean and refreshed.  I am really glad I saved myself $200+ by not buying the Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> At the moment, I&#x27;m a 24 year old male who&#x27;s looking to clear my face up the most affordable way I can. I came across this product by looking over the top 100 products in the Beauty Dept and this was in the top 5. After looking at what purpose it serves and all the positive reviews that came along with it, I figured it may be a good exfoliator to try with my regular daily wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it in the mail I was excited to try it. I already knew to be weary of installing the batteries as most people complained about in their reviews but got them installed with no problem at all. When I turned it on though, I felt somewhat fearful that this may not work out. It strongly reminded me of one of those cheap portable hand fans you buy at the dollar store attached with a baby brush. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is of great quality, but the bristles are just too soft for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it in the shower, I felt as if I would honestly get a better wash using my hands alone to massage in my face wash. This is way too gentle. I didn&#x27;t want to give up on the product so I used it a couple more times, but I am still highly dissatisfied and feel like I wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 2 stars for 2 reasons. 1) The facial cleanser it comes with at least seems to work well. 2) I may be the wrong candidate to try this product as it does seem more targeted for women much older then I am and needs to be this gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m just debating on giving this to my mother or returning it.</li>
            <li> I think this does a good job cleaning my face. It has two speeds (one slow and one a little bit faster). I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for about a year. I can say that my face definitely feels more clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this little machine and facial cleanser.  As a guy, that is probably an unusual thing to say.  However, men have to do skincare to maintain a studly, youthful appearance and this is a basic beginning regimen all men can benefit from just as much as women!</li>
            <li> this product really works---i live in the caribbean and get too much sun so i bought it to smooth away scaly spots on face, arms and chest--be careful around hair as it will grab it and tangle it quickly---just turn it off and pop the brush off and your hair is fine!</li>
            <li> Do I need to say more? I bought it for my wife and I didn&#x27;t use it. Since she loves it, I assume it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li> bought it for myself. cheap and great product. Skin looks better after one week for me. will buy again .</li>
            <li> This brush is what I was looking for - soft, but very effective. I have a light complexion and sensitive skin and this works for me!</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try over the much more expensive similar items.  It works very well and I feel and I feel like my face has been thoroughly scrubbed.  I have the T-zone problem with large pores and I see a difference using this system.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my teenaged daughter who has oily/acne prone skin.  It is gentle and helps with her taking care of her skin.  It&#x27;s easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> I love the product but I was surprised there were no instructions included with it.  I&#x27;ve never had one before so I wasn&#x27;t sure about the use of it.  If not for this I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great little cleanser! Love it!</li>
            <li> really love it! it works great!</li>
            <li> I was scared to order this after reading some reviews.  What is wrong with you people?  This is the most absolute best product!  It is an extremely soft brush  that will NOT hurt your face.  It cleans your pores and makes your skin glow.  I will use it forever!  Thank you Olay!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t justify spending $200 on some of the name brands.  This works just fine and keeps my facial skin clean and healthy.  Good product at a great price!</li>
            <li> My mother loves all Olay products and the Pro-X Advanced Cleansing system is no exception! She uses it every day.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, works well to wash your face. Not much to say about it besides that, it works well as described, has two settings of low-speed and high-speed. Overall good product</li>
            <li> I just bought this a couple of weeks ago because I wanted to try it instead of one of the more expensive brands. Before I use it I take all of my makeup off with a remover cloth, then I use it and it works so well! It picks up all of the leftover makeup that I thought was already gone. It leaves my faces feeling so squeeky clean. So far it hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all.. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say its perfect. Defiantly worth the price though!!</li>
            <li> Very weak power. I would not recommend or buy again. A pretty worthless cleaning brush. No value here at all.</li>
            <li> This was such a good buy! It really helps exfoliate your skin and get all the dead skin off! I use it twice a day with my regular face wash and an exfoliater in the shower 2-3 times a week. Yes I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this because I have had such bad skin all of my teenage years throughout my 23rd year. I started using this and it has cleared up my face in amazing ways. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for me because my skin is pretty normal. I try to use it 1-2 times per week because it does dry your skin (as I&#x27;d read on other reviews). I use a creamy, mosturizing face wash and after rinsing well I apply Eucerin cream as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try. I have used it for 2 days and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. I am using my usual face wash (Aveeno Ultra Calming in the morning and Aveeno Essentials Detoxifying Scrub in the evening) and right off the bat I noticed my face is smoother and softer. The lines I had going from the side of my nose to my mouth are gone!  My lotion also soaks up way easier and I don&#x27;t have to use as much, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy anymore. The only thing I have noticed is that it is kind of a pain in the butt to keep my hair away from it, but other than that it&#x27;s great. Definitly worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I had a Clarisonic for years and was hoping this would be comparable at a reasonable price.  The brush is too soft and the power is too weak.  I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Wish it rotated a little faster.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a product like this, but wasn&#x27;t willing to spend&lt;br /&gt;$200. so, for a considerable less amount...this works great!&lt;br /&gt;Some might not like the battery operated, you need to replace&lt;br /&gt;the batteries every few weeks to keep it running at it&#x27;s best, but&lt;br /&gt;it is great for traveling, small, light weight and works well.</li>
            <li> I think it has improved my skin tone and my pores.  I use it maybe twice a week, I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so I don&#x27;t have a dirty face, so I like that it smooths my skin and gets it ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is an easy way to thoroughly clean your skin while exfoliating at the same time.  I use this product three times a week and find the results just as I expected them to be.  Clears your skin of debris that otherwise would clog up your pores.  Also, you can use other exfoliating products instead of the Olay brand to save some money.</li>
            <li> gifted item.. doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with it</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks now and I love it.  I used to get dry patches of skin on my cheeks but since I have been using this, they are no longer an issue!  Anyone looking for an affordable way to keep your skin looking healthy, this is it.</li>
            <li> Update after 1 year: I am still using this cleansing brush and I am just as amazed. I use it at least once daily with the Olay cleanser that came with it (I bought more). I also bought extra replacement heads, made differentiating marks on them with a permanent marker and now my sister and I both use the same cleanser. We just change out the brush heads when we use it. And even with two people using them so much, the batteries last very long. I only just changed the batteries for the first time last week. That is well over a year since I bought it. Amazing product at an even more amazing price. Definitely recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived as scheduled, packaging was really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the product review:&lt;br /&gt;I think it does a very good job of removing dead skin cells and promoting new skin growth. Few weeks ago my mother commented that the skin around my mouth and chin was looking very dark. Looked almost like a goatee. That&#x27;s mostly due to use of hair removal products from upper lip area and also acne scarring around my chin area. I decided to do something about it and after a little bit of research I decided to get this cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once daily for about 5 minutes every night. I use the cleanser that came with it. I apply Olay Regenerist Regenerating serum after cleaning my face. I also wear an SPF product under my moisturizer during the day to prevent sun damage to the new layer of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 10 days since I started using this and I can already notice 3 distinct improvements in my skin&lt;br /&gt;1. A slight improvement in the hyper pigmentation around my mouth area.&lt;br /&gt;2. I had a huge cluster of really small, microscopic pustule-like texture right under my lower lip that also seems to be disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;3. The most impressive result of using this cleansing system is the effect it has on pores. Years and years of acne left really large and visible pores on my cheeks and in just 10 days, I can hardly notice any of them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the improvement in my skin is not due to the serum because I have been using the serum since last year. I use that for the smooth feeling that it gives my skin but it was the cleansing system that has improved both the look and feel of my skin. It could be possible that the two products work better when used together. Please note that when I say two products I am referring to (1) Olay&#x27;s Regenerating serum and (2) the cleansing system which includes the device and the face wash that came with it. I take it that the device was meant to be used with the face wash. I suppose people could use a different face wash if they wanted to but I think my results have been so good with the cleanser that came with it, I will stick to using just this for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles of the brush are very soft and not at all harsh, at least not for my skin. There are two speeds, I don&#x27;t use the lower speed much because I feel it&#x27;s too soft for my skin. I have used it in the shower without any problems. It came with with 2 AA batteries that are still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product and I ordered more of the sample cleanser that came with it. I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Using this brush is certainly better than just using your hands to wash your face. But, since I haven&#x27;t used Clarisonic yet, I&#x27;m not sure if this Olay one is generally on par with Clarisonic or just more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewing the brush on its own, I like it but it hasn&#x27;t wow&#x27;d me or helped improve my skin dramatically so I would be inclined to see how Clarisonic is.</li>
            <li> I went on a trip and forgot my clarisonic. I can&#x27;t live without it. So I ran to the store and bought this one, seeing as it has such good reviews. I hate it. I broke out so much. It does nothing for cell turnover. You HAVE to use an exfoliating cleanser. With the clairsonic, it already exfoliates your skin, so you don&#x27;t need one. I tosses it and am buying a clarisonic MIA to keep in my travel bag. NO WAY does this compare to the best in the world. A waste of money if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I have returned this.  It will work fine for you if you are just looking for a simple face cleanser.  Actually, you could do more with hand washing with a washcloth.  I thought this was kind of cheap though.  But it all depends on what you are looking for.  I believe the Clarisonic is probably the king of these things, but I refuse to pay that kind of price.  And after much research, I have decided I can do more for my exfoliating needs with a simple face brush and a good exfoliating cleanser.  I am a frugal person who does not believe in throwing my money away on the trendy things in life just to be cool.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for anything that removes dry dead skin so of course I purchased this.  Once I got it and used the specially included \\&quot;goo\\&quot; right away.  My excitement was replaced by \\&quot;meh.\\&quot;  I think it was Cybil Sheppard that said she use to steal cheap white washcloths from hotels while on location because she loved their abrasive texture to clean her face.  The Pro-X seemed like a lot of hoop-la for very merger cleansing experience.  I should have skipped the hype and stole a washcloth from the Motel 6.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected and I wish it was a little more powerful.</li>
            <li> perfect exactly what i wanted exfoliates and removes makeup</li>
            <li> Worth the money I spent on it. Use it every other day while in the shower. Cleans my face very well, will strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel so soft after using it. It exfoliates nicely. It removes all traces of dirt and makeup.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Makes your face feel silky and so very clean. Great for the money spent! Blemishes are clearing quickly now that I actually get my face CLEAN!</li>
            <li> I would always see this in the Wal-Mart isle as I would stand there trying to find something to make me look 21 again.  I will say that I purchased this several months ago and right off the bat I loved the way it made my skin feel immediately afterwards.  (I use the standard Olay foaming face wash with it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I thought well is it really doing anything special?  I used it almost every night per week.  I would keep it in my shower caddy or right beside the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After almost 4 months of use I can honestly say my blackheads that reoccur in the same parts of my face since I was oh around 15 yrs old, (I&#x27;m 36 now), are diminished.  They are gone.  Plain and simple.  Pores are smaller too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a simple idea of a rotating brush, but it is soft enough not to irritate.  I loved it till it stopped rotating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I abused this in the sense that I did keep it in my shower,  and I did not wipe it down and keep it dry, after 4 month&#x27;s it died and after opening it up the batteries were corroded and new batteries did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase another, I encourage anyone to buy, it&#x27;s a great product.....just keep it dry!</li>
            <li> About $10 cheaper than in stores....I have had two Jaffra ones similar and both burnt out....we&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts....bristles are much softer..like the two speeds.</li>
            <li> So I got this instead of waiting to save up for a clarisonic, so I can&#x27;t compare this to a clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I like it.  It leaves my skin clean and soft, has cleared up my blackheads pretty well on my nose and in the corners of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the cleanser it comes with AT ALL.  I use Burt&#x27;s Bees cream cleanser, the chamomile bark one.  I think a cream cleanser works really well with this product because the nature of the device is to exfoliate and the cream cleanser can keep the skin hydrated while that is happening, but that&#x27;s just a personal opinion, no medical evidence.  I have heard people using cetaphil and things like that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this often, you are going to chew up batteries.  Invest in re-chargables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t overdo it, use it only 2 minutes or so and only once a day, even less if you start feeling irritated.  This is going to be different for everybody, just telling you how it is for my skin, which admittedly, is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the replacement brushes are easy to find, but obviously the clarisonic has more types of brush heads to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the product, it gets my face clean, but don&#x27;t expect it to make your skin perfect overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Keeps skin soft, cleans out blackheads, easy to find replacement brush heads&lt;br /&gt;Cons: chews up batteries, lack of different type brush heads, icky cleanser comes with it</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, using this little machine, you can really tell what kinds of things are hidden in your pores. It cleans very nicely and can adjust to two speeds. It&#x27;s a very good price compared to the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> ive seen em at biglots now. for half the price, anyway, started seeing a difference in skin at first but not really after initial uses</li>
            <li> Love it, I was unable to buy the $100 version of this product, so I heard about this one and opted out for it, so glad I made that decision, I Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I only wish it could run faster...</li>
            <li> Have had for a long time and still working fine and really helps complexion.  Recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product feels not tender on skin. If you&#x27;re oily skin, it will fit you.</li>
            <li> This product was cool-- it took off my makeup very well. My face didn&#x27;t dry out, but I didn&#x27;t see any change in my complexion. I get a few pimples from time to time, and I have normal skin (perhaps a little more on the dry side).</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. It is much better than more the expensive (department store) brand!</li>
            <li> Not that exciting a product. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> It works great. Its waterproof so I can use it to wash my face in the shower. I don&#x27;t like the scrub it comes with but it works with my own face wash.</li>
            <li> I like this way of cleaning my face. It feels much cleaner than using a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Not that cool... but what can I expect for 22 dlls... i think I will keep it for a pair of face washes....</li>
            <li> Love this product. Is not too rough and can be used daily. This is just as good as one of those more expensive products!</li>
            <li> Great purchase and I&#x27;m hard to please!</li>
            <li> Perfect makes makeup so much easier to take off.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I was pretty exited about this, super cheap and 2,000 reviews, but unfortunalty it only comes in one size brush, no body brush no pumice brush no nothing the brush is really small not to mention the product is small as well. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This really does make my face cleaner and smoother than my former wash cloth\ method, and it&#x27;s not as messy either. It is soft and gentle enough to use every day. A very tiny sample of cleansing gel came with this, but you can use any kind you like. I ordered a small mirror that suctions to the wall so I can use this every morning in the shower.[[ASIN:B0085WHBHU Deluxe Shave Well Fog-free Shower Mirror - #1 Best-seller in the Shower Mirror Category on Amazon - 33% Larger Than the Original Shave Well Mirror]]</li>
            <li> Excellent !! It works on me !!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It is awesome! I gave four stars because of the speed. I wish it would be a little faster.</li>
            <li> This product is not for everybody. I purchased it at a local convenience store of mine, hearing about all the rave reviews online. This is supposedly one of the best products out there. Unfortunately, For those people like me with sensitive skin, this is something to avoid like the plague. After purchasing this ans trying it for the first time, I found a few things i disliked about it. For example, the device itself does not seem to be waterproof, or even water resistant. I was hesitant about bringing it into the shower with me, so I used it over my sink instead. When applying the product to my face and exfoliating, i found it got all over the device. After cleansing my face with it, the spinning brush stopped working for me. I believe because it came in contact with some water and the facial cleanser. I have rendered the cleansing system useless on my first use! after rinsing out the cleanser from my face, I found myself to be very red and blotchy. Unfortunately it is a common reaction for me with most cleansers, so I was not surprised that this did not work well for me. I was disappointed however. Waking up the next morning, I found that I had acne worse than I had ever had it before! this product completely clogged my pores, and caused a breakout in the likes I have never had before. Once again, I have sensitive skin, however I have never had a face cleanser cause acne before.&lt;br /&gt;I advise anyone who is looking to buy facial cleanser, or a cleansing system, to be extremely careful of what they put on their skin. If anyone has sensitive skin, this is definitely not the way to go&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and happy buying!</li>
            <li> Ordered this since I break out occasionally. It&#x27;s comfortable on your face an easy to you. Skin feels great afterwards.</li>
            <li> This brush cleansing system is really good. I use it with an medicated cleanser and i really do see a difference. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I have it and use it all the time</li>
            <li> I used this product believing it&#x27;t Olay brand.I have been using olay products and all of them were super good.This one did not work at all!.. I was so surprised to see this product which had no results at all!.. Just an Olay Regenerist scrub will do it all for you.Just massage your face with 4 fingers with the cleanser and you are done.It has no job which will show you great results.Waste of money.Instead we can buy night creams or cleansers with the amount and massage ourselves.</li>
            <li> Love this product, leave my skin very clean and soft. The brush is very smooth so it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> For the cheap price this product really does the work of something nearly 10 times the cost. Easy, durable, and effective. Although still get occasional acne and clogged pores I have noticed a difference and love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> FIrst of all, I was little bit surprised that it was smaller than I thought at first.&lt;br /&gt;But it is really smooth when I rolling on my face, it feels very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I recommended it to everybody!</li>
            <li> easy to use. I like the small handle and i wish it can really do more magic than towel to my skin.</li>
            <li> I just got the Olay pro x and I love it. You can feel how clean your face feels after use.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it twice a week. It makes my skin feel clean and radiance. Will recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> My face feels very clean and smooth after each use. It has two speeds you can set it on and each speed is gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> This product will do all most everything the Clarisonic will do at a fraction of the price. I like the fact that the bristles are a little softer than the Clarisonic, as the Clarisonic bristles are a little the ruff for my skin. For the price it is a \\&quot;Must Buy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for the cleansing brush. It works remarkably well, especially at it&#x27;s price point for delivering a result of soft, well cleansed skin. (it took me a couple of uses to realize it has two speeds). I have ultra sensitive skin, and the device itself causes no long lasting irritation. I have a nice glow after using, however I use the cleanser I&#x27;ve always used for my daily routine. The Olay Pro X cleanser it comes with it&#x27;s quite nice, but for my skin type,a little harsh. So that I&#x27;ll use maybe weekly. Overall I have been quite pleased by&lt;br /&gt;the  overall results. I do strongly recommend that prior to each use the brush be sterilized to avoid transmitting bacteria to your face and pores. A dip in alcohol, or spritzing of vinegar, just to be safe.  Also, when using around your nose, due to incomplete contact, you may want to close your eyes, as cleanser will go flying!  I will definitely be recommending this product! I&#x27;ve been an avid user of scrubs, scrubbing pads, etc, and this has given me the best results by far, without irritation.</li>
            <li> So I waited awhile to review this to really get a good feel for if I like it or not.  I have never used the Clairsonic and really debated buying it, but the price tag was just too high and I couldn&#x27;t justify it. I do think this does a great job, my face seems clean and it really does a good job removing makeup way better than just soaping with your hands or a washcloth.  One thing I have noticed is that I seem to get more? blackheads, especially around my jawline. I use a blackhead popper and now they seem to just get inflamed.  Not sure if it is all related to this scrubber, but I have not really had to deal with this before (I&#x27;m 39) so I would guess the scrubber has some correlation.  Not sure if the Clairsonic would do the same thing :( or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the sample of scrubby cream that came with it, because my face is so picky about anything I put on it.  Oil of Olay and I have never got along :).</li>
            <li> Ive never used a clear-syonic before but ive always wanted one but, there soo expensive and i dont have that kinda money. So when i came acrossed this product i was ecstatic ! Its only 20! Ive Never experienced  cleansing like this before. I can feel the clean and soon as i start putting on on my face! My breakout are less and it remove heavy makeup in a breeze . My new Must have product! Lovee itt! Thank you Olay for creating such a affordable and functional product.</li>
            <li> My grandmother always swore by Olay. She has passed away and her skin looked better than mine ever has, at half her age. After many years and my noticing my aging, I decided to follow her advise,I wish I did when she was still here.&lt;br /&gt;I had my first facial and the lady discussed with me taking care of my skin. It may have been my grandmother speaking through her. I purchased this the next day and in no time, I could feel and see the difference.</li>
            <li> Cons: In the last 3 months, the product has ruined my skin. My skin broke out and i now have the scars to prove it &#x3D;(.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The battery 3 months later still works. I use this twice a day. It works great in the shower. The massage feel is gentle but nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - i am going to stick with using this product because it does clean the skin BUT i feel it is aggravating my skill and making me break out &#x3D;(. I suspect i need to eat a cleaner diet and lay off the chocolate!!</li>
            <li> When washing the face, the brush gets makeup off thoroughly--I was impressed!  Both speeds worked for me, although with continued use, I went to the lower speed.  It really does help clear away dead skin cells from the face.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft after using this! I love that it was an inexpensive alternative to the Clarisonic! I love how it cleans deep to get the make-up and dirt out of my pores! Recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the gentle brush and the cleanser seemed to work well too. I have only used it once,  but I think it will be a good product for me.</li>
            <li> With this product I am able to get soft and clean skin without having to drag a washcloth or bare hands across my face. It has helped clear up some acne and reduced my pores. I think this is a great product for small price that it costs. I would say if you dont want to spend the $100+ for the clearsonic, the go ahead with this as I think its almost the same results.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve suggested it to many friends but they are hesitant to buy because they think it&#x27;s for older women! HA! I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 months now and I still break out every so often (I&#x27;m also only 19), but my skin is 10x smoother and it just looks better! I definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for gifts too!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have never tried the more expensive clairsonic or nutrisonic devices.  But I love this little brush.  My skin feels great after I use it, and it lets me use less moisturizer at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made a body-brush head for this device.  The only body brushes that are reviewed are either quite expensive, Clairsonic or woefully unreliable Nutrisonic--too bad.  I&#x27;ll let you know how the clairsonic body brush does--as soon as I save up the money to get it (smiles).</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these, one for a co-worker &amp; one for myself.  She really likes hers, I really like mine.&lt;br /&gt;It does a nice job, gets your face nice and clean without scrubbing harshly.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought a 3rd one for my daughter-in-law as a gift, she also thinks its terrific!</li>
            <li> I will never EVER use this again. It gave me the WEIRDEST, GROSSEST, MOST INTENSE breakout I have ever experienced. I probably had about 50 teeny tiny little whiteheads ALL OVER my cheeks the day after using this. Nothing else in my beauty routine changed while using this so it HAD to be this. It was a nightmare. I looked like I had a rash all over my cheeks!!!! Nothing like this has EVER happened to me before!!!!! Granted, I have acne prone skin, I get one or two normal pimples when I use products that don&#x27;t agree with my skin. Seriously guys, I can&#x27;t be the only one!! I have used the clairsonic brushes before while getting acne facials and they were amazing so I was looking for a cheaper alternative. Well this is NOT it! And no, I wasn&#x27;t using it wrong or too harsh or anything. When it comes to my skin, I know what I&#x27;m doing. I used it lightly, on the lower setting, for a normal amount of time. I don&#x27;t even know what to do with it now because it feels like the ultimate waste of money to throw it away after one use. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it on my feet or something. But it will never touch my face again. Buyers beware! If you have sensitive and oily skin like me, DO NOT USE THIS! Or at least use it a few times when you don&#x27;t have plans for the next day. I had a job interview! How mortifying!!!</li>
            <li> My ski thanks me for buying this product! My pores are cleaner and less defined, my skin seams tighter. I am pleased with the purchase and the price. Good value!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product! I like it and I wanted this so much! Very Excellent purchasing for me!</li>
            <li> I use it every night and leaves your skin really smooth and clean. My imperfections are significantly decreased. I like it so much. Recommend it especially for impure skin, but also for other types of skin, to keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the shipment has respected the time and it was fast, even though I live in Italy, it took only 10 days, and the packaging was very safe, very good.</li>
            <li> I really like it. I did some research and found that the other products that were in the $125 dollar range did exactly the same thing. The only difference was their size. They are bigger so you can use them for your whole body, but consequently not as packable.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for about a week but I can tell a huge difference in my skin. There are similar products like this, and while I have not personally tried the, I can&#x27;t see how you can beat the Pro-X. Definitely get your bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. She uses the product every day. I even got a kiss and a hug...I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> Lift fits in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;Cleansing the skin is smooth to become and feel ease.&lt;br /&gt;The price goes down a little more and more people will love.&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof function is very simple to use and a comfortable shower.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy an expensive cleansing system and then I read the reviews for this one and they were all good so I thought I would try it and I am extremely pleased!! Scrub on Oil of Olay, I love ya!!</li>
            <li> Was gifted a &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; facial cleaning system and this works the same without the ENORMOUS price tag.&lt;br /&gt;Use with any facial cleaning soap.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from adult acne and black heads for years and years. Enter this gem. I read the reviews and figured $20 is not a big deal to give it a go. I am amazed how well it worked for my sensitive skin. I use it with DermaDoctor Wrinkle Revenge 3.  It really leaves my face soft with a healthy polished glow. I also use the St. Ives apricot scrub once a week with the brush and its has really diminished the black heads. I still have to go in and manually clean them out but not nearly as often as I did before the brush. It&#x27;s amazing how this simple gadget helped clear up my face. Its been over 6 months and so far I can only count 2 minor blemishes. I will never go without the Pro-X!</li>
            <li> Love it. Don&#x27;t have a clairsonic to compare but this gets the job done. I would not take it into the shower b/c of the battery unless I could store it somewhere less humid and I was really good at keeping it out of the water (which I am not). I do not have particularly sensitive skin but it seemed like it was gentle and firm enough at the two different speeds.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush.  My face has never felt so clean and soft!  I am an older woman and I just want my face to feel clean and fresh.  It must be working because a friend recently asked me what I have done to my face, that I look 10 years younger!!  When I told her about the Pro-X she immediately ordered it and loves it.  The brush is very soft, yet it exfoliates beautifully.  I use Simple facial cleanser and moisturizer and it does a fantastic job.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am the husband to the wife that this was purchased for. Why do I get to write the review? Because I get to look at my Wife&#x27;s face all day. I must say, she does wear make-up for work and before this brush she had significantly more issues than she does now. I can&#x27;t see the reason for buying the higher-end model for this brush, and neither can my wife. She absolutely adores this brush and uses it daily. Highly recommended for those of you ladies that need to get dolled-up for work.</li>
            <li> For those people saying that it doesn&#x27;t compare to a Clarisonic…well, duh!  This is a fraction of the cost of a $150+ Clarisonic!  For the price, I&#x27;ve been very impressed with the quality of the unit and cleansing brush. It is ideal for teens because it cleans out clogged pours.  Plus, it runs on batteries so no one has to remember to charge it.</li>
            <li> A good price and my face feel new everytime I use this. It gets the job done very well. Try it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO glad I bought this rather than a Clairsonic. It does exactly what I expected and its much less of an investment.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great for the price. I leave it in the shower and use it only when I wore a lot of make up that day.</li>
            <li> The sheets are just what I wanted,like very much.</li>
            <li> Really good alternative to more expensive products.I use it every night and my skin feels fresh. Maybe it could be to often to use it every day if the skin- type is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I do not know what took me so long to finally purchase one of these facial cleansing brushes, but I am so glad I did.  I am a 37 year old woman with occassional break outs and pretty rough textured skin and clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has really reduced any breakouts drastically.  I also now have smooth skin and when I go get my makeup done professionally, they tell me how great my skin looks and feels.  My pores have minimized as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccommend</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and does an excellent job of cleaning my skin. There was a visible difference in my complexion after three weeks of use. I was so impressed that I gave it as a birthday presents to my daughters.</li>
            <li> I had really bad cystic acne and almost every product broke me out. I have one holy grail face wash, but finding an exfoliator that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin was a challenge. This brush does an amazing job!! I am very gentle with using it, I don&#x27;t use the face wash that comes in the box, and I only use it twice a week at most. It is a really great purchase and I am able to exfoliate now using my regular face wash. It&#x27;s a perfect product for me. I wanted to get the clarisonic at first but after reading the reviews I decided to try this first. I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have tried this sooner! My skin looks great. It has helped breakouts and winter dryness but it&#x27;s gentle on my skin. Forget all the exfoliating scrubs and treatments and use this instead!</li>
            <li> I am in love with the Olay Cleansing system! I have been looking for an exfoliating brush for a long time and most of them are really expensive. I&#x27;m talking like $150-300!! So, when I found this I was so happy! It comes with batteries, so that was an awesome bonus. And it comes with a small bottle of the cleansing cream. I use an organic, all-natural exfoliating cream made by a friend of mine, I haven&#x27;t used the cream that comes with this brush. However, the exfoliating brush is outstanding!! There are 2 speeds and you can use it in the shower, as it is waterproof! I love this brush and would definitely recommend this to anyone, male or female!</li>
            <li> great for price, I can not believe some of the other ones they are selling for double or triple the price with no refills with it!  And the refills are cheap too!  Actually spins as where most of the others just vibrate and cant see why to even buy them!  Way to go Olay!</li>
            <li> love love love.&lt;br /&gt;you can notice the difference right after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everybody I know.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad that I got this.</li>
            <li> After owning the Clairsonic &amp; having to throw it out because the batteries were not able to be replaced, I ordered this system.  Compared to the Clairsonic, this system just does not do the job.  The rotating brush does not do much as far as exfoliation &amp; runs on the slow side. I&#x27;m debating on whether or not it would be worth it to return the whole thing.  If you want a great exfoliating device-go with Clairsonic.  If you have really sensitive skin &amp; are not used to exfoliating, than this might be the right product for you.</li>
            <li> I believe this system helps me clean my face really well every day. The bristle are soft and the cleaning is thorough.</li>
            <li> Other cleansing systems are very pricy, this one is good and gets the job done for about a quarter of the price!</li>
            <li> This system does the same thing that the more expensive ones do, but costs a lot less. Feels good too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one of these facial cleansers for a long while. I couldn&#x27;t justify the hefty price tag on some of the other versions of this product. After reading reviews on Amazon I decided to go with the Olay product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviewers are right. This is a great product! I could definitely tell a difference on my face after using it. I will purchase more of these as gifts for my family.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my girlfriend, daughter and granddaughter and they love it. It leaves your skin smooth and clean, does wonders on blackheads and other debris. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This didnt work as well as I had hoped and actually ended up irritating my skin more than anything. I would next time just buy the real thing. Good try though.</li>
            <li> Love love this cleansing brush. Leaves my face feeling clean and soft. I highly recommend it. You will love it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice so far but thought I&#x27;d review it. It made my skin feel very clean but I noticed a little bit of sensitivity and dryness after using it. I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and have combination skin. I would not recommend using this more than a minute or your skin will start to sting. The product works as stated and is easy to figure out. Simply push a button and it turns on after installing the batteries that came with it. The cleanser it came with seems to work well. I plan to use it with Aveeno Positively Ageless after the sample runs out since it&#x27;s less than half the price of the product that came with this system. I saved about $10 by purchasing this through Amazon instead of buying it at my local Target.</li>
            <li> This is great and works wonderful, I was deciding between this and the MIA, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on the MIA.  So glad I bought this because it works great and was way less expensive.</li>
            <li> im loving this and ive only had it two days. it really helps get all the make up off, even after soap and cleansers.  im looking forward to seeing better skin now that i have this.</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive cleansing system...its worth the money.  I think I will use it awhile and then invest in a more expensive model.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting something to clean my face thoroughly and this is it! I saw it at Walmart for around $50 and I wasn&#x27;t going to pay that much. Getting it from Amazon for around $20 is the best way to go! I love that it has two different speeds to choose from and also comes with a small tube of the Olay face wash. Very happy customer here!</li>
            <li> I love my brush. It makes my face feel so good after a long day at work and my complection looks great.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s the job done. I cannot imagine Clairsonic or any other cleansing systems doing a better job of cleaning than this. The good part is..it&#x27;s a fraction of their price.</li>
            <li> compared to some of the cleaning systems out there - this one is extremely reasonable.  My 13 year old daughter loves the way it makes her skin feel afterwards and if it gets her to wash her face - I&#x27;m all for it!</li>
            <li> I wish I could get the Clarisonic Mia, but at $100-200 it&#x27;s just not in my budget. I mainly use the Olay Pro X to remove any makeup my makeup remover towelettes didn&#x27;t get. I think for $21 it does a pretty decent job. I like to use the Olay Foaming Face Wash with it. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> i used to have pretty bad acne but with this it scrubs off all the dead skin that was clogging my pours! it works so well!</li>
            <li> This cleansing system makes me wanna wash my face all day! After just one use my skin felt cleaner than it ever had before, after a week of using it twice a day I have no breakouts! They are gone, cleared up, and my skin looks and feels so smooth. I don&#x27;t know what I ever did without this system!</li>
            <li> i think that is not very useful, but it&#x27;s ok , not too bad, it will hurt your skin, be careful when you use it</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Clarisonic. It claimed to clean just as well. I didn&#x27;t have a Clarisonic to compare it to, but my mom had been raving about hers. At first I thought this product was just fine, but it was very harsh, so I could only use it twice a week. I have very sensitive skin, so any more than that would have been way too much. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference other than my skin did feel softer afterwards. I still get minor adult acne, and my skin didn&#x27;t feel cleaner than before. This product had no effect on my acne. I used the Olay for about 3 months, then went to visit my mom. She made me try her Clarisonic, which I could use twice a day. I immediately noticed a difference. When I got home, I purchased my own. My skin can absorb the products I use better, and the soft feeling I could only get twice a week I could get daily. Also, I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple in two weeks! The clarisonic is gentle on sensitive skin, and has even-ed out my skin tone, instead of leaving it raw and red. You can purchase the Mia on here for $99. I would highly suggest it. You will be much happier.</li>
            <li> This brush is great in cleaning. feels refreshing after using it and pores do not clog anymore. i recommend it to anyone with problematic acne</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone who wears makeup.  I found that I prefer using my own brand of cleanser but the Pro-X itself is great.  Lightweight &amp; waterproof.</li>
            <li> the wife has not stopped using it from the day she got it, i even tried it once . overall great product</li>
            <li> Low price but good stuff~ it&#x27;s okay to use it once  a week~ However, it could only rotate but not vibrate~ so it might not as good as Clarisonic~  anyway~ enjoy~ :) .</li>
            <li> I like it, the price is good. It does what it says. With this machine I don&#x27;t have to worry about not cleaning my face the way I should. The two power levels are really well adjusted and it works for those days that you feel your skin sensible so you don&#x27;t go hard on it. Overall the quality of the product is really good. The cleanser that comes with the machine it not of my taste but I use a lot of cleansers and they work good with this piece of work.</li>
            <li> Its very important that for those with sensitive skin this might break you out. I used it for two days and got a lot of zits, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for a couple of days now and my skin is much softer.  I don&#x27;t use the cleanser that comes with the brush so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but using the brush in conjunction with my regular routine has left my skin much smoother than it ever was before.  I use argan oil as a moisturizer, and the effects of the brush seem to help the oil absorb into my skin better and leave it more supple than before.  The brush is very soft so most people will probably be fine with daily use of the brush.  I also like the fact that you can use the brush in the shower without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that you can take it in the shower leads me to my only negative, which is the difficulty in getting the battery compartment open.  I suppose it has to be a tight fit otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t be able to take it into the shower, but it took me a while to figure out how to open it up.  There are brief instructions on the side of the box but that didn&#x27;t help much, and I had to resort to looking up a demonstration on YouTube before I had some idea how to get it done.  But now that I know the method, it won&#x27;t be an ongoing battle.  I think it&#x27;s just the first time that can be a real pain.  If you can get through that, you&#x27;re home free.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who is looking to up the ante on their skin routine.</li>
            <li> Motor has 2 speeds; not very fast, but gentle enough to use more frequently than the higher speed models. Battery last a long time. Great price. Water resistant. Can buy multiple brushes and use device for multiple people.</li>
            <li> UGH skin!  I have been on long term steroid therapy combined with winter&#x27;s harsh wind and cold made my facdrier than the Sahara Desert. A merry go round of skin products later still no significant improvement.  Then a few weeks ago I added a variety of Olay products to do battle.  Although I must admit I was skeptical after lathering on much more expensive products with excellent reviews from Amazon.  How could a product purchased in the supermarket do a better job?  Got news for you Olay trumps them.  My skin was actually softer and looked less lizard like.  Loved the gentle yet thorough exfoliation with 2 speed brushes.  The cleanser is fragrance free.  Sometimes I overdid the amount I needed so just scooped it up and used it elsewhere.  Experiment with the amount your particular skin texture needs.  This led me down the Olay path of skin care and I haven&#x27;t looked back.&lt;br /&gt;I added the following to my arsenal[[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid Ounces]],[[ASIN:B0012J135O Olay Complete Night Fortifying Moisture Cream 2 Oz]], [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]] and [[ASIN:B002UUT38I Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser 6 Fl Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  6 weeks later my sample cleanser ran out and I ordered the full sized bottle.  LOVE this scrubber and cleanser!</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my wife as a stocking stuffer.  she wanted one for the longest and she simply loves these brand/model.  the price and delivery time was excellent</li>
            <li> Just tried my Olay Pro - X for the first time last night and wow! I was very impressed. You could see and feel a difference as soon as you&#x27;re done washing your face. I dont think i will ever go back to just normal face wash anymore this product worked wonders! I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> For the price it is worth it.  easy to use nice to have in shower I will tell my family and friends to try this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month now and really like the soft brush to exfoliate gently.  I use it about every 3 nights and has worked perfect for what I was looking for - and the price was good too!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product and I love it! I saw a difference in my skin in just 2 days!</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for awhile,  my Mom has the expensive one.  Comparing the two they are pretty darn close to the same.  I love my Olay Cleansing System and would buy again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> It is a great tool for skin but It quits working after about 1 year. The on/off button ceases to do its job. Yes, I changed the battery&#x27;s.I have had 2 of these in so many years and both did the same thing.</li>
            <li> This Olay cleaner works great and is priced more reasonably than that other common, expensive, major branded one. Leaves skin soft. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it really gets deep into my pores and make my skin glow. It&#x27;s something every woman needs.</li>
            <li> I have prescription meds for oily skin and needed a cleanser that wasn&#x27;t harsh.  This made my skin look so polished from day 1 and very gentle.</li>
            <li> Definitely love this cleansing  product. My face feels wonderful after using this to cleanse.  Easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> My grandmother love it , she said that its a powerful cleaner i put 4 stars because i still don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> This product has completely fixed my acne. My skin is soft and no longer breaks out. It&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even remember when I received this gift, still working great! (At least a year ago)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a month. I love it! My skin looks resurfaced, my makeup goes on smoother, and my (giant manhole) pores look smaller and cleaner. I don&#x27;t use the included exfoliating scrub, although I did once, and wasn&#x27;t impressed. I prefer to use my Philosophy purity cleanser. I&#x27;m really happy with this tool, and I would completely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoying using this product. I definitely feel like it does it&#x27;s job based on how my face feels after I&#x27;ve used it. I try to use it 2 or 3 times a week and I definitely feel like I have less blackheads or any irritations on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this product to friends and if you are reading this considering buying it, it&#x27;s cheap enough that if you are not satisfied, you&#x27;re not out hundreds of dollars. So it&#x27;s an absorbable cost if you don&#x27;t like it, but I find that unlikely.</li>
            <li> I now own both the Clarisonic Mia and the Olay and I must say that I no longer use the Clarisonic. This is 10x better and removes my makeup. I love it. I that I came across this after so much money spent on the Clarisonic. Must buy!!</li>
            <li> Great for the price. However, on some spots on my face it feels a bit too harsh (might be cause I have sensitive skin). Other than that, as long as you don&#x27;t put pressure on it or leave it on one spot for too long, it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Love this products.  My skin is softer since using it</li>
            <li> I first bought this item close to two years ago, and have bought three more of them since. Before you jump to any conclusions however, the reason for this was because I just somehow lost them all, and then couldn&#x27;t go without buying another one. This device is amazing at reducing blackheads, shrinking pores, and overall giving the user a smooth, bright complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When combined with a gentle cleansing wash and used 3-4 times per week, I saw reduction of past acne scars within the first couple uses, and my skin has looked amazing ever since.</li>
            <li> No problems with this order</li>
            <li> Face becomes Dry, if you have dry skin problem dont purchase this&lt;br /&gt;Also it does not have dead skin remover brush!!</li>
            <li> I am glad I took a chance and bought this system. I use it in conjunction with my Cetaphil daily cleanser and after a week on consistent use my skin looks brighter  and thoroughly clean. As for the Olay cleanser I have used it a few times within the area around my nose to shrink the pores . I will upgrade to the 3 speed system by next month .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this olay brush before buying one of the higher priced brands...it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great tool for a modest price! I must admit this is only tool of this nature I have owned but I don&#x27;t need to look elsewhere. For a modest price, this does the job perfectly ad will work with all kinds of facial cleansers. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes my skin feel great.  One of the most reasonably priced beauty items ever.</li>
            <li> I love using this cleansing system.  It definitely cleans so much better than just a wash clothe alone and it&#x27;s so much more affordable than some other systems.  I only use it a few times a week as I find the bristles a little rough for my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I&#x27;ve had this for a week now and I can see that the discoloration and darkspots on my face has faded/fading. I use this with the cleanser it comes with and my other one (clearasil) and both works fine with the device. I use this product twice a day and I think by doing so it becomes more effective than using it only once a day. I will definitely forever use this product ( also keep in mind that the brush needs to be replaced every three months for better results, just like a toothbrush :) ).</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far. I make an effort to use it every evening. I feel like my face is clearing up. So worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now, and have seen a dramatic improvement in the appearance of my skin. It makes blemishes heal and disappear quickly, and does prevent new ones from coming. I was hesitant to use the exfoliating cleaner every day, but the &#x27;abrasive&#x27; element is about the consistency of baking soda, so it&#x27;s extremely mild, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that the Clarisonic is the Holy Grail of all scubby brush systems, and I may consider purchasing it after using this, but this works extremely well for my face and decolletage. I use it with Neutrogena face wash every day and the exfoliating cleanser every few days. I&#x27;ve not yet had to change the brush out, but I bought the refills with the unit just because it seems they sell out quite quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought i was doing a good job washing my face, but this product makes your face really flawless and clean. will order in the future</li>
            <li> I am pretty casual when it comes to skin care. A foaming cleanser once daily &amp; a moisturizer are the norm. The first time I used this I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. My skin truly looked like it did 10 years ago! Incredibly smooth and so vibrant &amp; healthy looking. I am hooked!</li>
            <li> I have problematic/sensitive skin and this is a life saver! I use it twice daily for facial cleansing. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and it really has helped clear up my skin. In the morning, I dip it into squeezed lemon juice and just do a quick cleanse. At night, I use my own cleaner, Cetaphil and scrub the makeup off, after I use lemon juice again to get the excess makeup left over and it leaves me feeling clean and smooth! This product is a dream and it feels so good! It does leave your face a bit dry afterward, but if you use your moisturizer immediately after, it really sinks into your skin well and feels great. This is a great product and an awesome price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just an FYI, my Pro-x started slowing down and I thought it was broken because I dropped it on the ground a few times. I was scared that I broke it but I simply needed new batteries. So just a heads up if it happens to you!</li>
            <li> I bought this after spending some time looking at my boss&#x27;s skin; she gets microdermabrasion every 6 wks and I had been thinking about one day doing this until doing a search on Amazon and stumbling upon this. I bought this after reading some positive reviews and looking at the star rating despite so many reviews. I was skeptical still, but am totally a believer. I bought the generic Olay skin cleansing cream at Target and the Olay toner and have noticed an amazing difference in my skin within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 28 and have oily, acne-prone skin, especially around the time of my period. I get more breakouts along my jawline and near my ears and since using this daily to every other day, I have noticed my skin seems brighter, more evenly toned, amazingly smooth, and less oily. Even my scars have faded. I highly, highly recommend buying this. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use, it&#x27;s very gentle, yet abrasive enough to remove dead skin and unclog pores. You don&#x27;t have to use it daily, but can if you want to. I suggest getting a gentle cleanser and a toner for added benefit. I don&#x27;t wear lotion on my face because I&#x27;m afraid of breaking out, but don&#x27;t feel like I need it with how amazing my skin feels. Who would ever think $20 would do the trick?</li>
            <li> Definitely a steal considering the hefty price for the Clarisonic. My skin feels smoother and a lot cleaner after a couple of uses. I love how it can be used in the shower. The brush is soft and the 2 speeds are great. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase especially considering I saved over $100 for the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I thought that the brush portion would be a little more stiff- almost like a toothbrush- but it is incredibly soft. While I wish it was a little more abrasive, this allows for using it day and night. While I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in acne, it does help with clearing up the flaking. It comes with a small tube of Olay cleanser, but I have substituted that for my normal cleanser.</li>
            <li> Makes my pores smaller and my skin feel clean.  My husband doesn&#x27;t like it because his skin is too sensitive and it makes him break out.  Works great for me though!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to folks who have sensitive skin.  One note though, the soap that &amp;#34;goes&amp;#34; with this makes me break out.  I use another soap instead.</li>
            <li> makes my skin real smooth and i know its cleaning my skin really well :) will be using this product for awhile</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of a brush like this for some time. I wanted the Clairsonic, but I have super sensitive skin, compounded with new issues as I&#x27;m now over 40, and hated the idea of spending that kind of money and then not being able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SO glad I bought this brush! I tried the cleanser that came with it but that was too much for my skin. I use a Neutrogena product with it and I love the results! It takes all of my makeup off, it exfoliates my skin gently, and cleanses deeply enough that my skin has a lovely glow and no blemishes. My skin, which was getting rough patches as I get older, has smoothed out and my skin looks radiant and significantly younger than my 41 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may eventually purchase the Clairsonic, but not anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was a little worried. Bought it anyway. Changing the batteries was easy. Face has never been cleaner. Deep cleans like I&#x27;ve never had before. Very glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t too sure about this product since skin poducts has dried out my skin badly. but have been using this once daily, and already my face is smooth, glowing. I bought this along with the Olay Regnerist detoxifying scrub. I use both in the shower daily and it is such a refreshing feeling. I think using it longer I will notice less of the facial areas I am worried about. but after 4 days of using it I give it 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I was having awful acne on my chest , cheeks, forehead.... Etc. no cleanser seemed to work and honestly some of them made the problem worse!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for myself for my 35 birthday and it was the best decision ever! In less than a week I noticed a huge difference in my skin! Far less acne, my skin was smoother and clearer and felt truly clean and not irritated!&lt;br /&gt;I use this product once a day..... My next purchase will be the moisturizer in this product line because you definitely have to moisturize after using the cleanser and brush!</li>
            <li> I bought this becuase it was on sale, and had heard good things about these cleansing products. It works great! I have had mine for about 3 months now. I usually have breakouts and large pores, therefore it is difficult to find products that help my skin. I use this once a day (the other time I wash my face during the day I use a washcloth) and my skin is so much softer and smoother now. I am actually getting compliments on my skin! I quit using it for a week or so, to see if there would be a difference... there was. My skin started to break out again, and my pores started looking larger again. I will use this from now on! Also, the sample of the product they put in there is great too. I was going to buy the regular size in the store, but it&#x27;s a little expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this for a year now and I can not say enough great things about it. I actually bought another one when I accidentally left the original during a stay at a hotel.</li>
            <li> I had co-workers raving about the Clairsonics they had bought and started using. I was curious and tempted to purchase until I saw the price ($100+ for the basic). I am not one to throw down that much money when I know I can find a similar product for less so I started doing my research...The Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System had a lot of reviews and the majority of them were positive. The price on Amazon was realistic for someone on a very tight budget. I decided I would give it a try and I am pleased that I did. While it does&#x27;t have the USB rechargable cord that comes with the Clairsonic, I couldn&#x27;t imagine the Clairsonic being any more effective. This Olay product really deep cleans! I used the sample size exfoliating scrub and it was nice and non-drying although I already had the Regenerist 7 in one scrub. The true test was end of the day make-up removal. What a champ!!! My face was clean, my pores were tight and my skin was so soft! I could see the benefits after only 1 use. Weeks have passed and I am still very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone even considering throwing away so much money on the Clairsonic. Save your hard earned money and purchase this product. With the money you save you can put it towards replacement brushes to stay sanitary.</li>
            <li> I Love this cleansing system. Every woman should have one</li>
            <li> yeahhhh not really useful. used it a few times and stopped. save your money or splurge on a clarisonic, this is just like using your fingers but takes more time.</li>
            <li> Very weak but still works I guess. No power and extremely soft bristles make for a less the invigorating experience.</li>
            <li> This Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System is very compact and the brush is very soft. I used it for the first time this morning. I first cleansed my face with Pond&#x27;s Cold cream, rinse that off, and put a tiny bit more of the cream on my damp face. I used the battery operated brush on my face and it was very gentle, but it did polish my face and exfoliate it. I was using one from Avon Cosmetics, but I found it was too harsh for my face &amp; caused broken cappillaries. It is not a top of the line product like The Clarisonic Brush, but for the money it is built well and it does the job. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this every day and is convinced it has really improved her skin. She is really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Never write reviews, but this product is fantastic. My face is so happy! Note: I use my own exfoliating facial scrub (neutrogena, I think).</li>
            <li> Did not seem to make any difference in my skin honestly.</li>
            <li> First, let me say I have the hide of a rhino and there is no such thing as too much exfoliation for my skin. I have a Clarisonic and thought this would be a good travel alternative. Nope, it&#x27;s too wimpy. If you, however, have very sensitive, fragile skin it might be a good alternative for you. It&#x27;s also a fraction of the cost. Some people say the magic is in the cleansers you use, but for my money it is also in the device.</li>
            <li> When I used this, my skin broke out into hundreds of micro-zits - these tiny white heads the size of a blackhead, but red, irritated, raised, and with definite white heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried not pushing so hard, or using it so long, but in the end, my skin looks better when I use my old skincare regime. So I&#x27;m back to that.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin is cleaner and softer. Great price and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I love my Olay Pro-Advanced so much that I purchased one for my sister and mother!&lt;br /&gt;Works amazing by the second week I saw amazing results. I recommend</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have and have never used the brand that is three times as expensive but have a hard time believing the expensive brand does a better job!  I love this.  Has two speeds, the brush is soft while firm enough to exfoliate and massage face without pain ( I have sensitive skin).  Easy to clean and handle comfortable to hold and sealed well to keep water out so as not to damage batteries.  Not sure why you would spend $100 plus when this product works so well and is a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for me. I don&#x27;t see a need to but a more expensive one this is just fine. Easy to use and holds up well in the shower.</li>
            <li> Your best bet is to just get an exfoliating scrub and a good rag to wash your face!</li>
            <li> This does a pretty good job and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Nice however Not miracle cleaning</li>
            <li> Definitely helping improve my skin and keeping the dead dry skin away!</li>
            <li> Like this a lot.  Just wish it had different brushes to add, but hey, that&#x27;s why u buy the high priced Clarisonic!  Worth the $ and does a good job</li>
            <li> I use this every other day and LOVE it!! I have sensitive skin and never have a problem! Works GREAT!</li>
            <li> This helps a lot for my rosacea!</li>
            <li> Good product. Clean the face very well</li>
            <li> Not very powerful, even with fresh batteries.  I didn&#x27;t think it really made any more difference than washing with a washrag.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. It is so gentle and yet my skin feels so good after using it. It is like loving your face when you use it. I don&#x27;t know, it is just awesome. Have never used anything like this before, have never had a facial, either. I am thankful I purchased this little gadget!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend enjoyed it as a gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much I posted a review in my own magazine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;ll be! The Olay Pro-X was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Being40plus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, I purchased the product because I am always trying to find a quick and easy way to exfoliate. I have combination skin, which means in some places it&#x27;s oily and others is dry. Here lately more dry than oily. It seems like my skin is changing as each day passes. My goal is to maintain a healthy glow as long as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While researching a number of products I noticed many, many ways to exfoliate. The cost varied from pennies per application to thousand (+) dollar surgical procedures. I am sure there is more than one way to address any problem that you may have. My issue is time, and money; I am looking for the least expensive way to look like a million bucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, Olay Pro-X is the solution for me. I used the product and right away could feel a difference. The applicator is extremely easy to use, light weight, and only takes 2 AAA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Olay Pro-X along with a cleansing cream that I purchased along with the applicator, my skin felt fresh. I know, I know it sounds like I am selling something. Well, I am! Try Olay Pro-X, because it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a look at the many reviews posted by other users. So that you can easily see the size of the applicator included a picture of the applicator in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light Weight&lt;br /&gt; Easy to Use&lt;br /&gt; makes for a great travel item&lt;br /&gt; Try it for yourself; and let me know your thoughts. ~CB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being40Plus FB Page&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! Just after one day I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is better than ever! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product was great at first, but no even 2 months in and it completely stop working. Unfortunately, this product was after the return window for amazon to accept it back, at this point I am out $20+ dollars I spent on it. Save your money, buy something else.</li>
            <li> Mildly impressed, spin seems weak.  This is a great price though. The exfoliating scrub is expensive as well.</li>
            <li> When I use this product, I feel like I&#x27;m at the spa. Now I can actually have my own spa at home. The brush is very soft and very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The brush head is much smaller than the Clarisonic, but it Works nicely though. It also came with a soap sample and has two speeds.</li>
            <li> I chose this product over the more expensive Clarisonic because I wasn&#x27;t sure that that one was worth the almost $200 price.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the Olay product.  I have pretty sensitive skin, and I also wear a CPAP machine so I can&#x27;t use a lot of harsh products on my face.  The cleanser it comes with is amazing and the brush is very soft.  My skin feels wonderful.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this thing, it feels really nice and makes washing my face convenient. I haven&#x27;t noticed any big change in my skin though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a Clarasonic but a friend who has both told me I should save my money and buy this one.  I keep it in the shower and give my face a good scrub with it almost daily.  My skin feels smooth and firm after and I am enjoying the product.  I&#x27;d recommend it for the price - I think it&#x27;s a deal for what it does.</li>
            <li> Great buy and relatively economical in comparison to other products.  Use it every day and it does a nice job of cleansing my complexion.</li>
            <li> it is useful to clear your old skin. and smooth. i think combine to oily skin will be more suitable.</li>
            <li> I like it ...dont think its exceptional but for the price i think its good</li>
            <li> I was torn between purchasing this and a Clarisonic.  I have been blessed with pretty good skin, so when I recently discovered that I had un unused Amazon gift card and the Olay products were on sale, it was a given - I would be purchasing this.  I suppose my expectations weren&#x27;t really high, so I was very pleased when I tried this out.  I use it pretty much daily now.  I use my favorite Mary Kay foaming cleanser with it - and it seems to make it go so much farther!  It only takes a tiny drop.  Sometimes I use it dry just to buff away some dry skin on my nose - and it works beautifully!  Your face really does feel cleaner (I don&#x27;t know about &amp;#34;6 times&amp;#34; cleaner) and that makes me think that my other products just work better if they&#x27;re actually getting down more in my pores.  I have gotten compliments recently on my skin - so I suggest this to anyone.  It&#x27;s the only change I have made in my usual skin routine and it has been worth every penny! .</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X works great and leaves my skin soft and smooth. My breakouts have lessened and my skin is radiant.</li>
            <li> I find this is a tad rough on my skin if I use it too long, but for short periods of time it works well, leaving my face very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I actually use this everyday and it leaves my skin looking and feeling great. the bristles are nice and soft. It feels like a mini massage.</li>
            <li> Seems to work really well, better value compared to competition.  I would buy this again, replacement heads seem fairly priced as well.</li>
            <li> Super smooth, not too rough, I really like the way it scrubs my skin. Very quiet, I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use it with the acne free severe kit and it has made a huge difference with my skin, I am just so glad I decided to try this because nothing was working for my acne. Now I can&#x27;t say that I have completely clear skin, its not a miracle worker but it has helped clear my skin up at least 90% which is amazing. So if you&#x27;re looking for a good inexpensive alternative to the Clarisonic Mia give this a try.</li>
            <li> I feel the difference right away, my skin improved after I used it. Using it every day now, and will recommend.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the big deal with these facial cleaners?  My washcloth does the same thing for a lot less money.  Not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Works great, and does what I expected it too.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I was deciding to get a clairsonic or this and I figured for the price I might as well try this. I&#x27;ve never used a Clairsonic so I can&#x27;t tell you the difference between this product and that product. What I can say is this product works well, left my face super soft, less visible pores, and my face looks youthful &amp; clean. :)</li>
            <li> My skin has recently been peeling and dry.  I&#x27;m trying to find gentle ways to remove the peeling skin. This cleansing system is the first I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s fine, I suppose.  But it really didn&#x27;t do any better than a warm soft wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Feels GREAT on the face and definitely beats washing your face with your hands, I just wish the exfoliating clenser in the box a bigger quantity and not just a sample size</li>
            <li> This cleansing system works great and is easy to use. Helps very well with the cleansing of your face and keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of a more expensive model of this nature one reviewer suggested this product. I have been using it for a month now and I do feel it has been helping with my skin. I am 31 and still suffer from break-outs and the Olay Pro-X has helped greatly! I recommend it to anyone, especially if you have acne prone skin but the usual facial scrub soaps are too harsh for your skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few months ago. The first week I started to use it I notice strangers admiring my skin. I use it as a night regimen follow by an olay moisturizer. My skin is much smoother, softer and fine wrinkle lines have reduce.  This is a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> This little brush was a terrific investment. It leaves my skin feeling wonderful, and the price was excellent, too. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself for Christmas and I love it!! I use this everyday and I can tell a difference. It was packaged well and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It only came with one brush and it doesn&#x27;t seem like the brush  will last that long.  I am not sure if I can find replacement brushes and if I can&#x27;t the item will be useless.</li>
            <li> It does not work at all. I pre-wash my face first and try the product, and it still did not clean thoroughly. After two weeks of trying, i stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I did not know that the cleanser contained micro beads.  These usually cause breakouts on my skin. The brush however was as expected. The bristles are a bit in the rough side however.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to get a clairsonic, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the $$$, so i went to get a facial and the woman recommended this one. I LOVE IT!!! it is the perfect size to keep on my sink and will be great for travel. i&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, and my skin already feels softer, smoother and cleaner. i think this is a great alternative to a clairsonic for us budget-conscious ladies.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  It was easy to use right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Have a blackheads/large pores issue around my nose. Purchased it to correct this issue. Didn&#x27;t help. Even though, I still use it. If you want to soften up the appearance of skin around your eyes,forehead and the top of your cheeks it will take 7-10 years off, for what that&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100+ on the Clarisonic model, so I decided to give this a go. It works great, and I use it with my favorite Origins facial cleanser. I&#x27;ve popped the head off and run it through the dishwasher a couple times, and that&#x27;s been a great way to keep everything nice and clean. My skin loves the gentle but thorough exfoliation. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago and have been using it nearly everyday with a pump foaming natural face wash from a local store. (I think it&#x27;s a generic for an Aveeno soap.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great! Mostly, my skin is fairly oily and ergo breaks out pretty often. When it&#x27;s not breaking out, I have whiteheads that cluster in spots such as above my chin but below my lip, on the sides of my nose, etc. I can&#x27;t see them, but I can feel them and it drives me insane. If I use this cleanser, it keeps those issues in check and my face has a nicer glow to it. I&#x27;ve tried the whole \\&quot;cleaning with fingers\\&quot;, washcloth, facial scrubber, etc. I favor this method far above those because I can no longer feel those bumpy, tough whitehead areas like I could after using the washcloth (or whatever else).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the price on here is amazing! I checked local stores and it&#x27;s at least 10 dollars more elsewhere. Get yourself some Eneloop Rechargeable batteries and you&#x27;ll be ready to go!</li>
            <li> I love using this.  Afterwards, I feel so refreshed and my face is so soft.  I would definitely recommend it.  Use your own facial cleanser if you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> This is going to be great to help keep my face clean.  It works really well and very gently.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The price for this is unbelievable. I&#x27;ve shopped around at Macy&#x27;s and various other department stores for this type of facial cleaning product. While there are more high end models charging you high end prices, this one here gets the job done. I do not have one negative comment in regards to this device. It works very well on your face and it feels very clean and soft afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some individuals have expressed their dissatisfaction in regards to the battery bay. The instructions are printed right on the box so it&#x27;s not too hard to figure it out. It just takes a little pressure to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very lightweight product and as the product description says, there are 2 speeds. The brush head itself is replaceable and you can purchase replacements in Target, Costco, online, ect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is a small tube as you will no doubt need to purchase a full size after about a month or two of using this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ...well not outside of having a facial.  The scrub that comes with this runs out very fast.  I replaced it with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean, Deep Exfoliating Scrub, Natural Apricot Beads.  The combination of this Olay product with the L&#x27;Oreal scrub is perfect.</li>
            <li> The rotating brush just doens&#x27;t seem to deep clean.  After using it for several weeks, I do not notice any change.  The free facial cleaner that came with the brush, does not impress me either.  It feels a little on the slimy side.</li>
            <li> How do you use this product? I Don’t&lt;br /&gt;What similar products have you used, how does this compare? Do not use&lt;br /&gt;What should other customers know when considering this product? N/A&lt;br /&gt;What aspects of this product do you like or dislike? Have to ask my girl friend&lt;br /&gt;What was the quality of this product above or below your expectations? Not sure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the miracle brush that I thought it would be after reading all the reviews. It does exfoliate, but I still had black heads on the tip of my nose after using this for about a week straight now, morning and night. I use my Mary Kay Timewise cleanser with this and they work well together. It&#x27;s much better than the cleanser included. The Olay cleanser has a strange smell and does not get my skin that clean. It&#x27;s also drying for me (I have dry skin). I don&#x27;t hate this product but it&#x27;s just ok. I get better exfoliation from my St. Ives apricot scrub. I guess the benefit is that with the spinning brush, you would theoretically have cleaner skin than by simply washing your face with your hands. Probably true, but I probably won&#x27;t buy this again if it ever wears out.</li>
            <li> I think it works really well. It is soft, but yet, cleans away the dirt and oils not wanted on your skin. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush!  I use it every day and then every Sunday I exfoliate my skin with my 3 minute peel from Real Chemistry.  I got mine at [...] and just love how deep it peels my face and neck without irritating my skin.  It&#x27;s acid free so I don&#x27;t have a clue how it works but it&#x27;s totally awesome - your skin just comes off in your hands and your face is unbelievable soft after.  It&#x27;s a new page in my skin Bible!</li>
            <li> It small and usefull. I bought for my wife. She loved it. It is gentle and no harm your face.</li>
            <li> I am 65 and had a few lumps and bumps on my face but since using this cleansing system my face is smooth and soft.It really cleans your face better than just using a facial scrub.&lt;br /&gt;I say give it a try and see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;use rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> She is very happy with it. She has been wanting one for awhile. Now she can have a sparkling clean face.</li>
            <li> My skin was drying out due to too much glycolic acid use, so I had to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was quite a godsend: I could remove makeup / dirt / grime easily without putting my skin through too much trauma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a good investment (I have not tried the Mia so I don&#x27;t know how it compares). I have not suffered breakouts to-date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: I have the odd zit which only glycolic acid seemed to prevent (until I got this product).</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good for the price. It doesn&#x27;t spin as quickly as I had expected. I use it with Desert Essence Thorougjly Clean face wash.</li>
            <li> I have always seemed to be very cystic acne prone with extremely oily skin. I decided to buy this to try to see if I could clear my face up a little. With all of the great reviews and the great price I figured it was worth a try. However, I DO NOT use the exfoliating cleanser as I have extremely sensitive skin. I used my every day acne cleanser, Boscia clear complexion cleanser, which i would recommend to anyone with sensitive acne prone skin. ive had this cleansing system for about 2-3 months now and absolutely love it. The first time i used it i thought the bristles were a little too soft to do anything at all, but after a few uses it seemed to stiffen up a little bit and i could really tell my face was 100x cleaner and softer. I have used just about EVERY product on the market including a combination of 2-3 antibiotics a day and a prescription strength topical gel which did work, but bleached EVERYTHING and was really expensive. This is the only thing that has actually helped me achieve that beautiful flawless skin I&#x27;ve dreamed of all my life. I would recommend this to anyone as long as you can take the 10-15 minutes to actually use it. I absolutely swear by this thing now. Between the brush, replacements, and my cleanser, toner, and benzoyl peroxide over the counter medicine, I&#x27;m STILL not paying as much as I did for just one month of the prescriptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: December 2nd,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this will sound cheesy, but this little thing has absolutely changed my life. Now that I&#x27;ve had this for awhile, I&#x27;ve learned the exact formula for my skin. At first I was using it every night along with a 10% benzoyl peroxide cream, spot treatment, and then moisturizer. For the first time in my life my skin was extremely dry and flaking everywhere. I ended up having to use an extreme aveeno moisturizer just to get my face back to normal. I am now using it every other night, and still use a lower dose of benzoyl peroxide but only on the nights I don&#x27;t use the brush, just so I know I won&#x27;t have any acne pop ups. I really wish I had taken before pictures. I had one side of my face that was really scarred and had dark marks everywhere from acne. It&#x27;s almost completely gone with no use of scar reduction formula, just the brush. My skin is clear, and my pores are so much unnoticeable. Also, I&#x27;ve found that if you have a place that&#x27;s more acne/blackhead prone, if you hold it still in that spot, it really gets down in the pores and cleans all of that out. This brush is 100% worth the results and then some. I&#x27;m finally not embarrassed to go out of the house with makeup caked on so people don&#x27;t notice the imperfections as much. I have no imperfections anymore. And it&#x27;s all thanks to this.sh, just so I know I won&#x27;t have any acne pop ups. I really wish I had taken before pictures.

            <li> I have tried the more expensive clairsonic product, but opted to buy the olay system, as I really like all the olay Pro X Clear products.  I found the Olay cleaning system to be a lot more harsh on the skin than the clairsonic.  The olay system is no where near as soft on your skin and as I have very sensative skin it made it really red and irritable.  I would suggest that if you suffer from sensative skin pay the extra and opt for the Clairsonic version.</li>
            <li> Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Can say this small vacuum machine for my face !! clean &amp; clean &amp; clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It makes me feel my skin very clear and my face so smooth!&lt;br /&gt;It works like clarisonic but it does cost very less!</li>
            <li> I have had it for a about 3 weeks now it is works just fine for me and has cut my morning routine down by a minute my skin is definitely smoother my pores seem smaller. the gentle facial massage is great in the morning. For those worried about the brush giving out amazon do sell replacement brushes but it not that big of an issue. Overall a very worth wild product if you do not like creams you leave on then wash or feel that hand scrubbing is inefficient (did the comparison could literally see dirt and grim on the) brush)</li>
            <li> I sit in the tub a couple days a week and massage it over my face. It makes it super smooth. Takes three years off your age the 1st time you use it, Not rough, but soft and still works to remove dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleansing system.  It is like your face is getting a daily massage. It cleans so well and your face feels wonderful once you are done.</li>
            <li> i love how it feels ahhh it helps make my skin so soft ah i love it and so does my sister</li>
            <li> I had been wanting this for a long time since I can&#x27;t afford the Clarisonic.  The price here was great.  This little machine has made such a difference in my skin.  My moisturizers go on so much better and I get a lot of benefit from them.  The brush is very soft but still does the job.  The exfoliator that comes with it is pretty good.  I watched a review that said that it was not easy to wash off but I didn&#x27;t have any problem at all.  I use the exfoliator every other day and my regular face wash between.  Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I heard alot about this brush but it didn&#x27;t do a amazing job like people on the reviews said.  it was ok it did make my face a bit better but it wasn&#x27;t a dramatic change.  St. Ives face scrub product does a way better job then the brush and at bus I bought a 3 pack for less then this brush.  I&#x27;m not sure if this was money well spent when it  comes to the brush.</li>
            <li> I love this cleaning system. My face has never felt cleaner. I used many different cleansers in the past and I will never go back or stop using this one. I use it along with Olay cleanser. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see spending well over $100 for this sort of thing.  Therefore, having NOT tried Clarisonic or other brands, can&#x27;t compare to them.  But, it works, does the job (as far as I can tell), &amp; is super-affordable.</li>
            <li> I already threw the packaging away because I was sure that I would love it and definitely not return it...what a mistake.  This thing is so slow turning, even on high, that I just do not get the hype!....I mean, even saying how it is better than that other $300 product....A waste of my limited funds, even with the $3 coupon online....I do NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> love this thing! Esp for the price, using it daily really helps to tighten and decrease the size of pores as well as making my complexion smoother and healthier</li>
            <li> I have one of these and love it.  I bought this for my granddaughter to take to college, since she uses her mom&#x27;s at home. So, it&#x27;s wonderful for all ages. Makes your face feel soooo good!</li>
            <li> I hate a dirty face and have tried all sorts of scrubs and facials.  I stopped using them because the skin on my face would peel off leaving ugly red blotches even after using a great moisturizer from the dermatologist.  This gentle cleansing brush gets my face clean without damaging my delicate skin.  I think it would work on any type of skin if a person appreciates a gentle squeaking face and / or neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Love this...I thought the bottle of soap that came with it would be a little bigger, but I used my own soap anyways. This thing is amazing...It really cleans deep uses little battery power and you can reuse the head for a decent time. A+</li>
            <li> I nice and affordable option to the more expensive alternatives.  Great product would recommend to others for sure!&lt;br /&gt;Good Stuff</li>
            <li> This cleaner is good but not as powerful as others. It uses batteries instead of being rechargeable so choose whichever you prefer.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to getting expensive facials and getting other expensive cleaning systems. The cleanser that was included with it is okay, in my opinion. You can really use this with any cleanser. I have used it with other cleansers from different brands like Neutrogena and it works well. My skin still feels very clean. The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was the battery compartment. It was hard to install batteries in the beginning. But other than that, this is a product that each person should buy if they want clean skin.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to anyone looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li> I am a teenager who&#x27;s constantly on Youtube looking at makeup videos.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE makeup... the more, the better... lol.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m also a very, very, lazy person.&lt;br /&gt;I hate to admit it but more often than not, I will fall asleep in my caked up face.&lt;br /&gt;My skin started to break out like crazy, and I knew I had to do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting this cleansing system, it made me actually look forward to washing my face every night. My skin cleared up within THREE DAYS!!! It&#x27;s been a whole week that I&#x27;ve gone without wearing foundation, and I owe it all to this baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never looked more fresh, and I feel confident taking selfies even though my face is not splattered on with foundation and other harmful ingredients!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU, OLAY!</li>
            <li> Olay pro-x is a great product. and it is a great price compared to the stores. the cleanser is very good too.</li>
            <li> after considering buying the Clarisonic cleaning brush i read it&#x27;s not really worth the cost. That lead me to this. it got great reviews and i see why. for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase. only real criticism is that it requires batteries instead of being rechargeable.</li>
            <li> It is very better for women, even though men. I can use it everyday. It can help me clean my face.</li>
            <li> The batteries are inside the handle, which lacks a &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s hard to pull off without using your teeth (ouch!), but I love the feel of my skin after use. The cleanser is included but very small tube so I would by something to supplement.</li>
            <li> I used this one as a gift.  I have one and I think it is great,  I will purchase another one when mine is done.</li>
            <li> I love the soothing massaging action of this on my face and my skin is incredibly clean after using this. The price is great. I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Do you have sensitive dry skin? Don&#x27;t get it. Left my skin red and even more dry. Then it broke me out.</li>
            <li> Just received this item and it works great!  It comes with a sample size exfoliator as well.  There are no instructions in the package, however.  To insert the batteries pull off the bottom of the device, it&#x27;s a little tricky to pull off.  I put about 5 small dabs of the exfoliator around my wet face and used the device for about 2 minutes.  My skin feels soft and super clean.  (I used the device on my face which had no make up on.)</li>
            <li> Gentle. Reliable. Teen uses it in shower and says she likes it. Be careful not to overdo. Otherwise just as presented.</li>
            <li> Broke within three months... I have to hold down the power button in order for it to work. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to save the $$$ a Clarisonic would have cost me. It is okay. The head doesn&#x27;t spin exactly centered so as you move the brush around your face, you have to do it in a certain direction. It always feels awkward. The two speeds are a joke. If you use the lower speed, you might as well just have the brush turned off. All in all, it was cheap enough that I don&#x27;t mind having bought it. I can&#x27;t say that I have seen any difference in my skin but it certainly can&#x27;t hurt to use it.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have allot of power, battery operated runs a bit slow. I guess for only $20 its okay, but think next time I would spend a bit more to get a better quality.</li>
            <li> I have been looking at the clarisonic mia but did not really want to spend that amount of money right now so decided to try this. So far I do not have any complaints. It is really good if you just want an extra deep cleaning and my face feels so clean and fresh after. I use it with the philosophy purity face wash and I am happy with the results. I will keep using this and don&#x27;t see much reason to spend so much money on the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> these things work...so much better than just the average face cloth. I bought two for my daughters because I like mine so much. And the price is ridiculous when you compare it to the Clarion, which is close to 10x the price. As far as I can tell, this one works just as well.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I anticpated</li>
            <li> Decent product, not as great as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use on mature skin. It actually thins you skin which is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Amazon after seeing some youtube videos on the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massager as such is not so refreshing as I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles in the brush got out of shape in just 2 massages. They kind of got bent and useless.&lt;br /&gt;$20 is a high price for the efficiency of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  I use it with the Olay exfoliating cleanser and I am very happy with the results.  I liked it so much I bought one for my mother and my daughter. Great price, too!</li>
            <li> exfoliates and REALLY cleanses. Love it</li>
            <li> I really love the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System. I&#x27;ve found I use mostly the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; speed. I love that I can use whatever cleanser I like with it as well. It makes my face feel really smooth and clean after I use it in the evening - I alternate a gentle cleanser with an exfoliating cleanser every other day, and my skin has never felt this nice. The brushes are easy to change, and I&#x27;ve replaced it once so far. I just rinse it out every night and allow it to air dry. I have been more than satisfied with my purchase, and like most Olay products, this one hasn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li> I had the Clarisonic Mia but was unable to use it and did not want to continue buying brushes. The Clarisonic Mia for some reason was very abrasive to my skin (and no I did not use an exfoliator with the brush, I used a gel). My skin is oily, yet sensitive in areas. The Clarisonic was so harsh that it seemed to irritate my skin more. On the other hand, my grandmother loves it but she has normal skin that is not prone to breakouts. Anyway, I was looking for a brush that would clean without irritating and decided to try the Olay Prox and I am glad I did! My products do better with my skin because of the clean that I am able to get with this device. I use it at night each day and although some people use an exfoliator with beads, I use the gel. When I use a scrub, I use my hands. This device is better than the Clarisonic for several reasons (1) it&#x27;s smaller (2) it&#x27;s cheaper (3) it uses AA batteries. The biggie for me is that it feels like the brushes that have been used on my face at spas. It cleans without having so much power that it hurts your skin. Too much scrubbing can hurt and that is not good for oily or sensitive skin! If you are looking for a cleaning brush that is effective, yet inexpensive, Olay Prox is definitely it!</li>
            <li> Works great! I am very happy. You don&#x27;t need to buy an expensive face cleaning bush.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these. I usually have to buy her a new one every couple of years, but she cleans her face with this twice a day, and loves them.</li>
            <li> Purchase two of these cleaning systems for my daughters and they love them. I had a very expensive system and I have to say this Olay cleansing system works just as well. Love the cleaning cream that comes with it.  I have notice both of my daughters skin had clear up. I would recommend only using every other day or three times a week if you have sensitive skin.  Also tell young girls not to press to hard against the face.</li>
            <li> product works well and is very reasonably priced, I was also able to use a coupon with it. Came with a spare brush head and small soap</li>
            <li> When I went into Ulta, I tried some facial products and the woman SWORE by the Clairsonic. When she told me it was over $150, I was like... NO WAY! I remembered seeing this product on the shelves and decided to give it a go. After two uses (Morning and night) I woke up the next day with a significant reduction in blackheads. I was so happy! For this price, this product really does the trick! Would DEFINITELY recommend to a friend! Or anyone!</li>
            <li> Loved this! It helped my face clear right up. I never realized that this would help my face so much! I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product!</li>
            <li> I am using the Olay face wash I already use with this system - haven&#x27;t even touched the stuff it came with.  I just really wanted to brush.  Works well, is well made, and has removed a ton of blackheads on my nose.  I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> It is not bad. It is okay cleaning brush.. but you might find that it can be to harsh with your skin. Depends on you skin really</li>
            <li> Functional and effective in removing dead skin cells. Good job Olay!</li>
            <li> I got this as a budget alternative to the Clarisonic and I&#x27;m sooo glad that I did!  My skin has never been THIS SOFT and THIS SMOOTH!  I&#x27;m so amazed. Only thing is, it spins in circles while the Clarisonic shifts in multiple directions...Apparently the circular spinning can create wrinkles?  Not that I&#x27;ve seen any, but something to keep in mind.  So when I use the Pro X, I move it up, down, left, right all the while...rather than holding it in place.  That way, it creates more shifting action like the Clarisonic.  Furthermore, the Pro X REALLY cleans my face...like deep clean!  I use it only at night in the shower and it gets off all my make up and grime.  My face feels so clean and refreshed afterwards.  My moisturizer is more effective too.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and it has been greatly beneficial to my complexion.  I have no regrets buying this.  When i come upon a small fortune or when the price goes down, I&#x27;d like to invest in a Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  System broke on me after 3 months.  Tried replacing batteries to no avail...bummer.  This thing is going in the trash.  I told myself that if this thing were to break and I found it effective, I&#x27;d get a Clarisonic.  So I did just that.  I ordered one from QVC (w/ installed payments) and LOVE IT.  I have no regrets, only that I did not get it sooner.  I still use the Olay exfoliating cleanser though, it works well!</li>
            <li> Still works very well. May 2015</li>
            <li> Ok, it&#x27;s been working GREAT on my skin. It makes my skin looks so clear and smoother than any other products, so I loved it until it&#x27;s broken. Come on, it was working great even yesterday, and not working today? It&#x27;s not about the batteries. I tried many different kinds of batteries and still not working. This one&#x27;s awesome just for 2 months.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find anything specially different with the cleansing brush because of its brand which is why I took 1 star off. It does what its supposed to do which is clean out the pores and reduces acne, facial oil etc. You just gotta find a facial wash that works for you but I recommend anyone who is having facial skin issue getting a cleansing brush. It just does a better job in keeping your face clean. From my own experience, it has reduced acne and pimple and I am using this with the regenerist cream cleanser. My face looks cleaner and feels smoother.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with one brush head and a small sample tube of  proX cleanser. I wish the product came with a replacement brush head as well. But I was able to find Olay&#x27;s replacement brush heads for this product 2 for $6 on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I only bought the product because there was a special deal at the time and it was a bit cheaper. I do think this product is a bit on the expensive side because of its brand name. There are similar cleaning brush system for cheaper price like the AcneFree product for those that are looking for cheaper options.</li>
            <li> Love it! I feel my skin very smooth, soft, bright and clean after few week of using it. Black head and white head lesser, can see my skin is improving. It is worth to buy.</li>
            <li> i give this product a 5.&lt;br /&gt;My pores have gotten smaller and my face has gotten clearer over  short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It is not a good buy or a bad one.  I guess I didn&#x27;t really have a set expectation but wanted to try this particular product before investing in something more expensive!</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling soft and beautiful follow up with face moisturizer right afterward!!!</li>
            <li> I am using a facial brush for the first time in my 60&#x27;s and I wish I had been introduced to these thirty years ago.  I feel&lt;br /&gt;like my complexion looks smoother and healthier.  Definite recommend.  I like that it&#x27;s light weight and can travel easily, too.</li>
            <li> Definitely gets a deeper clean than just washing with hands &amp; soap. I do have sensitive skin, so the Olay scrub it comes with was too harsh. I use the generic wal mart brand of Cetaphil cream cleanser with this and it works great :)</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a pretty good facial brush.  It is not very powerful, but it does the job.  I don&#x27;t think I want a ton of power while scrubbing my face anyway!</li>
            <li> Love it. Very good brush.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing system, soft brush and makes your face feel so clean and soft</li>
            <li> I use a different face cleaner and still wash my face with a towel after using the brush.  I have noticed that my skin is much smoother now.  I&#x27;ve also been taking a hair, skin and nail vitamin so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the brush or the vitamins.</li>
            <li> Omg omg this change my life!! Just let me tell you ruuuun and buy it!!!</li>
            <li> I like this cleaning brush the reason why I gave it four stars is because this product doesn&#x27;t make other brush heads like the Revlon cleansing system does. It just have one brush you can use with it but overall cleansing brush it does deep clean pretty good....</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is gentle on the face as well as cleanses.</li>
            <li> Checked the reviews for this item before purchasing and must say it&#x27;s better quality for the cost of others.</li>
            <li> Be Careful your hair doesn&#x27;t get caught.</li>
            <li> great product  I wash my face 2 x a day with ambi and it looks great also I use all over</li>
            <li> Seems to deep clean better than a washcloth or a standard complexion brush.  It&#x27;s been in use for about a month and seems sturdy and useful.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  Use it every day!</li>
            <li> It works very well and I am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser test I could see the change on my face skin day by day, now I say bye shiny skin :)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this product. I, sadly, have clogged pores and work hard to fight them. I can honestly tell a difference after using the lovely scrub brush. Although my pores aren&#x27;t perfect afterwards, they are so much better and I can tell that the bristles have penetrated the grossness. However, instead of using the lotiony stuff that comes with the system, I typically use it with face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some negative reviews about the speed of the brush; however, I haven&#x27;t had a problem with either speed and use them both. I would definitely recommend this brush to friends.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my face. Great exfoliator!</li>
            <li> This item stopped working after one week I tried changing the batteries but that didn&#x27;t help....I have asked for an exchange and will give it a second try</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, very gentle on my skin. I am loving it, I also enjoyed that it came with 2 Duracell batteries which is awesome because everyone knows Duracell is a good brand of batteries. I am hoping they will last a while before my next replacement. I am aware that a lot of people compare this to the MIA2, I&#x27;ve never used or owned a Mia2 so I cannot compare but this product on it&#x27;s own is amazing, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging dock, and the brush heads are more affordable, smaller than the mia2. A lot of people might not like the whole battery thing, and I was a bit iffy about it too, but it&#x27;s really not too bad if it means no docking, that&#x27;s just extra clutter I don&#x27;t want or need. I love the portability of this, would be nice to have a brush head though, I did not get one of those.</li>
            <li> Love this face brush. Once you&#x27;ve used it, you will never wash your face with your hands again! The cleanest feeling ever.</li>
            <li> I have been using just a hand-held facial brush for a while and thought I would try a power one without taking the plunge for a Clarisonic...well honestly I think I prefer my hand-held facial brush to this because this brush is just too soft and doesn&#x27;t seem to really make a difference in my exfoliating routine. I need a bit more power for this tool, and the sample it came with I just threw out because it smelled very chemically. I honestly would reach for the Clarisonic instead of purchasing this.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought, I never felt like it did it hard enough or took enough off. The brush feel off within the second month too</li>
            <li> I purchased the Olay cleansing system and was using it at night with a very sparing amount of cleanser. The problem with the brush is that it tends to fling the cleanser sometimes. Last night, it flung a small amount of the PRO X exfoliating cleanser into my eye. The brush was on my cheeck area at the time. I am always very careful to stay away from my eye area and use just a small amount of cleanser to avoid a problem like this.&lt;br /&gt;I tried flushing my eye to no avail and woke up in great pain. I had assumed that the exfoliating product would be dis solvable and would thus be gone by morning. My eye teared extremely, I tried flushing and nothing worked. I ended up having to go to the eye doctor and have the abrasive substance removed from my eye. There was \\&quot;slight scarring\\&quot; on my eye and I now have to use antibiotic eye drops to avoid infection. When I explained to my eye doctor what happened, he emphatically told me never to use such a product again and throw it away!&lt;br /&gt;So a half day is wasted in a lot of pain, I&#x27;m out $180.00 for doctor and prescription and vow to never use this thing again.</li>
            <li> This product was great while it lasted, but BE WARNED: Do not use in shower. It is NOT WATERPROOF. Somehow I missed that along the way and used it in the shower. It is now broken (even after replacing the batteries). As long as you don&#x27;t use it in the shower, great product.</li>
            <li> My face looks lovely, it feels great, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend $150. Love it.</li>
            <li> Affordable and effective!</li>
            <li> Very, very good little brush. Cleans deeply without being too aggressive. Water doesn&#x27;t slow it down, I get it totally wet and it keeps on going.  Easy to clean.  I&#x27;ve used it about a month, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is clearer and more refined.  I think this is because cream goes deeper into the skin after the brush cleaning.  I have a sonic brush as well, which I still use. This brush seems to clean deeper because the bristles are more separated. Like the affordable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating my review for this item since I&#x27;ve had it for at least a year now.  At first, I couldn&#x27;t notice a difference, but now, when I don&#x27;t use it, I can tell.  My face feels different.  When I use it, my face feels more smooth and it does help with exfoliation.  The trick is consistent use.</li>
            <li> Was delivered on time without damage.</li>
            <li> For the cost, this seems to be a decent cleansing system.  I wanted to see how my skin would feel using this type of exfoliator before I spent a lot of money on one.  I use it 2-3 days a week and it leaves my face very clean and smooth.  Also works well with cleansers other than the Olay that comes with it.</li>
            <li> use it about once a week, really cleans out your pours. Great product</li>
            <li> Feels like it&#x27;s getting my face cleaned pretty well</li>
            <li> Thought it would be more professional.</li>
            <li> Perfectly as described!</li>
            <li> Comparable to the Clairsonic. Reasonable price. It is a bit rough on skin though. I only use it when I have to wash off a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> Good while it last. It&#x27;s not rotating after few months</li>
            <li> I own the more expensive Clarisonic facial brush and swear by it. Instead of buying another Clarisonic for my Gym bag, I tried this one. It works okay to cleanse the face, but in my opinion, does not work nearly as effectively as the Clarisonic. The deal breaker for me was when I dropped the Pro-X in the shower and the casing, brush &amp; batteries when flying everywhere. Wet batteries are not a good thing. I should not have been using the Pro-X in the shower in the first place, but thats where I prefer to use it. I&#x27;ve dopped my Clarisonic in the shower several times and it has not come apart and has kept working for 3 years. I also prefer the convenience of charging the Clarisonic every couple of weeks vs. purchasing and changing batteries. Over time. I think cost of batteries will be the same as the Clarisonic. For me, this was one of those \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; lessons.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected date, every thing intact &amp; working. I use this 2x a day with the type of wash it came with, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Got this item today and used it for the first time. It was a little hard to pull the bottom off to place the batteries inside but other than that it made my face feel smooth and refreshing. I like how small it is and it&#x27;s a prefect fit for your hands. So glad I ordered it and plan to use it daily.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son, he loves it.</li>
            <li> Good price.As described.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in my skin after the first use and it continues to get better after evey use.</li>
            <li> Great portable skin care product.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth and soft after using this. I don&#x27;t recommend using it more than once or twice a week, but love it!</li>
            <li> I think this product does a pretty great job.  I used to be one of those people who didn&#x27;t even think past using my hands to do the job--this completely changed my mind.  I am shocked how much of a difference this, coupled with the exfoliating cleanser (comes with this kit) makes!  My skin is sooo much smoother and brighter after using this!  A lot of people say that if you&#x27;re not going to go Clarisonic, don&#x27;t go at all, but I respectfully disagree--this product definitely improves the skin condition compared to my bare hands, and based on that alone I can say that it&#x27;s been worth buying &amp; using!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this brush! Can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find something so awesome for my face. Its a must buy. The exfoliator that comes with it is great too, I purchased a bigger bottle when I ran out</li>
            <li> Like this a lot!!! Gentle scrubbing of the skin!!</li>
            <li> I like the brush and feel like my skin is cleaner and clearer. I haven&#x27;t used the mia so haven&#x27;t got that to compare with but for me its better than hands. I use it every morning and night. Its great for the price too.</li>
            <li> I love the brush and the replacement brushes are very affordable but the sample cleanser it comes with is so expensive. I think the cleanser really works and works well with brush but I wish it didnt cost so much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for several months . it is soft and clean my face gentle. It is portable to hold it. I can remove brush head conveniently to wash it . so far, it works awesome in good price .</li>
            <li> I did like this product but it broke on me within 2 weeks!! i am so hurt! I spent 30 bucks on this and it only lasted 2 weeks! total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I know these brushes are all the rage right now, maybe  I don&#x27;t have the right skin for this(?) or whatever ( sensitive , combination ) But I have been using it once every week for about two months  and  I just don&#x27;t see any positive difference, I mean it&#x27;s passed its 30 day return window... So  I&#x27;ll keep at it  but in general  my pores  look the same , and I feel like  I get more  dead skin with my finger tips than this brush ,  So  at this moment I&#x27;m disappointed ,  but I&#x27;ll give it  a full ninety days  before I give it a lower rating .</li>
            <li> its a good product, needs a stronger motor. It&#x27;s a great price for what&#x27;s on the market!</li>
            <li> It has been four months now since I purchased the Olay Pro-X. I absolutely love this product. I am 22 years old and don&#x27;t have very problem skin, however I feel it is difficult to do a good job taking my makeup off at night. I have tried wipes, wash cloths, my hands, you came it. Nothing compares to the cleaning power of the Olay Pro-X.  It came in a set, with a small trial size bottle of the cleaner as well which was nice, because the full bottle is a bit pricey so I wanted to try it first. The brush has two speeds which is nice because at first you will want to use the low speed until your skin gets used to the brush then in time you can go to the other speed if you wish. Even on the first day I could feel the deep clean happening. I ONLY use the brush twice a week to prevent any harsh side effects on my skin, but I love it. I look forward to the nights when I use my Olay Pro-X. I would for sure recommend this product to anyone who is interested. Well worth the money and you can usually find one on sale- either on Amazon or at Target.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more gentle than I expected, which is actually a good thing.  I use the machine every night but don&#x27;t use the cleaner each time.  I alternate with Cetaphil, which is very gentle, and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.  When I first got it I used the cleaner each time and that was too drying. You won&#x27;t see an immediate difference, but over time I can see that my skin is smoother, and it always feels much cleaner.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product and was not disappointed at all! Within one use I could see a difference in the size of my pores. I recommend this to anyone with lots of blackheads.</li>
            <li> While this product does work fairly well and do what it claims, It isn&#x27;t a very natural cleanser, which is much more important than you might think. I recently read [[ASIN:1456613588 Age-Proof: Beauty Alternatives You Need to Know]], which gave me extensive knowledge and insight as to why its so so important for your skin and body to be treated with gentle, all natural products. I would definitely recommend the book for anyone who wants a little more info on easy, inventive natural beauty alternatives that will work wonders!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looking and feeling a lot better after using this machine. I dont really use the cleanser it came with as I prefer the soap I use, but it works great. Much better than washing with my hands. My skin almost feels slippery smooth after using this. And after a week and a half, my skin looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use, and expect the results to even get better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a Clarisonic so I can&#x27;t compare in terms of quality, but I purchased the Olay Pro-X solely because of the price. I wanted a Clarisonic, but couldn&#x27;t justify the $125+ price tag. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the look of my skin when using the Pro-X, but it definitely gave me that deep clean feeling when I used it. I don&#x27;t like to over-exfoliate so I don&#x27;t use it daily, but I use it a few times a week or on days where I feel like my skin needs a heavier cleaning. I&#x27;d be curious to try the Clarisonic to see if it makes a visible difference, but again, I can&#x27;t really justify the price tag so for me the Olay Pro-X does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of months and its held up great. I love that it comes with batteries and a travel size cleanser.  I&#x27;ve noticed my face feels softer after and better balanced after using it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive but high quality facial brush.</li>
            <li> excellent product with instant result. i have read the reviews before buying. this product is exactly as what it describes. delivery is excellent too.</li>
            <li> I  really like that this has 2 speeds. I use an exfoliating scrub on the lower speed, and when I use the higher speed, I use a cream cleanser. It cleans gently, but thoroughly. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Better than cleaning with your hands. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Felt like i had a facial in a spa.&lt;br /&gt;You wont see results in a day but maybe in a week twice a day and will feel the change&lt;br /&gt;The box and the brush lasted a full month and now i am ordering the limited addition virsion of it&lt;br /&gt;It is a great home device so light and wont take a space in ur bathroom</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product. After use, it appears to make my skin super clean and soft.  I have used other cleansers with it, but works just as well.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price, works as good as some of the much pricier models.  I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> It works so good and my skin looks so much cleaner!</li>
            <li> Bought as gifts for my daughters and they both love them</li>
            <li> This does not have a lot of power and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s really doing anything beneficial to my face. A washcloth probably does a better job.</li>
            <li> I using it everyday, loving it and my skin now look better then ever</li>
            <li> It is just what I expected better price that the one in store</li>
            <li> Works great and is very comparable to more expensive versions! I prefer using my own brand of soap though, not the one okay recommends.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use with philosophy purity.</li>
            <li> This brush is great! Just as good as the Clarisonic and way cheaper. It definitely gives a deep clean and exfoliation. I would recommend this Olay product to anyone to use with their daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> The price compared to in-store prices is so much better. It came with everything, even a cleanser. I just wish it came with an extra brush head.</li>
            <li> My skin looks remarkably clean after a couple of uses and there has been a reduction in fine lines. A must have product!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Convenient and gets the job done for a FRACTION of the cost of the other higher end brands!!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Very pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> Love is not even the word to describe what I feel for this product. I use it everyday. I have noticed a substantial amount of changes to my face. Some of my problems cleared up: pimples, hyperpigmentation, whitehead..etc. this is a great buy. I use it in the shower and just in front of the sink. I also love using this after taking my makeup off. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> i love this brush cleanser. really affordable! im very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any of the more expensive brushes but honestly I find no need to.  This one works great at a fraction of the price.  It cleans my face better then just using my hands and a cleanser.  The two speed setting is nice and the brush is soft yet effective.  Why would you pay more for another brush that does the same thing.</li>
            <li> For an Olay product I was shocked....this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This seems like it is built well, but it isn&#x27;t strong enough for my face to feel like it&#x27;s getting cleaned or exfoliated. I wanted to speed up my exfoliation ritual. It&#x27;s strength wasn&#x27;t even comparable to washing with my hands and some Eminence strawberry rhubarb dermafoliant. I&#x27;m going to go with Clairsonic. If you&#x27;re looking for gentle cleansing, this is for you. I really love Olay products, so I was disappointed, especially because the price is so good. :(</li>
            <li> this is a great product for the price. works just as described just use a nice face rub with it</li>
            <li> I love this product and it came so fast!! Literally the best way to clean your skin! This product is a must!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year now and I really like it.  My face feels so soft after using it.  The others on the market are so much more expensive than this one.  Can&#x27;t imagine that they do anything more or better.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness this is worth every penny I spent! I love it! It has a high &amp; low speed, came with batteries &amp; face wash!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 days, and already vast improvement! I will follow up with more reviews!</li>
            <li> I use this brush every night before going to bed. I&#x27;ve used it with olay face wash, trader joe&#x27;s brand cleanser and clarasonic scrub. It&#x27;s amazing! Way better than overpriced clarasonic cleansing system.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X system is very easy to use. The cleansing cream that came with the system works great on skin. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. Just as the detailed message another reviewer gave exactly. The size is just right for use in the shower, it is water proof and it has two speeds. My face feels refreshed after I exfoliate with it. I thought I would try it with my clean and clear and wow! My face feels tingly and clean! Great buy. I cant imagine the more expensive ones doing much of a difference other than making more profit... Lol!</li>
            <li> I have used this cleansing system for 3 times in bathroom. After I used,I cleaned body of the machine with no hesitation,because it is so-called water-resistant in the introduction. However,when I removed the batteries and checked out,I found that the batteries were moist，there is no doubt that the water had gone into the machine.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly,the cleansing brush is very smooth,but sometimes it&#x27;s too smooth to clean my skin. For personal reasons,my skin is very thin,after I used,my face is always red and dry. Maybe the cleansing system is not suitable for me.</li>
            <li> i like it but im not in love with it. i do wish the cleanser had mroe natural ingridents. it does exfoilate well. the brush is not hard at all.</li>
            <li> This works great (love it comes with batteries).  My face feels really clean and smooth afterwards.  I was worried it might irritate my rosacea but it doesn&#x27;t seem to.  The exfoliating cream that comes with it is not too grainy or harsh.  This is helping to exfoliate the dead skin created by the prescription cream for my rosacea.  Please note though, I don&#x27;t have &#x27;flare ups&#x27; like typical rosacea patients so it may irritate others&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first set of batteries. I don&#x27;t wear makeup regularly, and I avoid the sun so I can&#x27;t comment to that aspect of it. But, I feel like my skin is cleaner overall - I only use it once per day. Honestly, I might consider spending the $$ for the big competitor at some point in the future, and the main reason for that is this product rotates, so it&#x27;s basically pulling your skin (don&#x27;t use it in eye area!). The more expensive options pulsate, and [in theory] less damaging to your skin. But for the price, I&#x27;m happy and I&#x27;ll get more than my money&#x27;s worth from it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for  acne.  Her face cleared up shortly after using system.  Easy to use for kids and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> My mom had hers for a few months and I got mine as a Christmas gift. I love it! My acne started clearing up with the use of this and the exfoliate that comes with this system. I loved it so much that I went ahead and bought the full size one because it&#x27;s the only thing that helps clear up my acne! I have combination/oily skin if that helps anyone who&#x27;s deciding whether or not to try this.</li>
            <li> I wish I could try the Clarisonic to see if this really is a comparable product or not.  The brush is gentle and seems to gently exfoliate.  It appears quite water resistant with no issues with the battery casing.  I used regular facial cleansing products, nothing special.  My physician recommended Dove or similar.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product. I am very pleased.  I have no reason to buy a more expensive brand because this works great.</li>
            <li> Love this! And what a fantastic price...Finally, I can get a deep-clean without irritating my skin...it is gentle and thorough.  I&#x27;m in love!  The one thing I must do now is fins replacement heads.  After six or so weeks of usage, I cannot remove all if the makeup discoloration from it.  On tip: Use Facial wipes first to get off any excess make up you may still have on your skin.  Additionally, use the Oxy Advanced Cleaning in the shower or after, to ensure that your pores are open and the brush can do the best job it can.</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to do a review on this to see how it worked on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that it leaves my skin clean and fresh. I have large pores&lt;br /&gt;and I can see a difference in the cleanliness of my pores. This is really easy to&lt;br /&gt;use. I use it almost every night, it is not harsh or rough on my skin. I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend this and I am so happy that I got it for such a good price.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product because it was a less expensive option than some others.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like it or even use it every day.  I&#x27;ve now purchased two of them and I DO use it every day.  I haven&#x27;t moved to the more expensive ones because this one works just fine for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> This facial scrubber gently cleans your skin. You are able to use your favorite facial cleanser. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> With dry winter weather upon us, it&#x27;s the time of year my facial products loose their performance &amp; facial lines are more pronounced. I considered purchasing a $200.00 + machine with a name starting with the letter &#x27;C&#x27;. Then thought, I&#x27;m not blowing that kind of cash for something akin to an electric tooth brush for the face, &amp; gave this product a whirl instead. Conclusion: Forked out just a little over 20 bucks &amp; LOVE IT! Immediate dramatic results with first use. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 7 months and it&#x27;s a MUST for removing all my make-up at the end of the day and cleansing oily skin first thing in the morning. I use my own facial cleanser to wash my face first, then I go in with a bit more cleanser and the Olay brush to do the deep cleaning. I keep rinsing the brush and cleansing again til no more make-up comes off on the brush. For years I thought I was getting my face clean by just using my facial cleanser and my hands or a cloth but I was so wrong! Since using this product I can honestly say my face looks and feels clean and it has helped my complexion stay clear and pimple free! Easy 5 stars...give it a try!</li>
            <li> very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, dont like being made to give a revew</li>
            <li> Was quite happy with my purchase, it was worth every penny !&lt;br /&gt;The bristle is very fine and soft, and is very gentle on my acne filled face.&lt;br /&gt;The speed of the is just nice. Any faster, i guess my acne will hurts.&lt;br /&gt;What i am unhappy about is that Amazon(Amazon fulfilled) uses this SUPER ULTRA BIG Box. It is insanely big that can contain 8 boxes of this cleansing system.</li>
            <li> It really claim what it does. After a few usage, my pores are visibly unclogged and there aren&#x27;t any bumps(When your pores are clogged with oil/white heads, you can feel it when you touches it isn&#x27;t it?). So yes, would recommend it to my friends and family. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have cystic acne and I needed something to clean deep into my pores.  The first time I used this i noticed a big difference.  My skin was soft and smooth.  I have been using this everyday and I have noticed a dramatic difference in my skin,  I haven&#x27;t been getting any break outs and the ones I had are disappearing.  I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product because it is helping me with something that I have suffered with for years.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that will deep clean my makeup off and leave my skin smooth.  It&#x27;s slightly exfoliating and even works to exfoliate the lips, but gently.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but I have difficulty keeping it in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position -- the little button just doesn&#x27;t want to stay in so that the brush keeps revolving.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels softer since I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;Does the company have any suggestions about how to keep it on?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25-year-old female with fair, oily, acne-prone and sensitive skin. I&#x27;m sensitive enough that it tends to turn red and irritated with most scrubbing products, but using super gentle products (such as Cetaphil) doesn&#x27;t touch the oil. I didn&#x27;t try the Olay brush with the little sample of included cleanser, but instead use [[ASIN:B0073GO01E Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel, 5 oz]] with it as well with very good results. I use the brush with one of these cleansers 4-5 times per week, at night in the shower, all over my face, neck and décolletage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week I used [[ASIN:B001I45ZFC Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Bar, 4.5-Ounce Bar (Pack of 6)]] with the brush, and my skin felt soft and very clean, but not stripped and no irritation, which was a pleasant surprise. It zapped off all of my makeup easily, and my witch hazel and [[ASIN:B000UVZU1S St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin, 10oz]] afterward soaked in very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first couple of weeks, my skin still looked calm and break-outs were somewhat reduced, but not totally eliminated. I then switched to the Simple gel cleanser, and the brush helps the gel turn into a light, frothy foam which feels really nice. My break-outs seem to be slowed substantially, and I haven&#x27;t had any random skin irritation. The most effect I&#x27;ve seen is in my décollete, which definitely looks brighter and clearer than when I was using a basic shower pouf to cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a miracle cure-all, but it does seem to be helping the effectiveness of my cleansers. If nothing else, it feels really nice and soft on my skin and encourages me to take my time while cleansing.</li>
            <li> This is the best piece of beauty equipment since the girdle!!!  i know what you&#x27;re thinking...\\&quot;YEAH RIGHT\\&quot;...but it&#x27;s true!!! Before i used this product: I would have to change my face cleansing product about twice a month.  It was either to harsh, leaving my skin tight and dry.  Or it was to oily leaving me vulnerable to acne whiteheads. I would get dark discoloration (eczema) down the sides of my mouth, giving the appearence of a beard.  I have been using the product since the start of summer 2012.  We are now in SEPTEMBER!!!  The first benefit: if you are one of those people who tend to fall asleep without washing your face...this will put a stop to that.  How? Because you can&#x27;t wait to use it!!  I have at one time or antoher even gotten out of bed in the middle of the night to make sure i get that face wash in!  i use it in twice a day.  I used the cleanser that came with it,which wasn&#x27;t bad, but once that ran out...i moved on to using the AMBI EVEN &amp; CLEAR Foaming Cleanse, with the brush. My skin is soft, it&#x27;s clear, it glows, it&#x27;s touchable, it&#x27;s absolutely flawless.  i am a mother of a 26 year old and a 21 year old....fun is watching the disbelief on people&#x27;s face, when i have to tell them i have children that age!!!!!  go Olay go!!!</li>
            <li> My dermo tried to sell me a two hundred dollar version and I was not going to go for that so I found this item and gave it a shot. I&#x27;m very happy with it and it really makes cleaning your face easy and thorough. All the little flakes get brushed away and its nice to have a scale free surface to apply my makeup to. I suggest highly for middle age acne/oily skin.</li>
            <li> Id been struggling with the idea of buying a Clarisonic after all the hype thats been out there, but it feels too expensive for a person that had tried to use face brushes before, but left them because they caused breakouts. My skin is oily combination, and I live in a city with extreme weather ( above 100F on summer and cold and icy at winter), so keeping my face clean has always been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I convinced myself that I should try this one, and Ive been using it for 2 months now and I cant be happier. My skin hasnt been this softer in years, and a lot of sun spots have faded. I use it at night, after I took off my makeup, and once a week I use a exfoliating scrub with it. The brush is gentle, it doesnt feel harsh at all, the 2-speed setting seems adecuate to start with the slow one and after a while go to the full speed. At first I had a couple of breakouts but it depends on how much pressure I put on it. Its safe for shower use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that its not comparable to clarisonic because this is a rotating brush instead of a sonic technology but for the price seems just right, its better than just washing your face for sure, it has helped my makeup to stay longer and look better. I recommend this a lot to my friends, perhaps I would be careful if I had acne-prone skin, or check with my dermathologyst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps: Putting the batteries on is a nightmare. Go and find a youtube tutorial in that case, so you wont struggle</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of this with 2 refills one for myself and one for my girlfriend, and we both enjoy using this every morning.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush (unfortunately paying much more than the Amazon price) to replace my scrub that I was using.  My previous exfoliating scrub did not get stellar reviews from the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep skincare safety database and I have been trying to find replacement cosmetics/products that are safer but still effective.  I found that I really like Burts Bees Radiance Facial Cleanser, except that it is not an exfoliator.  enter Olay proX.  I use the olay brush with the Burts Bees cleanser. It works great. Skin is clearer, blackheads gone.&lt;br /&gt;As with other physical exfoliators i have used in the past, I have found that it&#x27;s a good idea to wash (not just rinse) the brush after use.  That removes the bacteria that otherwise make zits come back when you use it again.  If you don&#x27;t wash it, I think that the bacteria and little skin bits stay on the brush, as I have definitely noticed that if i don&#x27;t wash the brushead, next time I use it I will get a breakout.  But when I make sure to clean it after use, then my skin looks fabulous.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this product.  I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much given how inexpensive it was, but I feel like it is doing what I want, which is to deep clean my face.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months and probably am about ready for a new brush head...I would like it to have a variable speed or direction, but other than that it is awesome. I noticed a difference in my skin after only the first use and have kept it up. I have even tried washing my face first with a facial sponge or other method and then following up with this and it&#x27;s amazing how much dirt/oil/makeup still comes up after already being washed with another method - this definitely works to get the skin clean. I haven&#x27;t tried the more expensive brands, but for the cheap price this is very worth it!</li>
            <li> Just like the skin cleansing brush that costs $200.  Good for teens but not as pricey and the replacement brushes are more reasonable too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product not sure if it would work. Not only does it work great it was also a great deal.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this after my girlfriend recommended to me.  I had problems with oily skin, blackheads, clogged pores.  Not only is it lightweight, portable and easy to store, the results from use is absolutely what a girl needs.  Just after my first use, the mechanical cleanser with it&#x27;s soft, gentle rotating brush cleaned out my pores, removed dead skins cells on the surface, and provided a relaxing massage to my face.  This creates blood circulation like you get from a professional face massage.  My skin visibly looked clean and radiant.  You don&#x27;t need to use the Olay cleanser for these results, I used my own exfoliating cleanser and it worked wonders.  I highly recommend this mechanical cleanser for anyone who is on a budget and needs a at home professional system for skin care.  My only suggestion otherwise is that you should not use it more then once a day because you can easily over stimulate your skin (especially if you have sensitive skin) which can cause more oil producation and breakage of your skin which can cause redness/swelling. Overall a great and inexpansive at home cleansing system.</li>
            <li> It was cheaper than Target on the promotion price. It&#x27;s an ok product. It hasn&#x27;t work as well as the clarisonic though.  Yet, would recommend for price sensitive buyers.</li>
            <li> I was really optimistic about this product after hearing how my friends/family have enjoyed it. I am in my mid-twenties though, and I didn&#x27;t notice any positive change. In fact, if anything I noticed that it overly dried out my skin even with minimal use. I stopped using it on my cheeks/chin area and my skin condition improved. Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the positive changes that others have from using this. It&#x27;s probably on par with a wash cloth, making it extremely overpriced for the results.</li>
            <li> 12/05/12&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve never before been able to use anything because of my sensitive skin.  I started using this and couldn&#x27;t stop.  My skin feel soooooo good.  It&#x27;s soft, smooth, tight, and just feels so good.  People with sensitive skin you need to at least try this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/10/12&lt;br /&gt;I AM BACK!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back for my one week of using review! I can&#x27;t say enough that this product has been a life saver for me. If you have ever broke out just because someone looked at you...(LOL-I can laugh and joke about this now, but up til about one week ago I lived a nightmare.) I couldn&#x27;t use anything and I do MEAN anything on my face without having anxiety and being let down. I&#x27;ve had to live with my face looking and feeling a mess. While my friends have the liberty to use anything they want and they have beautiful skin. I&#x27;ve been looking at this product for a very long time and told myself to not take the chance of breaking out in hives and burning of the skin. I&#x27;ve been let down so many times and not to mention the money wasted. Well, my face is horrible! So I broke down and went to walmart. I purchased this product for $29.00. I&#x27;m literally in tears right now!!!!!!!!!!!!! Something finally I can use and it works. My face is soooo soft and touchable. The unsightly skin pigment problems on both my right and left cheeks (they are huge) are actually getting lighter. The pits/little tiny holes in skin from pass and current acne have lifted. I no longer have dull leather like skin. It&#x27;s been so long since my skin felt like this. SENSITIVE PEOPLE - don&#x27;t be afraid to try this. Patch test, you know how we have to do it. But this is worth a try! I&#x27;m happy! And to be honest, if my unit broke after one month of use. I&#x27;m not going to complain, cause I use the H ___ out of it. I am just going to rush to the store and buy me a new one. LOL (smiling) God Bless!</li>
            <li> This make my face feel clean and much smoother.  I use with the Olay cleaner everyday and don&#x27;t have any problem.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this instead of wasting a bunch of money on a Clarisonic. From the first time I used it my face felt cleaner than it had ever been! My husband made fun of me because I was so obsessed with it, so I made him try it and he loves it to lol. I will def be buying replacement heads for this and using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works very well!  Easy to use and leaves my skin very soft and clean.  Would recommend  to anyone.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> If you are hoping this scrubber is as good as the professional ones then don&#x27;t waste your money. The speed is not efficient, it goes through batteries fast and the brush is tiny.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps to exfoliate your skin in order for it to &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. My face has never felt cleaner! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Olay pro-x cleansing brush-love this tool!!!  I use this about 3 times a week &amp; it really cleanses my face!</li>
            <li> I was considering getting a Clairsonic but found the price rather steep for my budget...and then I found the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System. I can&#x27;t make a comparative beyond the obvious price difference (since I havent tried the Clairsonic) but I can speak for Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System--I love it! I would regularly have breakouts but after putting it in my daily regimen--I noticed that my skin felt a lot cleaner and had no more breakouts! It was worth the price and it delivered beyond expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love more about it is that I didn&#x27;t had to worry keeping it in my shower (for ease of use and access) because it is waterproof. I wear makeup everyday and even with thorough cleansing, I would have the breakouts. The Olay Cleansing System brought new meaning to cleansing! The bristles do not hurt at all. I enjoy using it and would take even more time with it. The brush&#x27; rotating action massages and cleans the face, right to its pores. I would definitely recommend the product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at least 2 yrs ago and I didn&#x27;t use it long. I have extremely sensive and acne prone skin. This made my ance worse! My moderate ance sky-rocketed to severe acne within days.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing system.  I use it every night.  Cleans off all dead tissue, and leaves your face smooth and silky.  I use Olay 7 after cleansing</li>
            <li> Although it has taken some getting used to, I find that I really like this cleansing system.  I feel that the bristles really get into my facial skin and clean the makeup off better than a washcloth or just using my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a bit irritating to my skin at first but I am finally used to it.  For me, this is a great system and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Two years and still working ... this was an excellent purchase, because  it&#x27;s used everday.</li>
            <li> There are machines which cost a couple of hundred dollars, but for the very modest price, this system gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  My skin feels so much better.  Am considering buying a larger body brush to cleanse with.</li>
            <li> This made my beautiful clear skin break out worse then my worst breakout from my teen years.  Absolutely ruined my skin and it took 3 weeks for my skin to clear after I stopped using it.  This is like sandpaper but much rougher which I know because I actually use sandpaper (a very fine grain) to buff dead skin and unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my mom, she loved it and uses it every night. After using it for several months now, it makes her skin glow and she looks more radiant and beautiful. A must have for sure--without having spend way too much money and what&#x27;s great is that you can easily take it wherever you go. A+++</li>
            <li> Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System is very good. And it really does what it promises. Loved it! is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Good price, great exfoliator and comparable to the more expensive like products. This is great for young acne prone skin as it is gentle and not too abrasive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Olay Cleansing System for several months now.  The best thing about this brush is that it does a great job of removing makeup. My skin has a lot of what I call \\&quot;gook\\&quot; although I think the correct term may be \\&quot;blackheads\\&quot; - so if I&#x27;m close to the mirror plucking my eyebrows I can see these tiny little white things (finer than salt) hanging out of my pores, which is gross.  I gave it four out of five stars b/c this brush DOES NOT remove all the blackheads...which is surprising b/c I can easily pick them (quick swipe - no squeezing or anything like that) off with my finger.  If I were to use it longer than the recommended 60 seconds or so (3-4 minutes) and put the brush at different angles, it can get them - but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that.  I worry that using it for a prolonged amount of time and at different angles will just irritate my skin, so I decided to buy the clairisonic today.  With the 90 day gaurantee, there is no harm in my opinion.  I think you should get this depending upon your skin - if you have breakouts and blackheads - this will help, but it isn&#x27;t going to get everything out without angling and prolonged use.  It is definitely better than manual washing...if you have normal skin and just want something to get your make up off good, this is a great buy - and the price is worth it.  You do have to be careful around the eye area as the thing has slid off near my temple towards my eye on several occasions.  It is a little aggravating after using this thing and still seeing little blackheads everywhere, but for the makeup removal and price, I think it is deserving of 3 1/2 stars...but I&#x27;m giving it a 4 since that isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> I was a call away from going in for microdermabrasion treatment at my local dermatologist when I decided to break down and by this for $25. I&#x27;m so glad I did, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 days now, and WOW! My skin felt smoother after the first day, and visibly looks smoother on the third day. I have one of those 5x mirrors, so I&#x27;ve been able to really see how effective this product has been. So far I&#x27;ve just been using the exfoliating scrub it comes with, which has large granules; however, I plan using it with the Neutrogena facial scrubs. This product claims it makes exfoliating scrubs 7x more effective, and after using it twice a day I&#x27;d say I agree. The one thing that&#x27;s a bit tricky is the batter installation. Some claim there are no instructions, and that they had to call the company. There are instructions, printed on the box, not in a pamphlet. Simply just wiggle the bottom side to side and it comes off real easy. Also, the brush heads are 2 for $8 on Amazon, which is much cheaper than the $20 for 1 they charge at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System is okay but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations unfortunately. I would give it 3 stars</li>
            <li> Works like a dream! You get a great deep clean and I feel like it really pulls out all of the dirt and oils from your pors.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible idea, but lacks the real punch that most of us with problem skin really desire. The product turns out to be quite pricey to wash ones face! Save your money, or really save your money for the cost of care.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s others priced much higher. For a basic daily cleansing system, I&#x27;d highly recommend this brush. Not claiming to be waterproof, and AA battery operated, I use it with different cleansers in my shower without any issues. You can&#x27;t believe how it improves your skin. For the price and quality, you cant beat it. Arrived on time too</li>
            <li> This produce is working very well. I&#x27;m really enjoying the results of this electric brush.  I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time and product intact, I was not overly impressed with the spin speed of the brush, a friend recently introduced me to the newer and cheaper neutrogena product, I think I might switch.....</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  My skin is so smooth and clear. Fine lines are diminished around my eyes. I have not had any pimples pop up. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this is the shower and a great way to finish cleaning my face.. I live in the desert and it gets windy here and this product make my face feel clean and awake after I use it. ... I use it every evening and go be bed dirt free..</li>
            <li> The brush is awesome, really helps your skin feel cleaner and smoother. It works in the shower, batteries last long.</li>
            <li> I love this! It really works great and love that it is water proof as well! Did not have money for the Clarisonic although I did want to get a facial cleanse brush, so glad I got this one!!!</li>
            <li> I love the  unit, worth every penny, am considering giving for Christmas gifts.&lt;br /&gt;It also was recvd in a very timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou for a great product.</li>
            <li> i am stuck with a product that constantly breaks my face everytime i use it...what a waste of $$$. Is there a money back garantee on this thing?</li>
            <li> It was cheaper than the local retail store. I had to search utube to put in the batteries, but no problems once this was complete. It works as promised. No complaints. I had a smooth purchasing experience.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush, love the two speeds, the slow is good for the nose and the fast works for the forehead.  Like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wasn&#x27;t ready to fully invest $200 in the clarisonic. This cleansing brush works so well that I probably won&#x27;t. The two speeds are nice and I use both. I try not to exfoliate more than 3-4 times a week so my skin has some time to heal but have heard of people using this daily as well.</li>
            <li> I love any and all Olay products, but had put off purchasing this cleansing system.  I have extremely sensitive skin and was afraid this system would aggravate it and make it redder than it already is.  It did not.  The brush is very soft and gentle on my skin; I actually wish it had a little more substance to it because it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s doing much cleaning - my skin feels cleaner when I use a rough wash cloth.  I also use the system on my arms because at 60 yrs old, I now have &amp;#34;crepe&amp;#34; skin - my arms are the only place that really shows my age right now.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, so it hasn&#x27;t been long enough yet to determine if it will help with that area.  My 4-star rating is primarily because I love the Olay line of products.  I was not &amp;#34;blown away&amp;#34; with this item, but then, neither was I blatantly disappointed with it, either.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy the Clarisonic like everyone else I knew but I was hestitant because of the price. I found this on amazon one day and decided I should give it a try. Works pretty well to get the job done! I even ordered another one for my sister.</li>
            <li> Works great for me! I would buy this item again. U will have to buy extra heads every couple of months</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a little background from me - I&#x27;m a 21 year old African American male, never been to a spa. I decided to try this because I began taking better care of my health and it was only $18 so why not, right? The box has limited waste, and you can get everything out in a shake (literally). You just rock the bottom of the unit to open the battery compartment - if I didn&#x27;t read the box instructions I would have had no idea how to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I think the Pro-X is cool. I can only see myself using it to exfoliate (which is what it&#x27;s intended for so *thumbs up*). I kind of wish it was stronger? I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s weak but I&#x27;m a guy and I think power &amp;#62; practical. I often find myself confusing the speed button with the power button, but that just may be because I&#x27;m not used to it. I find that the brush head is irritating to clean out, not saying that it&#x27;s hard, but I just wish it was easier to wash the scrub out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I can see the Pro-X having longevity in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> so far so good, within a week i have notice my skin looks healthier and i&#x27;m  also wearing less makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this brush it works just as good as the clairsonic Its feels like a mini facial</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife for Christmas and she uses it twice a day. She absolutely loves it. Seems to be very sturdy and replacement heads can be found at our local drug stores.</li>
            <li> works great  at a very reasonable price, I can not see why somebody would pay $200 for a simular product really what fools they must be</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I figured I would give this a try and the price was right! Outstanding product. My skin looks great and I love how my skin feels!</li>
            <li> I tried tried and still trying to open battery compartment .. Design sucks.. It might be great on face..I don&#x27;t know that yet</li>
            <li> The product came in a few days ago, although I thought it would be a lot bigger than it actually is, it is easy to handle. All facial brushes do the same thing, it was a great buy. I would never spend $100+ on a Clarasonic brush, when this is just as good.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Compact and very light. It also already comes batteries (which is very nice) and also cleans well. The included sample isn&#x27;t much but what you get lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young adult with combination skin. I works with any cleanser and is easy to handle. I use it all over for no more than a minute because my skin has dry spots. I am african american and have noticed my darks marks to start fading.</li>
            <li> before spending the $259.00 for one of the other cleansing systems on the market i thought i would try this one, and i was pleasantly surprised. this little cleanser does and outstanding job at both cleansing and exfoliating. my skin is brighter and has a glow that seemed to be fading before trying this system. i would recommend this to anyone regardless of age. i happen to be one of the litlle older gals around but this did a wonderful job on my fragile skin and i would definitely recommend it for the younger women as i think it would handle even a teenage skin with acne. the cleanser that came with it was very good and even seemed to get off any left over makeup after i used my makeup remover. i feel this is a wonderful investment and a much better price than the higher priced system and does the job just as well. a great buy and great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for exfoliation without having to pay for a facial. It&#x27;s gentle and effective right in the comfort of your own bathroom.</li>
            <li> Is just as described and it works fine quick delivery and good quality for the price and it comes with the sample of the scrub I order one for my wife and now I order one for me I know I&#x27;m a man but I work outside and keeping my face clean stops breakouts of acne and pimples so I doesn&#x27;t matter who you are just take care of yourself!</li>
            <li> My skin looks great. I cant believe how smooth this product has made my skin feel.Very pleased.I would like to purchase for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this to deal with some bad acne problems on my lower face and chin. I decided to alternate between the cream Olay includes and a glycolic acid shower scrub. After using the scrub and the pro x consistently with my morning shower, I can see a tremendous improvement. My skin is a lot smoother and the acne is not as noticable or as red as before. The scarring is still there but I have a feeling that continued use should help address that.</li>
            <li> I brought this a year ago and finally used it a few weeks ago. my face feel so much cleaner then using a facial clothes. I was in the process of moving and found it. works great,</li>
            <li> Love. this. so. much. Everyone needs to get this if they cant afford the clarisonic. It works and does a great job of cleaning out my pores without clogging them. My acne is doing better and my skin is much softer. Super happy with my purchase and looking forward to using this all the time!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure acne, but it sure helps. And she feels like her skin is much cleaner than just using her hands to wash her face. The bristles are soft enough that her &amp;#34;peaches and cream&amp;#34; skin is not irritated. I recommend it for self conscious teenagers (Now if I could just get my son to even care about his complexion...)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with my Clean N&#x27; Clear 3-in-1 Exfoliating Cleanser, and my skin feels so good afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like going to a spa to get a $100 facial done. This product is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Brilliant my skin has never felt so clean.  My complexion has improved wonderfully.  Easy to use and everone should have one.</li>
            <li> Very, very happy with this product.  My face feels wonderful after using this with my Mary Kay products :)  Recommend to anyone who does not want to pay top dollar for something that works just as well...</li>
            <li> got for my daughter is great for cleasning and skin care&lt;br /&gt;is great massaging for fase and neck areas too</li>
            <li> I bought this about 2 months ago, and the product proves to be great.&lt;br /&gt;I used it about once a week for deep cleansing and exfoliating. the brush feels gentle and it works well with Cetaphil cleanser, which I have been using for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews, I haven&#x27;t noticed a great difference yet, but it&#x27;s clearly a quality product. The little motor inside turns plenty quickly to scrub my face and afterwords my face feels clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little tube of exfoliator that comes with the brush won&#x27;t last very long. You&#x27;ll definitely need to have another cleanser or exfoliator after a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing some long-term results with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Clarisonic for a few years now with great results but, after it took really nasty spill down the stairs while I was packing for a business trip I was in search of a cheaper option. I heard great things about the Olay Pro X so I gave it a shot. It DOES NOT compare to the Clarisonic on any level!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHARGING - The clarisonic comes with a neat charging dock that just magnetically snaps on. The Olay Pro requires batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATERPROOF - The Clarisonic is waterproof... the Olay Pro is NOT, it is water resistant. This basically means that the Olay can accidently get a little wet but, has to be dried off immediately. Seems really odd that they wouldn&#x27;t make a device that is supposed to get wet, waterproof. I leave my Clarisonic in the shower and never had a problem. If water sits in the batteries in the Olay then the batteries corrode&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIMING - The Clarisonic automatically turns off(you can turn it back on) at the end of the recommended cleansing time so you don&#x27;t over cleanse your face. Olay Pro does not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANSING - Clarisonic \\&quot; has 300 movements per second to gently, yet thoroughly remove 6X more makeup and 2X more dirt and oil than cleansing with your hands alone\\&quot; The Olay Pro only rotates in a circle, no vibration. The bristles are also coarse and irritating to my skin. The Clarisonic gives you a better clean feeling. There is a reason dermatologists, estheticians and spas use the Clarisonic and not the Olay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERSATILITY - The Mia has several different options for cleansing brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mia is about $119 and I have seen them on sale for about $80. I recommend you give the Mia a shot. If you feel it&#x27;s not worth the price it is 100% refundable through Amazon. In my opinion, don&#x27;t skimp when it comes to skin care. The Mia is by far a better product.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush - the little motor could be more powerful so that there is no drag on it when you apply it to your face.  But other than that, it is fantastic and I am glad I bought it and would buy another one.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing brush. I&#x27;ve issued other top rated brushes and this one by far my favorite for the price. I will say I had a few more brake outs for the first week but then they disappeared. My skin has never felt so soft and clean. I would recommend this to anyone liking to improve their skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Good product. Makes my skin feel super soft. Just started using it so not sure what the long term effects will be on acne prevention but so far very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a clearasonic for years. Although I never purchased one I must say I am extreemly happy with this product and happy to have gone will the less expensive option. The product is small and yet powerful. Even after just a few uses I can already feel and see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product initially because I hesitated to spend $$$ for the Clarisonic system.  This brush did a good job. Instead of sonic technology (Clarisonic) it rotates, which seems more abrasive.  My face was definitely smoother and had less breakouts after the initial breakthrough period (your skin may break out when first using it because of dirt and impurities rising to the surface of the skin).  However, the product broke after 5 months of continuous use.  I have since purchased the Clarisonic pro, and there is absolutely no comparison between the two.  If you have the money, skip this and just buy a Clarisonic.  If you can&#x27;t afford that system, then this will do just fine, while it lasts.</li>
            <li> A gift to my wife and it is worth the money. Works fine and feels good. Like many other systems, they try to sell the cleansing system cheap, and hope you buy more their fluid, looks like they are good at this.</li>
            <li> I am 38 and still suffer from acne and now developing sun spots in the summertime. I am also starting to get a lot of wrinkles!  Due to this I try to take care of my face the best I can. The first time I used this system, my skin felt unbelievably clean! I then used my Regenerist cream (for wrinkles) and I noticed a change in the small lines the next morning! Basically this product cleans your face so well that other products, creams you use after it do what they are suppose to! I am very impressed.  Now we will see if the sun spots start to fade.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get your sideburns caught in the rotation stem because it will pull your hair out!.  the speed is good and feels great on the face.</li>
            <li> I consider myself pretty low maintenance, but thought I&#x27;d try this cleaner to see if it could help shrink size of pores and clean out some black heads. Voila! Great job exfoliating and super cleaned my skin! Soft bristles really felt nice.  Had a coupon for this item at our local drugs store - used the enclosed sample of Olay exfoliating scrub.  For the price, I was very happy with results!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week. I really like it. I&#x27;ve been wanting one for awhile but did not want to pay a lot of money. The price on this one was great. I have noticed a differance in my pores and my skin is much smoother. I would recomend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have long since run out of the little sample of Olay Regenerist Cleanser, but this brush is divine - super soft but efficient, my skin really noticed a difference when I visited my sister for a weekend and forgot it! I  recommend it for ease of use and efficacy. Be sure, however, to buy replacement brushes as well, if you plan to use this with a scrub-like facial cleanser. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful and my face always feels so soft after. I havent tried the cleanser that it comes with only because my face is so sensitive, that if I use anything new on it I will break out. Maybe one day I will give it a try. Very happy buy!</li>
            <li> It being the winter months I have trouble with dry skin.  Seeing a tv commercial on the Pro-X I bought it  and I am very pleased with the results.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> First of all, getting the cover off to put the batteries in this thing was ridiculously hard, but it was worth it in the end. I have some hormonal cystic acne and combination skin that tends to dry out in the winter. I use this once or twice a day (with both the included cleanser and my own, in conjunction with another facial products) and my skin condition has greatly improved. I also really like that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I suppose the product would have perfect, had I received what was advertised. A friend recommended this item to me.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day! Works fine for me.  If I have a big pimple or a pimple that already has a white head &amp; I use that thing its busts the pimple but it leaves a scar.  I have enough of those already.  I still use it faithfully though.  Ive never used the more expensive one but this one does the job just fine.  Plus its waterproof!!!! I can use it in the shower!!!! :-)</li>
            <li> arrived in mail on time just as advertised would buy again as this is exactly what I expected based on description</li>
            <li> FROM DAY ONE THE DIFFERENCE WAS VISIBLE.  I&#x27;VE ALWAYS HAD GOOD SKIN, BUT DUE TO STRESS ETC, MY SKIN WAS LOOKING BLOTCHY.  STARTED USING IT AND IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY.</li>
            <li> At first,I think it will not work well because the cleaning system is very simple.&lt;br /&gt;But after some days,I found skin more fine and smooth.</li>
            <li> My wife says this works as well as some of the more expensive models out but wishes it had a charger with it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for grandaughter and she was really happy with it.  The price was really good and it&#x27;s just as nice as the one that comes with the facial cleansing product on TV.</li>
            <li> It has made a different on my skin...I can see it and feel it and I have felt that people can too....I use it regularly..I am very happy with my purchase..</li>
            <li> I brought this brush 5 days ago and I can already tell a major difference in the quality of my skin. I recently started getting break outs and was trying toners and oxy pads, none of which worked. I figured the main problem was that those products weren&#x27;t penetrating my pores, so I thought I can justify spending $20-30 to try this out (but I wasn&#x27;t about to spend $200 on a similar product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night one of using it, I could tell a difference in the texture of my skin. It felt incredibly smooth and felt like it was &amp;#34;deep cleaned&amp;#34;. I used a small amount of the exfoliating cleanser that the brush came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on day 5 my skin looks and feels more vibrant. My pores are smaller and my face just overall feels cleaner. I wash my face before using it so that it doesn&#x27;t stain the brush but there always seems to be make up on the brush (which just shows you how clean and deep this thing gets).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads are cheap and the unit itself was well worth the 30 days. I would recommend using the faster speed only a couple days a week and use the lower speed mostly because I imagine it could really irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product so I&#x27;m sure the rest of Olay&#x27;s Pro-X line is just as great and I&#x27;ll probably give those products a try soon!</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin. After I use it, my skin ends up very smooth and radiant. It also helps my moisturizer work better. My face feels so clean and soft that even my husband notices the difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and my face feels much fresh and clean. I&#x27;ve always wanted to have that Professional cleaning and this product brings that to budget conscious people like me.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  This is probably one of the best purchases that I have ever made regarding a beauty product.  My skin is really sensitive and it seemed like I always had a problem with black-heads on my nose and chin, it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks since I started using this product and the number of black-heads has greatly diminished.  My skin has also never been so soft and smooth and now my skin just has this amazing natural glow to it.  I greatly recomend this product for people who have sensitive skin and where breakouts and black-heads are a real problem.  I use the Pro-X Advanced Cleaning System two times a day I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you, Olay!!</li>
            <li> I have wanted a Clarisonic cleansing product for about a year now but couldn&#x27;t find it in myself to pay over $100 for one. I passed the Olay Cleansing System several times in stores but figured there must be something not so great about it if it&#x27;s only $20-30 dollars. I was wrong!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently read a review that stated if you compare the two products they are very similar and get the job done equally as great. The biggest difference is that the Clarisonic can be used on your entire body vs. Olay is for the face. I scooped it up as soon as I could!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face has never felt so clean and soft. My pores are visibly cleaner and I have only used this twice and most of my blackheads are already gone. The box says to replace the head in about 3 months which isn&#x27;t bad at all. It comes with a trial size Olay Exfoliating Scrub, the normal sized tube costs about $20 which is a bit expensive but it works amazingly..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been recommending this to all my family and friends!</li>
            <li> i use this product in the shower. its so inexpensive but BEWARE you wont get the full size bottle of the exfoliater this is only the travel size one.. i was so confused when i got it. but oh well. anyways it is so much cheaper than the clearsonic($100+) and for the clearsonic you cant even use it in your bathroom when you are showering... i love this product it works better than my hands.. i think this is TOTALLY A BETTER BUY than the clearsonic</li>
            <li> So happy with this purchase as it works simply, but very, very well.  It has softened the facial skin &amp; I know the cleansing factor has improved all lotions, make up which may have been left unknowingly behind.  A perfect purchase for me with aging skin that needed a revitalization.</li>
            <li> Using the Olay ProX feels like tiny ninja&#x27;s are spinning around my face, hacking off excess oil and dead skin cells with their tiny throwing stars, leaving my skin feeling smooth and baby-soft. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Ordered the ProX cleaning system on July 19 (conf date received.  It was to be here between17-26 days.  I have not yet received it.  It was charged to a cr. card on7/18.</li>
            <li> I got mine today and I used it for the first time .. and WOW .. it&#x27;s like I never washed my face before !! my skin became so soft and super CLEAN :]</li>
            <li> I like this product very attractive . Bye.</li>
            <li> i used this for the first time this morning and left the shower with my face feeling wonderful. the brush isn&#x27;t too rough even on the higher speed. i do wish the brush was just a little bigger. besides that, it&#x27;s great. :)</li>
            <li> I was going back and for about getting this the last time there was a $5 coupon, and waited too long and the coupon went away.  In the meantime I have been trying to add things to my beauty routine that would add a lot of bang for not a lot of buck, and this brush kept coming up on sites like makeupally and other beauty blogs.  Since Amazon&#x27;s regular price is comparable to the big box stores, I decided one day to go for it. To my great delight the coupon was back, and all I can say is that the brush is worth every penny I paid and then some.  It has made my average skin look better then ever, and has not caused any weird breakouts or redness.  I would agree that using the cleanser that comes with it might be too abrasive for regular use on sensitive skin.  I have been using my regular Cetaphil cleanser with the brush twice daily, and the Olay scrub once a week with great results.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a boost to their skincare regimen without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I received when they told me I was supposed to be receiving. Satisfied with it and I will buy more!</li>
            <li> I originally bought the MIa 2 and $160 later decided that I kind of hated it.  It felt awkward to hold, heavy and big.  It was difficult to clean my nose.  Was it 20 seconds on my forehead or chin?  Ahhhh!  They also warn you not to use it too often in the beginning, it will shred your face.  Cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First week, my face got crazy dry and started breaking out.  What.  The ladies at Nordstrom promised me that it was just my skin \\&quot;purging\\&quot;  uh right, whatever.  I pressed on.  Until I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  A month after buying the Clarisonic Mia 2 I returned it.  Good-bye break outs and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still loved the idea of using a brush, and although the motion was different- decided to take my chances with the Oil of Olay Pro-X cleansing brush.  I loved it.  I love that I can use an exfoliating scrub.  The oil of olay brush is also considerably smaller, lighter and feels way more comfortable to hold. I also dig that two replacement heads cost under $10 verses Mia&#x27;s $25+ per replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish there were options for the heads, but I&#x27;m okay with the one they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Oil of Olay brush for about a month, and my skin has been great.  I love this face brush, and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Keep your brush head sanitized!  I keep a little spray bottle with rubbing alcohol in it to spritz the head after I&#x27;m done using it as a disinfectant.</li>
            <li> Had been looking at this and the $200 products for many months now. When the exceptional deal price popped up the other day, i grabbed it. I used it while in the bath each morning and its gentle brushing gives my face a lovely feel.  i have sensitive skin and this does not bother it at all.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> How can I open it so I can begin using it? Please someone tell me how[[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]] to open this machine so I can put the batteries in it!</li>
            <li> I have only used this system once so far, so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best thing I have ever used, but after using it I can see and feel a difference. On the first run out I used my [[ASIN:B0002XG9X2 Panasonic EH2511A Pore Cleanser with Micro-fine Mist]] first, which deep cleanses my pores and followed it with the Olay Pro-X system.  The brush on the Olay is soft and it has a couple different speed settings for rotation.  I used it on the slowest setting across my nose and cheeks because that&#x27;s where I used my Pore cleanser most, then I upped the speed for my forehead, chin, and neck.  That night my face was red for a couple hours probably because I used both products a little too long, but balance comes with experience.  Next time I may use them on different days.  Either way, later that night and for the next few days my skin has felt so soft.  A few blemishes that popped up prior to using it are shrinking away, the redness went away after a good nights sleep, and my nose barely has a dark speck in any of the pores.  On it&#x27;s own it may be enough for most people but used as a duo with my Panasonic cleanser, for me, it&#x27;s looking like a winner.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and affordable!!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S MADE IN CHINA!&lt;br /&gt;I AM CHINESE!&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S PITY!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;LL BUY SOMETHING AGAIN !&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S A FANTATIC TIMES!&lt;br /&gt;GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;HAHA!</li>
            <li> THIS MACHINE IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH POWER  FOR WHAT I NEED . I RETURN IT BACK TO THE AMAZON LAST TIME AND BOUGHT STRONGER ONE.</li>
            <li> 2 speeds only...slow and slower. Only one cleaning head. Ok for cleaning but not a great exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I just wish I had ordered the cleansing system with several &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; heads.  However  for  what it is, it works very well.</li>
            <li> This product is great for digging deep into your pores and for cleaning your skin, but after using it your face feels really raw, and not refreshing. The face wash that came with didn&#x27;t help at all, so i had to go a buy my own. The brush gets really gross after you washing it out and dry it. The PROx should come with another brush inside and I think the face wash should come in a bigger size and should be more of a scrub.  Overall this product could use some work.</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a difference in thd texture of my skin after I use this system. The brush is quite gentle, but it really does remove rough, dead skin.</li>
            <li> She never uses it, so I decided to give it a go. Not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t scrub hard enough to really do much. I normally use a heavy duty ex-foliating  face wash with 3M light duty scrub sponge (those green/yellow ones you wash dishes with) to wash my face in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That works 100x better than this machine.</li>
            <li> This removes most of make up but provides very little exfoliation and leaves my face red. I have been using this for three months and have seen zero improvement with my skin. A wash cloth does a much better job at cleaning and exfoliating than this product. This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I feel like the rotating brush cleaned better than hands alone.. My face felt cleaner. I used the olay cleanser at night and my regular cleanser in the morning.</li>
            <li> I know some people love their Clairsonic, but for the price, this is a great product. I&#x27;m glad I decided to take a chance with the Olay Pro-X. Leaves my face feeling so clean and smooth. I use the cleanser it comes with, but I also use my own (Murad). Give it a shot...I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised. ;-)</li>
            <li> Works very well. I love that I can use it in the shower. Priced very well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I unfortunately cannot afford to buy products like the clarisonic so I thought I would try and give this a shot. It really does work! I suffer from cystic acne and this really helps me to clean my face the way it needs to be cleaned. I&#x27;ve noticed a change when paired with Mario Badescu&#x27;s acne facial cleanser. I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I have never had great skin (I&#x27;ve had acne for the last decade), but this has made an incredible difference in my skin. My blackheads have cleared, I rarely have break outs, my skin is softer, and my acne scars have started to fade. I use my own face wash that I trust. I don&#x27;t really like Olay&#x27;s face wash. I would recommend this to anyone, especially people with acne problems. If it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping the first few times you use it, don&#x27;t give up! Just give your skin time to clear. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> very good, if the product introduction can be more detail, then it would be better.</li>
            <li> I always have pimples on my T-zone. However, after using the Olay Pro-x, the number of breakouts reduced tremendously! There is distinct differences after using the product for one month and I am happy with the result! For the amount I paid for, it is definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> This item is nothing or does nothing remotely close to what they advertise it to do. I feel one could achieve better results with a toothbrush on the face. There are much better and even cheaper drugstore alternatives.</li>
            <li> I bought this when there was a coupon offer on it.  It is OK.  I think the head is a little small and under powered, but it does the job.  It runes off of two AA batteries.  The compact size and readily available batteries would make this a great unit for travel.</li>
            <li> Who knew? Small price for a grand result.  This 40+ gal went from dull to glow in about 1 week. Olay does what it says.</li>
            <li> it took some getting used to and a lil bit of soap in my eye, but the handheld unit is great. i noticed a difference on the 2nd day of use. my skin is smoother and more clear already. i&#x27;m a victim of adult acne, slight, and blackheads, but so far, after 3 days of use, there is a noticeable difference in my black heads and my moisturizer is going on easier and am using less. this is a great starter unit for those, like me, who wanted to see what the fuss is about but dont want to spend the 100&#x27;s on other units.</li>
            <li> I got the cleaning system 2 weeks ago.  I can tell the improvement on skin tone.  I don&#x27;t mind if the speed can go a bit faster.  By the way, save $10 buying online.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as powerful as some brands but does the job and I love that I can keep it right in the shower...</li>
            <li> Whenever I would use this in the shower, my face felt so soft and clean!! I use it probably 2 times a week. It works great.</li>
            <li> This is so much cheaper than the Clarisonic face brush and works just as good. I use it ever day!</li>
            <li> I am over age 65plus and have always taken good care of my skin.  Due to some medications Inow take, and having received 33 Radiation treatments for Breast Cancer this has taken a toll on my skiN over the past 3 yrs. and the Pro-X cleansing system has made a remarkable difference in tone and color, also I am starting to see a change in my facial wrinkles.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Its hard getting refills; they&#x27;re even too damn high $$$, or always add on items.</li>
            <li> head is too weak even on the highest power, does not clean anything, give product away to goodwill, better use your fingers</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my face feel very clean. After only a few weeks of using it, I think that my skin looks healthier. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Wow! My skin was brighter the first time I used it.  In only a few days, my skin was actually tighter, brighter.  It feels very smooth when you are done.  I agree with the good reviews on here, its amazing and affordable.  Use your regular moisturizers after cleansing. Ive also used my own cleansing lotion.  the cleanser it comes from works the best though. My skin feels smooth as a pearl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned both and this one is just as good, but at a small fraction of the price.  Bought it for my husband and for my own use as a replacement because I kept dropping the Clarisonic until it stopped functioning after the last drop.  Great alternative</li>
            <li> Made my skin very soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It is a good product. Good quality. And for people who need it, I recommend it 100%. In addition, this a good price.</li>
            <li> I wish that it had a more powerful setting but that is probably not good for your skin. Overall my face feels and looks better. Now I just need to get my kids to leave it alone. Will probably be buying them their own facial brushes in the near future.</li>
            <li> This is just ok.  It does exfoliate and help remove makeup but its just not excellent. The brush rotates instead of vibrating like the  luxury brand that is out there. I find the circular rotating motion is just a bit too rough on my skin, even on the slowest setting.  I use it maybe every other day to help exfoliate but thats about it.  Save your money and get that big name brand that starts with a C.</li>
            <li> Cleanest my face has ever felt and great to use in the shower. Plus cheaper than Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Works great! SO glad I didn&#x27;t fork over money for the more expensive Clarisonic. Granted, I do not have experience using the Clarisonic, but I&#x27;m exceedingly happy with the Olay brush. Makes my skin baby soft and I have not experienced breakouts like others have mentioned. I use it once a day and that seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li> Amazing and I love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like doing reviews but decided to do so because I now read reviews BEFORE I order an item and have found it very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product daily now for several weeks and see absolutely no difference. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Used only couple times. Did not see any change. It is simply a brush. Cream is not good either. Its not really a cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really DIDN&#x27;T have to pay $100 or more for this type of facial cleanser.  I&#x27;ve used this twice so far and what it does to my facial skin is unbelievably awesome!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really love it, and it didn&#x27;t (unfortunately) provide any miracle moments for my skin appearance. Since it didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s fallen out of my rotation because frankly if it doesn&#x27;t do anything exciting, I don&#x27;t have time for it. In fairness, I&#x27;m not exactly a girly-girl so facial care lasts about 26 seconds. I will give it 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t do anything bad. ;)</li>
            <li> I use this daily, and I am very happy with the results after using this product since February. The discs that work with this product are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after my other more expensive brush stopped working just after the warranty period ended. I like it a lot and have seen a pronounced improvement in my skin&#x27;s general texture and shine. It&#x27;s less powerful than the category leader but at this price - a good and surprisingly effective tool.</li>
            <li> I have this brush for over three months now. It played a big role in clearing up my white heads! Plus it made my skin feel smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive about buying this product thinking...a scrub brush on my face?  I was delighted to find the bristles are baby soft.  You can use it everyday.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t use it that much if you tend to have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it in the shower or by the sink.  They include a small tube of Olay cleanser AND the batteries!  My face is absolutely glowing when I use it.  I love it so much I ordered 4 brush refills and a large bottle of cleanser just to make sure I&#x27;d have it for a long time.  My sister does facials professionally and she recommended I use this.  I&#x27;m 53 years old with no wrinkles showing yet, thank God...and this just completes my cleansing routine and starts my day off with a glow.  This is a keeper! And you can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> Great product and great price range. I recommend at this price buying this product and testing out the cleaning system before you consider buying a More expensive brush. You might just be happy with the more affordable 2 speed brush like this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a cheaper alternative to Clarisonic. It comes with a sample size exfoliating cleanser. I found this to be very effective and my skin improved after a couple uses. Be careful, these brushes can be harsh and should only really be used once or twice weekly (and should not be used with abrasive cleansers or you risk skin damage). Less is more with manual exfoliation. This brush is not as sturdy or fancy as the Clarisonic but the effect is the same. I would recommend this to anyone who is seeking manual exfoliation for the face but can&#x27;t pay $200 for a brush</li>
            <li> My wife wanted one of these as she washes her face every night before bed (hopefully like every female who wears make up..) she read these help clean up anything she may miss by hand. Apparently it works as described and loves this. Pretty sure she uses it every night.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on a lightning deal. Love it! I needed to replace my clairsonic that died. This product works just as well if not better and much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it has done anything but supposedly this is more effective than handwashing.  I was using an old electric toothbrush as recommended by a doctor and this is at least faster and gentler- whether that is a good thing or not, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I prefer a sturdier brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price. I highly recommend it compared to other higher priced cleansing brushes.</li>
            <li> it is a small tool,i dont know if it is useful.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with adult acne on my chin and my forehead for a few years now. Actually, ever since I went off birth control. I have tried everything from over the counter remedies, ProActive and prescriptions, topical and oral. While some of the remedies helped they always had a downside like bleaching my bed linens and towels to drying out my skin. I decided to give Olay Pro-X a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did. My face has not been clearer. My skin is so soft and fresh looking. My forehead is completely clear and my chin only gets the occasional blemish every once in a while. I&#x27;ve noticed my pores have shrunk and my blackheads have disappeared. I love this thing! I went ahead and purchased a large bottle of the same cleanser that comes with the brush. I used it twice a day for a couple weeks but now I just use it once a day. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase!!!</li>
            <li> broke after it fell in the shower once. thats what i get for being cheap... i ended up ordering a clarisonic and im very satisfied with that. You really do get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife as a Christmas present two years ago. She still occasionally tells me how much she has enjoyed having it. I&#x27;d say she loves it. It&#x27;s not often that I pick a winner for her.</li>
            <li> Works good if you feel you need get an extra clean for your face using either your own exfoliate wash or the one provided in the package, just be careful you might get a little extra drying on your face, so just make sure you have lotion for your face.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these for my 13 and 11 year-old granddaughters.  They are using them religiously and I am so please they have embraced good skin care habits at this young age!  The fact they are usable in the shower helps immeasurably.  Whatever it takes to get good habits inbedded as early as possibly, huh?</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  This is very low tech.  One very small brush head and I am not crazy&lt;br /&gt;for the way it feels and when it is in use it seems harsh.</li>
            <li> Been waiting for the price to come down.  Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> This product is great value for money!&lt;br /&gt;Imagine it does what a $200 or more system does in cleansing your face.&lt;br /&gt;My wife tried the product and found the feeling to be on par to those you get in a facial saloon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it myself and the blackheads on my nose are easily removed without me having to squeeze them out.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of purchasing one of the more expensive versions of the microderm cleansers, and after reading other reviews decided to start with this one because it was relatively inexpensive and supposedly similar in performance.  I am happy with it overall, but found I didn&#x27;t want to use it every day, and instead use it a couple times a week.  Since I am only using it half the time, I am really glad I did not pay a lot for it!</li>
            <li> Has been everything I hope</li>
            <li> Those who still want to give it a try need to ask the seller to open the batteries compartment. I never saw something so hard. That should be the easier thing to do but it is the harder for these maker.</li>
            <li> SORRY, I WAS HOPING FOR MORE ACTION!  THE BRISTLES ARE A LITTLE SOFT - HAVEN&#x27;T SEEN MUCH DIFFERENCE, YET!  IT RUNS SLOW -  I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED - BUT THIS DID NOT FILL THE BILL-----WISH IT WERE FASTER AND A LITTLE MORE FRISKY - THE BRISTLES, THAT IS.  RIGHT NOW, AN EXFOLIATER WORKS BETTER.</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect tool to gently cleanse skin. My son is 15 and battling facial acne (as did I when I was his age) and my wife had bought him one of those well known products you&#x27;ve seen on TV - I won&#x27;t mention the name because my intent is not to bash their product. But it didn&#x27;t seem to be helping him that much, and costing us a lot of $$$. When I read the product&#x27;s ingredients, there didn&#x27;t seem to be any magic to it - just the same sort of common sense stuff you&#x27;d buy at the drug store to combat acne. So I surmised that its effectiveness was probably related to the discipline it instills in the user to treat acne. Since it makes you go through multiple steps, you&#x27;re treating your acne with care. I figured I could replicate the same discipline by making sure my son did 2 simple things: a) clean his face properly twice a day, and b) apply acne cream every night before bed. So that&#x27;s where this purchase came in - with this tool and a simple salicylic acid-based soap (that can be bought anywhere for very little $$$) he cleans his face, neck, and forehead in the morning and at night. The bristles are soft, it doesn&#x27;t require a lot of pressure to cleanse thoroughly, and it&#x27;s battery powered - simple! It&#x27;s a great way to apply the acne soap. He loves it, and I have to say his face is looking really good. Of course acne never completely clears up until one gets past those teen years (at least from my experience), but his breakouts are much fewer and less severe. We liked this cleanser so much I bought one for my 12 year old daughter too. I don&#x27;t believe controlling common acne has to be complicated, and this tool is a good weapon to have in the arsenal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use makeup, but I do appreciate a good exfoliation.  This product seems to have two settings: ineffective and ouch.  Either it did not feel like it was doing anything at all, or it was painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that my problem skin may not be the best candidate for this product, which is why I&#x27;ve rated it 3 stars.  If it wasn&#x27;t meant to be used by people with sensitive skin, it should clearly have stated that.  I fall into the \\&quot;discontinue use\\&quot; category, sadly.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens for $25 :). It works fine with me but compared to the mia2 it looks like the mia2 would put in so much more work just from the look of the brushes, but as far as the speed they look like they go about the same or if so not much of a dramtic difference. This product makes my skin feel really clean and moisterized(considering that i have really dry skin). one thing that i did was once the cleanser that this comes with ran out, i bought the clarisonic Refreshing gel CLEANSER which is about $20 and used it with the olay pro x! and my skin feels alot cleaner and softer but tighter which can be a plus for some people but i felt like it dried out my skin a bit. so here&#x27;s an alternative for some who are willing to try: if you bought this product but are still wishing/wanting for an more expensive product such as the mia2 EVEN though i think they do the SAME thing, try different cleansers with this.</li>
            <li> this product is so worth every penny. I love washing my face now, it has never felt cleaner using any other cleansing method.</li>
            <li> Ive been looking for a cleansing brush for a while and although my face (more so my cheek area) can be a little sensitive at times, this brush irritated my cheeks and forehead horribly! I have used tons of exfoliates before and have owned the neutrogena brush and clean and clear ones, I have never had this happen. My face broke out in a rash, my cheeks are red, irritated and have tons of blisters (small little ones that are obviously due to irritation). I used with a limp hand and no longer than 10 seconds on each cheek. Its way to abrasive for sensitive or somewhat sensitive skin, and using with the cleanser sample it comes with, forget about it! I thought that maybe it was my usage of the brush  or maybe a product Ive been using so I stopped using everything and i gave it a couple days and tried again, same result. This time worse. I still didn&#x27;t learn my lesson and decided maybe i cant use it daily and put to the side for a week and let my face completely heal. I tried again with a gentle creamy cleanser, no luck. I look horrible! I had to put makeup over it just to walk out the house. I&#x27;m not saying everyone will experience what I have, but be careful if your skin is anything like mine. Save your money and invest in a good cleanser, a good exfoliate and give your face a steam bath every few days. Don&#x27;t risk it. Now I&#x27;m stuck with tomato face for the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the first battery powered facial cleanser I have used. It replaced a facial bristle brush I purchased from a dollar tree, and I have been thoroughly impressed with the difference. I use it with my Philosophy face wash in the shower, and it leaves a nice tightening feeling on my skin. The bristles are gentle on both speeds, but cleans deep enough to really exfoliate. The only complaint that I have is that it only has two speeds--high and low. I would prefer something with more variable speeds, but I am happy with what I got for my money. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for well over a month now and can&#x27;t rave enough about it! I have very oily, acne prone skin and have found this to be amazing at exfoliating and cleaning out my pores each day. I started out using it twice a day (morning and evening) with my own facial cleanser but it worked so well and exfoliated so throughly that it was irritating my skin. I backed off and only use it in the evening with a foaming cleanser and it is the perfect combo (I do not use the included Olay exfoliating scrub)! It makes my skin feel velvety soft, which is fantastic in the winter months as I do get a few dry spots on my cheeks. It has made putting on my makeup in the morning so much easier too as I have gotten rid of the dead skin the evening before and just lightly wash off the nights build up before applying my foundation. Amazon&#x27;s pricing was also $5 or so cheaper than in the store which was great. I looked into getting the more expensive versions, but glad that I bought this instead as it&#x27;s much more budget friendly! A must buy!</li>
            <li> In my country Clarisonic Mia cost around 250USD. So when I saw Olay Pro-X with such low orice I instantly grab it in Amazon. The first time using it, with low speed, it already made wonder. I use together with Cerave facial wash to avoid too much abrasive on my skins. The first time i used it, bubbles from my facial wash turned a slightly greyish I can even see small impurities, black dots and all. Showed that the brush did it jobs. The very second I put serum on my face after wash my face, serum sink to my face immediately!! That&#x27;s how good this device in cleaning your face. I use it everyday now but with mild facial cleanser. I have acne prone skins with combination skins. Oily t-zone, dry cheeks and chin &amp; cycystic acne on jawline. My acne scars greatly reduce along my jawline. Impressive!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I love the way it cleans my face. The facial cleanser that comes with it works amazing but it is really expensive. But overall really like this product.</li>
            <li> I love my brush so much! I use it a few times a week and it makes my skin feel so refreshed and its not being to rough!</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of using this brush system. My skin feels smooth and refreshed after a 30-second use. I&#x27;ve also noticed a reduction in blackheads! Remember to moisturize after you use it though -- exfoliating will always dry your skin up.</li>
            <li> I got this because it was a lot cheaper compared to the Clarisonic. But the brush was not as soft as I thought. It was little too rough for my skin. I used it twice and had skin trouble so I stopped using it. Maybe I&#x27;ll give it another try later  &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. May want to spend more money for more power. This runs off 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> The motor seems not that strong, however, it is very simple to use. Hopefully,  it can work beautifully on me.</li>
            <li> I am retired after owning Anti-Aging-Wellness Clinics for over 2 decades... I use this little brush and I did give the Clairsonic a try... what an over-rated waste of money!  I have also noted from reading other low star reviews herein that they have jobbers bashing this Olay Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product sold by a Non-Rip-Off Company!  [I have no interest in either company]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience was this... re Clairsonic... Poor design, too heavy and not shaped for comfortability in long term holding to cleanse ... battery only lasted 6 months dead - non-replaceable it and your spent money on it are in the TRASH!  -- Additionally the speeds/modes offered are not long enough it was totally &amp;#34;fluff &amp; stuff&amp;#34; for the short-time it lasted... the Clairsonic in my professional opinion is exemplary of the fact that ... &amp;#34;A fool &amp; their Money are Soon Parted.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use this every night and my skin is much clearer and breaks out so much less. This is worth the money and more. I love it.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully, my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> It was cheap.  I wanted the Clarisonic, but didn&#x27;t really have the cash to fork over for such a luxury. This is okay I guess.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my skin, but then again the only issue I have is dry skin...so not sure how this would help that anyways. As a side note, my 3 year old daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/09/13: I gave up on this brush a few weeks ago. It made no difference at all in my skin tone, complexion, etc. My 4 year old daughter still loves it though...she likes to get \\&quot;spa treatments\\&quot; from mommy.</li>
            <li> I wanted a gentle cleansing system that would still do the job. This one is perfect. It cleans but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; the skin. I use it with the Olay Sensitive Foaming Face Wash, which does a nice job. I had a little bit of trouble getting the batteries in, but persistence won and I figured it out. Otherwise super-easy to use.</li>
            <li> ...better than a washcloth by far. Makes my night time routine easier and my skin feels so much better. Get it. It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to buy this product, I have used it a few times now and I can really FEEL the difference in my face and i can SEE the makeup its getting off that my remover wipes &amp; liquids were not getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is going to be a great prodcut in the long run for my face!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim in hopes it might reduce the size of my pores and help make my face feel softer. So far, it&#x27;s done both. The exfoliating formula that comes with it helps it clean and doesn&#x27;t feel rough at all--and I even have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent device for the price compared to pricier types that do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine it might work nicely with a sugar scrub and Castile soap.</li>
            <li> I must say i was very exceptical about this product, i mean i got it for 19 dollars and it has more than 1,200 reviews rating like if it was just plain awsome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND IT IS! I only have about 3 days with the product and i can tell you it works, it cleans your face and it leaves it baby butt smooth hehehe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wont go like wow fast its powered by 2 AA batteries so you cant expect to spin to lets say 500 or 600 rpm. Its fast enough for most peoples faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included Pro-X Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser is good but not that great, you may wanna try your own products and see what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall i give it 5/5 stars in quality, performance, and even looks i recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and deal with acne, and after almost 3 weeks of using this amazing scrubber there is a visible difference in my skin tone, clarity, and texture. Both my breakouts and dry, flaky skin areas have reduced significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear makeup religiously--I know, so bad for acne prone skin- so I hated the tedious process of having to remove it all at the end of the day without the guarantee of leaving almost no makeup residue. I really feel like this cleansing brush helps clean off all makeup residue and it exfoliates in half the time it used to take me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my nightly regimen,  I first wash as much makeup off as I can with my hands using an organic tea tree oil bar soap, then I use the Cure Natural Aqua Gel to remove dead skin followed by another run through cleanse using the Olay Cleansing system, I put on my moisturizer and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I lather some tee tree oil soap onto my face and use the cleansing brush massage and to exfoliate my skin, then I follow by applying moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like more work than it actually is. This product is definitely worth giving a try as an alternative to the more expensive brushes on the market.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. Since puberty till now (age 25) I have tried tons of products for my oily/ combination/ acne-prone skin. This is by far the best thing I have every used on my skin. The results are comparable to professional skin treatments that I have paid $120 for. After several weeks my pores are smaller than they have ever been, overall, my skin is softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish that they made different sized brush heads so I could use it more efficiently on my body. This is well worth the price. I might buy more as gifts for my siblings.</li>
            <li> This is excellent!  I was going to purchase the Clarisonic, but couldn&#x27;t justifying the price.  I saw a clip on YouTube by Mattie Roberts and she expressed that this was a good choice as well as she has used both the Clarisonic and this item.  This is well worth the price.  I had an old Beauticontrol one and it didn&#x27;t work half as well as this.  I use my own cleanser or scrubbing grains and it works great for at home microdermabrasion type scrub for the skin.  Buy without hesitation.  The batteries are easy to get to and change despite other postings.</li>
            <li> I had been toying with the idea of getting a Clarisonic for quite some time, and thought I would give this a go, as a cheaper alternative. I was severely disappointed. It really had no effect whatsoever. I will stick to using a facewasher and warm water every day, much more effective. In the bin it goes!</li>
            <li> Cleaning my face very softly, like it so much. Can b use to remove makeup, good for lazy ppl like me</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I made it so long wthout one of these. Very nice. works great. Light weight.</li>
            <li> Really good for cleaning makeup and for the price which is really good. It doesn&#x27;t use much battery at all. I&#x27;m still using the original batteries after a few months. Normally use it once a day for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!!  I feel the deep cleaning, and my skin has definitely improved!! Very, very pleased with this product!!!</li>
            <li> I was on the search for a good cleansing brush, but didn&#x27;t feel like spending the $$$ for the most popular brand, Clairsonic. This fits the bill perfectly. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Love this product, inexpensive, does the job nicely, not to harsh. Two speeds and you can use in the shower every morning so you can easily wash the soap off your face. My skin wasn&#x27;t bad to start with but is really looking great. Excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> This is super gentle...too much so for me. I gave it to my young daughter to use and I&#x27;ll save up for a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get myself to commit to a clarisonic for the price.  This works okay and I have used it with some different products.  The thing I didn&#x27;t like about it: it tried to rip out a chunk of my hair!  Washing my face a lock of my hair got caught on the rotating mechanism and it didn&#x27;t stop turning!  I was able to turn it off, and have been extra careful ever since.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on sale, and I liked the thought of a spinning brush.  I already have a Clarisonic which I think works great, but still, being a women, I had to try this product also.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, due to its price, it really works well.  The only thing is the surface area of the brush is smaller then the Claisonic, but it definitely cleans my face very well, and I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can always leave one in the shower, and one by the jacuzzi, so I never forget to have a good cleansing product around.  I can recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; and thank you for reading my review.  :)</li>
            <li> It is an ok buy,just i was expecting a bigger brush ,my bad ,part ok for the price and functionally travel size</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, brush leaves skin feeling refreshed and included sample of the Olay cleanser is fragrance free and worked well.  I bought this over a Clairsonic just to see how I like using something like this.  Jury is still out on whether or not the Clairsonic is right for me or if this will just suffice as I&#x27;m still on the fence in spending the money on a Clairsonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery door design is extremely poor, very hard to remove door or even know how to do such the first time.  There are no grips or features on the handle that aid in removal.  Don&#x27;t bother trying to do this with wet hands, you have to pinch and pull away from the handle to remove the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No directions in box, which would have aided the above.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use, unless to install the battery. I think it&#x27;s useful and my face more clean now. If the brush is more soft, it would be better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny and light device and works very good, but I had some problems with dispatch and it took a month.</li>
            <li> This is great! Like many others I wanted the Mia but my wallet wasn&#x27;t having it. I heard about this on YouTube so I decided to check it out. I have never had a Mia but I don&#x27;t feel like i&#x27;m missing anything at all. This is an excellent facial cleansing tool.My face feels so fresh and clean afterward. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Would have given it av &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; if it came with instructions.</li>
            <li> My face still feels dirty!  The brush is too soft and doesn&#x27;t even clean.  I guess you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with severe acne breakouts as a result of hormonal problems for the past 3 years.  I have tried almost every brand of drugstore products out there and I am happy to report that this is the best $20 I have ever spent for my skin!  I use it with my regular cleanser and occasionally with the included exfoliating cleanser and my skin is clear!  I can immediately tell a difference after every time I use it (3-4 times/week).  My skin feels super soft and looks immediately brighter after each use, and I think the deep exfoliating is helping clear up my old acne scars.  I highly recommend this product for both young and old!!!  It came super fast and the Amazon price is at least $10 cheaper than buying in store.</li>
            <li> This cleaning system is a good deal. The brush is as powerful as the more expensive ones and gives a nice clean feeling. skin feels very nice after use.</li>
            <li> I love it, it leaves my skin very smooth and clean. You don&#x27;t have to use too many products, with this you have enough to have a beautiful skin</li>
            <li> Only spins one direction, and it uses the battery really fast. It does help clean my face and it feels really soft after but I&#x27;m disappointed that it only spins one direction and how fast I had to change the battery. (4 uses and it needed 2 new batts)</li>
            <li> it is good !&lt;br /&gt;I check the quality and it is working very well.&lt;br /&gt;it is cheap than other shop.</li>
            <li> I use this system twice a day and so far so good!</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this item for a while. I feel I am taking much better care of my aging skin now that I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> This product works well. I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Good for milia...It vanishes.</li>
            <li> It seems sturdy &amp; it works OK.  It just doesn&#x27;t have much power.  If you apply any pressure, the motor slows way down. I&#x27;m still using it, but unless the increase the &amp;#34;horsepower&amp;#34; I wouldn&#x27;t get another one when this one quits.</li>
            <li> I likd this...I used it in the shower, out of the shower...it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Pay more get more... this one is cheap and that is what you get... not so good.</li>
            <li> After about 2 months of using this, my wife&#x27;s skin is noticeable smoother and more radiant.  Easy to use, easy to clean and looks good when you have a bunch of stuff on the shelf or in your shower.  Easy to find replacements heads and works great.  came with batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting amazing results, but for what this is the quality and price seem very good.</li>
            <li> I had my eye on the Clarisonic. I admit it. Too many people with amazing skin were raving about it on YouTube. But I could not get over the price. There was no way I was paying $100 for anything to do with skincare. This being only $20, and having amazing reviews (especially being compared to Clarisonics) I thought, hey, at least give it a shot.  I was really beyond impressed with this brush. I use a CeraVe foaming cleanser, which I love and has greatly helped my leaning-towards-oily and acne-prone skin. But when I used it with this for the first time, I really was amazed how much smoother it made my skin. I feel so clean and soft after washing my face with this. My huge pores on my nose have definitely gotten smaller using this. Seriously, just buy it, it&#x27;s amazing.  Getting the batteries in was a pain, but I watched a video on how to do it and that made it easier.  Have had no problems with water, I rinse it off and bring it into the shower and everything, no problems, it still works.  Following up with my Thayer&#x27;s Rose Witch Hazel Toner and Yes to Grapefruit Daily Scrub, my skin has never been softer. I really don&#x27;t have bad skin days anymore, I&#x27;m going out every day without makeup. I love using this brush, it makes my skin soft and happy.</li>
            <li> Woeks well. I&#x27;ve had mine ofr at least 3 years and still going strong,just needed to change batteries once.</li>
            <li> My skin stared shining right after I have stared using it. The jell inside is too small but the machine is good.</li>
            <li> This works amazing. I had no idea it was going to be so professional. Will be buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li> This gets all the dirt and makeup out of my skin! After I use it I can see my pores are clear! And its completely waterproof, I use this in the shower all the time!</li>
            <li> Love it, I bought one for each my mom, sister, and me. Really cleans your skin. My sister had really bad acne problem and had tried everything before and this cleaned her skin so fast. Within the first use, you can see and feel the difference. I use it every day!</li>
            <li> As always  buying through Amazon I never have to be concerned if the product will be different then posted or have a problem with it. I have used this and really like it!!</li>
            <li> Works really well , gives a deep cleaning I love the way my face feels when I use it I love it.</li>
            <li> I have never been interested in taking care of my skin. But after I experienced this, I feel like I found all the seceret of the world for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know you could get rid of small blackheads easily like this one would do. what a good choice! New world!</li>
            <li> It works fine in the beginning. Make sure you keep it dry after every time your using it ,or it will stop working due to the circuit shortage from humidity.</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well! Great product for the money--just as good (if not better) than my $50 Mary Kay one!! Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend $150 on a spin brush!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little under a week and I&#x27;ve already seen a major different! It has already drastically changed the appearance and texture of my skin. It really forces the cleanser to get deep down into my pores and fight any acne/scars that I have and really make the acne either less noticeable/go away. Perfect product if you have cystic acne, mild acne, or a pimple here and there.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System works as advertised.  I do think it works better then just washing your face with a soft wash cloth.  I use this product to clean my face before I do my nightly routine.  There are several product that I began using last month.  (see other reviews)  Using all of them together has worked well to bring back some of the youthfulness to my face, chest and arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product twice from Amazon because I like it so much.  The first one broke after the fourth time I dropped it in the shower.  I assumed it stopped working because I dropped it so many times.  This time I found the perfect spot to store it in the shower so it would not drop.  I haven&#x27;t dropped it once, and it has stopped working already!  I tried brand new batteries so I know it is the product.  Their warranty sucks.  I wish I had bought it at  Target since cardholder there get six months to return products.  I really like this product, but it is no good to me if it keeps breaking.  I don&#x27;t want to go to the ridiculously expensive brand, but I&#x27;m not sure what else to do.</li>
            <li> fabulous love it  but it only came with 1 brush  another would have been better. would recommend everyone try it</li>
            <li> I expected a lot more, this weakly powered brush did nothing to improve my skin, I get better results using a Buf-Puf facial sponge.  Feel stupid for paying $22 and believing all those great reviews.  You get what you pay for, I heard the much more expensive Clairsonic is a much better product.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift and they loved it! At this great price why not try something that can help your skin to radiate! We all know Olay is a fantastic company, so save yourself a ton by purchasing it here instead of at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> great face product! ive been using it for 2 weeks and i have definitely noticed a change in texture. Winter reeks havoc on my skin and i usually dry  out on the sides of my face and cheeks, but this product prevents that as it buffs away all the dead skin. the cleanser it comes with is great too. price was great too!</li>
            <li> Awesome product for an awesome price.  My skin has been so soft since I started using it! Would definetely recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent for gently exfoliation, Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very fine and soft. I was expecting something sturdier or an another studier attachment because the beads in my cleansing lotion are &amp;#34;beadier&amp;#34; and get the job done of cleaning my pores. However, I reckon if I did use it twice daily, I might get better results.&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating lotion is pretty good though. leaves a clean feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> I like how the brush massages and deep cleans at the same time.  My face feels so smooth even around my nose area.</li>
            <li> works great!&lt;br /&gt;i love it!</li>
            <li> Not that crazy about this thing.  I don&#x27;t think it exfoliates enough for me.  And the motor doesn&#x27;t seem that strong.  I prefer my Japanese Nylon skin bath wash cloth/towel.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to get this because of the poor reviews I&#x27;ve read on these sorts of scrubber brushes (with the exception of te Clairsonic which is beyond what I can afford) but decided to give it a shot. I was worried when I turned it on and noticed the bristles were soft and there wasn&#x27;t much of a scrubbing action against my hand but hen I used it on my face I was pleasantly surprised! I used it on the highest of the two settings and loved the amount of exfoliation it gave me. Much better than using a washcloth! My skin was very smooth afterwards. I know it sounds silly but it&#x27;s fun to use to and I actually look forward to using it every night. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t fond of was the cleanser that was included in the box. It didn&#x27;t have much of an exfoliating power to it and it didn&#x27;t suds up that well. But all in all I love this little device. The only thing I plan to do it use a different cleanser once the little trial one runs out. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the full sized one - this can be used with any cleanser or soap.</li>
            <li> this brush come with 2 spinning speech; with the spinning it will help you to form a lot more bubble than usual which will save you on the usage of the cleansing form.  I love the cleaning feel of my skin after using it every day as i am getting less and less black heads on my tzone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i dont like is the roughness of the brush...other than that it is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I love that this works the same as a device that is hundreds of dollars more expensive. Leaves my skin feeling really clean. It comes with some face wash, but I ended up using my own that I already had. I haven&#x27;t purchased the scrubbing heads for this yet, but I&#x27;m sure they will be just as good as the brush head that comes with thism</li>
            <li> A good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li> It gets all of the make up off of my face and gets rid of the dry skin. It&#x27;s wonderful for how much I paid. I was seriously considering getting the Clairisonic and opted for this instead. I&#x27;m so glad I did. It is very gentle on my face. Easy to use once or twice a day depending on what you prefer. It was so great I bought one for my mom. It&#x27;s super water resistant. Also, I really don&#x27;t notice a difference between the 2 settings, maybe mine was defective?</li>
            <li> This brush is okay.. It definitely does not compare to the Clarisonic though. Sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t have very much power, probably because it is battery operated. I do leave it in the shower all the time, so it is waterproof. It does clean my face better than just my hands, but I prefer the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.  Thought it would have a little more power but I use it every night before bed and then put my cream on.</li>
            <li> I have been hearing all about these brushes. I did some research and finally decided to purchase this one. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I have oily acne prone skin and have noticed a big difference just in the past 5 days. YOU MUST buy this product its amazing!</li>
            <li> I really like this system.. I really wanted the clarisonic SO BAD but it&#x27;s so expensive so I bought this one. It works really good except that I wish the brushes are bit wider or bigger. I hope they will also come up with a newer version that works for the body with stronger spin. I will definitely buy one. But this product cleanses you face really well and makes the face feels smooth and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on getting this but if really seems to make my face feel so much more clean. It is so easy to use and clean too. I would recommend this system.</li>
            <li> This is a great product especially for the money. I use the Olay Pro-X in the shower 2-3 times weekly with my usual benzoyl peroxide cleanser. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and does a great job of exfoliating my skin, especially the dryness around my eyebrows I tend to get in the winter. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing system from olay.  It makes my skin feel real soft and clean,  It&#x27;s well worth the money, I would have even paid more for it.  Because it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I first found something very similar on Sephora website, the price there for a similar product was around $200. Not knowing if i&#x27;d like it, I was not committing to making a purchase. Boy am I glad i found this product instead. I tried Olay Prox yesterday for the first time. Amazing results. My skin is exfoliated, soft, not dry, and is glowing in the morning. The device seems very simple but it serves the purpose. And did I mention that I paid only the fraction of the price they charge on Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;The sample cleansing cream that is included in the package is also great.</li>
            <li> my wife is very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try a motorized facial brush for a while so I purchased this figuring if I didn&#x27;t like it I would only be out a few bucks,  all I can say is I get better results by scrubbing with a baby washcloth &amp; soap.  This product is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good product! You can tell the difference in your skin after the first use whatever age.&lt;br /&gt;I am elderly and it helps my skin to stay clear and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price.  It is kind of cheaply made though. Battery is a pain to change. It lightly scrubs the skin.</li>
            <li> Couldnt afford a clairosonic saw this on youtube and it got great reviews decided to try it and its good:) i likey</li>
            <li> This did not seem to make any difference in my skin. I used it for about three months and did not see any changes</li>
            <li> I gave it to my sister and she&#x27;s in love with it. Says it leaves her skin feeling amazing. I&#x27;m glad I was a cheapskate and didn&#x27;t go to Macy&#x27;s for this!</li>
            <li> This brush I like. I must confess I expected it to be bigger but not problem with that. The bristles are very soft. I can use it in the shower, it is waterproof. Includes a small exfoliating product Olay did not know him but i liked it, very soft leaves my face. The only bad thing I could say is that i think should be a cap on the bristles to avoid contact with the bacteria in the environment, why not give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and started to notice dryness in my skin around 28 years old. I knew I had to get serious and wash my face morning and night then apply my skin care regimens. The worse part was the washing, because it was messy and a lot of work. I was considering purchasing the Clarisonic but I found out it was not a rotating brush, it is a pulsating brush. So, I went to the two larger chain stores and saw the Olay ProX selling for $29.00 - $39.00. I went online, did my research and found that the Olay ProX has a rotating brush (Awesome) and some Youtube reviews even say they prefer the Olay over the Clarisonic (WOW)! So, I ordered the Olay ProX from Amazon, received it in less then a week and I love it! I had dry patches around my nose and chin that got red and irritated after I washed my face which wouldn&#x27;t calm down until after an hour. The first time I used the ProX on my face, there was hardly any redness or irritation on my nose or chin. It actually made the dry patches and redness clearer and after the second use, I literally have no more dry patches! I truly believe better skin starts with the way you clean your skin. The ProX is amazing! It&#x27;s so easy to clean my skin now and I love seeing the results! I ordered two more as gifts from a different website and got a unbeatable deal for the Olay Professionals Holiday set. It pays to do your shopping online sometimes!</li>
            <li> We have 2 of these things and they do work well and are easy to use. They have not cleared anyones acne or eliminated blackheads completey but if used daily will reduce both. The best thing about this is the gentle brush tool which leaves your skin feeling very clean. We use it with other soaps and cleaners and have had good results.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. The first time I ever bought a product of this nature. I have been using it everyday since Dec 26, 2014 and it&#x27;s now Feb 5, 2015. I love the feel of how soft my skin is after using the product. You do need to use a moisturizer with an SPF in it to protect your skin from harmful UV rays. I don&#x27;t have blackheads, but I had pores that were noticeable to me when putting on my facial moisturizer in the morning. My pores are nice and clean now and have decreased in size by a large %. I love this product and how wonderful it makes me feel about my face. I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> this is absolutely waste of money.  Dermabration is still a better way to clean the skin.  Olay seems need to improve their product.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my daughter and she loves it. She uses it everyday and her complextion is getting much better.</li>
            <li> great brush deep cleans</li>
            <li> I keep this in the shower and use it every morning!  Easy, quick and my combination skin is noticeably better (thanks to this tool and the Pro X Acne Protocol) !  I wish I could say I never have break outs, but its far less than previously!  I use both the cleansing exfoliation cream that was included with the brush system as well as the Olay Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol cleansing cream and acne cream.</li>
            <li> got this for my little grandaughter and she loves it!! perfect for her experience with acne problems, a new venture for her, only being 11 yrs. old....</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my face feel!  My only critique would be the design of it...A FLAT bottom would have made it great-Just so it could be stood up!  Would def recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Great Christmas gift and keep your pores clean</li>
            <li> Bristles were too soft for me, very little exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to one of these on a cruise and have .sing it since.  Weekly exfoliations are wonderful for the skin.</li>
            <li> Its good, you can see difference in your skin after  using this....but it should come with extra brush...coz if you use this daily, you will need to change its brush soon..</li>
            <li> Finally! something is clearing up my mild acne! And its makes your skin feel soft. I use it every night.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 3 days now and I already find it to be a wonderful addition to my cleansing routine. I use it at night and with Olay cleansers (varied from the line) and I do feel my pores are smaller and the absorption of my skin moisturizers and Retin-A that I use are greater and therefore creating better results with skin texture and tone. I am prone to break-outs, but feel that they have been significantly decreasing since using this product with my routine. Great deal for a much lower price than the &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; and price product! I noticed the difference in my skin right away, I have a really bad habit of not completely removing all of my eye makeup before falling asleep but after I got it in the mail and tried it out the first day...OMG. I was in awe with how much makeup and impurities were off of my face after having used it for about 3 minutes (1 minute on each side of my face). I was planning on purchasing the Clarisonic Mia all along until I heard people comparing it to the Mia. I wondered how could such a product so different in price range possibly compare to the Clarisonic and after reading a couple reviews and watching Youtube videos, I was convinced. I mean $30 instead of paying almost $150 for something almost the same?  What did I have to lose? Like I said I tried it the night I got it in the mail and after using it for the first time I could definitely notice the difference in my skin. The tightness, the clean/fresh feeling, and the moisture was in my skin. I noticed that even for it&#x27;s soft bristles compared to the Clarisonic it still does a really great job at exfoliating. If any of you are trying to get better looking, healthier skin this year like I am...I say go get this right now and give it a try. It lived up to its hype and I am truly content with it and the fact that I didn&#x27;t have to go out and spend $150 is even better. All in all this is going to be a staple in my skin care routine from this day forward. I LOVE IT. Thank you Olay. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be brief and to the point.  After using this piece of garbage once, my face felt as if my skin was torn off.  It had angry red patches all over, the texture was not improved, it felt as if I had a sunburn and literally touching my skin was uncomfortable.  I bathed my skin wiht a thick coat of aloe vera to calm it down, went to Walgreens to bring the product back, with a side trip to the health clinic to see if they could give me something else to calm my skin down. DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN!</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this but do find that if I use it daily (as recommended) that I break out with big under the skin pimples in places that I never used to get them. However that being said, I have also noticed that the appearance of blackheads has really deminished quite drastically and the texture of my skin (normally very dry) has improved a great deal.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife. she loves it. Really helping her skin. The tube of stuff that came with it needs to have more in it.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I decided to get the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System instead of the Clarisonic because it was waaaay cheaper and affordable. The brush has very soft bristles for my sensitive skin and it has two speeds which i could alternate. I liked how it oscillates in circles so you feel as if you&#x27;re washing or scrubbing all the dirt off your face rather than moving the Clarisonic&#x27;s &amp;#34;sonic vibration&amp;#34; across my face. The Clarisonic is definitely more powerful and has a bigger brush head the olays. For me, it really depends on what your skin type is and what you prefer. I definitely recommend using your own face wash because everyone has different skin types. However, it does come with its own olay product.</li>
            <li> This product works no better than merely using a pair of facial-scrub gloves at a fraction of the cost.  The battery compartment is ridiculously difficult to open so I just left the batteries in place, something I do not like to do!  There should be something to put the brush head inside of when not in use so it stays clean/sterile?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in Olay for this product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something that would have a little more kick to it, like other reviewers said this has more of a massaging effect as opposed to sort of a scrubbing effect like i hoped for, it&#x27;s still a good product and not a bad facial product if you have sensitive skin. Just not quite what i was looking for. And you can use it for your body but again it&#x27;s going to massage more than scrub so not the most effective but does get the job done. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I love the Olay line, it&#x27;s affordable and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great gift, or treat for yourself!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use!  I have very dry, flakey skin in my T-Zone in the winter and am recently dealing with adult acne.  I bought this to help exfoliate my skin rather than using creams that are too harsh.  My skin is very sensitive too and easily irritated.  I didn&#x27;t think it would do the job because the bristles are so soft but it worked great!  It came with an exfoliating cleanser that so far has not bothered my skin.  It removed all traces of my make-up and gave my skin a nice glow when I was done.  No more flakes! My skin felt almost the same as it does after a professional facial and just for $20.  Love this!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!! It&#x27;s great.  My face looks renewed, smoother, younger and feels softer.  I would buy it again. :)</li>
            <li> Had a number of these over the years.  Not best and not worst.  Not bad for money.  When used regularly,  definitively&lt;br /&gt;improves skin appearance.</li>
            <li> Cleanser well. Leaves skin feeling fresh, clean and beautiful. A cheaper alternative for the clarisonic, works just as well. For sensitive skin just use it on the lower speed.</li>
            <li> Hello, I wrote a review re the brushes and not the Pro-X.&lt;br /&gt;Nutshell:&lt;br /&gt;1 easy to hold and cleans efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;2 Two speeds adequate.&lt;br /&gt;3 Like that it is smaller than most chargeable facial brushes.&lt;br /&gt;4 Will be easy to take on trip.  Not heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Yes, the delivery and packaging was as expected. The cleansing system works great for me and the price was right. Compare to other P &amp; G were the cheapest. I would recommend this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> For 18 or so dollars with the coupon clip at checkout this was a steal. I tried it for the first time today and it left my face feeling so soft. It came with batteries and an exfoliate but the bottle is pretty small so use it sparingly. Get this, you won&#x27;t regret it! The bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve never had a Clairsonic so I can&#x27;t compare, but I do love the way the ProX makes my face feel after using. It does a good job of taking all of my makeup off and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave it red afterwards.</li>
            <li> Like the appliance. The price was awesome. Was a bit disappointed in the size of the tube of cleanser. A really good value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product &amp; it works fine, but it&#x27;s  just not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> It works .  I also use the night firming cream and in the morning use cleanser. All three together are great</li>
            <li> This device is great. I have always struggled with acne and have found very few products that help. I&#x27;ve been using philosophy face wash, that along with this brush leaves my face feeling so nice and clean.</li>
            <li> What I really wanted was a Clarisonic, but can&#x27;t afford it. So when I saw this was on sale, I went for it. Good thing Amazon let me return it even though I used it and had thrown away the packaging. I tried it 3 times and each time, my face hurt. And I do all sorts of crazy things to my skin with no problems (peels, scrubs, treatments),so I was surprised my skin felt raw. I was expecting it to feel good. Its not very powerful. I own a SonicCare toothbrush, and I  thought the technology would be similar, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it. I even tried fresh batteries and it was still weak. It didn&#x27;t spin very fast, well at least not as fast as I thought it would. This caused a lot of &#x27;drag&#x27; on my skin. MAYBE I got a bad unit, but still, it shouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I purchased theProX cleaning system, because I wanted to improve my complexion but didn&#x27;t want to spend north of $150... Within two weeks of using this -- my complexion was much smoother and my pores smaller. I&#x27;m even getting compliments from friends! I really love this little tool and would highly recommend over the more costly brand names.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - clear face - soft face- work with AA battery- It is highly recommended in low price - but mia 2 is the best but it costs 150$</li>
            <li> Similar items sell for hundreds of dollars!  No way I&#x27;m paying that kind of money when this works just fine.  Leaves my face feeling clean.  Can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday. My skin looks awesome.</li>
            <li> The concept is there and the price is there but if you have acne prone skin probably not the best consider you are reusing the same brush. Felt great on the skin, soft but my skin broke out and that&#x27;s even with cleaning the brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent product  I would buy it again, and recommend it to anyone looking for  Cleansing System</li>
            <li> For a Fraction of the cost of the alternative brand I think the pro x is the best! My face looks and feels great after only using it a few days.</li>
            <li> This battery-operated, wasteful device doesn&#x27;t do anything special. In fact, it&#x27;s less gentle than an ordinary washcloth -- which also happens to be a lot less expensive and more effective. Alas, the bristles became misshapen quickly too. Nor was my face transformed; my pores weren&#x27;t buffed away miraculously. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> The motor on the device is too weak. No matter what batteries you put in it, it still operates poorly. The actual facewash isn&#x27;t too bad though. Still, I dont think it was worth it. I figured being an Olay Branded product, it would have worked out better.</li>
            <li> I got this on Amazon for $19.99 and later saw the same brush at Target for $49.99. It makes your skin feel super soft, minimizes pores and leaves you with a really clean feeling face. I&#x27;m 25 and didn&#x27;t have an acne problem until last year. I eat healthy and wash my face and medicate over the counter but still have had problems. This brush has helped so much. The only reason it got four stars instead of five is because I wish the brush had a bigger head. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem a bit too soft &amp; could use a bit more power</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for a long time but never got around to buying one till now. I love it and wish I had bought it sooner. It is gentle on the face and not abrasive. It cleans and my skin looks healthier then ever. Even comes with a small sample of the Pro X product even though I bought a different cleaner to use with it.  It actually massages your skin on your face. It felt so good after a long day of work. Everyone is commenting on how good my skin looks. May be a little more money then other products like it. But this works great and is well worth every penny. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the others use the brand that is trusted. My mom even bought one and loves it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> The Olay ProX makes my skin feel so much cleaner and smoother than regular washing.  It makes my skin glow and I have have healthier, better looking skin.</li>
            <li> After doing a lot of research I decided to purchase the Olay a cleaning system.  I can&#x27;t tell you what a difference it&#x27;s made in my skin.  My pours are smaller and my skin has such a better clarity!  I switched to the Total Effects Moisterizer too.  All these changes have made my skin look and feel at least 15 years younger!  I get so many compliments on how fresh and luminous my skin looks....at 57 I&#x27;ll take those compliments with a big smile!</li>
            <li> I bought it because of my acne and it hasn&#x27;t helped too much with that in the month that I have had it but it cleans off my make up. I use it with different facial cleansers and it leaves my skin very clean and soft but hasn&#x27;t helped with acne too much yet.</li>
            <li> The two speeds are enough. The faster speed may be two harsh on the face but is ok on the body. The brush is gentle and cleans very well. My skin feels smother an softer after each use. The cleanser that came with the system is a trail size and I was expecting a full size.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my, cause breakouts after use. If you have acne skin, don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> This Olay ProX does a great job. I have a dry mature completion so I don&#x27;t use it too often but when I do, it leaves my face nice and clean. I wish I could use it more often because I believe the moisturizers I use are better absorbed after using it. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product works a lot better than I expected! It really is great as a makeup remover and exfoliator. The buttons seem touchy at times, I have to hit it more than once for it to turn on or change speeds. Wonderful inexpensive addition to the beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this product and already love it. I washed my face like I normally do and then I used this on what I thought was my clean face and immediately saw the difference on the pad- DIRT! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I love how soft my face feels and love that I can use it inside the shower. Great purchase for me!!</li>
            <li> Now here&#x27;s a product I passed right over for a long time because I could not imagine scrubbing my sensitive skin with anything - until someone with skin like mine, and who looked wonderful, told me to try it. I did. At first it did nothing and then about 10 days later, I began to have seriously improved skin texture, color, smoothness and even color. My skin no longer &amp;#34;grabbed&amp;#34; foundation or blush. The few small red areas and breakouts that I had attributed to hormonal changes disappeared and have never returned. The small lines seemed to fade (not altogether, as nothing does that). It developed a glow I hadn&#x27;t seen in years. It felt good.  I am such a fan!  There is another product that costs $200 that does the same. I use it with the Pro X scrub and consider that essential. The entire Pro X line is hypoallergenic and I have super sensitive skin and it has never bothered my skin, so that&#x27;s good to know.  Neither is the amount of scrubbing too much for my very sensitive skin and in fact, it really does not scrub so much as just gently clean.  If it abraded or was harsh I would have been a rashy mess and it didn&#x27;t do that to me, even from the first use.  I use it twice daily. In morning only short time and lightly with just a dab or Pro X cleanser, and at night I use makeup remover and then give my skin a thorough scrub with the Pro X cleanser.  Morning and night, follow immediately with Olay Regenerist serum no fragrance and Regenerist no fragrance lines. Also good to know that you can use it under running water, so I got two, one for shower and one for sink. Uses two AA batteries.  Heads are replaceable. My daughter in her 20s tried it and now all her friends are using it. This product does precisely as advertised. I am 64.  This product is a wonderful addition to skin care for anyone. Teens will find it good for cleaning acne prone skin. Anyone who wants clean skin will benefit, men and women both. As one ages, exfoliation helps improve skin appearance and this little mild gentle scrubber, used daily, will do that perfectly.this little mild gentle scrubber, used daily, will do that perfectly.</li>
            <li> I got this for the electric brush and tossed the cream stuff. I use only natural products so I never tried that part. No issue with seller or shipping ;-)</li>
            <li> Just as good as Clarisonic without the high price!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t run this over your acne and that could make worse.&lt;br /&gt;Run over your normal skin everyday so it removes dead skin and don&#x27;t let acne to form.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it everyday morning and I didn&#x27;t get back any acne at all.</li>
            <li> made me break out. my skin is not very sensitive but this product did the opposite of why I got it. It just sits there now for guests to use.</li>
            <li> I was undecided between this product and the clarasonic but chose this one for the price and thought if I use it a lot or really like it I&#x27;ll try the clarasonic. I really love this product. I use it in the shower and have had no problems with it. I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve gone so long without this!</li>
            <li> So glad I got this. I must admit I&#x27;ve not really cared properly for my 58 year old face and I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but this device is so easy and enjoyable to use, I look forward to using it and think I really notice a brighter, smoother complexion. To those who say their face broke out using it, I too, got a big pimple after the 2nd use but I look at this positively; that the dirt can finally get out after good cleansing/exfoliation. One minor warning: keep your hair well controlled and away from your face!!! I got 2 little knots near my ears from where the brush must have picked up a few strands! No biggie, tho. Buy this and feel better about yourself!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush about once a week for the last month, and I&#x27;m loving it!  I, of course, originally considered getting a Clarisonic, but they are quite expensive.  At $20, I thought this would be a good way to try out these sort of brushes without sinking a lot of cash at once.  After using it, I find that my face feels very clean and soft, even to the point that I&#x27;m not always sure if I have cleaned all my cleanser off!  It&#x27;s quite gentle as I use it on my face.  Overall, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  I just couldn&#x27;t see spending a $100 on the Clarisonic.  I&#x27;d heard good thing about the Olay ProX brush &amp; am happy I took a chance.  The exfoliation level is perfect.  The only caution I would give is that the exfoiliating cleanser that came with it irritated my face.  When I used my regular cleanser from Mario Badescu, everything went back to normal.</li>
            <li> I wish I could love this product based on all the positive reviews, but this did nothing positive for my face. I have combination skin, so I have an oily t-zone, and dry and sensitive cheeks. I experience breakouts on my t-zone when I use this, and the bristles are pretty harsh imho. I understand that a harsh exfoliator on skin that is prone to breaking out is not a good idea. I tried to continue using it because I thought that the &amp;#34;toxins&amp;#34; under my skin might finally be breaking free, but I couldn&#x27;t continue using it because it never improved my complexion.</li>
            <li> Works great, better than most.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery thanks!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Of all of the beauty products that I have tried in the last ten years, this one is the very best.&lt;br /&gt;This little brush truly makes a difference. The price is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> What I wanted face wash is small though</li>
            <li> Considering the price it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li> Great buy as compared to the Clarisonic stuff. I like it!</li>
            <li> Cleans better than washing with your hands.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this, my skin looked so nice n clean with only one use, got rid of oil n dirt so well</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my teenage daughter.  She has wanted a cleansing system for a long time but the price of some of these can be a bit much.  We settled on the Olay Pro-X...the price was reasonable and the cleanser is easy to replace.  She reports that is gentle on her skin (a plus due to her age) and very easy to use.  She uses it only periodically (maybe 1-2x/week) and the cleanser has lasted quite a while.  She loves makeup and reports that her primer and foundation go on much smoother after cleansing.  After several months of use, the bristles are still in good shape.  Happy with this purchase...may even buy one for myself!</li>
            <li> Have used it for two weeks, seems it really works.</li>
            <li> The number one factor that influenced my buy was the price and that Revlon is a reputable brand. I purchased this a few years ago before it became wildly popular and I still use Pro-X to this day. A quick google search shows the many awards this product has received and the hundreds of reviews attest to its quality. You will see results with regular use, guaranteed!</li>
            <li> An OK cleansing device . Too soft for my taste . Wish it had more power.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good value for your money compared with other similar systems (ie. Clarisonic), granted I have never owned one of those. This gets the job done and I feel like it is cleaning my face much better than just using a facewash. My only complaint is that you have to have it on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; to feel like you are getting a result. Definitely don&#x27;t expect a ton of power. This is a great beginner system though for someone like me just getting into a skincare regime.</li>
            <li> This thing is AWESOME-SAUCE! I love love love love how it feels when it&#x27;s scrubbing my skin! Great product and not super expensive like the other brands! Perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Love this!!! I was able to see the difference immediately!!!</li>
            <li> I like it alot and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love a great clean face this will help you get it</li>
            <li> LOVE this! I was somewhat hesitant because I wanted the Clairisonic, but I am very pleased with this purchase. My skin feels so soft after using it.</li>
            <li> This made me smile. It is light and easy to pack for travel and really cleans my face without making it dry or tight. I have told a few of my friends about it already. I like how simple it is. VERY HAPPY.</li>
            <li> The trial sized tube of cleanser didn&#x27;t last me very long, but I was able to use it very sparingly and the results were wonderful. This little thing makes my skin feel so smooth &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> The obvious comparison of this device is to the Clarisonic type cleanser. I would analogize this to toothbrushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay : Clarisonic :: spinning toothbrush : Sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, the Olay is simply a two speed spinning brush head. The Clarisonic gives you that micro vibration buzz. The same thing with toothbrushes. The cheaper toothbrushes with a spinning brush head versus a Sonicare toothbrush that gives you that micro vibrating action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your needs, choose accordingly.</li>
            <li> i could not see the deference hand scrubing and this scrubure.</li>
            <li> Nice little face scrubber, except the sponges are really soft.  So, if not using a facial scruff with beads.. I don&#x27;t know how well it would do?  But, for the price couldn&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Works. Buy extra heads at the same time.</li>
            <li> it is perfect for my skin. I feel my skin is cleaner after using this. This is nice</li>
            <li> Love this brush. This is the third one I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> This does an amazing job of cleaning my face for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin. No improvements or changes and I&#x27;ve been using it for 9 months, changing the brush as instructed and using a salicylic acid fash wash. I&#x27;m surprised it didn&#x27;t work due to all the hype but maybe it&#x27;ll work for some and not others. I have clogged pores not acne but saw no improvements. Oh well, the positive is I enjoy using it and it feels nice on my skin, like a massage.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. The only reason I give it four stars is because it could be stronger, but for the price its great! The only issue I have had is not paying attention and getting lots of form that runs into my eyes... But that&#x27;s my fault haha</li>
            <li> I like the machine but i dont like the cream they gave to me. It wasnt work very good .</li>
            <li> Great price, works very well.</li>
            <li> I had it for a week and I think a little water got into it and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Really made a difference and cleared up my acne prone skin. you can barely tell I ever had a problem- helped get rid of some of my scarring. my skin literally glows</li>
            <li> I like it but fell once in the shower and broke !</li>
            <li> This system is so easy to use and feels so good while doing it and after, one&#x27;s face feels refreshed and so clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost twenty, with combination skin, mild-to-moderate acne, keratosis pilaris and eczema. When I was looking at automated scrubbers, I was debating between the ProX and the Clarisonic, which has multiple attachments. Decided to get the ProX, have had it for months, use it regularly. It&#x27;s good at removing the oil and dirt before it becomes blackheads, the exfoliation is alright, but not as great as a teen needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush speed is not spectacular. It goes from slow to even slower. I thought, at first, that I needed to replace the batteries. No, the motor is just designed to be slow. Plus, it&#x27;s not strong enough to scrub shoulders. So it works well enough on the face, but it could definitely be better.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush about 2 weeks ago, I don&#x27;t use it daily maybe every other day.  My husband said my skin was looking fantastic.  He asked what I was using because he wanted to try it too &#x3D;).  My skin looks radiant....I&#x27;m in love with this brush....You gotta try this.....amazing product!</li>
            <li> This product works great. It is so affordable and works better than the more expensive cleansing systems that are advertised.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend. She loves it. When I opened it, the build quality seems pretty good. This is a great priced item and she uses it whenever she has time.</li>
            <li> The brush makes my skin feel so smooth and soft I love it!  The first time i used it I hadn&#x27;t put make up on for days and when I got the brush away from my face it was gunky and dirty looking.  I was shocked because i exfoliate my face every other day.  As soon as I dried off I noticed how much brighter my skin was.  I have had this brush for about a month and it&#x27;s still going pretty well.</li>
            <li> does all that the expensive ones do-- but very affordable. I love Olay products because they work. My skin feels great.  when this one wears out I will definitely get another one.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Really made a difference in my skin the first time I used it. Skin felt different. Like I gave it a rejunenating experience. would highly recommend getting one</li>
            <li> BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE. I HAVE MINOR BREAK OUTS AND BLACKHEADS GLORY. I MUST SAY THIS IS A MIRCLE MACHINE. IT WORKS WONDERS! AND CLEANS SO GOOD. I AM ADDICTED TO CLEANING MY FACE NOW. I LOVE HOW IT SRUBS. AND I LOVE HOW THE EXTRA SOAP SAYS IN MY SKIN BECAUSE I PRESS SO HARD. IT PREVENTS BREAKOUTS. SO MUCH  WITH THE SYLIC ACID IN MY SKIN.. :) IT CLEANS LIKE A DREAM AND HAS GOT RID OF SO MUCH BULID UP OF BLACKHEADS AND CLOGED PORES! I LOVE THIS!! SO MUCH</li>
            <li> I just love my Olay Pro-x Advanced Cleansing System.. I decided to look at it first when I saw an aging segment on Good Morning America, about buying a cleansing system to moisturize your face to keep you looking young. They said you don&#x27;t have to spend hundreds of dollars to do it either. They actually used this model for the example. After you cleanse your face, they also said you could use items right in your kitchen to keep your skin soft &amp; moist, such as olive oil, coconut oil. So when I got this I use the cleanser that comes with this product cleaned my face it felt so fresh &amp; clean got all my daily makeup off. Then I went to the cubbard &amp; got out the extra virgin olive oil put a dab on my finger &amp; rubbed it all over my face, rubbed it in good &amp;#34;they were right&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not greasy at all, thought I would smell like salad dressing but not at all, just made my face feel so soft &amp; smooth!! So now that is my new regiment... So Thanks to Good Morning America &amp; Olay Pro-X Advanced  Cleansing System I now have nice soft skin that helps slow down the aging process &amp; all at a reasonable cost!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this forever (about a year) and it still works good. No problems with the water seal yet. It is aging but still in very good condition.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!! My face feels so fresh and clean after using it. Since I began using this brush I&#x27;ve notice my skin is smoother and my pores (which have always been large, no matter what I do) are smaller. It&#x27;s pretty much waterproof so I can bring it into the shower with me during my morning routine. It cleans my face better, so I am less oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love it !  This works great. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Why spend $99 or more?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for a couple of days now and my skin is much softer. I don&#x27;t use the cleanser that comes with the brush so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but using the brush in conjunction with my regular routine has left my skin much smoother than it ever was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels incredibly clean after I use this for one week. I&#x27;m not too sure if my face is much clearer than before, I&#x27;ve always had mild to moderate acne, and it still is, maaaayybbeee more mild, but I can&#x27;t be sure. However, I really enjoy how clean my face feels, so I&#x27;ll keep using it until I know otherwise. I have noticed that it kills my spray tan. But I&#x27;ll trade an acne free face for a tan face any day.</li>
            <li> Like others, I was unwilling to pay $200+ for other versions of a face cleanser. I find this product to work well, though I have nothing to compare it to...I have normal to oily skin with the occasional breakout. When I bought this I was in desperate need of exfoliation and it worked very well within two days of just using it in the shower in the morning. When I use it consistently with a mild face wash or the exfoliating gel that comes with it, my face stays clear and free of blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery plate is not that hard to remove. I read all kinds of reviews warning that it would be nearly impossible to get the batteries in and out, but it was very simple and I got the plate off with one try. Not sure if they have improved the product, or if it was just good luck.</li>
            <li> I had extremely flaky skin, no matter what kind of soap i used, nothing helped. I have paired this scrubber with my regular face wash (the scrub soap it comes with is a little rough to be using in conjunction with the scrubber for me) and a night cream and my flaky issues are solved! been using it for 2 weeks and no difference in the battery power yet.</li>
            <li> LOVE this cleansimg system! It&#x27;s not too soft or too tough. Just right. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. It cleans my skin thoroughly.  I noticed improvement on my skin immediately after the first use! You can pair it with any cleanser.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a couple of days but it seriously feels like a massage for your face! :) I love it.</li>
            <li> This cleansing system is awesome. People who compliment me on my complexion and I tell them I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay products for years. I am 51 and people say, &amp;#34;No way.&amp;#34; I thank my mom, too, but a big THANK YOU to Olay for your products</li>
            <li> The products works well and it was easy to replace batteries after reading the instructions in amazon. As I use primer, foundation and loose powder, even with cleaning oil and gel cleanser some residue is left but not after using pro x</li>
            <li> Hacked my boyfriend account just to post that review,that was one the best and the best gift he gave me and he did it totally different instead of chocolate on valentine he bought something that I always wanted to have to clean my pores(the cleanser 👏👌) .I recommend this Olay product to anybody it&#x27;s good it will leave your face smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> I really love this system. I do not have anything to compare it to but would never spend anymore than what I did for this so with that said I do feel like my skin had a nice glow and my skin feels softer. I gave one to my mom for Christmas and she really likes it also.</li>
            <li> I like this product so very much, it cleanses my face so awesome!! My face looks clearer, you can tell by my pours!! I highly recommend this product!! It works great!! And makes you feel cleaner in your face!! I use my cuticura acne soap with it and I love it!! Thank you, because washing my face with my hands wasn&#x27;t cutting it, I was leaving a lot of makeup and dirt stuck in my pours!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 days now.  I already see an improvement in my skin smoothness, softness and my pores are a lot smaller.</li>
            <li> Very effective and quiet. Can use with any product, but I use the Olay facial cleansers and get great results!</li>
            <li> I used it to clean my face twice a day for about a week. It really works for me and makes my skin softer than before. And acnes on face are less than before. I really like it.</li>
            <li> It feels good, though I have not honestly seen a difference in my skin.  I note the makeup on the head so I feel like it&#x27;s working.  Researched this product against clarisonic and felt that this was a better buy for the benefit.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use every day. Makes my face feel amazing. I am 21, and this little brush reminds me to wash my face (even at 3am). I clean to brush once a week with dish soap and vinegar. If you need a sub for clarisonic, this is it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel anything after I used it. Then I stopped. I just threw another $20 away, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Seems perfect... fast shipper....</li>
            <li> I have to say this is a great buy!  As I use this I can feel my skin rejuvenating with each circular motion!  I had my husband feel my face after using it for a few days and his reaction was sheer amazement.  My skin has not felt so soft since I was a young girl!  A must have!!</li>
            <li> Maybe the company has been listening to the complaints on the other reviews because it now says on the side of the box when they recommend changing the brush head and there were also instructions on accessing the batteries. I think it works great for the money.</li>
            <li> My skin type is all over the place, dry and flaky in certain areas, oily in others. Occasional breakouts. I was never happy with how my skin looked with just a washcloth. I was worried this might be too harsh but nothing could be further from the truth. My skin has just been so much better since starting to use this and the olay cleanser with it. I&#x27;m never going back.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with large pores.  I was hoping this would really get into my pores and clean the oil out while reducing the size of my pores.  It cleans my face well, however my pores still look like they are filled with dirt, especially on my nose.  I scrub with the highest speed setting.  The Olay cleaning scrub is very expensive.  I am using Neutrogena® instead.  I will continue to use this, just wish It worked better cleaning the pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful and easy to use cleaning system that leaves my face really feeling clean, smooth and dirt-free all in all.</li>
            <li> My face definitely feels cleaner when I use this, and I don&#x27;t really have complaints. Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> One of my friends raves about her pricey Clarisonic all the time.  My budget doesn&#x27;t allow for an expense quite as large as that product so I went looking for a more budget friendly alternative.  I decided on the Olay Pro-X and I am not disappointed.  For a fraction of the cost this is the little cleaner that could.  My skin has never felt and looked better.  If you are on a budget like me I suggest giving it a try or even try this one to be sure you will stick to a good skin care ritual and eventually upgrade.</li>
            <li> I use this brush on the &amp;#34;slow&amp;#34; setting on my face and chest twice a day. It has helped hugely with preventing breakouts. I don&#x27;t use any cleanser with it and have still found it to be sufficient and then some.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I Love it.  Have enjoyed this product so far.  Can feel the results, my skin feels really clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I am generally happy with my purchase.  I thought it was going to be more powerful, but at $20, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve this in the mail. Even more excited when I tried it out, and it left my face beautifully soft. Since then I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference in my skin. Less breakouts, softer, yet younger looking skin. Will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> This products comes as described. The device has two speeds slow and just to tad faster than slow!  But if you have sensitive skin or acne prone skin the two speeds are just perfect. It also comes with a small tube of  exfoliation cleanser to try.  So far my skin looks better in a bit brighter since I&#x27;ve been using it. It definitely feels cleaner from choosing the brush. The price is very good for the products received. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this product.  It doesn&#x27;t have very much power.  I had something like this when I was a teenager and it worked much better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the Clarisonic one, but having normal skin I find this product excellent - my skin indeed looks softer, pores smaller, and complexion glows! The cleaner supplied is god, but I&#x27;ve tried Nivea ones and they also work fine.</li>
            <li> Works well for me. Face feels cleaner. The only issue is the brushes get funky really quick and are not cheap to replace.</li>
            <li> I cannot really conduct a scientific experiment here.  Fortunately for me, my skin was not so awful that measuring improvements would have been practicable.  But, where I use it, my skin subjectively feels much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, let me raise some issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the box in which I bought the brush showed what seemed a much large bottle of exfoliating cleanser than actually came in the package.  Not a shock if one read the contents, but still deceptive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the device other than perhaps the brush-head itself is pretty simple and would probably not have been expensive to manufacture.  We are basically talking about an electric engine, powered by two AA batteries, with an on-off button, and a second button to toggle between two speeds.  If one can get a knock-off, such as that sold at CVS/pharmacy, for a meaningfully different price, then that knock-off might be the better buy.  I say “probably” and “might” here because it is possible that Olay uses substantially better parts in its devices; but I doubt that.  Where I would be more inclined to believe that the Olay product were truly superior would be in the brush-heads.</li>
            <li> I have not used such a product before.  I like the way it makes my skin feel afterward.  I&#x27;m sure after I&#x27;ve used it awhile I will start to notice a difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled about this product. It&#x27;s within my budget and I haven&#x27;t seen my skin look this healthy in years after using this brush for only a week. I used it with my own gentle Cetaphil as I have very sensitive skin and the results are smooth, glowing skin. I don&#x27;t need to use as much moisturizer or foundation and it&#x27;s much, much gentler than using a washcloth on my face every day. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  I noticed that a lot of the younger women have been using something like this to help exfoliate their facial skin. I am a 50 year old man, but I have oily facial skin, so I decided to try it, and I am very pleased with how it cleans and makes cleaning easy and fun. Works a long time on a set of batteries, can be kept in the shower with no problem. It was a really reasonable price and fast shipping here on Amazon. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase the replacement heads for it because I don&#x27;t feel like it works any better than a washcloth. The bristles are rough, and I felt like it made my skin redder than it normally is. Like many other reviewers have said, do not use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This really helped with blackheads but I need replacement heads and just seem to think masks and scrubs do the same thing.</li>
            <li> It worked fine and had two speeds. This was a plus, but the brush head went bad pretty fast and it would have been even better if it came with other types of non-brush heads.</li>
            <li> i bought this and liked the way it works.  bought another for my sister and she loves it, says she uses it every day.  i heard some dumb girls saying they spend like $200 + dollars on one.  this one does an awesome job.</li>
            <li> nice item, nice seller.</li>
            <li> As I entered my 30&#x27;s, I started to develop hormonal acne, which NOTHING will get rid of...not prescription or over-the-counter medications...so I decided to give this a try. It can be used with any face wash or exfoliating scrub, and assists in getting rid of built-up dead skin cells. I use exfoliating scrub, and this cleans WAY better...my skin feels much smoother after I use this. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small product, but it does what its meant to, which is just as well. It comes with a small face cleanser, which is nice as well (although extremely chemically in my opinion).</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and she loves it. She said she would recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> Feels really good on the skin.  However, the brush is really small.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!!</li>
            <li> The combs that vome with it is kind of hard i expect to be softer...i wonder if you can send me a softer comb or something softer since i think i have the right...thanks...will be willing to write a better review if you can send me a softer one because that is the only problem...!</li>
            <li> Iwas given this as a gift and even though my complexion is not bad, I LOVE it! I use it daily and have purchased 2 more as Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li> The product was received on time and was as it was described.  I have been using it everyday since it&#x27;s arrival and it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I bought this after wanting a Clairsonic for a while... I have noticed Major improvements in skin texture and way fewer breakouts since using this twice a day, and keeping all other products the same.</li>
            <li> I have Clairsonic and Neutrogena buff dermabrasion tools.. and I love them both - but this  brush is great for around the eyes and nose as the brush is much smaller! Perfect.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy shopping online.  This is the exact product i saw advertised in a magazine and i had no idea where to begin looking for one.</li>
            <li> Works well. Small in size.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have only been using it for a week and have already received compliments on the improved appearance of my skin. I am 31 years old and am in between the equally annoying &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;first signs of wrinkles&amp;#34; stages. This cleanses and exfoliates/softens, and my skin has never looked better. I use in conjunction with other olay products, but this has been the game changer....it seems to allow the creams and serums to deeper penetrate into my pores. (This also clears up blackheads) Highly recommend!! :)</li>
            <li> This system removes so much dirt and oil, while massaging my skin. Feels great in use, my skin feels so clean afterwards. I use this with the Clinique acne-cleansing system (foam wash, clarifying lotion). Since my budget would never allow a $200+ purchase on the Clarisonic, this is a great, affordable option for me. I highly recommend this Olay face brush. Soon I will need to replace the brush head, as it has developed some buildup, but I&#x27;ve had the same head on it for 6 months, so a regular change-out is expected about this time.</li>
            <li> Probablly one of the more gentle home dermabrasion tools around, but like most, with prolonged use can  irritate sensitive skin. My advice would be to start slowly and build up over time. Dont rush. You will get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B009A98HJI Anti Aging Skin Care and Nutrition Secrets Every Woman Should Know (Health, Fitness, and Lifestyle Solutions For Women)]]</li>
            <li> Not the Clarisonic ! I had one but returned as I felt guilty spending the $ . However this does a good job. I still would rather have the Clarisonic, but this will do until then !</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel wonderful.....</li>
            <li> It works just fine-there is nothing wrong with it-I should have added money to the 25.00 gift card I received and bought the cheapest Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. it&#x27;s soft on my face and I can really feel it cleaning. I have noticed since using this product my break outs aren&#x27;t as bad. After I wash my face with this it feels so smooth and clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this came with changable heads I would love it even more. I know they sell replacements but i&#x27;ve only ever seen one style of brush. Other than that this is a fantastic product and I would rec. it to anyone!</li>
            <li> i love it.  Helps removes make up that makeup remover didn&#x27;t.  I only wish they included a bigger tube of the cleansing creme.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product out.  I love the feel of the brush on my skin, however mine kept pausing during use.  I was pleased with the results, although continuing to push the button to turn it back on was very inconvenient.  It comes with a very small tube of cleaner, so plan on buying more within just a few days.  The cleanser was gentle and it left my skin feeling very soft.  I&#x27;ll be returning my defective one and I&#x27;ll review the replacement one I receive.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected to receive, and I am very happy with my purchase. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely AMAZING!  It far surpassed my expectations.  I am so glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on the Mia or other expensive brands.  This does a great job.  I&#x27;ve never felt my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks in an I like the outcome .</li>
            <li> I like this item because it was inexpensive and I believe that it does a better job of cleaning than just myself using my hands, but my roommate has a different brand and the bristles move quicker probably because she paid more for it.</li>
            <li> I bought the olay pro -x from walgreen. I was looking for something to help with skin peeling on my forehead and around my cheek areas. After the first use this worked wonders and left my skin feeling very soft. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The device works well. The product that comes with it is too harsh too use on my face...maybe as a foot scrub.</li>
            <li> Seems to work to a good extent. Wish it was bigger and faster that way it can do whole body.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this cleans my face. I use it about 3 times a week because I don&#x27;t want to over-scrub my skin. I ended up buying one for my husband too, and he uses it daily with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason for a 5-star review is that I paid $28 on Amazon, then saw it in Rite-Aid for $59.99. Crazy.</li>
            <li> Great size works really well! I&#x27;ve already noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li> Was a gift and really well received.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I use my own cleanser for everyday use and their cleanser twice a week.  It really does make a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived so long without using this tool to clean my face! I spoke to an expert who said that I have &amp;#34;congested&amp;#34; pores and that I should use a facial brush to clean my face. I&#x27;ve always had acne and flaking skin, so I was willing to try this Olay brush. I&#x27;ve had the brush for several weeks, and my skin now looks amazing! My pores look so tiny, and I rarely have breakouts. I do not use the exfoliating cleanser that came with the brush; instead, I use my own cleanser/exfoliater since I have sensitive/dry skin. But this brush is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected. I was really excited to get my pro-x in the mail so I was highly disappointed when it did not work like everyone said it would.</li>
            <li> Love, this is I&#x27;ve always wanted to buy, I feel very great, light makeup skin care no longer discharge makeup, is washed clean, cheap, but forgot to buy the brush head, the next time also come</li>
            <li> I was so flummoxed by the positive reviews of this product that I had to call my old English professor to find the best word to use that would accurately describe the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a mid 20s guy with leftover scarring from a case of chickenpox (how is that still a disease btw) on the sides of my face. I conducted a whole afternoon of research into a good skin treatment system, and bought the Olay system based on the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, know what you&#x27;re getting into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think you&#x27;re buying a relatively inexpensive microdermabrasion system (as it comes up in amazon search) that will reduce the appearance of scars and rejuvenate your skin, think again. The device has two speeds, slow, and a little slower. I was expecting some sort of soft orbital sander luffa type deal for your face, what I got was at best an oversize version of an electric toothbrush with softer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, don&#x27;t assume the magic is in the 50ml tube of the facial cleanser that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously was that the smallest bottle they could find? I even bought the extra 2 bottles of detoxifying pore scrub that amazon recommended. Another dead end. No different that any other less expensive cleanser on the market. In fact I&#x27;d submit that most other cleansers are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is it good for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re someone who has to clean their face a lot for whatever reason (e.g. make up, acne, oily skin, blah dee blah) this product would make it slightly easier to clean your face if you didn&#x27;t have say, a wash cloth around, or failing that, a paper towel with some cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it makes it fun to wash your face while simultaneously drawing attention to areas of your complexion some should pay more attention to (e.g. pores, blackheads, etc. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I would say boo Olay for this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own a Clarisonic brush but I don&#x27;t think I need that big of a brush anyways for that big of a price (over 100 bucks and don&#x27;t get me started on the investment for the refill brushes).  I have never really had bad skin and not the type to break out all over the face.  My traumatic experiences involve one huge pimple on the chin or around the nose every now and then, but overall my skin is clear of acne.  This Olay brush would be helpful for people like me that do not experience facial or body acne issues often.  I don&#x27;t recall having to change the battery yet and its been a year!  I noticed it slowing down and I thought it was the battery dying but false alarm and it went back to normal speed the next day!  I like it for the small, portable size (which you can take with you easily for travel purposes) and easy to hold in hand in the shower.  I recalled watching \\&quot;The Drs\\&quot; show and they mentioned this brush being just as good as going to a professional clinic and getting the microdermabrasion (THAT IS IF YOU USE IT EVERYDAY AND DO IT CORRECTLY- you can achieve similar results as doing the professional thing for so much less).  I personally feel my skin looking and feeling better with the brush exfoliating my skin everyday and probably helps absorbs the face wash and face creams.  If you&#x27;re on a budget, this product is trustworthy with it&#x27;s brand (I know there are a lot of knock-offs of the Olay brush) and it should do its thing just as well for you if you just need a little boost in your skincare routine.  The refill brushes should be around 10 dollars for a pack of 2, which is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you think you clean your makeup off well...check again and use the brush to really get into your pores and you might possibly see makeup residue!</li>
            <li> Awesome face brush, you can feel your clean firm and tighten up after just one washing. Awesome for any makeup wearer who wants to make sure your face is clean at night!</li>
            <li> Great product!  It cleans very well and feels so good!</li>
            <li> Love it !!!  It works in the shower n makes ur face feel so good !! So clean even with make up feels clean..</li>
            <li> I bought this when my Clarisonic Plus died after 4-5 years. I just couldn&#x27;t justify spending $250 every 4-5 years on a facial cleansing device, so I thought I&#x27;d give the Olay Pro-X a try. Unfortunately, I have grown used to the gentle sonic action of the Clarisonic as well as the deep pore cleansing brush head. I could not get used to the rotating action of the Pro-X and I did not feel my skin was cleansed as well as it was with the Clarisonic. In fact, my face started breaking out even though I did not change cleansers. I worked with the Pro-X for about a week, but I ended up purchasing a Clarisonic Mia 2 which is roughly half the price of the Plus, but still has the sonic cleansing I have grown used to. I&#x27;m giving the Pro-X four stars, though, because it could quite possibly simply come down to preference. I&#x27;m going to pass the Pro-X on to a friend and hope she&#x27;ll find she enjoys it.</li>
            <li> NOT A CLEARASONIC BUT A GOOD STARTER PRODUCT. AFTER USING IT A WHILE I REALIZED THAT THE CLEARSONIC WAS REALLY WHAT I WANTED, EVEN THOUGH MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.&lt;br /&gt;THE POOR BOYS CLEARASONIC.</li>
            <li> I would have given a higher rating if my product wasn&#x27;t defective.  I have to hold down the button in order for it to work.  Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, product arrived as described, &amp; it works like a dream! My skin loves it&#x27;s new regimen!!</li>
            <li> works well but makes the face a little bit painful.</li>
            <li> Wow I really like this product, leaves my face feeling just wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this Pro-X brush. I haven&#x27;t had it more than a few months and the spinning brush will not stay on the handle for more than a few seconds. I have a microdermabrasion attachment as well and that one won&#x27;t stay on either. They are constantly popping off and I&#x27;m having to chase them all over the shower. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This cleans your face as good as the higher priced brands, What I like about it is, the brush rotates, really cleaning. Prior ,I had the Clarisonic and I did not like it at all. the brush did not rotate, did not feel as clean.</li>
            <li> Clean my face so good! like it. Good price. Use my gel ar scrub</li>
            <li> Before buying the [[ASIN:B002XURD32 Clarisonic Mia Sonic Skin Cleansing System, Pink]] I had to do some research.  All of the reviews brought me to buy the [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]].  I used the Olay pro x for 9 days and after great results I went and purchased the \\&quot;more powerful\\&quot; clarisonic.  I have only used it once but I have to say that comparing the two products is like comparing apples to oranges.  Both are great but very different.  The Olay is a great exfoliator and my face feels so clean.  The clarisonic used a sonic pulse much like the sonicare toothbrush .  I have used the sonicare toothbrush for years and love it.  I am confident that I will love the clarisonic just as much.  I do feel like both products have a purpose.  I plan to switch between the two brushes.  Maybe every other day or one in the morning and one at night.  I can&#x27;t say that I like one better than the other.  I am glad I have them both.</li>
            <li> Did not keep. Bought this for a gift then discovered it was for aging skin and not appropriate for a teen.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got it and especially at this price point. I didn&#x27;t like the enclosed sample of the facial scrub (icky!) and substituted my regular, cheaper brand of scrub.My oily skin needs extra work certain times of year and this boosted my normal cleanser to the point of noticing a difference. I am 53, by the way, and need to work harder now on making my sun-damaged skin look better. A washcloth just doesn&#x27;t do it anymore. An excellent object I am glad I tried.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my daughter. She kept looking at the ones that cost over $100 at Dillard&#x27;s, and I just couldn&#x27;t afford to pay that much. After 3 weeks, I asked her how it was working.  She told me, that the reason she wanted one was because she tried one of the more expensive ones from a department store that a friend of hers had purchased, and she loved how her face felt after using it.  Now, she says she would not trade the Olay one for anything.  She absolutely loves it.  She says it get her face as clean as the over priced ones in the department stores.</li>
            <li> it works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think it could use some vibration and be much more effective. -1 star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;none the less, i have noticed clearer, happier skin.</li>
            <li> I have never used a clarisonic but I have used many exfoliating scrubs, masks, and peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw out the cleanser that this came with and use my Say Yes to Blueberries cleanser for dry skin. It works about as well as Anew&#x27;s mild glycolic retexturizing peel to keep my skin looking younger and smoother, but unlike most of the masks I&#x27;ve tried there&#x27;s no drying effect. Best of all, you can use this on rough areas of your body like your elbows as well- for that purpose I usually use it with extra virgin coconut oil. I did my research before purchasing and the main downsides to this product seem to be that it takes batteries instead of recharging- I&#x27;ve had the same battery in it for nearly three months and have been using this 2-3 times a week, so the battery lasts a while, and the fact that the brush heads only come in one type, but for less than half the price I&#x27;m not going to complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this little gadget is that it&#x27;s tough- I&#x27;m clumsy and have a small bathroom, and I&#x27;ve dropped it several times, left it in the shower a few times, etc. I see no difference in how well it works. Amazon also sells replacement brush heads, and I went ahead and bought a pack of two. I plan on using this product as long as Olay keeps making the replacement heads!</li>
            <li> Best clensing product I have ever used. Even better than the clarisonic in my opinion</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper option then the $400 clearsonic.  This works great!  I have very oily skin and large pores.  Just after one week I saw a difference.  My skin felt great after each wash and saw my blemish marks disappear.  I usually use my own scrub or face wash though.  I love this and will be buying this for my family and friends</li>
            <li> Really good, I like it. Makes my skin feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> seems to help clean the dead skin off face feels good after use</li>
            <li> This product has made me realize that washing your face with your hands is not good enough this product cleans away the excess dirt, pores and in my case (makeup) around my face and hairline i&#x27;ve noticed a great change in the way my face looks with and without makeup since using this..best investment!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I just wanted to get a fresh and clean face and feel some brightness in my skintone. I started to hear a lot about the Clarisonic, but I just don&#x27;t feel like paying that much for something that I don&#x27;t desperately want/need. It&#x27;s not a high priority item, so I started to look for alternatives. I haven&#x27;t used Clarisonic, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I do really like this a lot. I use it once/day on my face with a regular face cleanser, and my skin feels soooo smooth and nice and clean after using it. I just don&#x27;t feel like a facial exfoliator is a \\&quot;can&#x27;t live without\\&quot; type of item, and this gives you that luxury with a more sensible price tag than paying over $100. Seriously, we&#x27;re talking about face exfoliating... Clarisonic seems a bit excessive to me. This does the job just fine, in my opinion. If you are looking to exfoliate, this will do it! I like that it is waterproof, and I like that it is battery-operated versus rechargable because it makes it much more portable and compact. No complaints here, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for $32 in walgreens! I was very excited to started using and I did feel the difference in my skin within a week. HOWEVER, it only lasted LESS THAN A MONTH because the water leaked into the battery cage. I removed the batteries, changed them but nothing made it to work. I really like the product but losing $32 wasn&#x27;t funny at all!</li>
            <li> this is pretty good - doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power but then you aren&#x27;t suppose to be sanding your face - HA!  Does a pretty good job in cleaning and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 1 week and I cannot believe the results.  After the first use, my skin was SO smooth and shiny, it looked 10 years younger!  Now, after 3 uses &amp; 1 week later, the pores on my nose are almost indistinguishable.  I now only use a tinted moisturizer (or CC cream) on my skin and THAT&#x27;S IT for makeup!  I am so pleased.  Definitely recommended for men and women of all skin types.</li>
            <li> Made my face breakout. Had to stop using it. It was only $17. I probably use it to get Halloween make up off..lol. If you have sensitive skin I would not buy this or only use this once a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really impressed with this product.  While it does what it does clean and exfoliate I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it because it does not do a better job than the multitude of exfoliating cleansers on the market.  Think about it.  Why pay $20 for a tool when you could spend the money on a cleanser that makes your face just as smooth and clean and not have the additional costs of replacement batteries and brush heads.  Besides, you will still need to use the Pro-X with a cleanser!!!  I also think that some people are very pleased with this product because if they follow the directions they are washing their face for a whole minute which might be longer than they normally take to cleanse.  If you take a whole minute to clean your face you will get clean and if you are using a microdermabrasion cleanser you will get smooth.  It&#x27;s that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews saying that the Pro-X causes redness or irritation on their skin.  My combination skin is only sensitive to chemicals and has no problems with abrasion or breakouts.  For me, I would prefer something a little more powerful.  I actually feel that the speed is weak--even on the higher setting.  I get better results by just using my hands.  Still, everyone has different skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do like is that you can use the Pro-X in the shower; however, the payoff is that the battery compartment is so incredibly hard to open.  I had to find YouTube videos on how to open it and I still almost gave up.  I think it might be impossible for some people to open if they have arthritis or any other condition that affects hand strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser that comes with the Pro-X is pretty much on-par with other microdermabrasive cleansers I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve used this Olay version both with and without the tool (got the same result either way) and it&#x27;s pretty decent.  I&#x27;ve used other products where I was able to use less of the product and get more exfoliation because this one contains less \\&quot;grit\\&quot; but again my skin can handle more grit whereas others who are more sensitive to abrasion will find this cleanser to be just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rating the Pro-X with two stars because I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cost effective.  I have to buy a cleanser either way and notice no difference in the results by using the tool.  That said, the product does deliver on its claims.  It just does it no better than using an exfoliating cleanser on its own.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure product would work for my very sensitive skin.  It works great!  Really getts skin clean without irritation.  Complexion looks better in three days.  Easy to use.  Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this as it was recommended by a friend.  It works really well at cleaning my skin, much better than other scrubbers I&#x27;ve tried.  I love that I can use it in the shower too.</li>
            <li> My mom has the Clarisonic and I LOVED it. After I moved I didn&#x27;t want to fork out the money to buy my own so I got this instead. I really cant believe anyone would compare the two. This works ok. Honestly If i could I would return it and get my money back. Using any face cloth with micro beads works the same. Its flimsy and doesnt work like it should for being an auto scrubber.  If i were to buy a less expensive one again and couldn&#x27;t afford the Clarisonic I would get one a little more expensive than this or try a different brand. Otherwise save your money and get a gentle face scrubber and do it by hand.</li>
            <li> I first bought this in January 2011, not long after they were released.  I had been looking at the Clarisonic but could not afford the high price tag.  I have large pores, that tend to clog easily and form lots of blackheads and no exfoliant on it&#x27;s own has ever been able to solve the problem, so I bought this. This cleans so well and yet the bristles are so gentle.  I have never felt like my skin was getting raw unless I used it for too long or pressed too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, it died and I was devastated.  This has been the best skincare purchase I have ever made (and as someone who has oily skin, prone to breakouts, I&#x27;ve made a lot of them).  Regardless of the cleanser I use it with, my skin has been smoother, cleaner, and my pores diminished.  In the week I have been without it, blackheads have already been forming on my face again.  My face feels rougher and oilier without it. Thus I ordered a second one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first lasted over two years with daily use and I only had to change the batteries once in all that time.  I actually think the only reason it died was because I changed bathrooms and it was in near direct water in the new shower.  This brush is water-resistant, not water-proof, but I got a new shower rack and the new one will stay clear of the shower spray.  Even if one of these dies every two years, you would still have to buy 5 of these at Amazon&#x27;s present price to cost as much as one Clarisonic, which is ten years of use, and I guarantee one Clarisonic wouldn&#x27;t last ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr-- Great for your skin, great price, well worth it.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I especially love the price tag of this rather than spending over $100 on the clarisonic. The movement isn&#x27;t as great as the clarisonic and maybe the brush is not as hard has the clarisonic but for the pricetag I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it only once or twice a week (because the other days I like to scrub with my microderm vitamin C from the body shop and also Ocean Salt from Lush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say my skin is more clear because of using Olay cleansing system but still enjoy it.  I can probably live without it and just stick to my exfoliator cleansers but for the price why not use it.</li>
            <li> Something very good, the effect is good. Is too small wash up tired.Would recommend friends and family to buy.Is very good.</li>
            <li> With such a great price I was worried it would work as well as the other&#x27;s out their!  Boy was I wrong! But I will say you can not use with with other face washes, I tried to use a black head scrubber. Face wash just to see how we&#x27;ll it would work. Not the best results. But other then that it was a great purchase!!</li>
            <li> I like to exfoliate my face, and this little gadget is great for that.  It comes with an Olay cleanser that is gritty.  I find the combination of the rotary brush and the gritty cleanser to be a bit much for my sensitive skin, so I use Cetaphil face wash on it.  It feels really good, and I use it every night before going to bed.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look cleaner and more refreshed for the first week. After the first week, i got more pimples and I thought it stopped working, but I think it was mostly because I did not wash the brush clean enough. It is a good product for a good price and it will definitely make your skin cleaner, but does not get rid of pimples right away. Make sure to wash the brush clean enough or it will make the opposite effect!</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin and read about the cleansing brush can help exfoliate so ordered this before investing in clarisonic brush and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So smooth, feel great on the face, good to do a facial with. Massages your face while cleaning very nice</li>
            <li> This product is a great addition to my skin care routine. It really helps clear up black head and feels your skin feeling great. I use it with any of my face washes in the shower. Very happy with the product and recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> Great price, and works wonderfully! My skin feels so smooth afterward, and I have less breakouts.</li>
            <li> can astringe the pores on my face and easy to bring for traveling. high cost/performance ratio</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot. I can feel the difference it makes on my skin after I use it. It doesn&#x27;t come with any recommendations as to how often to use. That would be helpful. Right now I use twice a week. My sister uses hers daily with no issues.</li>
            <li> I cannot explain how much I love this product. It is like a mini version of the ones you see on tv for over a hundred dollars. Amazing price, and super portable. Cleans like nothing else. LOVE LOVE LOVE. If any of you guys want an amazing face cleaner, THIS IS THE ONE YOU SHOULD BUY!</li>
            <li> I love this devices. It has totally unclogged my pores, making them appear much smaller. My face looks healthier and skin feels much smoother. My moisturizer absorbs like never before. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this because it&#x27;s perfect to slough off dead skin around my nose.  Other brushes are too big, but this is a perfect smaller size!</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d use one of these facial cleaning systems and didn&#x27;t really think I needed one, but I&#x27;m really glad I took a chance on this one.  The Olay brush is gentle on my face whether I use it on regular or high speed.  I&#x27;m not sure how often I&#x27;m supposed to replace the brush head, but after using it for 2 months mine still seems to be holding up just fine.  Maybe I use less pressure, who knows.  My box had a sample size of the Olay cleansing product included with it and it works just fine on the spinning brush head.  My face feels clean and invigorated after using the Pro-X and I love the slight flush it leaves on my skin; my face looks so healthy when I&#x27;m done!  I don&#x27;t see a reason to pay more for another brand of brush, this one works great!</li>
            <li> Love this thing, and my skin is definitely a lot softer since using it. Only thing that concerns me is the fact that it spins in a complete circle opposed to spinning back and forth like the Clarisonic, which helps with wear and tear on the skin. Other than that, though, it makes for a great deep-down clean 3-4 times a week!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Cleanses my face gently!</li>
            <li> It really has made a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried a a name brand department store cleansing brush, and loved it, but was looking for a more budget-friendly alternative. My teen daughter and I have been using the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush for several months now, and it works great. I notice smaller pores, smoother skin, and less visible fine lines. She likes clearer skin and fewer breakouts. I do wish the brush was a little wider, and had a timer for each area of the face like the other one I tried, but it&#x27;s a great option for the price.</li>
            <li> This item does scrub my face and give me the new fresh skin that I was hoping for.  I might use a cleansing cream with no abrasives in it, as it might be a little too harsh for my skin to use an abrasive, but I do like the overall results!</li>
            <li> good product. decent pricing. ordered for myself but gave to daughter.</li>
            <li> As an &#x27;old&#x27; guy who is getting those dang blackheads all old guys get in my sideburns, this works great to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> Affordable and works fine</li>
            <li> Great item and seller! I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to see if this could replace my clarisonic mia 2. I do like my clarisonic mia 2 however, the brush heads can be quite expensive to replace every 2-3 months. The brush head however is definitely a lot smaller than the clarisonic one however, ii makes my skin feel super nice and clean; and helps remove excess makeup. Great for the price and brush heads are also affordable.</li>
            <li> The brush on this really doesn&#x27;t do much it&#x27;s wayyyy too soft.  I feel like I get a better wash with a washcloth.  Used it a few times, but not wasting my time with it any longer.</li>
            <li> Love this  face cleansing brush! Has msde a noticable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Ladies love it great way to express your legs,face,and if you want to keep your body looking great.</li>
            <li> Great product; very happy with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a must-have for people who use foundation. After I use normal face wash at the end of the day, and feel pretty clean after, I can still get more foundation off with this thing. And I don&#x27;t even use much foundation. But there&#x27;s really not that many ways to get that gunk out of your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin *is* smoother and *seems* to be more radiant as well. Also seems to prevent me from breaking out. With more time, I will see if this acne-prevention is just pure coincidence or actually due to using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this day and night. Skin is not very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope this doesn&#x27;t break soon since it&#x27;s pretty cheap- pricewise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Ironically, soon after writing this review, I got areas of breakouts on chin. Read about this happening to other people- namely with their Clarisonics- never thought it&#x27;d happen to me. Welp, guess it&#x27;s true. I do hope I&#x27;m in a \\&quot;purge\\&quot; phase now. I will still continue to use the pro-x. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive so even going over the breakouts is okay.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the cleansing brush.  It is very gentle to the feel on the face and I think, my face just looks much cleaner when I use it.  The Olay, I have only used twice....the brush does well with my other cleansing facial soaps or gels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been keeping my eye on these types of products for the past year, waiting for a good chance (or rather, price) to try out one. With the discount and coupon, I opted for this one recently - and I&#x27;m so glad I finally gave in! I use this daily, both in the morning and the evening. In the winter, I&#x27;ll probably cut back to just daily use, but with the heat and humidity my skin needs extra attention in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;This exfoliates as well as the &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; brushes do, IMHO. (I test-drove a friend&#x27;s for a week once.) I&#x27;ve used the cleanser that this kit includes, but even my usual face product (Philosophy&#x27;s Purity, if you&#x27;re curious) works extra hard with this brush. I&#x27;ve used it over my lips in the shower too, which was accidental, but worked out well - almost as well as my usual lip scrub. :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this both in the shower and at the sink with no issues. I do recommend wiping/drying the brush after each use, especially after use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the brush head was a little bit bigger, but that&#x27;s only to save time in my morning routine. Overall, this is an excellent product that works well and does wonders for my skin! I&#x27;ve noticed clearer, healthier skin as a result, and I&#x27;ve had to use less moisturizer after using the brush. The moisturizer soaks into my skin quickly too. That&#x27;ll help stretch the life of my moisturizers!&lt;br /&gt;I love the two speeds, though I tend to use the faster one more often. The brush is almost like a massage for your face, which is amazing to use in the midst of a migraine or headache. Bonus!</li>
            <li> Good product for price.  After using, I can tell my skin is smoother, clearer and I&#x27;ve actually received compliments.  It is not on the same quality/strength as the Clarisonic, but a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It is small, light, and can get wet with no malfunctioning.  It is easy to clean and has 2 power settings.  Only downfall is that I would actually like a rougher scrub brush!</li>
            <li> the wife uses this product every day since recieving it and just loves the way it makes her skin feel</li>
            <li> I have only used the Olay brand for several years, but since using ProX my skin feels its best! I have never felt my face this smooth in many months (I get quarterly facials). I&#x27;m 30-years old and my friends and family tell me I look 5-years younger since using ProX :)  No more facials needed!</li>
            <li> Great product for the money. This particular product was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It does a very good job of exfoliating the face.</li>
            <li> I love this! It makes my face so smooth. My pores are smaller, my face is super clean, the black heads on my nose are clearing up AND it&#x27;s super cheap compared to other ones out there like this. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this Olay Pro-X it really works the brush has two levels and can be used everyday, damn it I leave it in the hotel LAX so so so sad :( delivery was super fast, my goodness!!!</li>
            <li> After just 4 uses, I have noticed a difference in my skin.  My pores are less visible and my skin seems much smoother.  I have been an OOO user since I was a teen and now being well into my 50&amp;#34;s, it is nice to know I can still depend on a company to deliver what it boasts about.  I am sending one to my daughter also.</li>
            <li> This item works so well that I saw a different in my skin within a few days.  I do not use any other cleaning product on my face now; it&#x27;s gentle and feels very nice.  Highly recommend to all women.</li>
            <li> So I just got mines in the mail today! Was anxiously waiting for it! I used it and I absolutely love it!! I washed my face and dried it... Face looked brighter and so clean! Makes your face soft!!! Great product! Shipping was a day late but the product was perfect! :) yay!</li>
            <li> Love love this!! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and let me say I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Really gets in there and cleans my face.</li>
            <li> Wow. Talk about your face feeling super clean!!! Was skeptical but it is definately worth it. So squeaky clean and smooth feeling after!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and is a nice quality.  The bristles are soft, but not too soft, and the exfoliating sample is a good quality.  Really like this, especially because, let&#x27;s face it, the price is cheap for this type of face scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some mentioned an issue with knowing how to change the batteries.  I have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about, because my box had very clear and easy to follow directions.  (seriously, not remotely hard at all, was like changing batteries in anything else)  I was expecting a nightmare scenerio and it was the exact opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I didn&#x27;t do 5 stars is because I&#x27;ve had it for a short time, but technically based on how it arrived, the way it looks, feels, works, it&#x27;s 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference in my skin already.  My skin is smoother, cleaner, no lines, smaller pores, etc. Great price too!!</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING GOES WELL,ONE PITY THING IS CAN NOT CHARGE</li>
            <li> This is a great cleasing product for your face.  It is very small and light weight and can be used every day.  My old one died on my and it was not Olay.  I hope this one will last much longer.  My face is so smooth and good looking.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the great product.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it just seems a little flimsy</li>
            <li> This is a spectacular product. I love how my face feels after using it. It really polishes my skin and makes me glow! I bought the clarisonic and I love it but I will always tell people to use this if they don&#x27;t want to spend the money. It&#x27;s a great product, thank you Olay.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product ever so similar to the Clairsonic product that cost way more. My dermatologist had told me that with my aging, my pores do tend to get bigger, but since the bristles being so soft and with the soft circular motion of the product, it will clean the pores much better and they can get smaller as well ( i have noticed a difference too). It&#x27;s ability to sloth of dead shin cells helps any face cream you may use to be absorbed by the skin much better while help generating the new skin cells to grow making you skin look more youthful and glow.</li>
            <li> I have been debating about a Clarisonic for a long time and was deterred by the price. I read the reviews about the Olay and decided to give it a try. I was amazed at how smooth my skin felt after using it the first time.I use it every day and I think it cleans my skin better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin looks clearer and the color even seems to be better. I&#x27;ve never gone out the door without makeup but since getting the Olay I have actually gone out a few times with bare skin... that&#x27;s amazing to me. The battery issues are not important to me, only how the device works and it&#x27;s a great device for the price. I had a professional facial recently and the esthitician used a small brush which worked just like the Olay. My skin has always had breakouts my whole entire adult life but right now it&#x27;s as clear as it&#x27;s ever been. I am using various cleansers that I already have, some are exfoliating and other just cleansers and I think they all work fine. I love this little brush and am so glad I finally bought it. Maybe someday I&#x27;ll buy a Clarisonic but if not, I&#x27;m totally happy with the Olay. It&#x27;s made the most significant difference in my skin of anything I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I had a Nutrasonic (very similar to Clarisonic and cheaper at $89) that worked great before it quit a short few months after I bought it. The Olay brush works great so far but is not on the level of the higher priced Sonic brushes and has less power. This was expected since it is not a Sonic brush ...they are simply 2 different products. I was not prepared to invest much money in another brush so I went with this one. I like it, feel like it cleanses and exfoliates well, and would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this  even my grandson loves it</li>
            <li> I like everything about this. I use it, on average, every other day, although I hope to use it every day at some point. I keep forgetting! It  hasnt lost it&#x27;s charge yet. My face is much cleaner. I would have liked a little more power in the spin of the brush. It seems a little feeble. For the price though, I can&#x27;t complain. I would recommend if you don&#x27;t want to spend alot.</li>
            <li> i really like this product. i use it every 3 nights and it does feel deep clean after that. The only thing is that sometimes it gives me small rashes on the apples of my cheeks and near the nose.This may be due to pressing more while using it or using it rigorously but this happens sometimes only because i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The Pro-X cleans pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t clean as well as sonic face cleaners, but it&#x27;s good enough for me, and I like that it can be used in a shower.</li>
            <li> This item gives a deeper cleaning than using just your hands.  This is must have for a good daily skin care routine, at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am going to be 41 next month and although my skin looks much younger than my age, I was starting to notice larger pores, sun spots, and very fine lines.  I have tried many facial cleansers and moisturizers.  However, I&#x27;ve always been afraid to try a scrubber like this because my skin is sensitive.  I also have issues with redness on my cheeks.  The dermatologist diagnosed it as mild Rosacea.  Because of the redness and skin sensitivity I have shied away from products that would irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I am so glad I gave the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System a try.  I saw a difference from the very first use.  My skin was softer, my pores appeared smaller, and those little rough spots on both sides of my nose (in the fold) were completely gone.  Any moisturizing product that is applied after cleaning absorbs quickly and much more thoroughly than before.  It&#x27;s as though the cleaning brush has prepared my skin to absorb the moisturizing product.  I have used this faithfully twice per day since I received it (almost one month) and am overjoyed with how much my skin has improved.  It seems like with each passing day my skin looks better.  When I put my foundation on in the morning it makes my skin look flawless...just like it used to do when I was in my early 20&#x27;s.  No more foundation pooling in pores or caking in fine lines.  In fact, about two weeks after starting to use the product a woman walked up to me in the grocery store and told me I had beautiful skin.  I was speechless.  I didn&#x27;t know what to say.  I thanked her and immediately sent a text to my husband, who is using the product faithlessly (LOL,) and told him what had happened.  I am very happy with this product and recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using other Olay products (cleansers and moisturizers) with this product.  I was using the same products before - the only change to my skin care regimen is using the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System twice per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some reviewers mentioning their scrubber stopped working because they were using it in the shower.  I have used mine in the shower twice per day for about a month and have no problems so far.  Of course, I don&#x27;t wet the unit and I turn away from the spray of the shower to clean my face.  When I&#x27;m done cleaning I remove the brush and run it under the water and use my damp hand to wipe off any soap from the unit.  Water never penetrates the unit.  I then dry it with my towel and put it in the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about purchasing this item, I say go for it.  The price is very reasonable in comparison to other items or treatments on the market.  It&#x27;s easy to use and only takes about a minute two times per day to get amazing results.  I used to miss washing my face at night on occasion (lazy, too tired, etc.) but since the results from this product have been so positive and so quick, I actually look forward to cleaning my face and applying my moisturizer because I can&#x27;t wait to see how nice my skin look and feels in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy one for my 23 year old daughter and my sister-in-law so they too can enjoy the benefits.er day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some reviewers mentioning their scrubber stopped working because they were using it in the shower.

            <li> The scrubber is perfect for combination skin. The cleanser with the package is small.  If your just trying the product its the perfect kit.</li>
            <li> Does the job and works great!!</li>
            <li> After growing up with seemingly spontaneous acne and oily skin, I finally decided to invest in my face health as an adult. This little scrubber is wonderful! When I ran out of the cleanser that came with the Pro-X, I started using my own face wash (a deep cleansing wash from Target). It still works just as great with my own face wash as it did with the Olay brand that came with it. It leaves my face feeling super clean and I love it!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t ever held one of these before I purchased this one. It&#x27;s light weight and kind of cheap feeling. Probably not worth what I paid for it, but it does clean. So it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Love this, pores greatly reduced, smooth skintone, no acne. However I do wish the bristles were slightly softer. Still works amazingly for the price, eventually will upgrade to clairsonic when I have the money though.</li>
            <li> too slow and soft-wishing for a more intense scrub</li>
            <li> My daughter has a more expensive brand that does scrub harder, but this unit does a good job and is affordable. I bought some Olay Regenerist detoxifying scrub to use with it. They have quite a few interesting cleansers that I&#x27;m experimenting with. My husband was jealous so we bought some extra brushes and now he uses it, too!</li>
            <li> I recommend buying the whole kit that comes with the brush and the pad, just having the brush is okay, but both are more effective. Also, the exfoliator that comes with this kit is pretty rough, there are better ones available in stores.</li>
            <li> This cleans really well! The brush is also much softer than what I expected so I am quite satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> This was no more effective than using a Buff Puff on my face.  After a short while, I gave it away as it was just another gadget cluttering up the shower.  I returned to using the old fashioned Buff Puff, which works better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> this so far is really nice and way cheaper than at the local store. the bottle that comes in the box is fairly small so i went out and purchased a bigger one. but it feels like it works on your face the brushing head on the scrubber feel so so soft so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your face</li>
            <li> For what we paid for it we love it. we use it a lot, we put exfoliator on it once a week and use and regular facial wash other nights or mornings. Seems to clean well, easy to use and clean, have used the original batteres so far and it is still working fine.  can&#x27;t beat it for the price! face seems cleaner and smooth!</li>
            <li> This is what my skin needs! Such a gentle exfoliator that lifts that dirt right off of the skin. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It really gets the skin soft and clean. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this. I know there are a lot of these out there. This one is not overpriced and works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on whim in hopes of a better way to cleanse my oily and acne prone face.  I like that there&#x27;s 2 speed settings on the device.  However, I thought the device was too smooth for my skin type.  I have large deep pores.  I&#x27;m not a beauty expert but this does not seem to clean my face as well as a soft washcloth.  Using it seemed to apply no more pressure than a feather wisp across my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not a fan of the exfoliating wash that came it.  Again, because of my skin type, I&#x27;d rather  use something different like Proactiv to remove the oil and go a little deeper.</li>
            <li> This product just dried the face. my face would get dry and after a few hours it&#x27;d get oily again... did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product, I guess my skin just didn&#x27;t like it.  I used it twice gave it to my Mother and see loves it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin just within a couple weeks after trying it for the first time. I&#x27;m going on month 2 or so and my pores are smaller and more clear than they&#x27;ve been in a long time. After I used up the sample face wash that was included I&#x27;ve been using ones of my own and the brush still works just as good. I just don&#x27;t recommend foamy cleansers. Something with more of a texture works best. Love this product. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I had been debating on getting the Clairsonic, but at $100+ it&#x27;s a bit of a commitment for something you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;ll use regularly. So when I saw the Olay version I thought for 20 bucks if I don&#x27;t like it I&#x27;m not going to be upset about it. But let me tell you this thing is rad! It&#x27;s like a mini-spa treatment on your face and truly leaves your face feeling super clean. I&#x27;m just thrilled with it and so grateful for the wonderful reviews that helped solidify my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is a great cleaning product, but the one thign I don&#x27;t like is an annoying soudn that it makes, it is exactlly like mosquito.</li>
            <li> Ok for the few people who have had horrible reactions to this brush, you must have some seriously sensitive skin. lol I found the brush to be pretty soft. Not sure if I believe the whole thing about making pores tinier and whatnot, we shall see. But I enjoyed using it and it&#x27;s a great way to exfoliate and clean. I don&#x27;t use Olay products though so I am using the brush with Shiseido which is really good for Asian skin. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that it would come with a little stand or something to set it on or in when I&#x27;m not using it though.</li>
            <li> use it daily, I am very happy with my face scrubber. what a difference it has made in the apperance of the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Face cleansing was never high on my priority list, but this gadget makes it so easy that I actually enjoy the process.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I love the way my skin feels after using it, which I do every day. I am a former smoker of 45 yrs. and I also abused my skin as a habitual tanner, felt I had to be tan year round. Now at age 65 my skin shows the abuse.  So any product I use has it&#x27;s work cut out to try an reverse the damage.  I tried many and so far Olay products have been the only product that is showing me results.  So, if anyone who is still smoking/tanning, no product is going to be able to give you results but if you are not then I recommend trying Olay Pro-x and Olay&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> Great Product for the money.  Better than some of the much more expensive ones!</li>
            <li> I have used mine for almost a month now. It has really helped to brighten and clean my face. I even bought a second one as my sweetie used it and wanted one for himself. It has really helped his face after he shaves.</li>
            <li> Together with PanOxyl, has already helped to clear up my face after only a week.  Had tried a number of things for several months, but this did the trick!  $10 cheaper on here than in the drug store, by the way.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleansing system hoping it would allow me to better exfoliate and cleanse my face during my night routine, and it did THAT AND MORE! not only does it GENTLY clean your face from all the make-up, extra oil, and other things, but it definiely makes your skin feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom! :) it leaves it clean, smooth and radiant :) and I am NOT exaggerating! Take this from someone who has horribly oily skin:? and has dealt with mild to moderate acne for the past years, stating from when I was 12 and now 20. So, trust me on this, THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR! :) no CON&#x27;S here, just PRO&#x27;S ;) LOVEDDDD IT! :D and you can&#x27;t beat the price ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mine for a few months now, and since the very first use I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin.  I swear it took off 10 years and my skin has a glow to it now.  I also seem to have fewer breakouts, basically none.  I love the cleaner it came with, but it also works wonderfully with my own basic gel face cleaner.  I also bought one for my mom and she loves it too.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Need better directions and stronger brushes!</li>
            <li> The Brush is good! Cleans fairly deep but isn&#x27;t too abrasive. I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in wrinkles and I still break out just as much. I didn&#x27;t care for the exfoliating cleanser that comes with it. I prefer to use olay regenerist micro purifying cleanser. You will need to change the brush head every week.. otherwise your just accumulating dead skin and material from pores and reapplying them to your face. YUCK!! Over all, this product is totally worth the $$ :-)</li>
            <li> I expected it to be more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That large tube is about .1oz. The size in the picture is a joke to the actual size. No mention of the size&lt;br /&gt;of the cream</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teen who refused to wash his face with a washcloth. Give a boy a power tool and suddenly he wants to clean! His face has cleared up pretty well, he still has breakouts and acne, but it looks a lot better. He uses the lotion that came with the system.</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR DAILY CARE OF HEALTHY SKIN</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s gentle and yet it does a good job at exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think I am among those lucky people that has pretty good skin so I see no difference between before and after use, but my mother says that it is really good and works very well after every use</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.  It gets all the makeup off my face and gives me a deep cleaning that I just can&#x27;t get from soap and a washcloth only.  It did make my skin a little dry, but I solved that with Bio Oil and it wasn&#x27;t enough to make me stop using it.  I give it 5 stars because three months after purchasing it I still use it every day.</li>
            <li> I like that it is water resistant so I can use in the shower.  It has two speeds but the difference between them is negligible.  I do believe that it cleans better than your hands or a washcloth.  My face always feels smooth and stimulated (rosy) when I use it.</li>
            <li> Great little brush.  I bought it because the reviews were as good as the more expensive models.  You can tell a difference when you use it.</li>
            <li> Not only is this awesome because it is waterproof but it also fits the microdermabrasion head from Oil of Olay also - which is awesome!</li>
            <li> My face definitely feels cleaner using this rather than just a face wash. I keep it in the shower and use as part of my morning routine which I love.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is lighter, smooth, no more acne.&lt;br /&gt;My skin changed, and i am so fan of it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> battery does provide enough power, didn&#x27;t care for it&#x27;s cleaning; know you don&#x27;t want anything that is too powerful or that would hurt your skin, but still didn&#x27;t feel it cleaned properly</li>
            <li> Cheaper than drugstore. I use this every other day.  Works pretty good leaves smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is thorough but gentle for my face.</li>
            <li> Nothing will clean your skin like this. Shop for replacement heads online and don&#x27;t buy in store -too expensive.  No need for&lt;br /&gt;More expensive imitations.</li>
            <li> Amazingly soft and supple skin with ProX by Olay Advanced! Ty ProX by Olay Advanced!</li>
            <li> Really low powered.  Kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, exfoliated me skin. Felt a bit softer after one use. Will have to see the long term results before the jury is in though. For now, I am very happy with the product. Olay has always had some great products, I think this could be another one.</li>
            <li> I was at first skeptical about the benefits of this rather inexpensive tool. I thought that I could get the same exfoliation benefits from an old fashioned face brush or a facial scrub. However, after weeks of usage I am convinced that this is a worthwhile addition to one&#x27;s beauty set. While I still think that regular exfoliation via alternative methods can deliver similar results, this product&#x27;s ease and comfort of use makes it quite beneficial. It makes exfoliation a quick and enjoyable part of one&#x27;s daily routine and this alone makes it a valuable tool. I would not pay 200 something dollars for alternative brands, but at its current price, Olay Pro-x is a must have.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my skin felt incredibly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;25 years old, prone to clogged pores and mild acne. I considered botox, since I have fine wrinkles on my forehead that people occasionally point out: &amp;#34;Stop wrinkling your forehead!&amp;#34; Haha. Anyway, I decided to try this. I&#x27;m not sure that it will help with acne, but it has eliminated the dullness I would get on my forehead! I never realized how dry and dull my skin looked before until after I used this. The cleanser it comes with is okay. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s even necessary. I think any mildly exfoliating cleanser would do the trick.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing because I have a major issue with white gunk accumulating in the pores of my nose, which over the years have increased in size and are easily clogged. I use this every day and have seen decent results with keeping the pores on my nose clear of this unsightly white gunk. If I don&#x27;t use this thing every day, then the gunk starts to accumulate again. I haven&#x27;t seen a decrease in the size of the pores on my nose, but it does help to keep them clean, and it has helped to restore the soft skin I had on my face 10 years ago when I was in my early 20s. For the price I paid for it, I really can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t expect a miracle when you buy it, and don&#x27;t expect it to magically erase 20 years off your face overnight, then you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the results you get.</li>
            <li> I liked it the product works great and i feel like i am less shiny.  I would recommend it plus i find i am less lazy about washing my face at night.  I can do it while im watching tv or checking my email.</li>
            <li> It is useful. I can use it when I take a shower. Very comfortable and can help me clean my face.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for both men and women. Your skin will feel great after ever use. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works really well. I had terrible acne, but it&#x27;s so much better now. It came quickly and works perfectly. I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok, I didnt notice any difference. I think healthy skin comes from the inside and diet, exercise, or supplemetns are more effective.</li>
            <li> Ironically, using the microdermabrasion gel that came with it made me break out. I&#x27;m gradually clearing up again though and my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li> I love using it. But, I accidently drop off to a trash can and thrown away. got a get a new one soon.</li>
            <li> Everything was packaged the way it was advertised and batteries were included.  I am so happy I found this deal.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin care tool. I works better for me than simply using face wash. I would recommend to anyone who needs a little extra something</li>
            <li> Good product. Not too big and has two speeds. The brush is nice and soft -good for sensitive skin.  Great price.</li>
            <li> works good and enjoy using it</li>
            <li> I hesitated to order this product because my go-to cosmetics reviewers at beautypedia say it&#x27;s not any better than a washcloth.  However, the reviews on various sites were persuasive and I find washcloths rather abrasive for my skin. I purchased this product to see if use would help with enlarged pores in the nose region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions encourage use twice a day for 1 minute only. Then, of course, you need to buy new brushes fairly often. Since my skin is sensitive, I use it only once every two days and then particularly in the nose region. I see no difference in the rest of my skin, but I have noticed a reduction in appearance of enlarged pores around the nose.</li>
            <li> This brush works great! It is easy to use and a good size to handle. It feels great on my face. I&#x27;m so glad i found it.</li>
            <li> Amazing Deal, Thank You!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. I use with Proactive stage one and it works great. I use it on a bar of soap after every use to help it clean.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this and for some reason it does not work at all?? I tried new batteries but with no luck. Will return and try to purchase at a store maybe I received a defective one???</li>
            <li> Fast delivery great price</li>
            <li> Love this!!!! &amp; why pay $200 when this works great! I was skeptical of these face brushes but after reading tons of back up that they really work I wanted to try one. I have had oily skin and acne since I was a teen and even in my adult years it&#x27;s never gone away. Usually when I try new &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; things like cleansers with abrasives it only irritates my skin and makes it break out worse, so I thought a brush would have the same effect. (I have to use benzoyl peroxide 2.5% every day to keep my skin from huge breakouts but even that regimen has never made my skin as great as this brush has done!) I chose this brush because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on something I didn&#x27;t think would help anyways. Then when i felt how gentle it was, I thought &amp;#34;this can&#x27;t be doing anything&amp;#34;. Day 2 I noticed my skin was smoother and less oily. After a week I was amazed that my skin was the best it&#x27;s ever been in my life. Now  - even dark brown age spots have diminished. I don&#x27;t understand how this thing works but my skin feels great -  smooth and not greasy anymore! I use it every day to every other day  (I&#x27;m afraid to over use it - but I notice my skin getting oily again if I don&#x27;t use it regularly). It&#x27;s waterproof so I keep it in the shower and I use it with very gentle face soap - I have not tried the cleanser that comes with it. I wish I had found this years ago. If you have oily skin, this will be your best friend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but I think is going to be off soon will see.</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t even been a full year and it stopped working. do not buy this waste of money</li>
            <li> I love it. It does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought it for my feet.</li>
            <li> Love it, wish it spun even faster.  For some reason I think that would make me feel like I was cleaning better.</li>
            <li> good for gentle cleaning, not as power as clarisonic</li>
            <li> I bought this in lieu of buying an actual Clarisonic.  You get what you pay for.  The Clarisonic is now in my Amazon cart and this is in the garbage!  The face wash that comes with this is equally awful.  Although I usually like Oil of Olay I did not like this!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other cleansing systems, but I&#x27;m not going to be so fast in spending $150+ on a Clarisonic system. At $20 for this product, I certainly cannot complain. My skin has never felt softer or smoother! It is a gradual process of eliminating pores and blemishes, but after 3 months of use, I do see a difference. I did not use the face wash that came in the package- I just use my regular face wash. I also purchased one for my mom and aunt, who also noticed that their skin has become more vibrant. I use it every night (just once a day). Battery life typically lasts me about 5-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing system.</li>
            <li> Works great and helps keep the wrinkles smoother as I age</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the money!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I like the brush its not too harsh on my skin, 4 stars for not rinsing my makeup off well with water i have to add soap to the brush and then it cleans back to white</li>
            <li> bought for my  aunt ,  she said it&#x27;s really  good!</li>
            <li> Great product, I added it to my face cleaning routine every night :)</li>
            <li> A great buy, face feels super soft after use.</li>
            <li> Love love love this.  I have very dry skin and this helps me get the dry skin off so I can moisturize properly.</li>
            <li> this is a christmas gift and hope they like it</li>
            <li> It leaves skin feeling nice and smooth. It is very gentle and I couldn&#x27;t tell that it was doing anything while using it but my skin feels smooth afterwards. It has held up well after months of use. The cleanser that comes with it is nice as well with little microbeads.</li>
            <li> The cleanser was not in my box!</li>
            <li> Sorry but this would be good for a baby- it&#x27;s so gentle. I don&#x27;t think it cleans my sweaty face well after a good workout. I had a hundred dollar model that died so thought I&#x27;d save money and get this... Bad idea.</li>
            <li> Cannot see the improvement clearly, even right after using.</li>
            <li> Came in on time. Works as described and came with an extra tube of cleanser.</li>
            <li> Everyone loved this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my skin clean and&lt;br /&gt;Fresh!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I had an expensive one, but it finally died after a few years of daily use. I decided to try this one given the positive reviews and the great price. I&#x27;m glad I did--the brush is exactly like my old one. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to know if it&#x27;s going to last like my old one did, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Not yet use, hope it will work well.Looks high quality.</li>
            <li> Great product, well worth it.  Can use it in the shower and bath.  See a difference in my skin daily.</li>
            <li> Good brush to use all the time to wash your face.</li>
            <li> Soft brush, two speeds, but not much power.  The exfoliation effect relies mainly on the grainy particles in the cleanser rather than an aggressive rotation of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is probably easier on the skin than rubbing with a washcloth, but I&#x27;m just not sure that I&#x27;ll bother using it everyday.  It does appear to be made well, and it actually came with the necessary batteries.</li>
            <li> Good quality and price as well. Very useful. I use it every other day and find my skin brighter than before.</li>
            <li> Use this at night. My face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Worth the price. My face feels soft and clean! The bristles aren&#x27;t too harsh on my sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> Wife said it made her skin feel great. She&#x27;s happy so I&#x27;m happy. Good price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Ordered one for myself and my son.  He had a bout with acne and need just a little something extra to keep his skin clean.  Worked great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a year now.  It works good for the price.</li>
            <li> The machine does a good job and I&#x27;m glad I found it for a much cheaper price than many other brands. I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;The supplementary cream is a good product, too. I don&#x27;t remember seeing it on the description, so I just conconsider it as a good bonus.</li>
            <li> THIS HAS HELPED MY Acne SOOOOO MUCH!!! THANK YOU TO THE CREATORS OF THIS. 😍😍😍</li>
            <li> We have only had it for a few days. I bought it for my teen daughter, who is prone to break out. I think it&#x27;s a great introductory cleansing system for my teen. The speed and size is perfect for her! The fact that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; is a plus! I have a Clarisonic Plus and don&#x27;t like having to travel with it. This maybe an option for myself as well. I will give it a consideration, after I see how well it works for her face. She proclaimed that her face felt was extra smooth feeling after using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a Clarisonic for a long time, but the price always bugged me. I just knew that device was much less expensive to produce  than $100-plus. When I saw this product, and all of its enthusiastic reviews, I was still skeptical. But I got it this week. It&#x27;s wonderful! Performs exactly as advertised. For about $20! Yeah!! Guess what my sisters and friends are getting for Christmas this year...</li>
            <li> good thing,inexpensive,and more importantly my wife like</li>
            <li> I like this little machine. It is a pretty small machine. I had the full size clarasonic at one point, so when I received this, I was a little surprised it was so small. It works well. I had the unit for about two days and it dropped on the floor of my shower and fell into pieces and I thought, great, now it&#x27;s broken, but I put it back together and the thing kept working. I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> So the moral of the story... great product, but it depends on how your skin will react. I couldn&#x27;t give Olay a &amp;#34;1 star&amp;#34; for the product if it might be my face that doesn&#x27;t react well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this a bit ago and I pretty much use all Olay products on my face. There is nothing wrong with the function and the actual piece of equipment is great. Olay has created a solid product for a great price. The bristles are soft and the spinning is effective. I use it in the shower and it has stood up to any water penetration, so it is definitely water proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars, but I had to pull back one, just for the sake of drawing a little attention to the review and to explain people that it is a great product, but might not be for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not the product&#x27;s fault, it is more how my skin reacted.  The first week I used it, my face broke out. I had weird pimples in places that I didn&#x27;t know would surface on my face.  I figured it was because I was scrubbing up some nasty dirt and exfoliating better than I ever had before. My skin, after the pimples cleared, looked beautiful. It minimized my pores and made it look super smooth and even.  BUT... a week or two later, it broke out again.  I don&#x27;t normally get a lot of pimples... maybe one here or there, but since I&#x27;ve started using this product, it has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, I&#x27;m battling some new pimples that came up recently (pretty sure it&#x27;s the same reason) .. and they either are big red bumps that don&#x27;t have heads to pop (such as a lot of crap coming up from way underneath the skin) or a lot of little ones that can be quickly taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not completely giving up on the product, because I really like it and when my skin is happy, it looks flawless; however, if I keep getting break outs, I will have to stop using it.  I guess for some it might be perfect, or others, it is a nightmare (I&#x27;ve seen some reviews). I am trying to not use it everydayor switch up the days I use it, in hopes that it gets better. It was originally recommended by my derm, but every skin process is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Great product. My skin before using this product was dry with occasional outbreaks. Now, my skin is softer and more radiant. I use it twice a day with my own cleansing product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Came without cleanser,  which wouldn&#x27;t have been a super big deal, but the power of cleaning and flimsy brush head made me return it.</li>
            <li> Since using the cleansing system my breakouts have improved a ton, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I do like this product, however, I am not sure the quality is what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I love most of the Olay products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I couldn&#x27;t afford the famous Clarisonic and I have no regrets! I think it does a really great job. It&#x27;s smaller size works well for your face, any bigger and I&#x27;d think it would be hard to avoid your eyes. I have really dry skin and this works well with any creamy cleanser. It does make the cleanser foam up a bit though, so the creamy ones work better. My skin is a bit too sensitive to use it every day, so three or four mornings a week is enough. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this little gizmo.  I was looking for something to help keep the dead skin removed, to exfoliate, to stimulate circulation for a better complexion, but in fact, it worked the opposite.  The spinning brush is very very soft . . .like a baby hairbrush, and the spinning action is weak enough that if you apply a little pressure, it merely grinds to a halt.  Thus, it doesn&#x27;t really get the face clean AT ALL.  In just a few days, dead skin started building back up, oiliness increased, my complexion appeared dull and muddy.  Not clean or radiant.  I had been doing better with a soapy washcloth and my fingertips and have returned to that method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little tube of exfoliant product seemed to work well enough, but was a very tiny amount  . . . you might say, a sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its good points:  it fits the hand nicely, is waterproof to use in the shower, is lightweight and quiet.  Just not effective.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick ship.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a personal favorite and an essential part of my daily skin cleansing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout highschool and parts of my early adulthood I wouldn&#x27;t clean my face sufficiently, and with often wearing make up- I knew I had to stop being lazy and do something about my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, I felt like I lifted years off my face- in fact my face didn&#x27;t feel like it was my face, my face has improved so much since I first started using it... I use this once a day at night to help clean my skin from the daily impurities and my dermatologist approved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from Rosecea and my skin is sensitive. This little one does a good job of keeping my face baby smooth without irritating it or making me red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: for all those people giving this a low rating just because they like their clarisonic more, PLEASE, don&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s misleading for others in the sense that a good product is a good product if the value and quality are aligned. I&#x27;m sure clarisonic has it&#x27;s pros but this is a GOOD and inexpensive way to get a deep facial cleansing and for most of us it gets the job done. There are always better things out there but don&#x27;t rate down just because you can afford the latter.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve survived without one of these...I use it in the morning to wash my face and it&#x27;s been only 4 days and I can see the difference, my skin is muchhhh smoother.  Thank you olay and Amazon!</li>
            <li> It is okay. I do not feel that &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; clean. I feel a deeper clean using baking soda. This product is not bad, just did not have the amazing clean as the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> My skin care specialist recommended this rotating cleansing brush.  For the price, it is the best I&#x27;ve found.  After 2 weeks of using this brush twice a day, my husband commented on how great and youthful my skin looks. Also, I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning device- works well in the shower and with a variety of products.</li>
            <li> For a Fraction of the cost of the alternative brand I think the pro x is the best! My face looks and feels great after only using it a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my sister got one and loved it. So i was excited to receive it and try it. First thing, i&#x27;m glad it already came with the batteries so i didn&#x27;t have to look for some anymore when i got it. There&#x27;s also a small tube of an Olay cleanser that came with it that you can try. Unfortunately, the cleanser didn&#x27;t agree with me coz after 3 days of using it twice a day, i got pimples popping out all over my face! SO i jsut went back and used my regular facial cleanser with the device. The device works really, hands down! Normally, when i wipe on my astringent after washing my face, the cotton ball will still be dirty. But after using this device with the olay cleanser or back to my regular cleanser, the cotton ball barely have any brown color on it meaning my face has been really cleaned well! so happy!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. This machine leaves my skin very clean, doesn&#x27;t irritate and works well with cleanser of choice. Don&#x27;t recommend using it in shower as it is water resistant vs water proof. I use it first then enter the shower. Sturdy and easy to clean. Great addition...On the road to picture perfect skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first of this kind of product that I have tried and I love it! It makes my skin so smooth and it feels really good too. I gave it four stars instead of five though because while my skin is definitely softer and feels cleaner, it hasn&#x27;t really seemed to help with breakouts or blackheads.</li>
            <li> My face feels awesome after using this and a great price!</li>
            <li> Very weak, any pressure, at all, will make the brush stop. It&#x27;s just not a real good microdermabrasion brush. Save your money and buy a better one.</li>
            <li> The delivery was extremely fast. I like the fact that they give you  batteries and you can use immediately. It was easy to put together and works very well. I initially thought that the speed should be faster, but after use on the 2nd speed realized I probably would peel my skin off if it was any faster. I&#x27;m not quite sure if I like their facial product, but do know that the device is on point. Inexpensive and effective...can&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li> I would still definitely recommend the Clarosonic over this product, but for the price I think this does what it is supposed to. I wish the bristles were a little shorter, but I found this to be great for once a week exfoliation.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd one, I really like it, I purchased the 3rd one for our home overseas since I was not able to find one like this there, its just perfect, not to harsh, its nice and soft  but its enough to brighten your skin every day in the shower.</li>
            <li> Nice but needs more soap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. The brush is soft and not harmful to face. It&#x27;s not as magical as other said. But, indeed, it&#x27;s a good product and can make you feel fresh after using it. I use it everyday! It&#x27;s worth buying!</li>
            <li> It deserves a five out of five because it definitely does exactly what it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I used it, my skin felt much cleaner than when I use my hands to wash my face.</li>
            <li> does the job :) so glad i got it for a much better price than my local drug stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months, and it&#x27;s made a noticeable difference in my skin. Face feels very clean and bright after use, and is very soft to touch. 100X better than the cheap-o Neutrogena Sonic and you can use it with your normal face wash. The brush is gentle enough for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t clear up deep cystic acne but does seem to help surface acne &amp; black heads, and it creates a very clean palette for applying whatever else you put on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used the Clarisonic so I can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> Excellent product i ever purchased, it works wonders on my face, at last i can see the glow i long dreamed of..</li>
            <li> This is and excellent skin cleansing machine.  After two weeks I can tell a remarkable difference.  My skin glowsand shines upon completing the cleaning regiment.  Helps produce collagen which enhances the appearance of the skin.</li>
            <li> Works ok at beginning.But later doesn&#x27;t change my skin that much.Make my skin a little bit dry.Do not recommend to use everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several of these type of facial brushes etc including the wave which BTW doies not get into your pores at all!!!! THis one works fantastic- the cleanser is a bit abrasive for me but I use that 2-3 times a week anyway as an exfoliater. I&#x27;ve had it for several weeks and the batteries are still going strong too! easy to keep clean and sterile the brush holds up well- as I also use it on my husbands face if he&#x27;s within arms reach of me when I&#x27;m using it because ..hey guys need to exfoliate too right? lol. I use alot of oley products, creams etc and have never been dissappointed in them. FIve stars for this product!!!! Definitely worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> OH MY GOD! This Facial Brush Is AMAZINGGG !!!! If You Are Looking For A Facial Brush Stop Your Search This is the One! My Face looks AND Feels GREAT! I Absolutely Love it&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my upper arms to help exfoliate more in the shower. It does not do enough for that.  Based on what I have seen, I am sure it will work great on facial skin where more care is needed but it does not provide a deep enough scrub for other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cleaner.  It clears up blackheads, and is wonderful on sensitive skin.  I love the two speeds, and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it is a bit too rough for my skin. The skin under my nose is red after I use it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance&#x27; who had/has severe acne. And it has totally changed his skin for the better. Ever since using this, he barely have any severe break outs, and whenever he does have a break out, it does not last as long. He loves it and uses it daily. I use it sometimes and the feeling you get from the brush is so soothing and calming.</li>
            <li> Wonderful facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really gets out all the dirt and makeup and thus keeps my complexion clean. Highly recommended product for daily use.</li>
            <li> This is the first skincare product where I&#x27;ve actually noticed a physical difference right away. I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and while I don&#x27;t have problems with blemishes, blotchiness, etc. I have never had the kind of skin that \\&quot;glows.\\&quot; I want to glow, damnit! :) I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day - morning and night - for about half of the recommended 60 seconds on the low setting (I&#x27;ve heard that it can be too abrasive if you use it daily so I thought I&#x27;d play it safe) and my skin is now super smooth, even, and fresh looking. I bought this as an alternative to Clarisonic, which is a bit pricey for my tastes. Very satisfied so far. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I it an excellent product, I love it. My face it soft and clean as ever. All I have to do is to use it regularly. I am so glad with this purchase.</li>
            <li> But for $20 compared to $200 for the expensive product this is a good one, and worth the money. It also has a sonic mode, so people that are saying it doesn&#x27;t don&#x27;t use it properly. For $20 this is a great value!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product but was hoping the brush would be a little harder .  The brush is good but it will soften even more as you use it.  The product should come with at least 2 brushes.  One brush should be a hard one and the other like the one that  comes with it.</li>
            <li> I love the Pro-X so much that I bought 3 more for my family members for Christmas.  They were very happy with the gifts and use them everyday.  Noticeable change in my face as I have moderate acne.  Great product that compares equally with the expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> This product surprised me especially for such a low price. My face feels so soft. This product works and works well.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my Mother when it was the deal of the day. I use a clarisonic, but didn&#x27;t have that kind of money to spend on a gift. I gave this to my Mom along with Origins skincare and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. Using this actually sloughs off the dead skin that sits on the surface. Once that is sloughed off your product has a chance to soak in. She had been using Origins for a month before buying this, with no positive results. Now after using the brush and Origins for a month and a half I see a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> its the most thing that changed my skin to a better smoother and more young skin .... loved it so much</li>
            <li> This product works really well for what it is.  I was hesitant to invest in the Clarisonic without having ever used a face brush before so I decided to start with a lower priced item first.  I wanted to increase my skin&#x27;s exfoliation and decrease appearance of blackheads on my nose.  After several weeks of use (every other day), I have decreased blackheads and improved my skin&#x27;s overall appearance and feel.  I initially had a few isolated breakouts because the brush brought impurities to the surface (similar to but less harsh than using a prescribed dermatological cream).  Overall, I am very satisfied--especially since this was offered for a great price on Amazon.  Would this item pale in comparison the the Clarisonic?  Perhaps, but if you want to improve the appearance of your skin this item does work quite well.</li>
            <li> I like it. I&#x27;ve used it nearly every night since I got it. It makes my skin feel good. I can&#x27;t tell yet if it helps my skin since I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month, but my skin FEELS better to the touch. I use a variety of different cleansers, some are foamy, some exfoliating (spelled?), and some are super moisturized. The tube that came with the brush is pretty small so luckily I did have others.  It does help to remove more makeup than just using a cleanser or face pad so I know my face is getting clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin clean and fresh</li>
            <li> If you are wanting powerful and stiffer brush this is not for you HOWEVER for the money, it works fine for every few days of scrubbing your face.&lt;br /&gt;2 speeds, I just use the higher one.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it does not irritate my face and you can press harder and stay longer in one spot without worries of being to harsh on your face.  I thought for the money, it got the job done and I did not spend 200.00 for the same effect!</li>
            <li> giving only 2 stars due to defective product. this worked great for about 4 weeks then the buttons stopped woking properly. after 2 weeks of issues with the buttons it stopped working at all even with changing the batteries. i did like the brush. i did not see any dramatic change in my skin, but my face felt much cleaner and it was fast which was wonderful. i have oily acne prone skin, it did not irratate my skin. would give 5 stars if it was still working. i certainly expected this to last longer than 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> So far so good, does what it&#x27;s meant to do without irratating my skin. Price was good, and I feel like my skin gets that extra cleanse.</li>
            <li> I love this scrubber! It is not too scratchy and not too wimpy. I use the cleanser that comes with it or substitute my usual cleanser (Noxzema) without any problem. It has two speeds for greater control and is the perfect size. Why on earth would anyone buy one of the crazy expensive versions?! This one is perfect. My 8 year old son even gave it a go in the tub and said it was &amp;#34;cool, I guess, for something that just cleans you&amp;#34;. High marks from a little boy!</li>
            <li> great product for the price</li>
            <li> I can not believe how different my skin feels. This is wonderful.  Do not hesitate!  I am only sorry I waited so long.</li>
            <li> Overall I like this product. What I did not like it that it was sent to me with dead batteries. Not too much of a big deal except when I received it I just immediately packed it for a trip I was taking and was unable to get batteries for a few days.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush for the face.  I am glad it is safe to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning the face and neck area. You don&#x27;t realize what&#x27;s left behind, after a face wash, until you use the cleaning system</li>
            <li> For a long time, I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase the Clearasonic. I am glad I didn&#x27;t waste $200+ on it. I purchased this Olay dupe and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> Not sure it really makes a difference on my skin.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before.  Very pleased with how gentle and quiet it is. Works well with my cleanser. The size is perfect for my drawer.  My face feel clean, smooth, and not abused.  Wish I had one a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Broke the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> The batteries are a little difficult to insert because the cavity is a little difficult to open, but I&#x27;m sure that is to keep the battery area dry.  Works fine.</li>
            <li> Not really hot about the cleanser that comes with it but the brush works great no matter what cleanser you use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because the scrubs and face masks I was using while deployed weren&#x27;t working. My face never felt fully clean. I was flipping through a magazine and saw this and decided to give it a try. I ordered it and as soon as I got it, I was able to use it right away ... set up was less than 2 minutes. My face felt AMAZING after just one use. It&#x27;s pretty gross, but the white bristles allow you to SEE the dirt that&#x27;s being cleaned away. I saw all the dirt that the masks and scrubs weren&#x27;t getting. Before I knew it, I started to notice this scrub brush in a bunch of females shower caddys. Considering the outstanding results and the cost, I would recommend this to ANY female for daily use. Its small (I have small hands and this fits easily in one hand), lightweight and its quiet.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Makes my skin feel much cleaner and softer. Never tried any of the more expensive kinds but it exfoliates my face and gives it a nice massage. The battery is tricky but just google the brush and you&#x27;ll find a YouTube video that shows you how to do it. Also helps to use a rubber grip of some sort. Then it&#x27;s extremely easy to take off.</li>
            <li> I use mine all the time. So far it is working well. Nothing to go crazy over, but I guess it does okay.</li>
            <li> Can I use my own cleanser with this product?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this almost every day since it arrived and I love it! My face feels and looks so soft and clean when I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s a great product for a great price-- much better price than the Clarisonic version. Five stars!</li>
            <li> was given as a gift and my niece loves it, She uses it all the time it was a great value for the price</li>
            <li> This is so awesome!!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing and works almost as well as my clairsonic. I purchased this for traveling and it works well.</li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed in this product, so I gave it to my 11 year old granddaughter starting with acne,</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful brush to use on my face.  Its so soft but so effective.  I use whatever cleanser I have at the time with this brush and it does create a deeper clean than without the brush.</li>
            <li> It really gets down deep into my pores to clean out all makeup, etc. I use the Olay cleanser and pore minimizer with it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a facial brush without trying it first.  This is inexpensive &amp; my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I bought this on recommendation from my dermatologist. She originally suggested the Clarisonic but for the price difference she said this would work as well. It sure does, wayyyy better than using a washcloth or scrubby pad while being gentle on the face. I do not use the skin product that comes with the brush. I use another foam product she recommended and my skin has not looked this good in years. Pores are smaller and I have no more black heads. Not sure if that is a result of just using the brush nightly or if it is a combination of the foam and cream she has prescribed but I love the clean feeling the brush leaves behind. You do need to replace the brush head monthly and they cost app $10 for 2.</li>
            <li> perfect and great cost</li>
            <li> I love this product. This has helped my skin to be more clear. My skin is more radiant these days.</li>
            <li> As soon as I used this, I was amazed. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t try it sooner. It makes my face clear and smooth, it even helps wake me up in the morning. So thankful that I found this. I encourage any one with blemishes, acne, dull and tired looking skin, or just dirty pores to try this. It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Thank u, yep service was great product really good! I&#x27;m really happy with every thing! And certainly could not complain about the price. Will recommend this product to friends and family, thank u so much.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitate to buy this product at first. But after reading reveiws and reviews about it I decided to go ahead and buy it instead of buying the more expensive brand. I use this everyday with my regular cleanser and have seriously fallen in love with it. My pores have become visibly smaller and my overall face feels clearer. I have oily skin and think that by using this it may have also helped with my oily skin beucase my face feels as though it isnt as oily as it used to be. I would recommend it to anyone before you go buy the CLearsonic. it works just as well for a better price.</li>
            <li> high recommend if you don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on a product like this. i love it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for myself. I looked at the more expensive ones, and boy are they MORE Expensive! I don&#x27;t know how much better they are, or how much better they could be for that amount of money. I&#x27;m over 55 and use it with grainy, exfoliant products and it really gives me smooth skin! Gets make-up off, and moisturizers really seem to penetrate. And it&#x27;s great that you can use it in the shower; a little scrub with the exfoliant, rinse, and your skin feels to clean.</li>
            <li> This facial brush has two speeds, not too harsh on your skin, and great to give a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This brush has dramatically changed my skin. I&#x27;m 27 years old and have combination skin. My T-zone is always very oily, and everything else is dry, dry, dry! Well this brush has solved both problems in less than a month. It buffs away dead skin and leaves my face SILKY smooth. I&#x27;m seriously shocked by how such a low cost product can do such an amazing job. I didn&#x27;t break out excessively before, but I can say that I very rarely have any kind of blemish now. I thought the fact that it took batteries would be a problem, but after using it for 2 minutes twice daily for over a month...the brush still spins just as fast as it did on day 1. I use the brush with the Clinique three step system (just in case anyone was wondering). My only small complaint is that it is not completely waterproof so I can&#x27;t just leave it in the shower. But hey...its 25 bucks! Seriously...buy this now!</li>
            <li> Has significantly cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day. It works great with Burt&#x27;s Bees scrub as well as facial cleanser. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I have ever bought and really like it.</li>
            <li> it is a good product my wife loves it olay makes a very good product what more can i sayitis nice</li>
            <li> Provided heads will not stay attached</li>
            <li> Execellent tool to clean any face.  The brush is soft but effective and the two speeds come in handy for control in sensitive are near the eyes.  Product arrived as specified.</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly and I like the way it cleans my face and the bristles are very soft</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend who swears by it...</li>
            <li> At 38 years old my skin obviously doesn&#x27;t look as fresh or bright as it one did, so I wanted this brush to help with my dull complexion. I do have very sensitive skin that reacts to almost anything with anti-aging ingredients in it, so I didn&#x27;t care for the sample Olay cleanser that this came with. Instead I use this brush with Simple brand cleanser (gel formula in Spring/Summer and moisturizing formula in Fall/ Winter). I love the way my skin looks since I&#x27;ve been using this brush! I also like the way it feels while I&#x27;m cleaning my face, kind of like a spinning massage for my face. My very temperamental skin now looks rejuvenated and fresh.</li>
            <li> I ordered Olay Pro-x from amazon after a lot of research. I use this one twice a week for 1 or 2 min wth olay cleansing lotion.It makes your skin smooth and exfoliates the dead skin  and brings glow to your face. The quality of the product  is good and its upto my expectations.</li>
            <li> Great product! Always leaves my face really smooth!&lt;br /&gt;My sister also loves hers!</li>
            <li> I was so tempted to get the Clarisonic but did not want to shell out $200 for it and am so glad I didn&#x27;t. Does what it says, and I leave it in the shower for greater convenience. Have been using it for close to a month now, and the batteries have yet to run out. I have sensitive yet oily skin, and it works great on me. Would certainly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> For the price, it definitely makes my skin feel cleaner.  The brush head itself could be made softer as other reviewers have noted.  Unlike other reviews, I do not use this in the shower so I cannot comment for in-shower use.  I&#x27;ve also adopted using the brush with other facial cleaners that I prefer to use.  Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> I like the brush a lot, and it&#x27;s not hard on the skin at all. The cream with it is nice too.</li>
            <li> This cleansing brush is ok. Can&#x27;t really tell much of a difference between the low and high settings. I can&#x27;t really tell if its cleaning deep down in my pores either, but I guess for the price its pretty decent. The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> I use this brush twice a day with the tea tree face wash from the Body Shop, my skin feels much better and the acne has reduced drastically. PS: I follow up with a toner and face cream from the Body Shop</li>
            <li> The electric brush works well. It&#x27;s comfortable to hold, seems to apply the cleanser well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t determine anything about the cleanser from the minute amount that comes with in this package. I use the brush with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> this was a wonder purchase for me.  I started using it right away and can already tell a differency in my skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, great results!!  Very impressed!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on saturday and received it today which is tuesday June 25th. My first day using it and it made my face so soft. Another thing I liked about it is it took any foundation I had left on my face. Usually I have to scrub my face at least three times just to remove makeup. I would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I know I shouldn&#x27;t be so excited about washing my face, but with this I just can&#x27;t help it :)  My skin feels softer and smoother after I have used this.  I combine it with Cetaphil for a gentle, but thorough clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for Easter.  I had purchased a cheap 10 dollar one prior for her to try before I bought a better one to see if she actually liked it and would use it.  The only thing I wish this came was the other attachments (if I would have read the description more closely, I would have spent the extra 5 dollars and purchased the toilettree brand because it not only comes with over 5 diff attachments but it also has a much larger handle which I like).  This was still great for my mom and I like that it was has two speeds.  It also came with a sample of the face wash they make (however I make my own exfoliant scrub using sugar, olive oil and lemon juice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price especially compared to the Clarasonic, I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> bought this as a stocking stuffer for myself. It works great, just wish that it came with extra heads. Make sure you order extras.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing! I had doubts about these facial brushes and actually snickered whenever commercials came on.  Now that I&#x27;m pregnant I&#x27;ve developed large patches of really dry skin under my noise that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and wearing foundation to cover the redness only made the dry skin stand out even more.  I bought this in a desperate attempt to feel better about my skin and I&#x27;m delighted to say it&#x27;s one of my favorite purchases!  It scrubs just enough to get dead skin off but not enough that your face feels raw or over-scrubbed.</li>
