    <ol>
            <li>It has an absolutely delicious fragrance that wafts through the house whenever I draw a bath.</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent to complement the body lotion.  </li>
            <li>This is probably the best Eucalyptus bath gel.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good though!</li>
            <li>It is one of my all-time favourites and I will happily purchase this over and over again.</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift for my husband, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>all in all, it is worth the money to me, but not the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>has a good smell and leaves nice smoothness to skin.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Now I will have to find a nice box to put the bubble bath in...</li>
            <li>But makes nice bubbles for the kids.</li>
            <li>Greatly scented, worth the money.</li>
            <li>A wonderful scent and loads of soft soothing lather.  </li>
            <li>I love the eucalyptus products in this line.</li>
            <li>She really enjoyed it along with the tub pillow and a glass of wine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to order more.. a bit pricey, but i will buy more to spoil myself..</li>
            <li>This is fabulous and luxurious bubble bath!  </li>
            <li>Smells great and bubbles very well.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents for the bath, and it&#x27;s unisex, so my husband could use it, too.</li>
            <li>We both love the smell.</li>
            <li>i absolutely can spend an hour or more in the tub with these bubbles!  </li>
            <li>but it makes your skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Turned on the jets and the bubbles filled the tub.  </li>
            <li>The hard crystals make wonderful lingerie sachets.</li>
            <li>so I used a cap full.  </li>
            <li>A light refreshing fragrance like no other....</li>
            <li>after all, i&#x27;m worth it...</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>Although a little pricey, the quality is always good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bubble up as much as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>I cannot praise it too highly!</li>
            <li>No instructions on how much to use</li>
            <li>This is a very relaxing aromatic bath/soak.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say as I&#x27;ve ever used it, but it smells better than some of the other eucalyptus products my wife has.</li>
            <li>You can not hardly rinse off with bath gel!</li>
            <li>A little more citrus scented than I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>worth the money as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The only problem is using it up too fast!  </li>
            <li>I tried out 3 different bubble baths through Amazon and this by far was the winner!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fab scent skyrocket price</li>
            <li> I love the eucalyptus products in this line. I order over and over again! Greatly scented, worth the money.</li>
            <li> This foaming bath smells luscious.  It doesn&#x27;t bubble up as much as I&#x27;d like but it makes your skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my wife.  She really enjoyed it along with the tub pillow and a glass of wine.</li>
            <li> This was for a gift. It did not come in a gift box or any box except the shipping box. It came in plastic wrap only. Now I will have to find a nice box to put the bubble bath in...adds to my cost of the gift, and this bubble bath was not inexpensive.</li>
            <li> ...to me, it is hard to recommend because it boils down to whether you like the scent or not.  Doesn&#x27;t generate a lot of bubbles but water is hard here so....all in all, it is worth the money to me, but not the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> acceptable bath oil.  has a good smell and leaves nice smoothness to skin.  worth the money as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I tried out 3 different bubble baths through Amazon and this by far was the winner! It has an absolutely delicious fragrance that wafts through the house whenever I draw a bath. I cannot praise it too highly!</li>
            <li> A light refreshing fragrance like no other.... i told my husband to skip buying me anything for my birthday so i could purchase every thing in the product line!  It&#x27;s uplifting and soothing all at the same time. I&#x27;m about to order more.. a bit pricey, but i will buy more to spoil myself.. after all, i&#x27;m worth it...</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent to complement the body lotion.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best Eucalyptus bath gel.  I would recommend all of Thymes products. Although a little pricey, the quality is always good.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous and luxurious bubble bath!  i absolutely can spend an hour or more in the tub with these bubbles!  Treat yourself!</li>
            <li> Label is misleading. I thought it was for body bathing. It should have said BUBBLEBATH on the front of the bottle</li>
            <li> The scent is perfection. It is one of my all-time favourites and I will happily purchase this over and over again.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as promised. No problems at all. A little more citrus scented than I was hoping for. But makes nice bubbles for the kids.</li>
            <li> Smells great and bubbles very well.  No instructions on how much to use so I used a cap full.  Turned on the jets and the bubbles filled the tub.  Next time I will use a lot less.  This bottle will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents for the bath, and it&#x27;s unisex, so my husband could use it, too.</li>
            <li> Luxurious. The hard crystals make wonderful lingerie sachets.</li>
            <li> This is a very relaxing aromatic bath/soak. worth the price. Just use as directed, it foams up well, no need to overpour ( as I did 1st time).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! However, i needed shower gel and ordered bath liquid. You can not hardly rinse off with bath gel! i need to reorder shower gel. Smells so good though!</li>
            <li> A wonderful scent and loads of soft soothing lather.  The only problem is using it up too fast!  I wish they would make a larger size (and lower the price a little)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say as I&#x27;ve ever used it, but it smells better than some of the other eucalyptus products my wife has. As I said my wife loves it and she puts up with me, so she deserves it!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my husband, and it&#x27;s great. We both love the smell. Makes for a relaxing bubble bath!</li>
