            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Love this brand!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Really nice color.</li>
            <li>Perfect color, nice pleasant smell, super easy to use and gives me a nice overall color and also is great for covering the gray!  </li>
            <li>I was happy to be able to purchase this online, and have it shipped right to my home.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a home hair dye that I&#x27;m in love with,</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the appropriate amount of time, I rinsed off the dye as directed.  </li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>I love this hair color</li>
            <li>unlike most hair color</li>
            <li>so figured I&#x27;d give this one a try since it was inexpensive but still from a reputable brand that I&#x27;m very familiar</li>
            <li>Easy to apply too.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and colors well.</li>
            <li>the last few times I have dyed my hair and I am very satisfied at how healthy it makes my hair look while also giving it a beautiful color and gorgeous shine.</li>
            <li>Love the color and easy to apply even for a first timer coloring there hair!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair looking amazing leaving a  nice overall shine!</li>
            <li>Said I would get this free pkg3 for writing a review so I am.</li>
            <li>I find it an important part of dying your hair.</li>
            <li>color was spot on, but honestly that wasn&#x27;t too much of a concern since I sometimes go a shade darker or lighter.  </li>
            <li>Just a warning, this hair dye made my hair a little more &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34; than I probably would have liked but it does look good and fairly true to the color on the box.</li>
            <li>Love this color..looks exactly like the color of the box once applied to your hair..</li>
            <li>Next time I will know better, but it would be nice if you could display the products side by side on screen to make the selection clearer.</li>
            <li>However it does tend to fade rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Good color and has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>It covered all my gray and none of it washed out with my first wash after applying!</li>
            <li>The hairdresser noticed the difference right away, and actually the product didn&#x27;t do a very good job of coloring the gray, especially at the temples.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every product out there, and this is the truest to &amp;#34;light brown.&amp;#34;  I love it and have bought several boxes so that I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>but I certainly didn&#x27;t have any problems and the price was right.</li>
            <li>The color is vibrant and lasts!</li>
            <li>Came out a little redder than I planned but its fun to have a change in life once in a while :)</li>
            <li>Works just fine and lasts as long as I think a boxed color would.</li>
            <li>It came out easily, but it left my hair extremely dry</li>
            <li>My two year old kept coming to the door holding her nose saying stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and not wire feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves your hair shiny and soft</li>
            <li>Hair color discontinued, and pkgs are old.  </li>
            <li>I have order 6 bxs twice, both were old 2007 and 2008.</li>
            <li>Natural looking color.</li>
            <li>I will know better next time, but in the meantime I wasted time on a hair coloring that didn&#x27;t work and money on three boxes of it</li>
            <li>It was slightly darker than I expected but turned out ok</li>
            <li>The instructions were very clear and applying the dye was as expected.  </li>

            <li> So loved this color. It covered all my gray and none of it washed out with my first wash after applying! Perfect color for Summer.</li>
            <li> Said I would get this free pkg3 for writing a review so I am.</li>
            <li> Love the color and easy to apply even for a first timer coloring there hair! The price is also good! Leaves hair without a drying feel to it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hair dye - what else can I say? It did it&#x27;s job without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> There are two products with similar names and numbers:  This one and Clairol Balsam CREME color 608.  I didn&#x27;t realize that.  I thought that I was getting the creme but got this one.  The hairdresser noticed the difference right away, and actually the product didn&#x27;t do a very good job of coloring the gray, especially at the temples.  I will know better next time, but in the meantime I wasted time on a hair coloring that didn&#x27;t work and money on three boxes of it (I can no longer find this product in stores and thus have to get it on line, in packages of 3).  Next time I will know better, but it would be nice if you could display the products side by side on screen to make the selection clearer.</li>
            <li> Great color, just wondering why none of the boxes had a conditioning packet.  Does this brand not include it?  I find it an important part of dying your hair.</li>
            <li> Really nice color. Easy to apply too.</li>
            <li> It was slightly darker than I expected but turned out ok</li>
            <li> Overall, the hair color worked.  I have a few grays and color my hair about every 6 weeks.  I haven&#x27;t found a home hair dye that I&#x27;m in love with, so figured I&#x27;d give this one a try since it was inexpensive but still from a reputable brand that I&#x27;m very familiar with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color was spot on, but honestly that wasn&#x27;t too much of a concern since I sometimes go a shade darker or lighter.

            <li> I have been trying Clairol brand the last few times I have dyed my hair and I am very satisfied at how healthy it makes my hair look while also giving it a beautiful color and gorgeous shine. The color lasts quite a while too before any touch ups or re-dyes.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and not wire feeling. Love this brand!</li>
            <li> Works okay... I used 4 boxes , not getting the same result</li>

            <li> I love this hair color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair shiny and soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is as stated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use  and great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from Amazon on sale</li>

            <li> Good color and has lasted a long time. Didn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
            <li> See previous review.  Hair color discontinued, and pkgs are old.  I have order 6 bxs twice, both were old 2007 and 2008.</li>

            <li> Good price. Natural looking color. However it does tend to fade rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this when there was a coupon and three at a time, saved a bunch of money on a product I already use.</li>
