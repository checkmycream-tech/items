            <li>Perfect for my needs, but 3 for $ 25.00 was a little pricy when compared to Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>

            <li>Real cotton terry, not microfiber which can break the hair.  </li>

            <li>I will buy again and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So nice to find the heavy kind - not the thin microfiber that catches on the fingers.  </li>
            <li>I try to leave the turbie on for about ten minutes to really get as much liquid out as I can.  </li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY my granddaughters because it so much nicer that a bath towel on their heads..</li>
            <li>It makes things so easy when finishing a shower-no hair dripping all down your back!</li>
            <li>Each item is nicely enclosed in a little mess bag.</li>

            <li> They save you from having to use a second towel for your hair and keep you from dripping on yourself while you towel dry after a shower.</li>
            <li> Other varieties attach with buttons that are constantly falling off.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>

            <li> , i gave 1 turbie to my mom and the other to my sister</li>
            <li> The turbie, on the other hand, is something that you can put on your hair/head without hardly any bulk and it stays put while I do all the other things I need to get done.  </li>
            <li> that when I touch the microfiber it &amp;#34;catches&amp;#34; on my skin and feels a little like rubbing sand paper.  </li>
            <li> and it takes forever to air dry it, especially if I am not able to towel dry it</li>
            <li> Just wash them at least every other use.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t shrunk or anything like others I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> they are real cotton and are sooo thick!!!!  </li>
            <li> I avoid hair dryers because I heard that hair dryers can damage delicate hair.</li>
            <li> but I hate to subject my hair to the heat</li>
            <li> Very thick and absorbent!</li>

            <li> These are the classic all cotton Turbie Twists. Each item is nicely enclosed in a little mess bag. Great for gift giving. Made of thick absorbent cotton, and it&#x27;s a pretty beige color. No bright neon colors like so many are nowadays.</li>
            <li> I love the all cotton Turbie Twist hair towels.  I have very long hair and it takes forever to air dry it, especially if I am not able to towel dry it well beforehand.  I can blow it dry but I hate to subject my hair to the heat all the time not to mention spending a lot of time just drying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a towel but that is bulky and they are always falling apart as I go about doing other things.  The turbie, on the other hand, is something that you can put on your hair/head without hardly any bulk and it stays put while I do all the other things I need to get done.  I try to leave the turbie on for about ten minutes to really get as much liquid out as I can.  I then comb my hair and let it air dry or blow dry as I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this so well, I have purchased various sets for all my friends and family over the years.  It is a great product and one that I have used for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this package of 3 turbie twist and i&#x27;m really pleased with them, at the moment i received the package my hair was to long and the turbie covered all of it , i gave 1 turbie to my mom and the other to my sister they just love to use it every morning.&lt;br /&gt;I would definetely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs, but 3 for $ 25.00 was a little pricy when compared to Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 sets. To give to all my female family members because I have had one for 3 years and I love mine...they are real cotton and are sooo thick!!!!  I want to give one to all the females in my family...ESPECIALLY my granddaughters because it so much nicer that a bath towel on their heads..These are top quality!!!</li>
            <li> The quality is really good.  They haven&#x27;t shrunk or anything like others I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. The color is exactly as described too.</li>
            <li> Love these things! They don&#x27;t wear out your neck like a towel does when you have your hair up in it. I will definitely buy more when and if these every get worn out.</li>
            <li> Very happy with them. Just wash them at least every other use. They tend to get a smell after awhile.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many Turbie Towels, looking for one to replace an old one I loved.  The microfiber ones just don&#x27;t work  - living in the desert my hands are so dry that when I touch the microfiber it &amp;#34;catches&amp;#34; on my skin and feels a little like rubbing sand paper.  These cotton towels are perfect and they dry my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> This is the hair towel I was searching for.  Real cotton terry, not microfiber which can break the hair.  The packaging is also a plus.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair I avoid hair dryers because I heard that hair dryers can damage delicate hair. These hair towels help my hair dry faster and keep my hair out of my face while I get ready.</li>
            <li> Purchased these because they are cotton.&lt;br /&gt;They work very well.  I like the three pack!&lt;br /&gt;Was able to give one as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice.  I use the hair towel after every&lt;br /&gt;shower.  Easy to through in the washer and drier.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect!</li>
            <li> Use daily to dry my hair, very absorbant more so thaan the micro fiber out on the market today.  I love my new towels would buy more as soon as I wear these out!</li>
            <li> Good product. Great delivery time. Arrived as promised. Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good and thick. Actually the thickest and best ones I have bought and I have been using these for years.</li>
            <li> Have had several over the years--some cotton and some microfiber?  Love all, but theses new ones are thicker and fluffier than the old ones.  Love the feel and absorption.  Great!</li>
            <li> I love this version! I don&#x27;t like the microfiber version because they don&#x27;t seem very absorbent. Earlier versions of the terry cloth version were thinner than I&#x27;d have liked. Other varieties attach with buttons that are constantly falling off. (And a bonus are the cute little sacks that they come in, which I&#x27;m finding useful for a variety of purposes.)</li>
            <li> I love this towel!  It makes things so easy when finishing a shower-no hair dripping all down your back! I am replacing a Turbie Twist that I have had for more than 10 years!</li>
            <li> These are for my wife, and although she hasn&#x27;t used one yet, she&#x27;s thrilled - having read reviews and such.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was on time and condition equally as perfect.</li>
            <li> So nice to find the heavy kind - not the thin microfiber that catches on the fingers.  It&#x27;s also great that they are just plain beige - not the neon colors that don&#x27;t go with anything in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> These towels have great absorbency (equal to, or, greater than my previous microfiber towel). The natural cotton color is nice. When I wrap them they stay on well. I love that three come together and each are packaged well enough to give away as gifts. I will buy again and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these head wraps in terry cloth for sometime. I found plenty in  microfiber but they just are not as absorbent as the terry cloth ones.Finally I found them here. These are very quite nice looking and seem to  be of a good weight and quality. I can&#x27;t wait to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They  are nicely packaged with  with each one individually  wrapped and if I can bear  to part with it, I may  give one to a friend who has been trying to replace a terry cloth robe with a hood to no avail. She likes the hoods for  drying her hair.  I told her if she could find these in terry cloth, she  wouldn&#x27;t miss the hood on a robe.</li>
            <li> My daughters and I love these.  They save you from having to use a second towel for your hair and keep you from dripping on yourself while you towel dry after a shower.</li>
            <li> very excellent quality.  Very absorbent.  I love them.</li>
            <li> I have been using hair towels for years, but these are by far the best! Very thick and absorbent! And I love the color! I really like the elastic band holder. Much preferred over the button offered by other brands.</li>
