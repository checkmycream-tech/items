            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>but often I only use 2 pins and they hold perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I love being able to get my hair off my neck and out of my face without using a damaging elastic.  </li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>MAGIC.</li>
            <li>I have two daughters in the house and none of us have been able to figure out how these are supposed to stay in our hair.</li>
            <li>Much better than bobby pins.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hugely pleased. :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m also not the most skilled at doing hair so that may be overkill but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more</li>
            <li>It wet, and it dries into perfect spirals.</li>
            <li>I find the tighter I pull together my hair, the more secure the updo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to get my fine, smooth hair to stay in a bun until I tried these.  </li>
            <li>These are so cool!</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to twist in and twist out.</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use and no pain.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smooth, don&#x27;t rip or snag, and are so easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my staple look to give a quick twist of the hair, spin this in and done!</li>
            <li>These pins work fabulously in both of our hair.  </li>
            <li>can secure it all day, even at the gym.  </li>
            <li>bundle up your hair and screw the pins into the bun to secure it.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>These pins are amazing because they make a very neat bun with no strays at all that stays all day.  </li>
            <li>I very rarely need to fix it with my spin pins, and even if I do, it takes about 10 seconds and doesn&#x27;t require a mirror.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t leave the line that hairbands do, and they&#x27;re quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>These pins are super easy to use, but it does take some practice.</li>
            <li>I think these would be especially good for people with sensitive scalps since you only need two for an up-do and the tips are rounded and comfortable.</li>
            <li>and once I got the angle right, I was able to wear a side bun for the first time.</li>
            <li>The bun falls out a bit more quickly when I made it with dry hair, but these are still amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hair impaired, but with spin pins I&#x27;m easily able to pull off a decent bun in no time.</li>
            <li>Use them all the time for a quick bun.</li>
            <li>Loved them in the summer when I had very long hair, then was convinced it pulled my &amp;#34;face down&amp;#34; by my daughter</li>
            <li>These hold it up fine, but i can&#x27;t figure out how to not have straight spikes of hair stick out.  </li>
            <li>One of these little guys does a great job with holding my hair and 2</li>
            <li>Such an amazing invention.</li>
            <li>The blonde pins blend nicely with my hair.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>I have hip length hair, full, but very straight, very heavy, very fine textured, and light brown in color.</li>
            <li>I bought these and almost instantly fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>I have more hair than any human being could ever want.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they work, but they really do!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really only good for buns, so far as I can tell, but they make a much nicer looking bun than a hair elastic does.</li>
            <li>When I first got these</li>
            <li>thing I do is put the first one in</li>
            <li>Without first making a pony-tail, the bun gets flattened out and I prefer a rounder bun.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried using them for a French twist, but I&#x27;m sure these pins could hold it up.  </li>
            <li>Almost all other reviewers also love these pins - for all kinds of hair!  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>and these are the only &#x27;pins&#x27; that work in my hair :)</li>
            <li>This is a great idea, but I think my hair is too thick.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s intended for &amp;#34;light hair&amp;#34; it still doesn&#x27;t match platinum blondes, only slightly more natural light tones.</li>
            <li>and that is exactly what I get with the spin pins.</li>
            <li>which is how I got my first set.</li>
            <li>but these worked really well in the hot sweaty summers in GA to get it off my neck.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>The messy bun is in style right now, so these will be useful for more than yard work.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to do even without using a mirror.  </li>
            <li>I love these things, I&#x27;m glad I found them in a lighter color because I can only find them in dark colors at the store.</li>
            <li>They work fine, but I only really see myself using them for one style--putting my hair up in a bun.</li>
            <li>A tip: they work best on wet or damp hair, at least for my shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>so I could almost need a third pin to really get it secure.  </li>
            <li>I have even ended up in unusual situations, such as a hike or dancing, and they kept my hair secure.  </li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>Bought them on a whim, didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li>If I want to run or something, I tend to need a hair band and these pins, but it holds the whole time.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>But just having a hairstyle I can do in under ten minutes is fabulous.</li>
            <li>My daughter, however, has straight thinner hair</li>
            <li>far once my hair is up in these I&#x27;ve been able to go out dancing, move cows, spend the afternoon outside in the wind and rain, chase a toddler, etc without my hair moving an inch.</li>
            <li>Also says you need to use two but for thin hair only one works great!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine curly hair and these two pins</li>
            <li>Works better on half my hair.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say you don&#x27;t need a hair elastic, but I normally use one.  </li>
            <li>With a normal band, the bun will stay for a while, unless I run, but I have to re-do it all day.</li>
            <li>New favorite things, these little guys.</li>
            <li>think these would come in handy for doing a little girl&#x27;s hair because traditional bobby pins can hurt.</li>
            <li>then the second one goes in perpendicular to the first, rather than directly across (which is what I believe the directions say to do).</li>
            <li>These are amazing, my hair is about mid-thigh length, very thick</li>
            <li>They are so much better than using several little bobby pins that stick out and snag your hair.  </li>
            <li>These disappear into my hair completely.</li>
            <li>Mine is absurdly thick, smooth, straight, and slippery.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it would be easier with thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li>that is straight on the top half and gets wavy and thicker on the bottom half.</li>
            <li>They create a secure, but messy bun that stays in place through moderate activity.  </li>
            <li>I have LONG, thick curly hair and these pins really hold and are comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Because it is so long, I really like to wear it in a nice casual bun for school and work.</li>
            <li>Now I can have a clean, uncluttered look of a plain, simple bun.  </li>
            <li>I bought these hoping they&#x27;d keep my hair up since, apparently, I&#x27;m incapable of running bobby pins.</li>
            <li>I need the shorter ones to get longer apparently.</li>
            <li>I know long, thick hair is supposed to be a good thing, but it&#x27;s not when you look like Hermione with it down and get headaches when you put it up.</li>
            <li>I like wearing my hair in a bun, but it&#x27;s thick and stubborn and requires so many pins that I would frequently leave it down or just in a ponytail.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little practice to get them in right - even my husband has the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair (down to my lower back)</li>
            <li>These little pins really do hold hair up all day.  </li>

            <li> The instructions say you don&#x27;t need a hair elastic, but I normally use one.  </li>
            <li> With a normal band, the bun will stay for a while, unless I run, but I have to re-do it all day.</li>
            <li> New favorite things, these little guys.</li>
            <li> think these would come in handy for doing a little girl&#x27;s hair because traditional bobby pins can hurt.</li>
            <li> then the second one goes in perpendicular to the first, rather than directly across (which is what I believe the directions say to do).</li>
            <li> These are amazing, my hair is about mid-thigh length, very thick</li>
            <li> They are so much better than using several little bobby pins that stick out and snag your hair.  </li>
            <li> These disappear into my hair completely.</li>
            <li> Mine is absurdly thick, smooth, straight, and slippery.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it would be easier with thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li> that is straight on the top half and gets wavy and thicker on the bottom half.</li>
            <li> They create a secure, but messy bun that stays in place through moderate activity.  </li>
            <li> I have LONG, thick curly hair and these pins really hold and are comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Because it is so long, I really like to wear it in a nice casual bun for school and work.</li>
            <li> Now I can have a clean, uncluttered look of a plain, simple bun.  </li>
            <li> I bought these hoping they&#x27;d keep my hair up since, apparently, I&#x27;m incapable of running bobby pins.</li>
            <li> I need the shorter ones to get longer apparently.</li>
            <li> I know long, thick hair is supposed to be a good thing, but it&#x27;s not when you look like Hermione with it down and get headaches when you put it up.</li>
            <li> I like wearing my hair in a bun, but it&#x27;s thick and stubborn and requires so many pins that I would frequently leave it down or just in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little practice to get them in right - even my husband has the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair (down to my lower back)</li>
            <li> These little pins really do hold hair up all day.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had long hair to style and mine is thick and naturally wavy,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair, and am amazed these two little pins can disappear into my bun and hold it so securely.</li>
            <li> But to actually hold my hair in one of those loose looking styles is unprecedented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> to long hair-dos.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and it would take 8-10 bobby pins to achieve a reasonable hold.  </li>
            <li> I have a LOT of hair (thick and all the way down my back) and this is the first hair tie that holds my hair well in a bun.</li>
            <li> If you have layered hair, it&#x27;s a little more difficult to keep all the ends in.</li>
            <li> I put my collarbone-length hair into a low, messy bun at 7:30am, did gardening and yard work for a couple hours, and five hours later, the bun is still holding.  </li>
            <li> I can pull off a french twist well, but anything else often takes a lot of time, not to mention I don&#x27;t like to use too much elastic because I don&#x27;t want to have to cut my hair because of broken hairs and split ends.</li>
            <li> She teaches school and prefers loose, breezy hairstyles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently grown my hair past my shoulders and always looking for simple ways to keep it up.</li>
            <li> I did use two other long pins on the side to help hold the edges.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to get tight enough to hold my hair in place.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, The aren&#x27;t working as well since I had layers put in a few months back.</li>
            <li> My hair is a bit thin, and I do have to make a fairly tight but, they are never uncomfortable and they do not damage the hair at all.</li>
            <li> The instructions say not to let the 2 pins intertwine, but I don not really see why - as long as you &amp;#34;unscrew&amp;#34; rather than try to pull the out they never give me trouble.  </li>
            <li> I usually need several bobby pins to pull off an updo.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> FYI - This pack contained 2 spin pins, I&#x27;ve ordered packs before that came with more than 2.</li>
            <li> I love these. I&#x27;m hair impaired, but with spin pins I&#x27;m easily able to pull off a decent bun in no time.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use but the instructions say not to cross the pins &amp; I have found that hard to do based on the size of my hair once in a bun as instructed. Otherwise though it holds my hair through an 8 hour work day &amp; I usually cannot use traditional clips as my hair escapes them (mid-way down back, a lot of it but individual strands are thin).</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and it would take 8-10 bobby pins to achieve a reasonable hold.  Then the pins would damage my hair as I was taking them out.  One of these little guys does a great job with holding my hair and 2 is better than a dozen pins.  The blonde pins blend nicely with my hair.  Great product.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use.  I usually need several bobby pins to pull off an updo.  I can get my hair up with 2 or 3 spin pins.  So easy!</li>
            <li> I bought these and almost instantly fell in love with them. They&#x27;re smooth, don&#x27;t rip or snag, and are so easy. I like wearing my hair in a bun, but it&#x27;s thick and stubborn and requires so many pins that I would frequently leave it down or just in a ponytail. Creating a side bun was impossible too, by the way. As soon as I tried these, I could feel that my hair wasn&#x27;t going anywhere and once I got the angle right, I was able to wear a side bun for the first time. I will be using these all the time, especially in the summer!</li>
            <li> These are easy to use, durable and create great buns. Definitely a must buy for anyone who loves a messy bun! However, I do end up using a few bobby pins to make the bun a bit neater</li>
            <li> Been using for years due to work  requirement of hair being up. Works great. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing. I have more hair than any human being could ever want. I know long, thick hair is supposed to be a good thing, but it&#x27;s not when you look like Hermione with it down and get headaches when you put it up. But these weird spiral things have come to my rescue. Top buns are all compact with them, and NEVER hurt. Ever. Magic. I also discovered that they work well to put hair half-up. New favorite things, these little guys. Now if someone could figure out how to make a hair device for those of us with hair heavier than iron, that&#x27;d be the best.</li>
            <li> I had a set, bought these for my sister.  She and I have completely opposite hair.  Hers is thin, coarse, loose, and curly.  Mine is absurdly thick, smooth, straight, and slippery.  These pins work fabulously in both of our hair.  I use mine to make a reliable tight bun before a shift as a veterinary nurse.  She teaches school and prefers loose, breezy hairstyles.  We both love spin pins.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with these things!</li>
            <li> I had my doubts but these are nice to have around.  The instructions say not to let the 2 pins intertwine, but I don not really see why - as long as you &amp;#34;unscrew&amp;#34; rather than try to pull the out they never give me trouble.  My hair is a bit thin, and I do have to make a fairly tight but, they are never uncomfortable and they do not damage the hair at all.</li>
            <li> These are so cool! I don&#x27;t know why they work, but they really do! They go in super easily and come out beautifully without hurting my hair. They&#x27;re really only good for buns, so far as I can tell, but they make a much nicer looking bun than a hair elastic does.</li>
            <li> These things rock! Use them all the time for a quick bun. It&#x27;s my staple look to give a quick twist of the hair, spin this in and done!</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping they&#x27;d keep my hair up since, apparently, I&#x27;m incapable of running bobby pins. Or my hair is incapable of keeping them in. Either way, buns are not something my hair does with ease. My hair is currently past my shoulders and I&#x27;m growing out my layers. When I first got these I had a really hard time getting them to catch all my hair and stay in. With practice I&#x27;m now able to put my hair up and have it not move *at all* during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do is put the first one in so it catches my ends then the second one goes in perpendicular to the first, rather than directly across (which is what I believe the directions say to do). They do end up crossing/catching on each other but I&#x27;ve never had a problem getting them back out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far once my hair is up in these I&#x27;ve been able to go out dancing, move cows, spend the afternoon outside in the wind and rain, chase a toddler, etc without my hair moving an inch.</li>
            <li> I got these to try to achieve a &amp;#34;classier&amp;#34; bun while at work.  At first, they seemed like the best thing ever, but I realized after a while that they don&#x27;t work as well as hoped with my layered hair.  I still always have little bits sticking out the sides.  Also, my cats think they&#x27;re toys and so I lose them all the time.  All in all, I&#x27;d say they were an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; purchase - not a life changer.</li>
            <li> I love them. They work on my hair.</li>
            <li> These little pins really do hold hair up all day.  I have long, fine curly hair and these two pins can secure it all day, even at the gym.  They are simple to use - simply bundle up your hair and screw the pins into the bun to secure it.  It&#x27;s easy enough to do even without using a mirror.  The instructions say you don&#x27;t need a hair elastic, but I normally use one.  Without first making a pony-tail, the bun gets flattened out and I prefer a rounder bun.  I have no problem getting the pins through the bundle of hair at the elastic.  I haven&#x27;t tried using them for a French twist, but I&#x27;m sure these pins could hold it up.  They are so much better than using several little bobby pins that stick out and snag your hair.  The spin pins are painless and virtually invisible once they&#x27;re in.  I think these would be especially good for people with sensitive scalps since you only need two for an up-do and the tips are rounded and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Almost all other reviewers also love these pins - for all kinds of hair!  Fabulous.  My hair is very thin, straight, and long, but is a very small bun when I twist it up.  These pins are amazing because they make a very neat bun with no strays at all that stays all day.  And, they don&#x27;t break my hair at all the way a band or a barrette does.  Now I can have a clean, uncluttered look of a plain, simple bun.  Before I used clips that were really too heavy for my thin hair and they looked so clunky.  I use the smaller size (set of 3) but often I only use 2 pins and they hold perfectly.  Hope you like them too!</li>
            <li> Awesome and fun to use.  Takes a few practice tries but work well when you get the hang of it.  My hair isn&#x27;t very thick and I&#x27;m sure it would be easier with thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to get my fine, smooth hair to stay in a bun until I tried these.  I put my collarbone-length hair into a low, messy bun at 7:30am, did gardening and yard work for a couple hours, and five hours later, the bun is still holding.  For my hair, this is nothing short of miraculous.  I love being able to get my hair off my neck and out of my face without using a damaging elastic.  The messy bun is in style right now, so these will be useful for more than yard work.  The price at my supermarket was $3.27.</li>
            <li> Loved them in the summer when I had very long hair, then was convinced it pulled my &amp;#34;face down&amp;#34; by my daughter so I cut it all off and now I miss the hair but these worked really well in the hot sweaty summers in GA to get it off my neck. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> They work fine, but I only really see myself using them for one style--putting my hair up in a bun.</li>
            <li> I love these things. Makes the perfect bun. I put my hair I. It wet, and it dries into perfect spirals.</li>
            <li> I used these in the past but lost one of the spins. This was my second time buying these. These work really well. HOWEVER, The aren&#x27;t working as well since I had layers put in a few months back. I need the shorter ones to get longer apparently.</li>
            <li> Small, inexpensive help for med. to long hair-dos.</li>
            <li> OMG these things are perfect! I was NEVER able to put my hair up in anything other than a ponytail. However, these keep my hair in a bun even at work. Work consists of alot of bending and moving and the bun STAYS! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> MAGIC. Bought them on a whim, didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. A tip: they work best on wet or damp hair, at least for my shorter hair.  The bun falls out a bit more quickly when I made it with dry hair, but these are still amazing.  They don&#x27;t leave the line that hairbands do, and they&#x27;re quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are pretty cool.  My hair is really thick and long so I could almost need a third pin to really get it secure.  It&#x27;s also a bit of a learning curve to get the pins through the bun and the hair below.  Still a neat idea.  Works better on half my hair.  Comes out without tangling.</li>
            <li> I have two daughters in the house and none of us have been able to figure out how these are supposed to stay in our hair.</li>
            <li> Revolutionary! Just two pins holds my medium/long hair in a bun or updo all day. I have even ended up in unusual situations, such as a hike or dancing, and they kept my hair secure.  Easy to twist in and twist out. Much better than bobby pins. I thank the inventor.</li>
            <li> These are amazing, my hair is about mid-thigh length, very thick and these are the only &#x27;pins&#x27; that work in my hair :) I take ballet and they work for a really solid bun!</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of hair (thick and all the way down my back) and this is the first hair tie that holds my hair well in a bun. With a normal band, the bun will stay for a while, unless I run, but I have to re-do it all day. With two of these, the bun isn&#x27;t going anywhere all day. If I want to run or something, I tend to need a hair band and these pins, but it holds the whole time. I&#x27;m hugely pleased. :)</li>
            <li> I bought these to make doing my hair for work a little quicker in the morning.  For some reason, the 2 pack was way cheaper per pin than the 3 pack offered by Amazon and you probably only need two at a time, so this pack seems like a no-brainer to me.  They create a secure, but messy bun that stays in place through moderate activity.  I have long, straight blonde-ish hair that isn&#x27;t particularly thick or difficult.  These hold it up fine, but i can&#x27;t figure out how to not have straight spikes of hair stick out.  It&#x27;s probably a mix of user error and uncooperative hair, but i do wish i could create a smoother bun.  I&#x27;ll probably buy another set to have around though, I like letting my bun down and not having ponytail holder bends in it.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, but I think my hair is too thick. They don&#x27;t seem to get tight enough to hold my hair in place. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had long hair to style and mine is thick and naturally wavy,</li>
            <li> Such an amazing invention. I love these things, I&#x27;m glad I found them in a lighter color because I can only find them in dark colors at the store. Even though it&#x27;s intended for &amp;#34;light hair&amp;#34; it still doesn&#x27;t match platinum blondes, only slightly more natural light tones. As a platinum blonde myself, it doesn&#x27;t bother me that the pins are darker though.</li>
            <li> I wish I had these when I was still a ballerina! They work great and are so easy to use. You almost literally screw them into your bun! I have really long hair so I need 3-4 pins to hold my buns but I&#x27;m also not the most skilled at doing hair so that may be overkill but either way, they work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these would come in handy for doing a little girl&#x27;s hair because traditional bobby pins can hurt. These are so easy to use and no pain.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t work on my hair like the picture.  i have tons of pieces that stick out.  however it is very secure.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! I have pretty long hair (down to my lower back) that is straight on the top half and gets wavy and thicker on the bottom half. Because it is so long, I really like to wear it in a nice casual bun for school and work. I like a casual bun, but not a &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; one, and that is exactly what I get with the spin pins. I highly recommend putting your hair in a ponytail first, then twisting your hair and wrapping it around the base of the ponytail. Twist one pin on each side of your bun, and ta-da! You&#x27;re ready to go. No bobby pins, no products. When I used bobby pins I would be fixing my bun all day. I very rarely need to fix it with my spin pins, and even if I do, it takes about 10 seconds and doesn&#x27;t require a mirror. Great for all hair types and lengths.</li>
            <li> Hold a bun all day. Great for a top knot. If you have layered hair, it&#x27;s a little more difficult to keep all the ends in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently grown my hair past my shoulders and always looking for simple ways to keep it up. These pins are super easy to use, but it does take some practice. I find the tighter I pull together my hair, the more secure the updo. Never again will I be without these.</li>
            <li> The best invention ever! Perfect for long hair, hold buns in very nicely! Also says you need to use two but for thin hair only one works great!</li>
            <li> Holds my hair tightly and all day.  Very happy with these!</li>
            <li> We use these to pin up my daughter&#x27;s waist length hair so she can sleep at night. The pins hold well, her hair doesn&#x27;t tangled and it keeps the breakage (we use to braid her hair every night) to a minimum. It only takes a little practice to get them in right - even my husband has the hang of it. We love these!</li>
            <li> I have hip length hair, full, but very straight, very heavy, very fine textured, and light brown in color. I&#x27;m always looking for tools that help me do something other than a boring military bun or plain braid, but don&#x27;t take an hour of braiding, twisting, or require 246 hairpins. I can pull off a french twist well, but anything else often takes a lot of time, not to mention I don&#x27;t like to use too much elastic because I don&#x27;t want to have to cut my hair because of broken hairs and split ends. I felt like these went into the hair very smoothly, without catching or breaking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used these I just made a loop at the base of my neck and threaded the hair through to make a loose knot, then twisted the rest of my hair around this chignon, rolled it up, and twisted the pins in-- One from the top, one from the bottom. It looked freaking amazing. I did use two other long pins on the side to help hold the edges. But to actually hold my hair in one of those loose looking styles is unprecedented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also they come in a light color, which is great. These disappear into my hair completely. They hold up a lot of weight. I&#x27;m ordering more so I can play with more styles! But just having a hairstyle I can do in under ten minutes is fabulous. I&#x27;m an instant fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair, and am amazed these two little pins can disappear into my bun and hold it so securely.</li>
            <li> I have been using these pins for about two years and have just had to replace them. I have LONG, thick curly hair and these pins really hold and are comfortable.  My daughter, however, has straight thinner hair and they do not work for her--which is how I got my first set.</li>
