            <li>something this effective will eventually be outlawed by someone.</li>
            <li>so anywho, I decided to buy my own foot scrub from sallys...</li>
            <li>really nice if you play lot of sports and are often embarrassed about your feet.</li>
            <li>Save your money and do your own pedicures to remove calluses.</li>
            <li>Within seconds, my skin was softer, the cracks seemed to disappear and it was very easy to use -</li>
            <li>This foot rasp is, by far, the FASTEST, and best thing I have used on my dry,callused and cracked feet.</li>
            <li>OMG, the most amazing tool for callus removal ever.  </li>
            <li>great and well worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I love that its a 2 pack</li>
            <li>Love love love this product</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Nice to have callus free feet</li>
            <li>you need it most.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I listened to their advice.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Safe to use.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll damage yourself for sure.</li>
            <li>I bought two...and buying five more now for backups....</li>
            <li>I obliged, and left with the best feeling feet ever.</li>
            <li>I go barefoot or wear flip flops/sandals most of the year and was paying for the upgraded pedicure with the chemical heel treatment every time.  </li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll be able to walk around in flip flops and feel confident.</li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li>I even ordered more for my friends and sisters.</li>
            <li>I searched for this in the beauty supply stores, glad I found it here.  </li>
            <li>Smooth feet ALL of the time!</li>
            <li>Works WAAAAAAY better than that egg thing</li>
            <li>Everything it says and more.  </li>
            <li>Works better then the egg.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Works better than what they use at the nail salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews on this...</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used it a number of times now and am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS TOOL, i use it in the shower to remove any callus off my feet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not a finisher, so for manly feet that&#x27;s probably okay,</li>
            <li>I used this product once and knew it was better than anything I had ever used.</li>
            <li>You just need to pay attention and not take off healthy, tender skin after the callous is gone.  </li>
            <li>Best purchase made in a long time.</li>
            <li>The best use of this product is to use it on dry feet.</li>
            <li>does the job quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>This is a keeper, nice and big and the grip is great too.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried for my dry cracked heels!  </li>
            <li>Effective and economical.</li>
            <li>The rasp is also easy to maneuver because of the handle.</li>
            <li>Very quickly.</li>
            <li>go easy with it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>If I had known how easy it was to use one of these, I don&#x27;t think any one would pay for a pedecure if they knew it was this easy.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The Ped-Egg was nice at first, but the results were not even close to immediate.</li>
            <li>tried the sandpaper-like products that are fine for keeping your feet smooth,  but they can&#x27;t touch this thing.  </li>
            <li>the way, it is important to note that this is a professional-grade product.</li>
            <li>to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and having two in the set in different colors is great.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>As in, &amp;#34;I really CANNOT believe this is so effective</li>
            <li>Great support and solid under pressure.</li>
            <li>He loved it as well, and we all know how most men are about their feet - they only take care of them when the lady tells him to.</li>
            <li>but if you are gentle, it will do a consistent good job without hurting you.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>(and I tried all the popular types and more) took too long.</li>
            <li>At least my feet are perfect now.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my feet which has skin so thick</li>
            <li>I have a smooth heel right after using it.</li>
            <li>Go easy at first</li>
            <li>I have now bought this product for other members of my family and they all think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>; You know, in our world of hyped-up products that don&#x27;t ever really deliver on their promises, it&#x27;s nice to know that the hype is real, but the price won&#x27;t make me squint.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I can give myself a quick pedicure in the shower itself.</li>
            <li>It works quickly.  </li>
            <li>This does the job quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone I am going to order another pack one for my sisters hubby and mine :)</li>
            <li>SAFETY FIRST!</li>
            <li>So simple, easy &amp; safe</li>
            <li>Works incredibly well and have yet to dull the blade.</li>
            <li>If you use it religiously and make sure not to use it after moisturizing or right after a shower you will keep your feet super smooth.</li>
            <li>I used this item, and sure enough, I did experience great looking feet because it was the answer to my problem feet; but at the same time, I had really sore feet</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>A refining rasper would be nice to add a final touch of smoothness but</li>
            <li>Definitely a fun manly product, my dad enjoys it.</li>
            <li>I am now confident with bare feet.</li>
            <li>It feels good in the hand and takes a lot less effort than the ped egg.  </li>
            <li>never loved my feet so much...and i have gorgeous feet!</li>
            <li>I used it very gently, as recommended.</li>
            <li>This has helped save money and keep my feet pretty at the time.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, get more than one so that you&#x27;ll have them in the future if they stop selling it.</li>
            <li>I paid for this purchase the first time I didn&#x27;t need to do that and had one to give to my daughter.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I scrub my feet with a regular foot scrub, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work like this product.</li>
            <li>My feet feel smooth and soft after.</li>
            <li>It gets my feet just as smooth as a professional pedicure.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw it in the box</li>
            <li>I went back on to amazon and ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I love it, gave the second one to my niece.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best money i have EVER spent.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so me and husband got new carpet put it when we bought our house,we figure we should just renew the old carpet that is already put inso</li>
            <li>tried those cheap candy-assed raspers from the drug store with mixed success</li>
            <li>I am thrilled and would highly recommend this to anyone experiencing dry feet/heels!</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this, but wish I had done so a long time ago.</li>
            <li>but I realized you barely had to use any pressure and the skin removes smoothly.</li>
            <li>However, be careful because it is very easy to take off too much skin</li>
            <li>That sounds like it would hurt or would be less effective</li>
            <li>i dry off and then pull it out and get to scrubbing :)</li>
            <li>I suppose the only danger is overdoing it, which I can see you can do so very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy,  and ever since I turned 30 the soles of my feet have been getting more dry.  </li>
            <li>I searched and searched for a foot rasp with a large head, my friend said look on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d recommend something else to go back and buff the skin down to get it nice and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>I doubt I ever spend money on pricey pedicures again since the main reason I got them was for my heels!</li>
            <li>Great product, I didn&#x27;t think there was any way these hard working feet would ever be soft.</li>
            <li>This thing is the real deal.</li>
            <li>pressed 200lbs for an hour straight.</li>
            <li>I took the advice of others to not do too much</li>
            <li>And we both thought that my feet were smooth prior to her using this tool.</li>
            <li>This product is very sturdy and works very well.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this product.</li>
            <li>Feet feel so much softer</li>
            <li>The quickest way I have ever used to remove the rough layers and smooth my feet!</li>
            <li>You really have to be mindful of how much pressure you need to apply when using this on your foot.</li>
            <li>if you scrape too much it will cause cracks on your feet.....</li>
            <li>then I thought it would be and very plastic looking...</li>
            <li>It really does the job it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li>I am very meticulous about my feet with pedicures bi-weekly and at home care in between.  </li>
            <li>These rasps are very aggressive, which saves time.  </li>
            <li>Hello baby soft feet!!!</li>
            <li>The instructions recommend to use on dry feet - which I too would recommend if you&#x27;re a new user of foot rasps), but I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of using right after I get out of the shower and it quickly and gently removes the calloused skin.</li>
            <li>Best tool to get rid of pesky old, hard, rough skin on your feet.</li>
            <li>The older you get you will be looking for this.</li>
            <li>This is a great product BUT warning only use it on dry feet as it has the potential to do major damage of your skin</li>
            <li>For most people though I would just use a sandstone in the shower since it doesn&#x27;t shed dead skin cells everywhere.</li>
            <li>My favorite foot file and I have purchased quite a few.  </li>
            <li>One was gifted to me a few years ago</li>
            <li>It was something new that my pedicurist had just started using and asked if I wanted her to try it on me.</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week, on dry feet, then follow with lotion and my heels stay smooth with no other effort.</li>
            <li>My feet feel so soft!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same one that they use where I go for my pedicures.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The plane is long enough for me to use comfortably.</li>
            <li>When I took this tool to my dry foot, I could not believe what Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp removed from my foot.  </li>
            <li>The item really does  expose pretty pink and tender li\\&quot;l feet.</li>
            <li>short, my feet look beautifully smooth and soft in under 5 minutes or less, and even better than a &#x27;professional&#x27; pedicure and in a fraction of the time (other than adding some polish)</li>
            <li>does the job super sharp</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hard on my feet and needed a better rasp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hard pressed to think of a product that I have been this satisfied with.</li>
            <li>So have had a hard time keeping my feet smooth, no matter how much I scrub and moisurize between pedicures.  </li>
            <li>This thing just down right WORKS!</li>
            <li>Be careful not to take too much skin at one time because you can make your feet very sore.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your heels, soles and calluses soft.</li>
            <li>my feet look like my three year old&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>They are baby soft now.</li>
            <li>thank you so much for a product that actual works</li>
            <li>sometimes I just be too busy to schedule for pedicure</li>
            <li>Keeps feet baby soft between pedicures.</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet soft.</li>
            <li>is too soft (from soaking or bathing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Read the other reviews,  some of which are very funny.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products for ridding my feet of callouses and dead skin.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;NO exaggeration - within a few minutes, my feet are smooth and soft like no other product can do.  </li>
            <li>Life is busy and I cannot go get one often so this is a MAJOR BLESSING!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s aittle intimidating at first, and a tiny bit gross.</li>
            <li>My heels were very dry and cracked and after using this the first time, the difference was unreal.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to take off too much skin and leave your feet sore for days!</li>
            <li>Then they started getting dry and were right back where they were before the pedicure.</li>
            <li>Love I have rough heels, with cracks and dead skin.</li>
            <li>No other product</li>
            <li>With the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp, I literally got rid of cakes of dead skin in 30 seconds; my feet actually look normal now.</li>
            <li>This is used dry and is much less likely to injure you but does a better overall job.  </li>
            <li>I have read all the positive feedback from other customers who have owned this item.</li>
            <li>I say that because when you have pink skin like that, it is very tender.</li>
            <li>Feet actually are smoother than getting a professional pedicure.</li>
            <li>Sturdy enough that a man can use without breaking the handle like my son often does when using my old one.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to slough off too much though</li>
            <li>You really have to be careful not to over do it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going slow and easy to get my feet back in shape.  </li>
            <li>we got the same exact kind of carpet that was already in the floors...while not knowing that it does nothing but bad things to the feet.</li>
            <li>But gets the job done much, much faster and efficiently vs. all other &amp;#34;scrapers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>&#x27;re rough feet to baby smooth in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>So, once you have removed majority of the dead skin and calluses, be very CAREFUL as you approach the true skin on your feet.</li>

            <li> something this effective will eventually be outlawed by someone.</li>
            <li> so anywho, I decided to buy my own foot scrub from sallys...</li>
            <li> really nice if you play lot of sports and are often embarrassed about your feet.</li>
            <li> Save your money and do your own pedicures to remove calluses.</li>
            <li> Within seconds, my skin was softer, the cracks seemed to disappear and it was very easy to use -</li>
            <li> This foot rasp is, by far, the FASTEST, and best thing I have used on my dry,callused and cracked feet.</li>
            <li> OMG, the most amazing tool for callus removal ever.  </li>
            <li> great and well worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I love that its a 2 pack</li>
            <li> Love love love this product</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Nice to have callus free feet</li>
            <li> you need it most.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I listened to their advice.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Safe to use.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll damage yourself for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought two...and buying five more now for backups....</li>
            <li> I obliged, and left with the best feeling feet ever.</li>
            <li> I go barefoot or wear flip flops/sandals most of the year and was paying for the upgraded pedicure with the chemical heel treatment every time.  </li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll be able to walk around in flip flops and feel confident.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li> I even ordered more for my friends and sisters.</li>
            <li> I searched for this in the beauty supply stores, glad I found it here.  </li>
            <li> Smooth feet ALL of the time!</li>
            <li> Works WAAAAAAY better than that egg thing</li>
            <li> Everything it says and more.  </li>
            <li> Works better then the egg.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Works better than what they use at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews on this...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it a number of times now and am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS TOOL, i use it in the shower to remove any callus off my feet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not a finisher, so for manly feet that&#x27;s probably okay,</li>
            <li> I used this product once and knew it was better than anything I had ever used.</li>
            <li> You just need to pay attention and not take off healthy, tender skin after the callous is gone.  </li>
            <li> Best purchase made in a long time.</li>
            <li> The best use of this product is to use it on dry feet.</li>
            <li> does the job quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> This is a keeper, nice and big and the grip is great too.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried for my dry cracked heels!  </li>
            <li> Effective and economical.</li>
            <li> The rasp is also easy to maneuver because of the handle.</li>
            <li> Very quickly.</li>
            <li> go easy with it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> If I had known how easy it was to use one of these, I don&#x27;t think any one would pay for a pedecure if they knew it was this easy.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The Ped-Egg was nice at first, but the results were not even close to immediate.</li>
            <li> tried the sandpaper-like products that are fine for keeping your feet smooth,  but they can&#x27;t touch this thing.  </li>
            <li> the way, it is important to note that this is a professional-grade product.</li>
            <li> to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and having two in the set in different colors is great.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> As in, &amp;#34;I really CANNOT believe this is so effective</li>
            <li> Great support and solid under pressure.</li>
            <li> He loved it as well, and we all know how most men are about their feet - they only take care of them when the lady tells him to.</li>
            <li> but if you are gentle, it will do a consistent good job without hurting you.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> (and I tried all the popular types and more) took too long.</li>
            <li> At least my feet are perfect now.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my feet which has skin so thick</li>
            <li> I have a smooth heel right after using it.</li>
            <li> Go easy at first</li>
            <li> I have now bought this product for other members of my family and they all think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> ; You know, in our world of hyped-up products that don&#x27;t ever really deliver on their promises, it&#x27;s nice to know that the hype is real, but the price won&#x27;t make me squint.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I can give myself a quick pedicure in the shower itself.</li>
            <li> It works quickly.  </li>
            <li> This does the job quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone I am going to order another pack one for my sisters hubby and mine :)</li>
            <li> SAFETY FIRST!</li>
            <li> So simple, easy &amp; safe</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well and have yet to dull the blade.</li>
            <li> If you use it religiously and make sure not to use it after moisturizing or right after a shower you will keep your feet super smooth.</li>
            <li> I used this item, and sure enough, I did experience great looking feet because it was the answer to my problem feet; but at the same time, I had really sore feet</li>
            <li> definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> A refining rasper would be nice to add a final touch of smoothness but</li>
            <li> Definitely a fun manly product, my dad enjoys it.</li>
            <li> I am now confident with bare feet.</li>
            <li> It feels good in the hand and takes a lot less effort than the ped egg.  </li>
            <li> never loved my feet so much...and i have gorgeous feet!</li>
            <li> I used it very gently, as recommended.</li>
            <li> This has helped save money and keep my feet pretty at the time.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, get more than one so that you&#x27;ll have them in the future if they stop selling it.</li>
            <li> I paid for this purchase the first time I didn&#x27;t need to do that and had one to give to my daughter.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I scrub my feet with a regular foot scrub, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work like this product.</li>
            <li> My feet feel smooth and soft after.</li>
            <li> It gets my feet just as smooth as a professional pedicure.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw it in the box</li>
            <li> I went back on to amazon and ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I love it, gave the second one to my niece.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best money i have EVER spent.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so me and husband got new carpet put it when we bought our house,we figure we should just renew the old carpet that is already put inso</li>
            <li> tried those cheap candy-assed raspers from the drug store with mixed success</li>
            <li> I am thrilled and would highly recommend this to anyone experiencing dry feet/heels!</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this, but wish I had done so a long time ago.</li>
            <li> but I realized you barely had to use any pressure and the skin removes smoothly.</li>
            <li> However, be careful because it is very easy to take off too much skin</li>
            <li> That sounds like it would hurt or would be less effective</li>
            <li> i dry off and then pull it out and get to scrubbing :)</li>
            <li> I suppose the only danger is overdoing it, which I can see you can do so very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy,  and ever since I turned 30 the soles of my feet have been getting more dry.  </li>
            <li> I searched and searched for a foot rasp with a large head, my friend said look on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d recommend something else to go back and buff the skin down to get it nice and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I doubt I ever spend money on pricey pedicures again since the main reason I got them was for my heels!</li>
            <li> Great product, I didn&#x27;t think there was any way these hard working feet would ever be soft.</li>
            <li> This thing is the real deal.</li>
            <li> pressed 200lbs for an hour straight.</li>
            <li> I took the advice of others to not do too much</li>
            <li> And we both thought that my feet were smooth prior to her using this tool.</li>
            <li> This product is very sturdy and works very well.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this product.</li>
            <li> Feet feel so much softer</li>
            <li> The quickest way I have ever used to remove the rough layers and smooth my feet!</li>
            <li> You really have to be mindful of how much pressure you need to apply when using this on your foot.</li>
            <li> if you scrape too much it will cause cracks on your feet.....</li>
            <li> then I thought it would be and very plastic looking...</li>
            <li> It really does the job it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> I am very meticulous about my feet with pedicures bi-weekly and at home care in between.  </li>
            <li> These rasps are very aggressive, which saves time.  </li>
            <li> Hello baby soft feet!!!</li>
            <li> The instructions recommend to use on dry feet - which I too would recommend if you&#x27;re a new user of foot rasps), but I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of using right after I get out of the shower and it quickly and gently removes the calloused skin.</li>
            <li> Best tool to get rid of pesky old, hard, rough skin on your feet.</li>
            <li> The older you get you will be looking for this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product BUT warning only use it on dry feet as it has the potential to do major damage of your skin</li>
            <li> For most people though I would just use a sandstone in the shower since it doesn&#x27;t shed dead skin cells everywhere.</li>
            <li> My favorite foot file and I have purchased quite a few.  </li>
            <li> One was gifted to me a few years ago</li>
            <li> It was something new that my pedicurist had just started using and asked if I wanted her to try it on me.</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week, on dry feet, then follow with lotion and my heels stay smooth with no other effort.</li>
            <li> My feet feel so soft!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the same one that they use where I go for my pedicures.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The plane is long enough for me to use comfortably.</li>
            <li> When I took this tool to my dry foot, I could not believe what Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp removed from my foot.  </li>
            <li> The item really does  expose pretty pink and tender li\\&quot;l feet.</li>
            <li> short, my feet look beautifully smooth and soft in under 5 minutes or less, and even better than a &#x27;professional&#x27; pedicure and in a fraction of the time (other than adding some polish)</li>
            <li> does the job super sharp</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hard on my feet and needed a better rasp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard pressed to think of a product that I have been this satisfied with.</li>
            <li> So have had a hard time keeping my feet smooth, no matter how much I scrub and moisurize between pedicures.  </li>
            <li> This thing just down right WORKS!</li>
            <li> Be careful not to take too much skin at one time because you can make your feet very sore.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your heels, soles and calluses soft.</li>
            <li> my feet look like my three year old&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> They are baby soft now.</li>
            <li> thank you so much for a product that actual works</li>
            <li> sometimes I just be too busy to schedule for pedicure</li>
            <li> Keeps feet baby soft between pedicures.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet soft.</li>
            <li> is too soft (from soaking or bathing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews,  some of which are very funny.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products for ridding my feet of callouses and dead skin.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;NO exaggeration - within a few minutes, my feet are smooth and soft like no other product can do.  </li>
            <li> Life is busy and I cannot go get one often so this is a MAJOR BLESSING!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aittle intimidating at first, and a tiny bit gross.</li>
            <li> My heels were very dry and cracked and after using this the first time, the difference was unreal.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to take off too much skin and leave your feet sore for days!</li>
            <li> Then they started getting dry and were right back where they were before the pedicure.</li>
            <li> Love I have rough heels, with cracks and dead skin.</li>
            <li> No other product</li>
            <li> With the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp, I literally got rid of cakes of dead skin in 30 seconds; my feet actually look normal now.</li>
            <li> This is used dry and is much less likely to injure you but does a better overall job.  </li>
            <li> I have read all the positive feedback from other customers who have owned this item.</li>
            <li> I say that because when you have pink skin like that, it is very tender.</li>
            <li> Feet actually are smoother than getting a professional pedicure.</li>
            <li> Sturdy enough that a man can use without breaking the handle like my son often does when using my old one.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to slough off too much though</li>
            <li> You really have to be careful not to over do it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going slow and easy to get my feet back in shape.  </li>
            <li> we got the same exact kind of carpet that was already in the floors...while not knowing that it does nothing but bad things to the feet.</li>
            <li> But gets the job done much, much faster and efficiently vs. all other &amp;#34;scrapers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> &#x27;re rough feet to baby smooth in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> So, once you have removed majority of the dead skin and calluses, be very CAREFUL as you approach the true skin on your feet.</li>
            <li> This product is VERY sharp so for those using it for the first time please be careful!</li>
            <li> It is a tiny bit hard to get into those hard to reach areas but for the most part it gets were</li>
            <li> My husband will only use it dry outside it the yard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only rasp that has smoothed out the callouses developed on the bottom of my feet near my toes that are hard to get at.</li>
            <li> I apply a skin salve after I use this and find that I can trim calloused skin every week or two and avoid the skin cracking that caused me so much discomfort and pain in the past.</li>
            <li> Though pretty-in pink feet can be your best friend, if you stop to think about it, they can be your worst enemy.</li>
            <li> but the key is that you have to use it on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Because my grandfather, my mother, me and a couple of my daughters have the same problem with out feet, DRY, CALLUSED CRACKED FEET.  </li>
            <li> The key is to use this on dry feet, as directed.</li>
            <li> It takes less than a minute on each foot and makes them baby soft.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and wear sandals constantly.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at 1st, but was pleasantly surprised after I applied my BB True Spa foot cream, the next morning &amp; still 4 days later, my feet feel like silk.  </li>
            <li> If you rub it against skin that is already soft, it has little or no effect, just what one would hope.  </li>
            <li> this is what i have been searching for a long time....</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected, but that is a plus too.</li>
            <li> hers is sharp enough..</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry, cracked, and calloused feet.</li>
            <li> On dry feet</li>
            <li> OMG: the dry skin came off like a snow flurry, and within three minutes I had baby-soft heels again.  </li>
            <li> The directions say to use it on dry feet</li>
            <li> I too have always suffered with dry cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Due to the cheese grater feel, my rough skin has gone away, my cracks are starting to diminish.</li>
            <li> Smooths rough feet almost instantly with only a few rubs.</li>
            <li> Only problem is that it gets everywhere, so i have to do it in the tub and just rinse it down the drain.</li>
            <li> Just be sure not to go crazy and shave too much off of your feet; you&#x27;ll be sorry the next day.</li>
            <li> but I use it on both, dry and wet, depending on what I am doing at the time.</li>
            <li> leapt at the former but, being strong-willed and rebellious by nature, took the latter with an excessive grain of salt, a mistake she&#x27;ll not soon repeat&lt;br /&gt;Nor</li>
            <li> I nicked my left foot a little which drew blood, but it was very minor.</li>
            <li> little Darling&#x27;s corporeal perfection was tainted only by some rough heel skin from living in flip-flops&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;d</li>
            <li> Be CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> so I kept the pink</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way you&#x27;ll have rough feet after using this thing.  </li>
            <li> When using this item, you have to be really careful.</li>
            <li> And because of this, you must be really careful, as I have found out.</li>
            <li> (Though they use it when my feet are wet which isn&#x27;t how the instructions say to do it.)</li>
            <li> Buy this and kiss your rough edges</li>
            <li> Just need to be careful to not overdo.</li>
            <li> You MUST be careful with this tool.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money in your local beauty supply store....</li>
            <li> Evidently, not so much.</li>
            <li> Just be careful....</li>
            <li> I thought I probably wasted my money because I don&#x27;t like to return anything, especially via the mail.  </li>
            <li> but it routinely cut me if I wasn&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Just be careful as to not hurt yourself with it.</li>
            <li> I immediately came home and looked the tool up on Amazon.com, and low and behold, as usual, they sell it.</li>
            <li> -- just be careful to know when to stop!  </li>
            <li> I gave my parents the other one</li>
            <li> I ordered the twin pack one for my sis and the other of course for me.</li>
            <li> I routinely peeled it because filing with any other files, including battery operated  </li>
            <li> so be careful!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sharp so don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful as you can make your heels sore, even though it doesn&#x27;t hurt while you&#x27;re scraping, it will hurt after!</li>
            <li> Be careful, it&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous this would be too harsh for personal use, as my pedicurist of 15 years uses one.</li>
            <li> I bought two..one for my roommate who complained about her rough feet daily.</li>
            <li> 2 mins of a little rubbing and the dry nastiness is gone!</li>
            <li> be careful when you use it, you want to peel of the dead skin and not THE skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so efficient that you need to be careful not to remove too much dead skin</li>
            <li> This thing beats everything I&#x27;ve tried hands down.</li>
            <li> Meaning, it&#x27;s SHARP!</li>
            <li> TOSSED THAT NOT SO SHARP THING IN THE TRASH!</li>
            <li> To see the amount of dry skin that fell off of my feet while she used this tool was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> from the moment i took the product out and used it in less than 15 min</li>
            <li> However, this one takes a lot less effort - it&#x27;s like grating cheese.</li>
            <li> (previously, I had to do them every day).</li>
            <li> , yes, Vaseline and bandages are the remedy for those whose restraint fails to moderate their enthusiasm at the initial improvement they&#x27;ll undoubtedly witness&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion for product improvement?  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous at first because I was afraid I was going to cut myself</li>
            <li> I have the ped-egg and the little rotary motor driven one from tv.</li>
            <li> Between all of us, we have used almost every product and had little or not benefits.</li>
            <li> I still have the cracks to get rid of, but that will take just a little while longer since they have formed over years.</li>
            <li> What would I do without this little miracle.</li>
            <li> Little bit at a time.  </li>
            <li> Can work a little too well</li>
            <li> All that hyperbolic rhetoric in praise of this little monster appears well founded</li>
            <li> why does the chic at the nail shop ALWAYS scrape off every little dead skin??</li>
            <li> This scraped ALL of the dead skin and callouses off my feet and the cracks are gone.  </li>
            <li> Bye bye dead skin....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the metal &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; shaped one and pumice rock but my bunions and heels had so much dead skin that i would be in the shower scraping and scraping.</li>
            <li> I usually do it after shower...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the PediEgg in the past</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not much more expensive that it actually</li>
            <li> No more $30 pedicures</li>
            <li> this seriously gets off every little thing..</li>
            <li> I can now give myself a pedicure in a very short time, keeping the skin reasonable, and stopping my terrible habit mentioned.</li>
            <li> And pedis are so expensive in the long run for me!  </li>
            <li> Microplane, deceptively slick and refined though it may appear, is a serious grater that you&#x27;ll do well to respect and employ judiciously&lt;br /&gt;Allusions to Power Toolage and Skull-and-CrossBones motifs........</li>
            <li> Me not having knowledge in this area, I decided to almost give up..thinking every scrubber is that dull...</li>
            <li> this does the hard work.</li>
            <li> Now I can at least stretch out the time between pedicures, or not worry if I cannot get in for an appointment before needing my feet to be visible in my sandals.</li>
            <li> No more sand paper feet in the Vaughan household!</li>
            <li> I actually used a very expensive foot file about 3 days ago</li>
            <li> I was worried that the rasp would be too caustic for my feet, but after a few uses, my heels are healed!</li>
            <li> This thing is serious.  </li>
            <li> I have used the pedegg, and I tell you, the results were not good at all.</li>
            <li> Go slowly!</li>
            <li> In fact, it made the situation much worse for me.</li>
            <li> In just a few minutes it removed a painful callus on the side of my foot.</li>
            <li> The back of my foot heel is horrible, I used this</li>
            <li> Hip hip hurray, no need to go for expensive pedicures</li>
            <li> Looks scary and you think it would hurt.</li>
            <li> Perhaps  but exaggerated?  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with nasty cracked heels for YEARS due to almost always being barefoot.  </li>
            <li> We were shocked at how our feet looked after just one use.</li>
            <li> Purchase it, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy   about that.        </li>
            <li> Holy crap!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My sister uses this product on her client for pedicure. It leaves your heels, soles and calluses soft. However, one must follow its direction to prevent injury. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot filing product that I have ever purchased! Before this, I was using the Ped-Egg. The Ped-Egg was nice at first, but the results were not even close to immediate. With the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp, I literally got rid of cakes of dead skin in 30 seconds; my feet actually look normal now. And, I&#x27;ve only used it once! The rasp is also easy to maneuver because of the handle. 10/10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it is important to note that this is a professional-grade product. Meaning, it&#x27;s SHARP! So, once you have removed majority of the dead skin and calluses, be very CAREFUL as you approach the true skin on your feet. I nicked my left foot a little which drew blood, but it was very minor. Be CAREFUL. SAFETY FIRST!</li>
            <li> This stuff if great!!! so glad I purchased this! i get callusous easilyso I have to get Pedi&#x27;s all the time. And pedis are so expensive in the long run for me!  soooooooo glad I got this!!! works wonders!!!!  and I love that its a 2 pack so I kept the pink and my husband uses the brown!</li>
            <li> This thing is the real deal. I bought one for all my crusty feet friends.</li>
            <li> Good for cheese or feet. I bought two..one for my roommate who complained about her rough feet daily. She took hers and made supper. I took mine and made my feet beautiful. Then she left with her grater for Thailand where she continues to grate cheese claiming that her feet cured themselves by sweating. Go figure. At least my feet are perfect now. People should notice. I will not be alone.</li>
            <li> It works miracles!  I am now confident with bare feet.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an upgrade to the PedEgg... this was definitely it.  There&#x27;s no way you&#x27;ll have rough feet after using this thing.  Just be careful not to take off too much skin and leave your feet sore for days!</li>
            <li> I searched and searched for a foot rasp with a large head, my friend said look on Amazon. I did and loved the price and the ease of using it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have gotten this item. I used to own the pedegg. I purchased 2, one for me and my sister. I have used the pedegg, and I tell you, the results were not good at all. In fact, it made the situation much worse for me. I ended up with feet that were as raggedy as can ever be! I had \\&quot;cuts\\&quot; here and there. I was very unhappy   about that.        I have problems with dry, cracked, and calloused feet. I saw this item on Amazon, and I decided to order it. It was an add-on item, and I didn&#x27;t want to go there. I saw that you can order the twin pack, so I went for that deal. That was wonderful.      I have read all the positive feedback from other customers who have owned this item. They have used this item, and have gotten great results. But there are warnings that you must heed as I will explain.      When using this item, you have to be really careful. The item really does  expose pretty pink and tender li\\&quot;l feet. And because of this, you must be really careful, as I have found out. I used this item, and sure enough, I did experience great looking feet because it was the answer to my problem feet; but at the same time, I had really sore feet that I thought I had blisters, only to find that there were cracked sores. Though pretty-in pink feet can be your best friend, if you stop to think about it, they can be your worst enemy. I say that because when you have pink skin like that, it is very tender. So I urge you, folks to please take your time, and use with caution. But you still can have great looking feet. The best use of this product is to use it on dry feet.</li>
            <li> What did I do before I owned this?? I use it in the shower as the last thing while my feet have soaked. My husband will only use it dry outside it the yard. Go figure! We are both happy so either way works!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product</li>
            <li> Great product and at a good price!</li>
            <li> Oh my! This works wonders. Very quickly. Gone are the days of soaking, grating, and pumicing until your arms look and feel like you just bench pressed 200lbs for an hour straight. I&#x27;ve tried ceramic files, pumice stones, graters, electric pedi-files and nothing compares to this microplane in its ability to take you&#x27;re rough feet to baby smooth in just a few minutes. Loooove this tool!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Works fantastic!  Nice to have callus free feet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aittle intimidating at first, and a tiny bit gross. If you use it religiously and make sure not to use it after moisturizing or right after a shower you will keep your feet super smooth. It is a tiny bit hard to get into those hard to reach areas but for the most part it gets were you need it most. For most people though I would just use a sandstone in the shower since it doesn&#x27;t shed dead skin cells everywhere.</li>
            <li> does the job super sharp</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I ever purchased. This has helped save money and keep my feet pretty at the time.  The older you get you will be looking for this.</li>
            <li> The plane is long enough for me to use comfortably. In just a few minutes it removed a painful callus on the side of my foot. I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best money i have EVER spent.  I have struggled with nasty cracked heels for YEARS due to almost always being barefoot.  This scraped ALL of the dead skin and callouses off my feet and the cracks are gone.  I took the advice of others to not do too much and I&#x27;m glad I listened to their advice.  I doubt I ever spend money on pricey pedicures again since the main reason I got them was for my heels!</li>
            <li> Works like a wonder. Be careful, it&#x27;s sharp! Sturdy handle, well made.</li>
            <li> The Microplane Pedicure foot rasp is an Outstanding product!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS tool!  Comes in a twin-pack, and cannot recommend it enough!  I go barefoot and/or in sandals throughout the year (when not at work or out and about), so my feet are exposed to the elements and tend to get callouses..&lt;br /&gt;NO exaggeration - within a few minutes, my feet are smooth and soft like no other product can do.  Not even the Emjoi Micro Pedi (I&#x27;ve had 3 - both the A/C operated as well as battery-operated Emjois), and they cannot touch this.&lt;br /&gt;In short, my feet look beautifully smooth and soft in under 5 minutes or less, and even better than a &#x27;professional&#x27; pedicure and in a fraction of the time (other than adding some polish)</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money! Safe to use. Bye bye dead skin.... Hello baby soft feet!!!</li>
            <li> This puppy shreds a callous like nobody&#x27;s business.  Go easy at first or you&#x27;ll damage yourself for sure.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Only used once but the key is that you have to use it on dry skin. That sounds like it would hurt or would be less effective but it&#x27;s not!  My feet feel so soft!  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Holy crap! Talk about one VERY effective product. I have the ped-egg and the little rotary motor driven one from tv. This thing beats everything I&#x27;ve tried hands down. I wear flip flops 99% of the year and my feet get...well...gross. in just ten minutes (3hat would have taken me an hour plus with a pedegg) my feet look like my three year old&#x27;s. I bought two...and buying five more now for backups....something this effective will eventually be outlawed by someone.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this tool during my recent pedicure. It was something new that my pedicurist had just started using and asked if I wanted her to try it on me. I obliged, and left with the best feeling feet ever. To see the amount of dry skin that fell off of my feet while she used this tool was unbelievable. And we both thought that my feet were smooth prior to her using this tool. I immediately came home and looked the tool up on Amazon.com, and low and behold, as usual, they sell it. I purchased the 2 pack and used one on my husbands&#x27; feet. He loved it as well, and we all know how most men are about their feet - they only take care of them when the lady tells him to. Purchase it, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed at all. As a matter of fact, get more than one so that you&#x27;ll have them in the future if they stop selling it. I love it and my husband loves his too!</li>
            <li> This product is very sturdy and works very well. A good deal to buy the twin pack and give one to a friend, too!</li>
            <li> Honestly, this rasp is amazing. It&#x27;s exactly the same one that they use where I go for my pedicures. (Though they use it when my feet are wet which isn&#x27;t how the instructions say to do it.) I go barefoot or wear flip flops/sandals most of the year and was paying for the upgraded pedicure with the chemical heel treatment every time.  No need for that now. I paid for this purchase the first time I didn&#x27;t need to do that and had one to give to my daughter. I use it about once a week, on dry feet, then follow with lotion and my heels stay smooth with no other effort. I love it!</li>
            <li> I believe I inherited inactive sweat glands. Because my grandfather, my mother, me and a couple of my daughters have the same problem with out feet, DRY, CALLUSED CRACKED FEET.  Between all of us, we have used almost every product and had little or not benefits. This foot rasp is, by far, the FASTEST, and best thing I have used on my dry,callused and cracked feet. Because my feet are prone to dryness, I still have to be vigilant about using a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is one of those items that you purchase and then wonder why on earth you didn&#x27;t buy it years earlier. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing. My heels were very dry and cracked and after using this the first time, the difference was unreal. They are baby soft now. I would get pedicures and my heels were great for about four days. Then they started getting dry and were right back where they were before the pedicure. The key is to use this on dry feet, as directed. So glad I purchased this, but wish I had done so a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Saw many good reviews on this item and after purchasing it is certainly worthy of those good reviews!  Smooths rough feet almost instantly with only a few rubs.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Use as directed.  On dry feet</li>
            <li> Works really well.  I have purchased extras for gifts!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried for my dry cracked heels!  Within seconds, my skin was softer, the cracks seemed to disappear and it was very easy to use - I am thrilled and would highly recommend this to anyone experiencing dry feet/heels!</li>
            <li> Amazing product....I will never have to go and pay for another pedicure again...from the moment i took the product out and used it in less than 15 min my feet felt (supple)soft. I didnt have to soak in anything to get this amazing result which is a plus...this is what i have been searching for a long time....my family says i should be a spokes person for this because i called them all and sent pictures before and after too them...lol everyone has now ordered this product because i will not let mines out of my site...thank you so much for a product that actual works</li>
            <li> Love this product... Great buy for its price.</li>
            <li> Product works great; definitely worth the price. I&#x27;ve been using the Ped-Egg for a while and it pales in comparison to this microplane. It takes less than a minute on each foot and makes them baby soft. Just be sure not to go crazy and shave too much off of your feet; you&#x27;ll be sorry the next day.</li>
            <li> Its like cheese grater but for feet.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, easy to use. be careful when you use it, you want to peel of the dead skin and not THE skin</li>
            <li> Okay, so me and husband got new carpet put it when we bought our house,we figure we should just renew the old carpet that is already put inso we got the same exact kind of carpet that was already in the floors...while not knowing that it does nothing but bad things to the feet. I had to get pedicures every 2 wks because of this carpet. because we have kiddos and responsibilities sometimes I just be too busy to schedule for pedicure or if I do, i only have time for manicure or either or... so anywho, I decided to buy my own foot scrub from sallys...TOSSED THAT NOT SO SHARP THING IN THE TRASH! Me not having knowledge in this area, I decided to almost give up..thinking every scrubber is that dull...then it hit me...why does the chic at the nail shop ALWAYS scrape off every little dead skin?? hers is sharp enough.. maybe that one from sallys just suck?!! so i looked online and purchased this and I&#x27;ve been using it once a week!!! never loved my feet so much...and i have gorgeous feet! this seriously gets off every little thing.. I usually do it after shower...i dry off and then pull it out and get to scrubbing :) hope this helps.</li>
            <li> OMG, the most amazing tool for callus removal ever.  Throw away the pumice stones, the foot scrubs, etc.  Buy this and kiss your rough edges good bye.  I have dry skin and wear sandals constantly.  So have had a hard time keeping my feet smooth, no matter how much I scrub and moisurize between pedicures.  I was traveling recently and got a pedicure and she used this tool.  I immediately bought one on Amazon (2 pack, what a deal) and cannot tell you how amazing it is.  You will not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the PediEgg in the past but I&#x27;m hard on my feet and needed a better rasp. I was a little nervous this would be too harsh for personal use, as my pedicurist of 15 years uses one. However it&#x27;s not to harsh/sharp and is super-easy to use. The instructions recommend to use on dry feet - which I too would recommend if you&#x27;re a new user of foot rasps), but I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of using right after I get out of the shower and it quickly and gently removes the calloused skin. Now I can at least stretch out the time between pedicures, or not worry if I cannot get in for an appointment before needing my feet to be visible in my sandals.</li>
            <li> Love I have rough heels, with cracks and dead skin. No matter how many times I scrub my feet with a regular foot scrub, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work like this product. Due to the cheese grater feel, my rough skin has gone away, my cracks are starting to diminish. I still have the cracks to get rid of, but that will take just a little while longer since they have formed over years. But I have faith that soon, I&#x27;ll be able to walk around in flip flops and feel confident.</li>
            <li> I love it work great .</li>
            <li> What would I do without this little miracle. My feet feel smooth and soft after. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing --  OMG: the dry skin came off like a snow flurry, and within three minutes I had baby-soft heels again.  So simple, easy &amp; safe -- just be careful to know when to stop!  Moisturizer now gets to where it&#x27;s needed, not the outside of a slab of the callous.  Yaay!</li>
            <li> really nice if you play lot of sports and are often embarrassed about your feet. I don&#x27;t think Obama would welcome them, but eveyone else is welcome.</li>
            <li> This foot rasp is great! The directions say to use it on dry feet but I use it on both, dry and wet, depending on what I am doing at the time. I gave my parents the other one and they love it as well!</li>
            <li> Will buy again, and again!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product...does a fabulous job!</li>
            <li> This is a very effective tool.  It feels good in the hand and takes a lot less effort than the ped egg.  Just need to be careful to not overdo.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing I ordered the twin pack one for my sis and the other of course for me. We were shocked at how our feet looked after just one use. I was a little nervous at first because I was afraid I was going to cut myself but I realized you barely had to use any pressure and the skin removes smoothly. I am glad I ordered this. Highly recommended for anyone I am going to order another pack one for my sisters hubby and mine :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be more impressed my a product, period. This thing just down right WORKS! I&#x27;m hard pressed to think of a product that I have been this satisfied with. Happy feet, for sure.</li>
            <li> The back of my foot heel is horrible, I used this and it is a wonderful miracle pedicure remover.........I brought two, already!!!</li>
            <li> This is simply awesome!!! Best tool to get rid of pesky old, hard, rough skin on your feet.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot file I&#x27;ve ever used.  Hip hip hurray, no need to go for expensive pedicures anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job quickly and effectively. I even ordered more for my friends and sisters.</li>
            <li> Used it 1st nite after receiving it. I was a little skeptical at 1st, but was pleasantly surprised after I applied my BB True Spa foot cream, the next morning &amp; still 4 days later, my feet feel like silk.  No other product I&#x27; ve used helped my feet like this.</li>
            <li> I searched for this in the beauty supply stores, glad I found it here.  Just like what they use in the nail salons. I walk barefooted around the house often, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Great product, I didn&#x27;t think there was any way these hard working feet would ever be soft. My wife no longer forces me to wear socks in the bed. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> This callous grater works great.  Easy to clean and having two in the set in different colors is great.  Bigger than I expected, but that is a plus too.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smooth feet ALL of the time! Does not cut or wound. Requires no skill. Keeps feet baby soft between pedicures. Easy to use and clean. Works WAAAAAAY better than that egg thing</li>
            <li> Works great! However, be careful because it is very easy to take off too much skin and you won&#x27;t realize it until maybe the next day..</li>
            <li> Everything it says and more.  You MUST be careful with this tool.  Yes....a tool.  I&#x27;m going slow and easy to get my feet back in shape.  Little bit at a time.  Finger tip pressure only.  My son did use the second rasp to carve his rain gutter regatta boat for cub scouts this weekend.  It worked better than my wood rasps in the shop!!!</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well and have yet to dull the blade.</li>
            <li> Incredible rasp.  Perfect for my feet which has skin so thick I routinely peeled it because filing with any other files, including battery operated  (and I tried all the popular types and more) took too long. I can now give myself a pedicure in a very short time, keeping the skin reasonable, and stopping my terrible habit mentioned.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money in your local beauty supply store....this is THE ONE to buy!</li>
            <li> Product is amazing!! !! No longer have to go to get pedicure. Feet actually are smoother than getting a professional pedicure.</li>
            <li> This rasp works great, I thought nothing could help my feet and I&#x27;ve tried everything!</li>
            <li> Works better then the egg.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have bought really expensive foot files and this is super-amazing. I actually used a very expensive foot file about 3 days ago and I thought I&#x27;d gotten it all. Evidently, not so much. This foot file is incredible. I suppose the only danger is overdoing it, which I can see you can do so very quickly. Amazing product. As in, &amp;#34;I really CANNOT believe this is so effective and it&#x27;s not much more expensive that it actually is.&amp;#34; You know, in our world of hyped-up products that don&#x27;t ever really deliver on their promises, it&#x27;s nice to know that the hype is real, but the price won&#x27;t make me squint.  Thanks for offering this product. It&#x27;s great. :)</li>
            <li> Love it, works great. Feet feel so much softer</li>
            <li> Wow!  It works great.</li>
            <li> My favorite foot file and I have purchased quite a few.  Can work a little too well so be careful!</li>
            <li> This is a keeper, nice and big and the grip is great too.  Sturdy enough that a man can use without breaking the handle like my son often does when using my old one.  Also it gets the job done easier and faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the metal &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; shaped one and pumice rock but my bunions and heels had so much dead skin that i would be in the shower scraping and scraping. However, this one takes a lot less effort - it&#x27;s like grating cheese. Only problem is that it gets everywhere, so i have to do it in the tub and just rinse it down the drain. But gets the job done much, much faster and efficiently vs. all other &amp;#34;scrapers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the rasp would be too caustic for my feet, but after a few uses, my heels are healed!</li>
            <li> Save yourself hundreds of dollars in pedicures. These work like a dream.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  It gets my feet just as smooth as a professional pedicure.  Be careful not to take too much skin at one time because you can make your feet very sore.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I have been doing without this product!!! I feel like I can give myself a quick pedicure in the shower itself. Life is busy and I cannot go get one often so this is a MAJOR BLESSING! I am buying them for mom and my SIL!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Great quality.</li>
            <li> The quickest way I have ever used to remove the rough layers and smooth my feet! A refining rasper would be nice to add a final touch of smoothness but this does the hard work.</li>
            <li> Save your money and do your own pedicures to remove calluses. Effective and economical. I ended up buying a second set for travel. Best purchase made in a long time.</li>
            <li> It works, but beware: it&#x27;s sharp so don&#x27;t overdo it. Go slowly!</li>
            <li> This is the best I have ever found. Keeps my feet soft. Be careful not to slough off too much though or your feet will be tender the next day. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING! Works better than what they use at the nail salon. In fact, they need to start using this at the nail salon.  I think I will buy this as gifts.</li>
            <li> it works so so so well and you see the result instantly! I have a smooth heel right after using it. give it a try. I bought 3 of them, 1 for myself , my husband and a relative!</li>
            <li> Best item ever. This product is VERY sharp so for those using it for the first time please be careful! You really have to be mindful of how much pressure you need to apply when using this on your foot. Once you&#x27;ve figured that part out, this works really great! Got my dad and sister one and they love it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with how well this product has improved the look and feel of my heels.  I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews on this...I used it very gently, as recommended.</li>
            <li> great and well worth it.  i&#x27;ve had enough pedicures to know that no one is going to be as aggressive as i want them to be - for obvious liability reasons.  so i ordered my own and am very happy i did.  i&#x27;ve used it a number of times now and am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> AMAZING RESULTS!!!!!!!!!  This is the best tool that I have ever, ever, ever used on my feet.  Just be careful....if you scrape too much it will cause cracks on your feet.....go easy with it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS TOOL, i use it in the shower to remove any callus off my feet. Works great by itself, not need for callus gels.</li>
            <li> It worked, now I don&#x27;t have to pay someone to do it, it&#x27;s so easy to use and the results are great!</li>
            <li> One was gifted to me a few years ago and I wanted to pass it on to my family and friends. This is a great product BUT warning only use it on dry feet as it has the potential to do major damage of your skin is too soft (from soaking or bathing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a finisher, so for manly feet that&#x27;s probably okay, but I&#x27;d recommend something else to go back and buff the skin down to get it nice and smooth afterwards. Definitely a fun manly product, my dad enjoys it.</li>
            <li> If I had known how easy it was to use one of these, I don&#x27;t think any one would pay for a pedecure if they knew it was this easy. This tool is amazing.</li>
            <li> This thing is serious.  I&#x27;m a guy,  and ever since I turned 30 the soles of my feet have been getting more dry.  I do walk around the yard barefoot,  which may not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the sandpaper-like products that are fine for keeping your feet smooth,  but they can&#x27;t touch this thing.  You really have to be careful not to over do it.  It works quickly.  Read the other reviews,  some of which are very funny.</li>
            <li> This item is GREAT!  When I first saw it in the box I thought I probably wasted my money because I don&#x27;t like to return anything, especially via the mail.  It was bigger then I thought it would be and very plastic looking...big ended up making it work so well...I went back on to amazon and ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> No more $30 pedicures</li>
            <li> I used to use a plane-like device to it  calloused skin that worked well when my skin was softened after a shower or bath but it routinely cut me if I wasn&#x27;t careful. This is used dry and is much less likely to injure you but does a better overall job.  If you rub it against skin that is already soft, it has little or no effect, just what one would hope.  You can use it overly aggressively but if you are gentle, it will do a consistent good job without hurting you.  I apply a skin salve after I use this and find that I can trim calloused skin every week or two and avoid the skin cracking that caused me so much discomfort and pain in the past.</li>
            <li> Great support and solid under pressure.</li>
            <li> It really does the job it&#x27;s suppose to. And it&#x27;s easy to handle. Just be careful as to not hurt yourself with it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products for ridding my feet of callouses and dead skin. This does the job quickly and efficiently. It&#x27;s so efficient that you need to be careful not to remove too much dead skin or you&#x27;ll end up with sore feet. It&#x27;s the only rasp that has smoothed out the callouses developed on the bottom of my feet near my toes that are hard to get at.</li>
            <li> Works great! 2 mins of a little rubbing and the dry nastiness is gone! Can&#x27;t wait to attack my husband&#x27;s feet with it! No more sand paper feet in the Vaughan household! Shipping was fast! Got it to my APO address overseas in 3 days!</li>
            <li> Speechless!  I am very meticulous about my feet with pedicures bi-weekly and at home care in between.  When I took this tool to my dry foot, I could not believe what Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp removed from my foot.  Order the O&#x27;Keffe Foot Cream and apply afterwards.  You can&#x27;t beat the combo!  MUST...MUST...MUST do if you&#x27;ve been looking for something that works with ease.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I love it, gave the second one to my niece. She loves it as well. Every home in America should have one.</li>
            <li> Looks scary and you think it would hurt. It works fantastically and does not hurt whatsoever. Exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!  BEST AMAZON PURCHASE EVER :)</li>
            <li> I echo all the great reviews. I too have always suffered with dry cracked heels. I used this product once and knew it was better than anything I had ever used. You need to be careful as you can make your heels sore, even though it doesn&#x27;t hurt while you&#x27;re scraping, it will hurt after! I now only have to do my heels once a week (previously, I had to do them every day). I have now bought this product for other members of my family and they all think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> All that hyperbolic rhetoric in praise of this little monster appears well founded&lt;br /&gt;My little Darling&#x27;s corporeal perfection was tainted only by some rough heel skin from living in flip-flops&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;d tried those cheap candy-assed raspers from the drug store with mixed success&lt;br /&gt;Reading Reno Dad&#x27;s review convinced me to offer her one of these devices, accompanied by his suggestion to employ moderation and restraint in its use&lt;br /&gt;She leapt at the former but, being strong-willed and rebellious by nature, took the latter with an excessive grain of salt, a mistake she&#x27;ll not soon repeat&lt;br /&gt;Nor should you or yours replicate her misadventure&lt;br /&gt;This Microplane, deceptively slick and refined though it may appear, is a serious grater that you&#x27;ll do well to respect and employ judiciously&lt;br /&gt;Allusions to Power Toolage and Skull-and-CrossBones motifs........metaphoric?  Perhaps  but exaggerated?  Not really&lt;br /&gt;And, yes, Vaseline and bandages are the remedy for those whose restraint fails to moderate their enthusiasm at the initial improvement they&#x27;ll undoubtedly witness&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion for product improvement?  Bulk price them by the pallet so you can afford to give them to everyone you meet</li>
            <li> These rasps are very aggressive, which saves time.  You just need to pay attention and not take off healthy, tender skin after the callous is gone.  I am very happy with these.</li>
