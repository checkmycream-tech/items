            <li>Wish there were more cloths.</li>
            <li>i would buy them again for another venture into the desert. :)</li>
            <li>like no brand wipes better</li>
            <li>I love these and won&#x27;t travel without them again.</li>
            <li>It leaves him clean and smelling fresh !!!</li>
            <li>Good way to freshen up when on the trail or on the job, I like them so much I have ordered more for an upcoming trip.</li>
            <li>Following a marathon in Antarctica they provided a very good alternative to a shower.</li>
            <li>Good to have when you do not have time for a shower, they do the job very well.</li>
            <li>AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL CLEAN AND SLEEP ALOT BETTER.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel sticky, just clean, and I slept much better than I would&#x27;ve otherwise.</li>
            <li>They seem to stay wet and fresh forever because they are packaged so nicely with a very good seal.</li>
            <li>(easily removed the Betadine from surgery) and leaves my skin soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend for a good clean up between showers.  </li>
            <li>Four cloths are ample for a light bath.  </li>
            <li>The wipes do not drip but hold the cleansing stuff while feeling soft and good on my skin.</li>
            <li>They are larger and thicker than regular wipes...plus whatever is in the wipes does a wonderful job of cleaning and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel this product was as moist as others I have used and that it had a medicinal smell whereas other brands have a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin clean, refreshed and it feel like you just took a shower.</li>
            <li>Great for a camping trip when water access is limited!</li>
            <li>These wipes are a great substitute for cleaning up when you can&#x27;t take a shower or can&#x27;t get an area wet (bandages, etc).  </li>
            <li>Still, they are good overall, and I would probably buy these again.  </li>
            <li>I decided not to take these on a 3-day backpacking trip because of the weight of the full package.  </li>
            <li>They are a large size, do clean and deodorize your skin with no &lt;br /&gt;irritation, and are easy to tote along on a visit or put discretely in your bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Great for camping and travel or for those who can&#x27;t shower due to being bed ridden or after surgery.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and by no means cloying.</li>
            <li>These were great, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done ...great for bed bound or travelers who want to stay fresh.  </li>
            <li>THESE CAN BE HEATED IN THE MICROWAVE AND USED RIGHT OUT THE PACK.</li>
            <li>They clean very well</li>
            <li>These bathing cloths are an absolute necessity!</li>
            <li>these are helpful for those that have a disability or even in the summer when its so hot and humid and sweaty.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that would clean my 2 1/2 year old grandson when he needed a freshen up after a blow out potty training accident.</li>
            <li>They effectively get me through the day without developing that slight funk some over-sanitized Americans find distressing.</li>
            <li>For the times when a person is unable to get around due to illness or injury, they are the perfect solution to feeling clean and fresh while bedridden.</li>
            <li>There was this huge dust storm and when I got back to the RV, I didn&#x27;t want to turn the shower brown with dirt</li>
            <li>The No Rinse Cleansing &amp; Deodorizing bathing wipes work very well</li>
            <li>and they worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>They are very convenient.</li>
            <li>I had used them the day before but when dust storm day was the day i really NEEDED to use them.</li>
            <li>but the sand was too much for any seal.  </li>
            <li>I only use them when nothing else is available.</li>
            <li>I went on a very primative camping trip this summer.</li>
            <li>I think 2 sheets are good enough for a complete body bath - 1 for upper body and 1 for lower body,...</li>
            <li>It was the only thing that kept me clean.</li>
            <li>just make sure you aren&#x27;t doubling back in the same area and save the last clean section for the dirtiest area(s).</li>
            <li>I have used these for a quick fresher up when I&#x27;ve already showered and don&#x27;t have time for another shower that same day.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t come close to real shower but does the job needed to keep you as fresh as possible otherwise.</li>
            <li>They are strong enough and large enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Used these for a music festival where showers were far away and cost too much.  </li>
            <li>Material is soft but very durable.</li>
            <li>thicker than normal baby wipes</li>
            <li>One was large enough to wipe down my arms, legs and feet, and I was pretty dusty, so if you&#x27;re just sweaty or something you might be able to cover even more area.</li>
            <li>My feet were always pretty gross by the end of the night</li>
            <li>so I actually cleaned myself off with these first and then got in.</li>
            <li>They really remove grime, but clean delicate areas gently.  </li>
            <li>This work very well with my husband as an alternative to an actual shower at the nursing home.  </li>
            <li>There are no harsh chemicals in them</li>
            <li>Like they were old or something.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated having them recently when my walk-in tub stopped up</li>
            <li>These wipes are nice and thick, They could be bigger.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry in a small travel bag.</li>
            <li>My mother was in her last days and suffered a small stroke so she couldn&#x27;t stand to shower any more.</li>
            <li>Wipes are thick, moist and two of those will easily substitute showering.</li>
            <li>I tried this brand for the first time, having already used some other brands.  </li>
            <li>The brand that the hospital used was slightly better, in that they did not leave as much moisture behind, but they are more expensive.</li>
            <li>The only draw back is that the residue takes about 5- 10 minutes to dry out and a little more for complete dryness.</li>
            <li>The towels are thick and soft, the scent is clean and deodorizing and the moister in the towels doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>Good cleansing/bathing wipes, however they do leave a little bit of a sticky residue behind.</li>
            <li>Not a substitute for old fashion water and soap, but it will let you feeling fresh - at least for a while.</li>
            <li>Indispensable in situations when other options are not available, or time constraints dictate their use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does clean well when other options are not available.</li>
            <li>I had sand embedded in oil all over my legs during a rafting trip and one of these cleaned up the whole mess.  </li>

            <li> They really remove grime, but clean delicate areas gently.  </li>
            <li> This work very well with my husband as an alternative to an actual shower at the nursing home.  </li>
            <li> There are no harsh chemicals in them</li>
            <li> Like they were old or something.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated having them recently when my walk-in tub stopped up</li>
            <li> These wipes are nice and thick, They could be bigger.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry in a small travel bag.</li>
            <li> My mother was in her last days and suffered a small stroke so she couldn&#x27;t stand to shower any more.</li>
            <li> Wipes are thick, moist and two of those will easily substitute showering.</li>
            <li> I tried this brand for the first time, having already used some other brands.  </li>
            <li> The brand that the hospital used was slightly better, in that they did not leave as much moisture behind, but they are more expensive.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that the residue takes about 5- 10 minutes to dry out and a little more for complete dryness.</li>
            <li> The towels are thick and soft, the scent is clean and deodorizing and the moister in the towels doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> Good cleansing/bathing wipes, however they do leave a little bit of a sticky residue behind.</li>
            <li> Not a substitute for old fashion water and soap, but it will let you feeling fresh - at least for a while.</li>
            <li> Indispensable in situations when other options are not available, or time constraints dictate their use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does clean well when other options are not available.</li>
            <li> I had sand embedded in oil all over my legs during a rafting trip and one of these cleaned up the whole mess.  </li>
            <li> The product is thick and easy to handle when wiping down.</li>
            <li> Albeit it was a low-dust week due to an early rain.</li>
            <li> It is definitely too dry.</li>
            <li> Not a problem so long as you got these.</li>
            <li> It takes a while for your skin to dry with these.  </li>
            <li> I had limited gear spaces</li>
            <li> No free showers in General Admission at the Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival for 4 days?</li>
            <li> You get 8 wipes per package for different parts of your body (you&#x27;ll need one package per day/wipe down).</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was that they came in a variety of scents, because they are a little too &amp;#34;powdery,&amp;#34; or floral, for my taste.  </li>
            <li> Using duct tape for the few that are left at home.</li>
            <li> Also sent some overseas to military members.</li>
            <li> but you get only a few</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, and nothing works as well as this for cleaning the body when one can&#x27;t shower for any reason.  </li>
            <li> I knew i would be dusty and gross and wanted a back up plan</li>
            <li> They were dry and stiff and not flexible.</li>
            <li> Not worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they are a little too moist.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> Not like little wipes.</li>
            <li> My biggest concern was hygiene and these little wipes did the job.</li>
            <li> These are handy to use on occasion when a bath is difficult or impossible.</li>
            <li> Got started on &amp;#34;bathing wipes&amp;#34; when I went camping with family a few times.  </li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY WHEN CHRONICALLY ILL.</li>
            <li> While most people just dealth with being disgusting for two days, I had these guys and each day after spending time in that river</li>
            <li> these were not very good at all.</li>
            <li> During that time, the skin remains sticky and hard to put on clothing.</li>
            <li> These are very thick heavy duty wipes, not like a wet-one at all.  </li>
            <li> Bought to use on a train trip, sufficiently thick and moist.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and moisturize your skin while cleaning and don&#x27;t have a horrible or heavy scent.</li>
            <li> SOMETIMES ONE IS JUST SO EXHAUSTED TO GET A BATH AT NIGHT.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to deal with dirty nasty me and could go to sleep relatively clean without waiting forever to get a shower.  </li>
            <li> I began using this type product when recovering from surgery and was unable to shower for a week.  </li>
            <li> These really take a lot of nasty crap off of you.</li>
            <li> I did not microwave them but used them cold</li>
            <li> and I hate getting into bed with dirty feet.</li>
            <li> Work well to not feel awful over 4 days of camping, though, and help you feel cleaner without access to a shower.</li>

            <li> Nice and soft and worked awesome for the music festival I was at. My feet were always pretty gross by the end of the night and I hate getting into bed with dirty feet.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and plenty moist.  They are the best we ever tried!  We highly recommend for a good clean up between showers.  We will always have while camping and &amp;#34;rustic&amp;#34; vacations!!!!  Love, love them.</li>
            <li> They really remove grime, but clean delicate areas gently.  I have tried other brands, and nothing works as well as this for cleaning the body when one can&#x27;t shower for any reason.  I can even use them on my dog&#x27;s muddy feet!  The only thing I wish was that they came in a variety of scents, because they are a little too &amp;#34;powdery,&amp;#34; or floral, for my taste.  It would be nice to have a variety of scents to choose from, like citrus and vanilla musk.  Otherwise they are the best bathing wipes available.</li>
            <li> Great product! I will always use these when going camping - they are a great quick refresher when spending a lot of time outdoors:-)</li>
            <li> These are great for when you just need to freshen up between showers or don&#x27;t have access to a shower.  They would also be good to take camping.  I began using this type product when recovering from surgery and was unable to shower for a week.  The hospital had a different brand that was very similar.  They do not have an over-powering scent.  My only complaint is that they are a little too moist.  It takes a while for your skin to dry with these.  Still, they are good overall, and I would probably buy these again.  The brand that the hospital used was slightly better, in that they did not leave as much moisture behind, but they are more expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried this brand for the first time, having already used some other brands.  I didn&#x27;t feel this product was as moist as others I have used and that it had a medicinal smell whereas other brands have a more pleasant smell. It is definitely too dry. There are better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li> The No Rinse Cleansing &amp; Deodorizing bathing wipes work very well &lt;br /&gt;.  They are a large size, do clean and deodorize your skin with no &lt;br /&gt;irritation, and are easy to tote along on a visit or put discretely in your bathroom.  I did not microwave them but used them cold and they worked very well.  The wipes do not drip but hold the cleansing stuff while feeling soft and good on my skin. &lt;br /&gt;The pack is resealable which is very handy when you don&#x27;t need to  &lt;br /&gt;use them all the time or are traveling. Four cloths are ample for a light bath.  They are an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. Like the No Rinse Body Wash, I used it at Burning Man and it came close to being as refresing as a shower. I shared some of the No Rinse Wipes with others and they had the same reaction; \\&quot;amazingly refreshing.\\&quot; I&#x27;m going to defnitely buy more. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> This work very well with my husband as an alternative to an actual shower at the nursing home.  He likes them warmed, but if you are just wiping a face you can rinse it out with warm water and use it on arms as well.  There are no harsh chemicals in them and I believe they are calming.  A little pricey but when you are giving comfort - you bend.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried these. I bought them according to the good reviews they received to add to my emergency preparedness supplies.</li>
            <li> Just what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> I did spend 4 days in the desert at Burning Man this year without shower and these wipes saved my life! Great thing to have during outdoors trips, camping, hiking. Wipes are thick, moist and two of those will easily substitute showering. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These bathing cloths are an absolute necessity! For the times when a person is unable to get around due to illness or injury, they are the perfect solution to feeling clean and fresh while bedridden. They are very soft and moisturize your skin while cleaning and don&#x27;t have a horrible or heavy scent. They seem to stay wet and fresh forever because they are packaged so nicely with a very good seal.</li>
            <li> My family loves it! It is easy to use and the quality is good considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again and would like to recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I took this with me to the hike to the top of Kilimanjaro and it worked great. I had limited gear spaces so I only took 2 of these with me for the 7 days I was up on the mountain. I think 2 sheets are good enough for a complete body bath - 1 for upper body and 1 for lower body,... just make sure you aren&#x27;t doubling back in the same area and save the last clean section for the dirtiest area(s). After I use it, I do feel &amp;#34;clean,&amp;#34; almost as good as a warm shower. The only draw back is that the residue takes about 5- 10 minutes to dry out and a little more for complete dryness. During that time, the skin remains sticky and hard to put on clothing.</li>
            <li> Recently had surgery and could not shower for a week.  These wipes were a GREAT substitute.  They are larger and thicker than regular wipes...plus whatever is in the wipes does a wonderful job of cleaning and refreshing. Awesome!!</li>
            <li> My mother was in her last days and suffered a small stroke so she couldn&#x27;t stand to shower any more.</li>
            <li> Not a substitute for old fashion water and soap, but it will let you feeling fresh - at least for a while.</li>
            <li> I have used these before. They are very convenient. When you have someone that is bedridden it is the easiest and fastest way to bath them.</li>
            <li> I bought these for last year&#x27;s Coachella festival and thank goodness. There was this huge dust storm and when I got back to the RV, I didn&#x27;t want to turn the shower brown with dirt so I actually cleaned myself off with these first and then got in. These really take a lot of nasty crap off of you. I had used them the day before but when dust storm day was the day i really NEEDED to use them. They did the job. I&#x27;m on here a year later writing a review because I wanted to see what they looked like again so I could find the leftovers somewhere in my house for Coachella next week. May just have to purchase these again. They are a good size as well. Not like little wipes.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Gets the job done ...great for bed bound or travelers who want to stay fresh.  Have purchased multiple times but now buy this product in larger quantity package.</li>
            <li> I decided not to take these on a 3-day backpacking trip because of the weight of the full package.  For &amp;#34;suitcase&amp;#34; travel, they are good for freshening up.</li>
            <li> I loved these.  I had sand embedded in oil all over my legs during a rafting trip and one of these cleaned up the whole mess.  Nice and moist and cushy.  Wish the seal would have held better but the sand was too much for any seal.  Using duct tape for the few that are left at home.</li>
            <li> THESE DO A GOOD JOB . SOMETIMES ONE IS JUST SO EXHAUSTED TO GET A BATH AT NIGHT. ESPECIALLY WHEN CHRONICALLY ILL. THESE CAN BE HEATED IN THE MICROWAVE AND USED RIGHT OUT THE PACK. NO RINSING NEEDED!!!  AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL CLEAN AND SLEEP ALOT BETTER.</li>
            <li> Used these for a music festival where showers were far away and cost too much.  These things were a life saver.  I didn&#x27;t have to deal with dirty nasty me and could go to sleep relatively clean without waiting forever to get a shower.  Definitely recommend for camping.</li>
            <li> They need a zip lock to seal. A sticker never did seal in moisture well...&lt;br /&gt;It does clean well when other options are not available. I carry them in a gallon ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> These became necessary following an operation that prevented showers for a period of time.  They more than passed the effectiveness test.  Indispensable in situations when other options are not available, or time constraints dictate their use.  Handy items to have around.</li>
            <li> these were not very good at all. They were dry and stiff and not flexible. Like they were old or something.</li>
            <li> Great for travel and camping !</li>
            <li> These are great. They clean very well (easily removed the Betadine from surgery) and leaves my skin soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> These are very thick heavy duty wipes, not like a wet-one at all.  one of them was enough for my morning clean-up on a recent trip to the boundary waters.</li>
            <li> Good to have when you do not have time for a shower, they do the job very well.</li>
            <li> Bought to use on a train trip, sufficiently thick and moist.  Also sent some overseas to military members.</li>
            <li> These are handy to use on occasion when a bath is difficult or impossible. I really appreciated having them recently when my walk-in tub stopped up and I couldn&#x27;t take a bath until I could get a plumber out.</li>
            <li> I used something like this product when I had a emergency  appendectomy in the hospital. I wanted something that would clean my 2 1/2 year old grandson when he needed a freshen up after a blow out potty training accident. These do the job ! It leaves him clean and smelling fresh !!! I will be ordering more .</li>
            <li> Good cleansing/bathing wipes, however they do leave a little bit of a sticky residue behind. Work well to not feel awful over 4 days of camping, though, and help you feel cleaner without access to a shower.</li>
            <li> I was camping for the weekend and had never been before-- I knew i would be dusty and gross and wanted a back up plan so I bought these. I ended up only using two, each night before I got into my sleeping bag, but they were awesome. I didn&#x27;t feel sticky, just clean, and I slept much better than I would&#x27;ve otherwise. One was large enough to wipe down my arms, legs and feet, and I was pretty dusty, so if you&#x27;re just sweaty or something you might be able to cover even more area.</li>
            <li> They work OK. But they do not feel as good as using soap and water. I only use them when nothing else is available. Great for a trip and for kids.</li>
            <li> Works great for me, perfect for a couple of nights camping....or anywhere else ,nice size and  feels like  a wash cloth worked well.</li>
            <li> Great for a camping trip when water access is limited!</li>
            <li> Took these to a festival. After being in 85Â° heat all day, these worked great, and aside from my hair I felt clean. You get 8 wipes per package for different parts of your body (you&#x27;ll need one package per day/wipe down).</li>
            <li> These were great, but not worth the price. I find out they are at a local store at a third of the price.</li>
            <li> No free showers in General Admission at the Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival for 4 days? Not a problem so long as you got these.</li>
            <li> These wipes are nice and thick, They could be bigger. They dont fall apart and they clean very good without leaving a sticky film.</li>
            <li> Got started on &amp;#34;bathing wipes&amp;#34; when I went camping with family a few times.  If you can&#x27;t get a good shower, these are great for getting clean in the meantime.  They are strong enough and large enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> Following a marathon in Antarctica they provided a very good alternative to a shower. Material is soft but very durable. I had no allergies no rash following use. Easy to carry in a small travel bag.</li>
            <li> These wipes are a great substitute for cleaning up when you can&#x27;t take a shower or can&#x27;t get an area wet (bandages, etc).  The product is thick and easy to handle when wiping down.</li>
            <li> these are helpful for those that have a disability or even in the summer when its so hot and humid and sweaty.  thicker than normal baby wipes</li>
            <li> The towels are thick and soft, the scent is clean and deodorizing and the moister in the towels doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling. Great for camping and travel or for those who can&#x27;t shower due to being bed ridden or after surgery. I gave some to a friend while recovering from breast cancer surgery and she loved them! Said they were helpful while she was recovering. I have used these for a quick fresher up when I&#x27;ve already showered and don&#x27;t have time for another shower that same day. Like if a take a walk on my lunch break at work, or if I&#x27;ve been cleaning the house and find out someone is coming over or I have to make a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> Worked great. Wish there were more cloths. I ended up just using 2 per day -- one for my face and one for my body. Great to rub things like bugspray and sunscreen off. Won&#x27;t come close to real shower but does the job needed to keep you as fresh as possible otherwise.</li>
            <li> These kept me &amp;#34;clean enough&amp;#34; during Burning Man. Albeit it was a low-dust week due to an early rain. My biggest concern was hygiene and these little wipes did the job. i would buy them again for another venture into the desert. :)</li>
            <li> These wipes are excellent! I commute by bicycle and use these every morning at work as part of my changing into work clothing. The scent is mild and by no means cloying. They effectively get me through the day without developing that slight funk some over-sanitized Americans find distressing.</li>
            <li> Not worth it for the price. they work find but you get only a few and they are cheaper at the local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;I like no brand wipes better</li>
            <li> These are great!  Very easy to use and to keep handy in my pack or vehicle.  Good way to freshen up when on the trail or on the job, I like them so much I have ordered more for an upcoming trip.</li>
            <li> Perfect addition to your backpacking must-haves.</li>
            <li> I went on a very primative camping trip this summer. A campsite with no running water, tied into a canoe trip in a dirty-ish lake. While most people just dealth with being disgusting for two days, I had these guys and each day after spending time in that river, I would go into my tent and \\&quot;shower\\&quot; with these things. It was the only thing that kept me clean. I love these and won&#x27;t travel without them again.</li>
            <li> This product was super good for me after having a surgery. Leaves skin clean, refreshed and it feel like you just took a shower.</li>
