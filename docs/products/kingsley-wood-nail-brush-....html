    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best nail brush ever.</li>
            <li>If they lowered the angle of that part, brush would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Best nail brush on the market.  </li>
            <li>Service was excellent.</li>
            <li>Very good quality product and as advertised.</li>
            <li>Beautifully made, so it&#x27;s a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>This is great for cleaning under my nails every day.</li>
            <li>Quality materials make this a great buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really good looking with the wood.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll never be able to replace it!</li>
            <li>Over all its a nice nail brush.</li>
            <li>My wife has tried the rest and said this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The large panel of bristles are softer than I like for nails, though they work fine, and the row of stout bristles is great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the row of angled bristles on the top that do such a marvelous job of getting under the nails.</li>
            <li>Already looking for a better one.</li>
            <li>This brush is ok.</li>
            <li>good quality, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>The longer ones perfect for stimulating circulation, sloughing off dead skin, and cleaning the outer nails.</li>
            <li>The shorter ones are great for getting deep under nails.</li>
            <li>But the brush is very useful.</li>
            <li>Keeps your nails clean and doesn&#x27;t rip your cuticles.</li>
            <li>This brush looked very nice when I received it, but within 2 weeks it had gone black around the holes where the brushes are attached.</li>
            <li>Bristles are just the right level of stifness.</li>
            <li>Great little nail brush!</li>
            <li>The little short bristles are perfect for cleaning under the nails.</li>
            <li>nice soft bristles but not overly soft.</li>
            <li>It is very much a brush-flavoured brush, manufactured from sturdy wood and bristles.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>The structure of the brush is good but the angle of the back brush (for getting under nails) is too high to actually get under your nails.</li>
            <li>and it does work very well.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush was made by an old man in the Grassmarket area of Edinburgh, Scotland who is gone now, and it finally wore out after years of use.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the bristles are longer and not as stiff as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Bristles are just the right hardness where as most nail brushes are so stiff they could remove paint from a wall.</li>
            <li>The bristles are the right stiffness to clean under my nails with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m particular about nail brushes, I guess, and this one put me off.</li>
            <li>Nail side is raised a bit high for me</li>
            <li>Soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Bristles are too soft to remove stubborn dirt/stains from around/under nails</li>
            <li>In working men.&lt;br /&gt;To soft</li>
            <li>Bristles too soft to get under my stubby nails</li>
            <li>Also, they sent me a mail order catalog despite the fact that I have never ordered directly from them and am on the Mail Preference List.</li>
            <li>Natural bristles.</li>
            <li>The angled bristles are short and stiff and do a better job of cleaning my nails</li>
            <li>Not strong enough bristles to clean nails .....</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve bought plenty of nail brushes over the years, but they never last long.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot tell if they have stopped and it was just loose ones, or if the entire brush is going to fall apart.</li>
            <li> This is for little old ladies.  </li>
            <li> (feet muddy from long photo shoot and this brush didn&#x27;t come close to removing any of the grime from toenails ...</li>
            <li> Ya wouldn&#x27;t think such a simple device could be designed so poorly, but this brush really misses the mark.</li>
            <li> It still works, but I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s going to hold up.</li>
            <li> So far it has not spontaneously combusted or poisoned a family pet...</li>
            <li> They fall apart or the bristles are so soft as to be useless.  </li>
            <li> when you work on a farm and in two big gardens, you need a serious nail brush!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve got tough hands and do lots of dirty gardening work, so this brush is probably just right for the average person.</li>
            <li> Strangely large and kindof ugly.</li>
            <li> The ones I usually get from The Body Shop have never done this.</li>
            <li> Wooden piece is so shallow (&amp;#60;1/2&amp;#34; thick) and its edges so squared off, it&#x27;s difficult and awkward to use if hands are wet, like when using in the shower or under running tap water.</li>
            <li> Seriously Amazon, do I have to review everything?</li>
            <li> but it can be a bit awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I have three dogs, and they get dirty, so my hands get dirty, too.</li>

            <li> Just what we needed for our pedicures!</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job. . Soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft to remove stubborn dirt/stains from around/under nails (feet muddy from long photo shoot and this brush didn&#x27;t come close to removing any of the grime from toenails ... eeewwwww). Wooden piece is so shallow (&amp;#60;1/2&amp;#34; thick) and its edges so squared off, it&#x27;s difficult and awkward to use if hands are wet, like when using in the shower or under running tap water. Ya wouldn&#x27;t think such a simple device could be designed so poorly, but this brush really misses the mark. Already looking for a better one.</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer that the bristles could be stiffer. However, I&#x27;ve got tough hands and do lots of dirty gardening work, so this brush is probably just right for the average person. I like it and it does work very well. My favorite brush was made by an old man in the Grassmarket area of Edinburgh, Scotland who is gone now, and it finally wore out after years of use. I guess I&#x27;ll never be able to replace it!</li>

            <li> Not strong enough bristles to clean nails .....</li>
            <li> nice soft bristles but not overly soft. cleans nails well on me and my toddler.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> The structure of the brush is good but the angle of the back brush (for getting under nails) is too high to actually get under your nails. If they lowered the angle of that part, brush would be perfect.</li>

            <li> This is great for cleaning under my nails every day. I have three dogs, and they get dirty, so my hands get dirty, too. My only issue with it is the wood has split in several places. It still works, but I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s going to hold up. The bristles are the right stiffness to clean under my nails with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought plenty of nail brushes over the years, but they never last long.  They fall apart or the bristles are so soft as to be useless.  Quality materials make this a great buy.</li>
            <li> What can I say? Great little nail brush!</li>
            <li> Not quite as &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; as in the illustration.</li>
            <li> Bristles are just the right hardness where as most nail brushes are so stiff they could remove paint from a wall.</li>
            <li> The little short bristles are perfect for cleaning under the nails. The longer ones perfect for stimulating circulation, sloughing off dead skin, and cleaning the outer nails. Beautifully made, so it&#x27;s a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the back side of the brush could be stiffer.  But the brush is very useful.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Best nail brush on the market.  This is my second one.  Service was excellent.</li>
            <li> This brush is ok. The bristles are starting to fall out and I cannot tell if they have stopped and it was just loose ones, or if the entire brush is going to fall apart. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for. Natural bristles. The shorter ones are great for getting deep under nails.</li>
            <li> good quality, exactly what I wanted. when you work on a farm and in two big gardens, you need a serious nail brush!</li>
