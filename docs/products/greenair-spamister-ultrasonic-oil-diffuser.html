            <li>but I love the design.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>perfect for diffusing essential oils - I have 2</li>
            <li>I have a different diffuser from Greenair that I love, so I bought this one because I thought it would be more attractive for the family room.</li>
            <li>It would easily be mistaken for a vase.</li>
            <li>It has two fine  mist settings which I like.</li>
            <li>it was fine.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>The device has a power button and a dimming light button.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and the mist lasts through the night.</li>
            <li>Also did not like how the plug fit.</li>
            <li>They work fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, and looks nice.</li>
            <li>I have it in my living room and it doesn&#x27;t look like a cheap piece of plastic in my room.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and lets the essential oils really scent the home.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my new Greenair Spamister Advanced Aromatherapy Diffuser for Instant Mist Wellness.</li>
            <li>It looks good, I like the ceramic cover with the butterflies, it produces a cool mist almost immediately after you turn it on, and it is simple to operate.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty but not  dependable.</li>
            <li>It was beautiful when it worked, but it is not cheap and should&#x27;ve worked longer than 3 times.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do a large room, but perfect for a bathroom or a small bedroom.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite diffusers, elegant and pretty, runs for several hours.</li>
            <li>I put quality essential oils in this diffuser and it fills the air nicely.  </li>
            <li>and they worked perfectly in the beginning, I only gave 4 stars because both are now starting to take much longer to diffuse and shut off (instead of about 4hours, it&#x27;s up to 8...).</li>
            <li>and she said I just didn&#x27;t have it seated right.  </li>
            <li>There is a plastic tube coming out the top of the diffuser which barely lets anything out...</li>
            <li>This is the third diffuser I bought and definitely the one I liked the most.</li>
            <li>Started running hot, after cleaning it seems to be running fin√®</li>
            <li>The first one broke after 2 days , they did replace it without question thankfully.</li>
            <li>It is pretty and the reviews are correct that the mist is almost instantaneous.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different diffusers over the years, and this one is at the bottom of my list.</li>
            <li>The first one fell on the floor and broke.  </li>
            <li>First, the timed setting stopped working, and it could no longer be set for 1 hour or 2 hours.</li>
            <li>They are so quiet, put out a good mist even on &#x27;low&#x27;,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been used pretty much every day.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the LED light.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is the light.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li>There is no actual &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; department available to help.</li>
            <li>If you want one that lasts more than 4 hours and shuts off automatically or has a remote, then you&#x27;ll have to spend over $100.  </li>
            <li>and it runs the whole time, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice design, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, some are difficult to open and refill, but this one is great.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will work well in her super tiny dorm room.</li>
            <li>(I use high quality oils.)</li>
            <li>Greenair adds a  little paper saying if you are not 100% satisfied to contact them, which I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to look for a new diffuser now.</li>
            <li>Then, the light stopped working, or would only work occasionally.</li>
            <li>I gave this one star because it&#x27;s pretty, and one star because it&#x27;s quiet and compact.</li>
            <li>All of my Young Living diffusers, although far more expensive, work ten times better.</li>
            <li>Bought this in early Nov and by first of dec it quiet working.</li>
            <li>This was disappointing, as this particular product seems to put out a higher output of mist than other brands, and without the time setting, you go through more oil and have to refill and reset it more often.</li>
            <li>Simple one button for on and off (high is blue light low is green light).  </li>
            <li>so i wasn&#x27;t surprised when it broke.  </li>
            <li>I have come across some other friends who purchased this and had the exact thing happen to them.  </li>
            <li>After 3 months of nightly use, the unit is barely running.  </li>
            <li>I received the item and it barely worked.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even the same quality as the one I purchased locally (the plastic container you put the water and oil in was thin clear plastic as oppose to the thick opaque plastic mine was made of and the ceramic top didn&#x27;t fit as snug as mine).  </li>
            <li>This does not last anywhere near the four hour time limit, although it will shut itself off when the water is low.</li>
            <li>It appears to be functioning at half power with very little output - and it will run for more than 24 hours if not turned off (the water just isn&#x27;t being diffused as it should).</li>
            <li>I can barely smell the oils it&#x27;s supposed to be diffusing, even when I add ten drops.</li>
            <li>This product worked well the first few times I used it, then all of a sudden when I went to turn it on, it started flickering and shut off.</li>

            <li> In small and large rooms.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve read all the reviews first, seems to be a common problem.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter&#x27;s bedroom because to was so pretty,  but a rubbish product - money down the drain- don&#x27;t waste your cash.</li>
            <li> I normally do not post reviews, but yet read them regularly when making decisions on whether or not to purchase something.</li>
            <li> I used my Young Living Oils in it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have 2 other diffusers from different manufacturers and have had no problem.  </li>
            <li> which is only about half of the time.</li>
            <li> A few days later the on/</li>
            <li> It shuts off automatically when empty.  </li>
            <li> I add a few drops of Doterra essential oils to it and use it at night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> followed the instructions to the letter, including carefully cleaning it and avoiding citrus and lemon oils.</li>
            <li> Some reviews mentioned that it gets things wet all around it, but mine hasn&#x27;t done that at all, even when used continuously on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> We could not be more disappointed in product or a company, and will not be purchasing any products from Greenair ever again.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> Not worth the 40 some dollars I spent on it.</li>
            <li> but I have not been able to find them anywhere (out of stock :( )</li>
            <li> That was it, it stopped working and $40 was down the drain.</li>
            <li> A very small amount of water, about 1/4 C., is vaporized over a period of a few hours at the highest setting to about twelve hours on the low setting.  </li>
            <li> I ran the thing for 3 days with that little bit of water in it and it still was not gone.</li>
            <li> Works for a little while and then stops:( Very pretty though.</li>
            <li> This is my first time writing a bad review</li>
            <li> Its fill well is very small, and the recommended use is five drops oil to the half cup or so of tap water in the well.</li>
            <li> I purchased the diffuser pictured (with the three butterflies and white base and no light option) at a local store for myself.  </li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> What a waste of my oils!</li>
            <li> I could get past the fact</li>
            <li> The vapor swirls up slowly through the opening like those little log cabin incense burners with just a slow swirl like a chimney smoking.</li>
            <li> Disappointed as this company was highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would give this item a negative star rating if I could.</li>
            <li> A real waste of money.</li>
            <li> It appears that this is a very small company that either does not have the staff or the ability to support their customers or stand by their product.  </li>
            <li> Seriously ?  </li>
            <li> unfortunately it worked no better.  </li>
            <li> When I received it, the diffuser was not the one pictured on the amazon website or the one pictured on the box (with the three butterflies and white base).  </li>
            <li> We used it approximately 6 times before it malfunctioned.</li>
            <li> Instead it had two butterflies with a silver flower design and a fake wooden base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very frustrated with the price and the short life of this product.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, the item stopped working after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Wrong guess.</li>
            <li> My friend had an issue with hers, wrong size plug sent and hers wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a defect in the base as it is allowing water down in the plastic base.  </li>
            <li> disappointing and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Greenair products are disappointing to me and I will not purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> I like to use espeially during cold and flu season it kills the airborne viruses if you use a oil like Doterra.</li>
            <li> The plug from the cord to base, rusted and it&#x27;s already on the blink.</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>

            <li> Started running hot, after cleaning it seems to be running fin√®</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful diffuser and matches my daughter&#x27;s butterfly room perfectly. After 3 months of nightly use, the unit is barely running.  It appears to be functioning at half power with very little output - and it will run for more than 24 hours if not turned off (the water just isn&#x27;t being diffused as it should). I&#x27;ll need to look for a new diffuser now. It&#x27;s a nice design, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased the diffuser pictured (with the three butterflies and white base and no light option) at a local store for myself.  I decided to order this one through amazon for a gift.  When I received it, the diffuser was not the one pictured on the amazon website or the one pictured on the box (with the three butterflies and white base).  Instead it had two butterflies with a silver flower design and a fake wooden base.  It wasn&#x27;t even the same quality as the one I purchased locally (the plastic container you put the water and oil in was thin clear plastic as oppose to the thick opaque plastic mine was made of and the ceramic top didn&#x27;t fit as snug as mine).  Despite what I observed I still gave this one as a gift and it worked that night for an hour.  The next day it only turned on and off and the timer options no longer worked.  A few days later the on/ off buttons wouldn&#x27;t even work.  I have come across some other friends who purchased this and had the exact thing happen to them.  Even though I love the design, I would not recommend this diffuser (I am even apprehensive about ordering any greenair brand diffuser).</li>
            <li> I like this diffuser it fills the room with wonderful fragrance. It looks very nice, the cermiac cover is very nice. The only thing that this lacks is a larger container to hold water. It&#x27;s container only lasts for 4 hours.</li>
            <li> This diffuser doesn&#x27;t work well at all. The ceramic with the butterflies is just a decorative cover that I never use because if I can get the diffuser to work, the lid has to be on crooked which prevents the ceramic cover from being used.  There is a plastic tube coming out the top of the diffuser which barely lets anything out...again, thats IF it works... which is only about half of the time. I have a different diffuser from Greenair that I love, so I bought this one because I thought it would be more attractive for the family room. It just doesn&#x27;t work well. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> This product is rubbish.  The first one broke after 2 days , they did replace it without question thankfully. The next one broke 5 days after the last return date. I have 2 other diffusers from different manufacturers and have had no problem.  I bought it for my daughter&#x27;s bedroom because to was so pretty,  but a rubbish product - money down the drain- don&#x27;t waste your cash.</li>
            <li> I have used it almost daily for over a year.  It has two fine  mist settings which I like. A very small amount of water, about 1/4 C., is vaporized over a period of a few hours at the highest setting to about twelve hours on the low setting.  It shuts off automatically when empty.  It is beautiful as well.</li>
            <li> It only lasted 5 days. Daughter bought it for me for Mother&#x27;s Day!  It is pretty and the reviews are correct that the mist is almost instantaneous.  The device has a power button and a dimming light button.  All buttons will not work.  Though the water is gone, it will not shut off. The only way I can turn it off is to unplug it.  There seems to be a defect in the base as it is allowing water down in the plastic base.  We fear a fire hazard.</li>
            <li> Not the product advertised.</li>
            <li> Bought three of these for Christmas gifts Dec 2014.  Received calls from two of the people I gave as gift and both had stopped working.  Two months ?  Seriously ?  Tried to call the customer service number, &amp;#34;tried&amp;#34; key word.  Left messages, no response.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 diffusers; 2 for me, 1 for a friend. We both love the efficiency.  They are so quiet, put out a good mist even on &#x27;low&#x27;,  they turn off automatically (in case we forget to turn them off before leaving the house) and they&#x27;re attractive. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the LED light. But then I don&#x27;t understand why so may electrical items have to have them....makes a room look like an airport runway when the room is supposed to be darkened!</li>
            <li> I gave this one star because it&#x27;s pretty, and one star because it&#x27;s quiet and compact. Its fill well is very small, and the recommended use is five drops oil to the half cup or so of tap water in the well. This does not last anywhere near the four hour time limit, although it will shut itself off when the water is low. I can barely smell the oils it&#x27;s supposed to be diffusing, even when I add ten drops. I have tried many different diffusers over the years, and this one is at the bottom of my list. All of my Young Living diffusers, although far more expensive, work ten times better. I wish I could get my money back for this. I will probably pack this up along with my daughter when she goes to college in the fall. Maybe it will work well in her super tiny dorm room.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect little diffuser.  I bought myself one and two others as gifts! I add a few drops of Doterra essential oils to it and use it at night.  Simple one button for on and off (high is blue light low is green light).  Easy to clean and the mist lasts through the night.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to use in her apartment and she and her roommate love it.  I have already purchased another for myself</li>
            <li> The plug from the cord to base, rusted and it&#x27;s already on the blink. I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks. It leaks. I&#x27;m very frustrated with the price and the short life of this product.</li>
            <li> I received this diffuser as a gift. I picked it out and put it on my wish list. It works wonderfully. In small and large rooms. I use it in my bedroom and living room. The only thing I would change is the light. It is way too bright in the bedroom.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, the item stopped working after 2 weeks. Very pretty but not  dependable. The item appears to have working difficulties with the on/off switch</li>
            <li> This worked for five minutes.  Have to send back.  Also did not like how the plug fit. Gave one star just because it was nice looking.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase.  The first one fell on the floor and broke.  It is made of a nice china so i wasn&#x27;t surprised when it broke.  They work fantastic.  I used my Young Living Oils in it everyday.  I am looking at purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser. I broke the ceramic cover and the company replaced it for free!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my Diffuser!  It is easy to use, some are difficult to open and refill, but this one is great.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite diffusers, elegant and pretty, runs for several hours.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product! We received this item as a gift. We could not be more disappointed in product or a company, and will not be purchasing any products from Greenair ever again.&lt;br /&gt;We followed the instructions to the letter, including carefully cleaning it and avoiding citrus and lemon oils. We used it approximately 6 times before it malfunctioned. First, the timed setting stopped working, and it could no longer be set for 1 hour or 2 hours. Then, the light stopped working, or would only work occasionally. The diffuser worked, but could not be set for a time limit. This was disappointing, as this particular product seems to put out a higher output of mist than other brands, and without the time setting, you go through more oil and have to refill and reset it more often. We tried all of the troubleshooting suggestions with no results. As of now, the mister only works sporadically.&lt;br /&gt;The most disheartening part was attempting to call customer service for this product when the malfunction started. There is no actual &amp;#34;customer service&amp;#34; department available to help. When calling the number, you are given a list of extensions which take you to voicemail for a specific employee.You are sent either to a sales rep or elsewhere. It appears that this is a very small company that either does not have the staff or the ability to support their customers or stand by their product.  Our voicemail was never returned. We are going to attempt an email in the hopes that it is returned and we can either get some advice on how to fix the diffuser or hopefully a replacement product. In the future we will not be purchasing this brand of essential oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> I would give this item a negative star rating if I could. I received the item and it barely worked.  Greenair adds a  little paper saying if you are not 100% satisfied to contact them, which I did. The gal was real nice and shipped a replacement unfortunately it worked no better.  Contacted Greenair again and she said I just didn&#x27;t have it seated right.  This is my 5th diffuser, not all this brand or type but it was not unseated it was fine. The vapor swirls up slowly through the opening like those little log cabin incense burners with just a slow swirl like a chimney smoking. That is not how it is supposed to come out. I ran the thing for 3 days with that little bit of water in it and it still was not gone. What a waste of my oils! Greenair products are disappointing to me and I will not purchase from them again. It is not about price but about quality.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a month</li>
            <li> Bought this diffuser trying to guess which one would work best. Wrong guess. I had it about two months when it quit working. Don&#x27;t know what to do. A real waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new Greenair Spamister Advanced Aromatherapy Diffuser for Instant Mist Wellness.</li>
            <li> Malfunctioned after only 5 days of use - had to get refund .</li>
            <li> Works for a little while and then stops:( Very pretty though. Have returned it twice!</li>
            <li> I give this diffuser 4 stars because it works as it&#x27;s supposed to.  It looks good, I like the ceramic cover with the butterflies, it produces a cool mist almost immediately after you turn it on, and it is simple to operate.  If you want one that lasts more than 4 hours and shuts off automatically or has a remote, then you&#x27;ll have to spend over $100.  For the money, it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Works very well, and looks nice. It would easily be mistaken for a vase. Some reviews mentioned that it gets things wet all around it, but mine hasn&#x27;t done that at all, even when used continuously on the highest setting. This is the prettiest inexpensive diffuser I could find.  UPDATE: Mine has worked for several months with no problems. It&#x27;s been used pretty much every day.</li>
            <li> This is the third diffuser I bought and definitely the one I liked the most. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  I bought 2 of them. You can use it as a nightlight or use it with light off! It&#x27;s beautiful with the light on and the butterflies on it. I would deff recommend it.</li>
            <li> I put quality essential oils in this diffuser and it fills the air nicely.  I like to use espeially during cold and flu season it kills the airborne viruses if you use a oil like Doterra.</li>
            <li> Horrible product! Worked for one night...one night with just water in it. I could get past the fact the design is totally different than what&#x27;s on the box.....but to break in one night. I should&#x27;ve read all the reviews first, seems to be a common problem.</li>
            <li> Bought this in early Nov and by first of dec it quiet working. Not worth the 40 some dollars I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this item and I was concerned about purchasing but I love the design. I have it in my living room and it doesn&#x27;t look like a cheap piece of plastic in my room. It&#x27;s a nice ceramic vase and when it&#x27;s not on it looks nice in the room as well as when it is on.&lt;br /&gt;I actually want a 2nd but I have not been able to find them anywhere (out of stock :( )..&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of talk about the size of the water holder. I fill mine up and run it from about 4:30 pm until bed around 9:30 and it runs the whole time, so it works great for me !</li>
            <li> Loved my diffuser, beautiful! My friend had an issue with hers, wrong size plug sent and hers wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. It works wonderfully and lets the essential oils really scent the home.</li>
            <li> perfect for diffusing essential oils - I have 2 and they worked perfectly in the beginning, I only gave 4 stars because both are now starting to take much longer to diffuse and shut off (instead of about 4hours, it&#x27;s up to 8...).</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprise, it is so beautiful in person. Exceeded my expectations.  Works great and easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t do a large room, but perfect for a bathroom or a small bedroom.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! It puts out a nice mist and fragrance. (I use high quality oils.) I have had no problems at all with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I normally do not post reviews, but yet read them regularly when making decisions on whether or not to purchase something. This is my first time writing a bad review but I feel as though I must so others like me know what might happen. This product worked well the first few times I used it, then all of a sudden when I went to turn it on, it started flickering and shut off. That was it, it stopped working and $40 was down the drain. It was beautiful when it worked, but it is not cheap and should&#x27;ve worked longer than 3 times. Disappointed as this company was highly recommended.</li>
