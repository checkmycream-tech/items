            <li> if your buying empty cups.(Think</li>
            <li> /&gt;they work, but one has a &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; nipple and the other doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> but in reality they are very thin and they don&#x27;t add much to really even make a difference.</li>
            <li> I was going to return them but to tell the truth I never end up returning half the things I should.</li>
            <li> Okay...so I am a size B (not really FULL B, but a B nonetheless).  </li>
            <li> They are also very thick to give the appearance that when you wear them, your bust will appear larger.    </li>
            <li> Th esteem I received was extremely thin and both pads were attached with a plastic clasp in the middle.</li>
            <li> These are thin and have a sticky back, not noted in promo.  </li>
            <li> These were a waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is too thick, and is complete useless for me.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with these purchase.</li>
            <li> too bad the 2nd time I tried to wear it</li>

            <li> I am not happy.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wore them on my wedding day and ended up taking them out 1/2 way through the day because they were just annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These inserts do the job when you want to wear a nice strapless dress and you&#x27;re looking for that extra lift and cleavage.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for. They fit nicely and they do exactly what you expect them to! Make your boobs look bigger! They are perfect for when I was to cosplay as a character with larger boobs. They also look exactly what the picture shows, no clips or anything. They just suction to your boobs. They feel cool, not really cold but definitely cool, when you put them on at first. Its probably just the sticky stuff. I can wear them all day without irritation and the cool feeling goes away after a little while.    These are perfect if you want your boobs to look bigger.</li>
            <li> The picture clearly shows two individual silcone pads. They are also very thick to give the appearance that when you wear them, your bust will appear larger.    Th esteem I received was extremely thin and both pads were attached with a plastic clasp in the middle. Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> They were not what I excepted at all. I was not pleased with these purchase. They didnt add any size or enhancement. I wont suggest these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was going to return them but to tell the truth I never end up returning half the things I should. I decided I would use these instead of nipple sheilds. But I bought them to use under my strappless dress at a wedding but they kept showing because they are kinda tall (covers alot of the breast) If I was to ever get these from the store and got to see them first, I wouldnt of got them. If I wanted them to be used as a nipple sheild I woulda gotten a size smaller then I am.</li>
            <li> Yes, the 1st time I put this insert in I was amazed.....too bad the 2nd time I tried to wear it I got 1/2 way through dinner and \\&quot;pop!\\&quot; the fastner, which is not shown that holds the 2 sides together for enhanced clevage pulled apart. &lt;br /&gt;My breasts looked deformed! &lt;br /&gt;My husband had to whisper for me to go to the bathroom and correct myself!!!! &lt;br /&gt;I tried to replace it and purchased another one--same thing--2nd use and it popped! &lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend but for 1 use! If you are looking for regular wear BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> These are thin and have a sticky back, not noted in promo.  Also has a center clip not shown.  Not what I expected &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Okay...so I am a size B (not really FULL B, but a B nonetheless).  I got these Silicon Inserts b/c I&#x27;m going to Miami and wanted to have some cleavage.  I learned that if you position them just right, they&#x27;re perfect.  Make sure to angle them at a downward slant, angling from high outer edge of breast down to lower inside edge.  I made mine just barely cover my nipple and then when I clasped it, it was instant cleavage.  I also still wore a strapless bra.  The further out you space them, the more cleavage you get.  These really do work!!!</li>
            <li> Very good for filling out, I would have preferred a little more (I have note exactly got alot to work with) You may need more padding. But they work good. and the material is top notch as far as consistency, and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t quite get 5 stars as the sizing was a bit confusing/misleading/vague on the page.</li>
            <li> I am happy with them!</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t quite what I thought they were,  I will be returning them.  They don&#x27;t fit the bras and don&#x27;t work for ,my purpose</li>
            <li> these inserts are hilarious, they have become quite the conversation piece amongst my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they work, but one has a &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; nipple and the other doesn&#x27;t so I can&#x27;t wear it with just anything.</li>
            <li> They are okay but not the ones that I expected.  I wanted the ones that are fuller at the top.</li>
            <li> These were a waste of money. For anyone needing a little extra help, these do not have much to them. They appear to be pretty thick in the picture but in reality they are very thin and they don&#x27;t add much to really even make a difference. I wore them on my wedding day and ended up taking them out 1/2 way through the day because they were just annoying.</li>
            <li> I am using them while I await breast augmentation surgety and they have been great. I look fuller so that after the procedure it won&#x27;t be so obviously since Im doing a conservative increase. The only con is that they have an adhesive that is sticky and causes breast area to have slight odor once removed.</li>
            <li> They stay on very well and even provide some lift. Great for strapless or skimpy clothes.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. It was difficult to see detail in pictures and description was not accurate. Did not meet my needs.</li>
            <li> It is soft but the shape is far from my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;It is too thick, and is complete useless for me.</li>
            <li> Happy with product. helps match smaller breast to match the larger one. easy cleaning with soapy water &amp; air dry. Shipping was quick. actually learned about these on a tv sitcom!  stays sticky without glue</li>
            <li> they are supposed to be self-adhesive and there is no stick...I am not happy. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!! Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I did not understand what I was buying so its OK if your buying empty cups.(Think of this as buying individual bra cups made of silicone sparated). Size B means size B cup shell here is no thickness to give enhancement.&lt;br /&gt;Hope you understand what I am saying.</li>
            <li> The sticky backing actually sticks! I have used these a multitude of times now, and still do not have to worry about them sliding around or falling away.</li>
