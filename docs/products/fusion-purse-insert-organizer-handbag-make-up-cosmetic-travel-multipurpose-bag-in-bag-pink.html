            <li>It makes it so handy to find what I need in a hurry.  </li>

            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Best purchase of the year so far!</li>
            <li>I luved the concept and the zippers worked fine, plenty of pockets and it was cute!  </li>
            <li>One of the handles ripped very quickly and the organizer kind of flops around in my purse because it does not have a sturdy frame.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I use one for a purse organizer, and love all the pockets.  </li>
            <li>The design and color is cute.  </li>
            <li>If the sides were stiffer, that probably would have worked better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this bag.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more..</li>
            <li>I wish it was a bit more structured.</li>
            <li>I will definitely do more research before buying another purse insert.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Liked so much bought friend one for a gift!!!</li>
            <li>Specially jokari over the door hanging was amazing...</li>
            <li>seller was kind enough to replace my items and I was greatly thankful for that.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have this in a great purse with lots of pockets, but this organizer means I can pull it out of my current purse and put it in a smaller/less organized purse and have all my stuff handy.</li>
            <li>This purse organizer is cheap, cute, and has plenty of pockets...</li>
            <li>Easy to pull this product out of one purse to another.</li>
            <li>And I can easily reach for everything else.</li>
            <li>Easy to switch between handbags.</li>
            <li>but I now use it on my night stand to put my book light pens and stuff like that in it.</li>
            <li>I still had to cram it in my purse to make it fit, though.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic organizer fits in my purse and allows me to keep everything organized</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to measure your handbag before you buy this, to ensure it will fit.</li>
            <li>and I can easily find things quickly.  </li>
            <li>But for a small to medium tote, it is perfect.</li>
            <li>and I got it so quickly.</li>
            <li>Seems to be pretty good quality and has lots of outside pockets, which I like.  </li>
            <li>I am now able to pack all my stuff in my back and switch easily between bag.</li>
            <li>You can fit so much in to the organizer.</li>
            <li>it is very useful considering there isn&#x27;t much that she doesn&#x27;t carry around with her, it fits almost everything.</li>
            <li>new items I received were in a lot better condition and am very please.</li>
            <li>I may purchase a smaller one for my make-up; there is a zipper top</li>
            <li>Really, really like it!</li>
            <li>At first I was dispointed when I purchased these items, when I received them they were damaged.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>What I know is that I&#x27;ll never take more than a second to find my wallet in my (pocketless) purse.</li>
            <li>Most purses are just one big opening and this helps organized my purse!  </li>
            <li>This purse insert is rather large, which is what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I have finally found an organizer for my purse that is light weight</li>
            <li>Keeps my purse very organized</li>
            <li>so things don&#x27;t hold up very well in it.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>I really did but the handles got in the way.</li>
            <li>Really helpful with staying organized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, not great but OK.</li>
            <li>I use the main compartment for my compact, blush, etc., and the pockets to hold my brushes, lipsticks, liners, etc.  </li>
            <li>Very flimsy, material is very soft.</li>
            <li>I have 2 of these little organizers, and love them.  </li>
            <li>So many uses for this little organizer.</li>
            <li>It is pretty big though.  </li>
            <li>Large deep bags are a no.</li>
            <li>it completely sloved my purpose..</li>
            <li>Wish I would have checked better, there were other inserts for less money.</li>
            <li>You put your stuff in this bag, all neat and organized, and when you want to change purses, you simply lift it out and drop it into your new bag.  </li>
            <li>she can keep her entire bedroom in her purse and not have to empty the entire thing out whenever she wants to carry a different bag.</li>

            <li> First everything I need and keeps what needs to be hidden, hidden.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still an improvement of just throwing everything in my purse, but not a very high quality item.  </li>
            <li> I use the other one for my daily cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> Overall it keeps me from tearing my hair out when looking for something in the black hole that is my purse!</li>
            <li> Due to our prime account, it came in two days.</li>
            <li> Others cost 54.00 and up, which I was not willing to pay.  </li>
            <li> The gray interior color makes it difficult to see to the bottom of a large purse.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> but it never stays up, always falling down.</li>
            <li> The organizer just became another item that was sitting in the bottom of my purse flattened out creating less organization than before I used it in my purse.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but it was not functional and I had high hopes that it would have worked so well because I do need something like that.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this purse organizer but was a bit disappointed once I started using it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little flimsy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sturdy and its was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> ; and you girls know what I mean, this is the accessory for you!</li>
            <li> However, when I put it in my purse it would collapse on the sides and now my stuff was sitting on the sides and it was difficult to see what pocket I was trying to get into.</li>
            <li> I use a hobo bag, so I was desperate to get something that kept my items in one place.  </li>
            <li> they stood behind there product and so thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this to put my make up in but it never stays up, always falling down. I don&#x27;t use allot of make up but I now use it on my night stand to put my book light pens and stuff like that in it. It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I have finally found an organizer for my purse that is light weight and I can find everything so easily now!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Keeps my purse very organized and I can easily find things quickly.  Great choice of colors, as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to pull this product out of one purse to another. First everything I need and keeps what needs to be hidden, hidden. And I can easily reach for everything else.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this purse organizer but was a bit disappointed once I started using it.  It&#x27;s a little flimsy so things don&#x27;t hold up very well in it.  Will not be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy, material is very soft. Doesn&#x27;t stand so all my stuff falls all over inside my purse. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, not great but OK. It&#x27;s still an improvement of just throwing everything in my purse, but not a very high quality item.  One of the handles ripped very quickly and the organizer kind of flops around in my purse because it does not have a sturdy frame.</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these little organizers, and love them.  I use one for a purse organizer, and love all the pockets.  It makes it so handy to find what I need in a hurry.  I use the other one for my daily cosmetics.  I use the main compartment for my compact, blush, etc., and the pockets to hold my brushes, lipsticks, liners, etc.  When I travel I use the zippered pockets for holding some baby wipes (in a ziplock bag) for removing makeup. So many uses for this little organizer.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for a large tote! Love all the compartments this organizer has!! Very sturdy and well made. Liked so much bought friend one for a gift!!!</li>
            <li> The design and color is cute.  But, it&#x27;s kind of flimsy.  It doesn&#x27;t stay upright in purse. If the sides were stiffer, that probably would have worked better. I didn&#x27;t return it, although I should have. I keep telling myself, maybe I can put something in it to make it stiffer but, I haven&#x27;t yet. Would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I tried touse this...I really did but the handles got in the way. It&#x27;s not sturdy and its was a waste of my money. I&#x27;ve tried different purses. NOPE....doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> What all i bought was a best deal n excellent quality! Specially jokari over the door hanging was amazing...it completely sloved my purpose..</li>
            <li> This purse insert is rather large, which is what I wanted.  I still had to cram it in my purse to make it fit, though.

            <li> Really helpful with staying organized. Easy to switch between handbags. You can fit so much in to the organizer. I love it.</li>
            <li> Too Flimsly. Doesn&#x27;t support the stuff in.</li>
            <li> I love this bag.  It is just perfect for my needs and I got it so quickly. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more..AAAA+</li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit more structured.</li>
            <li> Very handy to change bags!! Really, really like it! Wish I would have checked better, there were other inserts for less money.</li>
            <li> Purchased &amp;#34;on the fly&amp;#34;, needing it immediately. Due to our prime account, it came in two days. The appearance is as shown, but it does not stand alone. One side of the fabric handle was not properly sewn and it came apart before using it once. The gray interior color makes it difficult to see to the bottom of a large purse. I will definitely do more research before buying another purse insert.</li>
            <li> I am now able to pack all my stuff in my back and switch easily between bag. The only limitation is the type of bag that it can be used for. Large deep bags are a no. But for a small to medium tote, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> If you are a person that has a lot of purses, this insert is great!  Others cost 54.00 and up, which I was not willing to pay.  For that price, I could buy another Vera Bradley bag.  You put your stuff in this bag, all neat and organized, and when you want to change purses, you simply lift it out and drop it into your new bag.  Its a great size for the &amp;#34;Mandy&amp;#34; Vera Bradley bag.  It even has zippered sides where you can zip stuff out of site.  If your purse it a &amp;#34;bottomless pit&amp;#34; and you girls know what I mean, this is the accessory for you!</li>
            <li> I use a hobo bag, so I was desperate to get something that kept my items in one place.  The insert does tip over a lot and things can  fall out, but there are 2 zippered compartments for things that you don&#x27;t want to lose at the bottom of your purse.  Overall it keeps me from tearing my hair out when looking for something in the black hole that is my purse!</li>
            <li> got this for my mother last Mother&#x27;s Day. she has been using it every day since! she can keep her entire bedroom in her purse and not have to empty the entire thing out whenever she wants to carry a different bag. it is very useful considering there isn&#x27;t much that she doesn&#x27;t carry around with her, it fits almost everything.</li>
            <li> Love it... Fantastic organizer fits in my purse and allows me to keep everything organized</li>
            <li> Hate it. It folds over in my purse and does not hold the items well. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> At first I was dispointed when I purchased these items, when I received them they were damaged.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was kind enough to replace my items and I was greatly thankful for that.&lt;br /&gt;The new items I received were in a lot better condition and am very please. I would recommend this product to all my friends. they stood behind there product and so thank you!!! they are everything I exspected.</li>
            <li> This purse organizer is cheap, cute, and has plenty of pockets... what else can you ask for? What I know is that I&#x27;ll never take more than a second to find my wallet in my (pocketless) purse. Best purchase of the year so far!</li>
            <li> Does what it says - keeps things organized!  It is pretty big though.  You&#x27;ll need to measure your handbag before you buy this, to ensure it will fit.</li>
            <li> Most purses are just one big opening and this helps organized my purse!  The quality is great and I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have this in a great purse with lots of pockets, but this organizer means I can pull it out of my current purse and put it in a smaller/less organized purse and have all my stuff handy. Nice.</li>
