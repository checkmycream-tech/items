    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The taste is not the best</li>
            <li>In the end I think it&#x27;s probably best if you can afford it to go to a dentist and get your teeth done.</li>
            <li>For best results you need to use this product in the morning and evening</li>
            <li>The taste is not the best</li>
            <li>Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>to use and great benefits.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just even some whitening made me happy.  </li>
            <li>and so it doesn&#x27;t seem very effective.  </li>
            <li>As for the price, it&#x27;s fair...</li>
            <li>; however, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are looking for an effective teeth whitener.</li>
            <li>I was worried the product would wash off my teeth from my salivating mouth, spitting, and having my lips over my teeth, but the product was still effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, whatever Amazon is shipping out is old!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, this product is nice because there is no trays, easy to apply and fairly non--messy.  </li>
            <li>You pay for speed (5 days costs more than 7 days, for example)</li>
            <li>Also, these days, most products are ONCE PER DAY use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some, that might be a plus that makes this worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to see more gel in the pens.  </li>
            <li>Being able to paint it on your teeth was convenient.  </li>
            <li>I thought this whitening product would work better than most because it has a protective gel that you apply before the whitening solution that can help with tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t really sure I was using them right.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is best to just save up and pay for actual teeth whitening from a dentist.</li>
            <li>The application process is so much better than using the trays.</li>
            <li>Most stains on my teeth are not going anywhere.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it for many days in a row, so</li>
            <li>If this product had worked as stated, I would have really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>That would be ok if the gel came out smoothly, or at all.  </li>
            <li>For me, the system is just not as easy or efficient...</li>
            <li>Keeping this stuff on my teeth for 30 minutes was not going to be easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The product is great if you can get it fresh and new.  </li>
            <li>Primarily because I feel like I can&#x27;t close my mouth while I have the gel on my teeth</li>
            <li>This one came out in crusty globs, instead of smooth on the brush.  </li>
            <li>If so, I would be happy to come back to this product time and again.</li>
            <li>The results I had were after basically one day of using the product, and it was still okay for me, but I wonder if it could have done better if I had more whitening product - or if that really is all that is normally</li>
            <li>This product has some good things about it, but overall I don&#x27;t think it works.  </li>
            <li>Does that sound like fun?</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how effective this was for me.</li>
            <li>I am taking off a full star, though, because the pens run out REALLY quickly - in about a week for me, which is a lot shorter time than the whitening gel in a tube like nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I saw a very mild change in color after the first day, but then nothing since.  </li>
            <li>so the product gets pushed out consistently and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Prime Time Smile</li>
            <li>Time Smile recommends TWICE PER DAY...</li>
            <li>I actually really liked this product, and I could see myself actually buying it again.  </li>
            <li>super easy to use but not super effective.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used a whitening product in years since it never seemed worth the expense and hassle from sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>The pens then went right in the garbage.  </li>
            <li>Love the idea, especailly since it means you can get at the inside back teeth.  </li>
            <li>Also, you could theoretically whiten more teeth...</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, I had to sit there cranking away on the twist-bottom for quite a while before any gel appeared in the brush.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I would most likely recommend looking out for another product.</li>
            <li>Whitestrips are so much easier!</li>
            <li>I have to admit first off</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say don&#x27;t get it, but I will caution to get it on sale to first try it out.</li>
            <li>gel tastes nice, not minty, maybe fruity but not very flavored at all.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many days this stuff will actually last.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, nice product for me.</li>
            <li>It was fun seeing little bubbles after both applications, kind of like peroxide on a cut.  </li>
            <li>And the most important thing is that it works - in just a few days</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it has some positive things about it.  </li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t blow me away, I didn&#x27;t see too much</li>
            <li>The concept of the Prime Time Smile Dual Action teeth</li>
            <li>the whole 30 minutes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the product really stays on the teeth.  </li>
            <li>However, this product is really a pain to use.  </li>
            <li>Noticeable for me, and as much as I could expect from a product in this price range.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a reasonable price and works well - I really did notice a difference between this and other whitening gels, because it stays on better.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it quite as often or for quite as long, as I feel my teeth are somewhat fragile at this point, but the effect is noticeable, and I am smiling much more!</li>
            <li>The other teeth&#x27;s contrast makes it more noticeable.</li>
            <li>The white solution smoothed on much easier, but I think it just gets washed off quickly because of saliva</li>
            <li>Even though the directions said that it&#x27;d take a few clicks to get both the pre-whitening treatment and teeth whitening gel to come up to the brush, it took way more then that and made me wonder if there was even that much product in the tubes.</li>
            <li>hope a little more work goes into the quality of the dispensing pen</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth however and after the first application I found my teeth to be sensitive to the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>what I realized is that they all have pretty much the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li>that I only used Prime Time Smile</li>
            <li>Before I had even tried the whitening, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the packaging as the whitening gel had dried gunk on it, which led me to believe it had probably leaked at one time leaving me with less product as well.</li>
            <li>right there, it&#x27;s a less exciting product for me.  </li>
            <li>While the brush is a nice aspect, I had a hard time seeing if the gels had covered my tooth since they&#x27;re practically clear.</li>
            <li>The taste was subtle mint and chlorine - it kind of reminded me of pool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tend to have very sensitive teeth but didn&#x27;t have a problem using Prime Time Teeth Whitening but after 5 days I didn&#x27;t notice any change in teeth color.</li>
            <li>Prime Time Smile Dual Action Teeth Whitening had the promise that it would whiten teeth in five days, and to be honest, I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li>With that said, I went through the product pretty fast and had minimal whitening.  </li>
            <li>Dual Action Teeth Whitening works with a two step process.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for the old Crest I had used, which seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth with Sensodyne because I have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>also like that it comes with a protecting gel - that did work to protect my gums and sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>rather spend my money on a professional job.</li>
            <li>Dual Action Teeth Whitening for about five days, but had to stop because my gums were getting irritated</li>
            <li>, so it might work for others who don&#x27;t have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The use, on the other hand, was not disappointing at all.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would use something like Crest Whitestrips instead, you&#x27;ll get more value for your money and it will actually whiten your teeth a few shades.</li>
            <li>What it comes down to is delivery method and price and this product wins on both counts.  </li>
            <li>but I found that a little time constraining and my teeth were a too bothered by the Prime Time smile Dual Action Whitening System for me to use it twice a day for a week.</li>
            <li>but they all work and are relatively easy to use and make minimal mess.  </li>
            <li>I have used a product similar to this before with no trouble.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the easiest products I have used and has about the same results as the others.</li>
            <li>Each tube comes with less than .05 oz (.04) to be exact.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were pretty gnarly to begin with from years of drinking black teas.</li>
            <li>I am not giving a very poor review, even though as sold I did not find it effective.  </li>
            <li>First, I like that you can paint just the areas and the teeth you want with the little brush.  </li>
            <li>The difference after my initial use was mild, but not sure if it was from the product or my whitening tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a chancy product to buy, I can see it drying up pretty fast, it possibly leaks, and it&#x27;s hard to figure out if there&#x27;s enough on your teeth.</li>
            <li>The whitening technically lives up to its promise but barely.  </li>
            <li>and I can see it getting old with long term use.  </li>
            <li>During that time, since it promises results within a few days, I examined my teeth pretty well</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package, I noticed that the white pen had already leaked a little.</li>
            <li>(whereas with crest whitestrips I usually see one right away).</li>
            <li>Occasionally I will have slight problems with my gums, but usually due to stress or other issues, so I can&#x27;t be sure this caused it or not.</li>
            <li>I assume they did, but I&#x27;d like to know I&#x27;m not using too much, or too little either.</li>
            <li>The good news is they don&#x27;t taste bad and they don&#x27;t sting your teeth.</li>

            <li> Each tube comes with less than .05 oz (.04) to be exact.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were pretty gnarly to begin with from years of drinking black teas.</li>
            <li> I am not giving a very poor review, even though as sold I did not find it effective.  </li>
            <li> First, I like that you can paint just the areas and the teeth you want with the little brush.  </li>
            <li> The difference after my initial use was mild, but not sure if it was from the product or my whitening tooth paste.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a chancy product to buy, I can see it drying up pretty fast, it possibly leaks, and it&#x27;s hard to figure out if there&#x27;s enough on your teeth.</li>
            <li> The whitening technically lives up to its promise but barely.  </li>
            <li> and I can see it getting old with long term use.  </li>
            <li> During that time, since it promises results within a few days, I examined my teeth pretty well</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, I noticed that the white pen had already leaked a little.</li>
            <li> (whereas with crest whitestrips I usually see one right away).</li>
            <li> Occasionally I will have slight problems with my gums, but usually due to stress or other issues, so I can&#x27;t be sure this caused it or not.</li>
            <li> I assume they did, but I&#x27;d like to know I&#x27;m not using too much, or too little either.</li>
            <li> The good news is they don&#x27;t taste bad and they don&#x27;t sting your teeth.</li>
            <li> But the main reason I have to dock this system a couple of stars is that it is a pain to on and a bit messy.  </li>
            <li> I twisted the first tube for ages, and I was pretty convinced they were empty.  </li>
            <li> Usually the main ingredient in these products is peroxide.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t particularly heavy-handed (imo) with the amount used so the amount included was really small or</li>
            <li> The solution in the blue tube, the pre-solution, was thick and clumpy and hard to smooth onto my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Over the last few years, I&#x27;ve used several different strip products for teeth whitening.  </li>
            <li> left my mouth closed while this product was on my teeth while saliva gathered since I didn&#x27;t want to swallow.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it acted differently and the gel just wasn&#x27;t as visible as it is in the other product</li>
            <li> and then when I tried to apply the white one, it just leaked down the side of my pen.</li>
            <li> but when you only have a small amount to last you 10 applications.  </li>
            <li> The product in the whitening pen didn&#x27;t last past the 2nd day.</li>
            <li> After turning the next time, all the product from the previous turns included would come gushing out</li>
            <li> A little bit of gel finally came out.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product had a bad taste or burned my gums, but I didn&#x27;t really notice too much difference after using it for the recommended five days.</li>
            <li> When I got these, the tubes seemed empty.  </li>
            <li> I finally got some on, but I was worried my teeth were going to bleach unevenly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, the pens still seem to be empty to me.</li>
            <li> However, my gum inflammation eased up a few days after I stopped using it, so it is likely.</li>
            <li> As teeth whitening products go, I&#x27;d say this is no better or worse than the other options, the main one being those clear plastic strips you put on your teeth.</li>
            <li> After use, they improved to pale yellow/borderline white.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete failure for me.</li>
            <li> One pen is a pre-treatment, the other a whitening gel.</li>
            <li> But this is a two wand system and you are to paint one substance on before the other.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not noticeably whiter!</li>
            <li> I seriously twisted for far too long - these things are apparently nearly empty of product.  </li>
            <li> Instead of strips that are hard to position, and may not provide proper coverage for all kinds of teeth, this set comes as two wands which you are to paint on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> all at once so it would be a nothing or landslide effect of product coming out which was hard to regulate when you&#x27;re trying to ration it out over several uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You are instructed to not eat, drink, or wash your mouth out for at least thirty minutes following the procedure.  </li>
            <li> I will say that a small amount seems to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I put them down on my vanity.  </li>
            <li> The prices are going down every year.</li>
            <li> It literally takes less than one minute.  </li>
            <li> After using it for over a week, my teeth were slightly whiter, but nothing too noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Try not to spit for a half hour, then rinse it out.</li>
            <li> Ive tried this for 2 and a half days</li>
            <li> I did find that I had to spit a few times just due to the fizziness of the Hydrogen Peroxide after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> The idea behind the two brushes is that one prepares your teeth for being whitened while the other actually whitens.  </li>
            <li> However, the white pen continued to leak worse and worse and ended up getting completely stuck to my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> If they&#x27;re not what little is coming out</li>
            <li> A little.</li>
            <li> I could get a little on the tip, so I applied that to my teeth and cleaned off the pen where it had leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was a little messy and a waste of product.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that it lived up to its promise, but I was also disappointed to see that the whitening was barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product leaked and was dried out when i got it</li>
            <li> It then fizzed in your mouth, and for me, it also dried out my gums.  </li>
            <li> Also product has no impact on tooth that is dead.  </li>
            <li> I do believe it was dried out.</li>
            <li> , it stopped me from doing it a few times.  </li>
            <li> It was not easy to try to paint onto my teeth.  </li>
            <li> For anyone who has wasted money on whitening strips or trays, or any of these mediocre mid- priced products.... you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> using it is a little clumsy compared to a whitening tray formed from your teeth.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s supposed to happen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different whitening products over the years including some expensive one and</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a brush on gel, instead of strips, just because it&#x27;s easier, but you do have to brush your teeth before you apply it, and that may make you lazy about it</li>
            <li> the turning-clicking base failed at some point and no more product got pushed up through the top</li>
            <li> The good feature of this product is not having to use those silly and awful trays.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> It tastes bad, I feel myself trying not to gag or swallow directly after using it.</li>
            <li> This product was not effective for me.</li>
            <li> FInally, an extremely thick, gloopy paste came out.</li>
            <li> The taste is unpleasant, and I noticed my lips had a white film on them from the hydrogen peroxide, and I had hydrogen peroxide on my hand as well.  </li>
            <li> The gel was very thick and hard to spread on my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really fair for me to review this product, because I have tetracycline staining on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Strips are annoying, but at least they are pressed against the teeth for a specific amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Mornings are tough for me as it is, and remembering to apply this product is a challenge.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a dramatic difference</li>

            <li> I must&#x27;ve twisted the thing for twenty minutes - no gel.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no spring chicken, so my teeth have been progressively yellowing with the years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been afraid to use anything but the whitening toothpastes, and they do help, but don&#x27;t do the job like Prime Time.  </li>

            <li> The bad thing is there&#x27;s no portion control</li>

            <li> With both pens, often I would turn two-three times at the base and no product would come out.</li>
            <li> It also tastes horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Prime Time Smile Dual Action Teeth Whitening works with a two step process. One pen is a pre-treatment, the other a whitening gel. The pens are activated by twisting one end. I didn&#x27;t find this product had a bad taste or burned my gums, but I didn&#x27;t really notice too much difference after using it for the recommended five days. I did like the pen type application, with the brush. I&#x27;ve used stronger, expensive teeth whitening products before and while those burned my gums, they worked. This product didn&#x27;t blow me away, I didn&#x27;t see too much whitening take effect, definitely not enough to make any difference. It was just so-so for me.</li>
            <li> The good feature of this product is not having to use those silly and awful trays. You simply paint your teeth twice s day and keep it moving.  The taste is not the best but I can suffer the distaste for pearly whites.  The difference after my initial use was mild, but not sure if it was from the product or my whitening tooth paste.  I have stained teeth thanks to my green tea consumption, so my experience may not be drastic to begin with.  In the end I think it&#x27;s probably best if you can afford it to go to a dentist and get your teeth done.</li>
            <li> The concept of the Prime Time Smile Dual Action teeth Whitening kit is a greta one.  Instead of strips that are hard to position, and may not provide proper coverage for all kinds of teeth, this set comes as two wands which you are to paint on your teeth.  Love the idea, especailly since it means you can get at the inside back teeth.  But this is a two wand system and you are to paint one substance on before the other.  That would be ok if the gel came out smoothly, or at all.  No amount of turning as instructed go both wands to work reliably at the same time.  Of course your mileage may vary</li>
            <li> product leaked and was dried out when i got it</li>
            <li> Over the last few years, I&#x27;ve used several different strip products for teeth whitening.  They all work.  You pay for speed (5 days costs more than 7 days, for example)...but they all work and are relatively easy to use and make minimal mess.  Also, these days, most products are ONCE PER DAY use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prime Time Smile recommends TWICE PER DAY...right there, it&#x27;s a less exciting product for me.  Mornings are tough for me as it is, and remembering to apply this product is a challenge.  But the main reason I have to dock this system a couple of stars is that it is a pain to on and a bit messy.  It is no comparison to the ease of strips, in my opinion.  You have to brush on two different gels onto your teeth, and the stuff gets bit gloppy.  It then fizzed in your mouth, and for me, it also dried out my gums.  Dessicated them!  I felt like I was swallowing the stuff the whole 30 minutes I had it on.  For me, the system is just not as easy or efficient...thus, I will not use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES whiten teeth.  I&#x27;ll give it that.  Just as well as 5-7 day strips THAT YOU USE ONCE PER DAY.  Also, you could theoretically whiten more teeth...because you&#x27;re not constrained by strips, you could coat all your teeth if you wanted to, I reckon.  For some, that might be a plus that makes this worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and great benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Smile is brighter in 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must buy product</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this whitener after I had ordered it once I read more about it online. I used it for a week and saw no changes in the color of my teef.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it as a whitener. I&#x27;ll be looking for the old Crest I had used, which seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Since they were advertising this as an alternative to trays, I was looking forward to trying this teeth whitening system. When I first opened it, I had to sit there cranking away on the twist-bottom for quite a while before any gel appeared in the brush. I was disappointed to see that it then requires being on the teeth for a half hour... Primarily because I feel like I can&#x27;t close my mouth while I have the gel on my teeth (I don&#x27;t want my lips to push the whitening gel off my teeth). I still feel like the trays or strips are easier to use. I&#x27;ve also noticed no changes in my teeth... Certainly not noticeably whiter!</li>
            <li> The blue pen lasted only two applications! I think they sell &amp;#34;pens&amp;#34; so you cant see there&#x27;s nothing in them. All profit.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked this product, and I could see myself actually buying it again.  It&#x27;s a reasonable price and works well - I really did notice a difference between this and other whitening gels, because it stays on better.  I am taking off a full star, though, because the pens run out REALLY quickly - in about a week for me, which is a lot shorter time than the whitening gel in a tube like nail polish.  I&#x27;d like to see more gel in the pens.  Other than that, nice product for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of teeth whitening products.  None have ever worked, and they&#x27;ve also always been a pain to use.  Prime Time Smile Dual Action Teeth Whitening had the promise that it would whiten teeth in five days, and to be honest, I was a bit skeptical.  I was surprised to find that it lived up to its promise, but I was also disappointed to see that the whitening was barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The use, on the other hand, was not disappointing at all.  There are two brushes that you twist in order to release the whitening fluid then simply paint your teeth with.  It literally takes less than one minute.  You are instructed to not eat, drink, or wash your mouth out for at least thirty minutes following the procedure.  I did find that I had to spit a few times just due to the fizziness of the Hydrogen Peroxide after a few minutes.  The idea behind the two brushes is that one prepares your teeth for being whitened while the other actually whitens.  It&#x27;s designed to speed up the whitening process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short version of everything I&#x27;ve said: super easy to use but not super effective.  The whitening technically lives up to its promise but barely.  For that reason, I would most likely recommend looking out for another product.</li>
            <li> When I got these, the tubes seemed empty.  I twisted the first tube for ages, and I was pretty convinced they were empty.  I put them down on my vanity.  The next night, I picked it up again and twisted some more, to check before throwing them out.  A little bit of gel finally came out.  I painted it on my teeth, and picked up the second pen.  I seriously twisted for far too long - these things are apparently nearly empty of product.  FInally, an extremely thick, gloopy paste came out. It was not easy to try to paint onto my teeth.  It was clinging to the brush as though it&#x27;s life depended on it.  I finally got some on, but I was worried my teeth were going to bleach unevenly.  The taste is unpleasant, and I noticed my lips had a white film on them from the hydrogen peroxide, and I had hydrogen peroxide on my hand as well.  Keeping this stuff on my teeth for 30 minutes was not going to be easy.  I ended up giving up and just brushing it off my teeth because I couldn&#x27;t stand the taste.  The pens then went right in the garbage.  Whitestrips are so much easier!</li>
            <li> The product claims to noticeably whiten your teeth within five days.  Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t the case.  After using it for over a week, my teeth were slightly whiter, but nothing too noticeable.  I&#x27;ve listed the pros and cons below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- The biggest downside is what I already stated.  It doesn&#x27;t noticeably whiten your teeth.  I think this could be used if you&#x27;ve whitened your teeth and want to maintain the results.&lt;br /&gt;- Each tube comes with less than .05 oz (.04) to be exact.  That&#x27;s not a lot of product.  I will say that a small amount seems to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;- The whitening gel and pretreatment come in a convenient tube.  However, when I opened the box a lot of the whitening gel had seeped out of the tube.  It was a little messy and a waste of product.&lt;br /&gt;- Usually the main ingredient in these products is peroxide. I couldn&#x27;t find the list of ingredients that listed the percentage of peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Comes in convenient tubes&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;- The pretreatment seems to work.  I brush my teeth with Sensodyne because I have sensitive teeth.  This formula did not irritate my gums at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars because I think this product may help to maintain whiter teeth; however, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you are looking for an effective teeth whitener.</li>
            <li> This product has some good things about it, but overall I don&#x27;t think it works.  Here&#x27;s why - there is nothing to keep the bleach product on your teeth.  You brush it on then leave it for 30 minutes, but there is no tray and no strip, so I don&#x27;t think the product really stays on the teeth.  I used it twice, and did not notice a difference in whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it has some positive things about it.  First, I like that you can paint just the areas and the teeth you want with the little brush.  It works well in that sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it comes with a protecting gel - that did work to protect my gums and sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am not giving a very poor review, even though as sold I did not find it effective.  I think it could be used with a bleaching tray from another product and it would probably work.  I plan to try that at some point, but I have not yet.  Ultimately though, used as directed I did not see a result (whereas with crest whitestrips I usually see one right away).</li>
            <li> It took me about 40 turns on the pen to get the protective gel to finally come out and then it basically all come out at once in one giant clump.  Not sure if that&#x27;s supposed to happen but when you only have a small amount to last you 10 applications.  I didn&#x27;t have that problem with the whitening gel though.  It was fun seeing little bubbles after both applications, kind of like peroxide on a cut.  I tend to have very sensitive teeth but didn&#x27;t have a problem using Prime Time Teeth Whitening but after 5 days I didn&#x27;t notice any change in teeth color.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before when I purchased it from Walmart.  However, whatever Amazon is shipping out is old!!!!!!!! DON&#x27;T PURCHASE!!!!!!!!!  I cant even return it because I threw away the box.  The product is great if you can get it fresh and new.  This one came out in crusty globs, instead of smooth on the brush.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  The taste wasn&#x27;t bad. Being able to paint it on your teeth was convenient.  But, the results were practically non-existent.  I saw a very mild change in color after the first day, but then nothing since.  When the instructions say you need to turn the knob a lot of times to get the solution to move into the brush, they weren&#x27;t kidding. The solution in the blue tube, the pre-solution, was thick and clumpy and hard to smooth onto my teeth.  The white solution smoothed on much easier, but I think it just gets washed off quickly because of saliva and so it doesn&#x27;t seem very effective.  Strips are annoying, but at least they are pressed against the teeth for a specific amount of time.  Bottom line, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Well it does whiten your teeth, a bit.  However, this product is really a pain to use.  The gel slips and slides everywhere and doesn&#x27;t stay on your teeth. It also tastes horrible.  Overall, I would use something like Crest Whitestrips instead, you&#x27;ll get more value for your money and it will actually whiten your teeth a few shades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no spring chicken, so my teeth have been progressively yellowing with the years.  I&#x27;ve been afraid to use anything but the whitening toothpastes, and they do help, but don&#x27;t do the job like Prime Time.  I don&#x27;t use it quite as often or for quite as long, as I feel my teeth are somewhat fragile at this point, but the effect is noticeable, and I am smiling much more!</li>
            <li> Product, noticeably whitened my teeth.  Tooth sensitivity increased for a period while I was usng it.  Also product has no impact on tooth that is dead.  The other teeth&#x27;s contrast makes it more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> There is supposed to be gel in these pens that when you twist the bottom comes out so you can put it on your teeth. I must&#x27;ve twisted the thing for twenty minutes - no gel. I have used a product similar to this before with no trouble. I thought maybe it acted differently and the gel just wasn&#x27;t as visible as it is in the other product so I tried painting teeth anyway and did taste something, so used as instructed - with no results. I don&#x27;t know, the pens still seem to be empty to me. If they&#x27;re not what little is coming out (maybe it&#x27;s just that not enough came out of the pen) is not working at all.</li>
            <li> As teeth whitening products go, I&#x27;d say this is no better or worse than the other options, the main one being those clear plastic strips you put on your teeth. If you think you&#x27;re just going to paint your teeth white, guess again. You brush goo number one on, then liquidy goo number two. Try not to spit for a half hour, then rinse it out. Does that sound like fun? Nope. That said, it did brighten my teeth somewhat, but it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re going to be doing toothpaste commercials after one application.</li>
            <li> I thought this whitening product would work better than most because it has a protective gel that you apply before the whitening solution that can help with tooth sensitivity. I have sensitive teeth however and after the first application I found my teeth to be sensitive to the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of the brush for brushing on the solution, but using it is a little clumsy compared to a whitening tray formed from your teeth. For best results you need to use this product in the morning and evening but I found that a little time constraining and my teeth were a too bothered by the Prime Time smile Dual Action Whitening System for me to use it twice a day for a week.</li>
            <li> The good news is they don&#x27;t taste bad and they don&#x27;t sting your teeth. The bad thing is there&#x27;s no portion control and I wasn&#x27;t really sure I was using them right.&lt;br /&gt;Did they work? A little. It wasn&#x27;t a dramatic difference but maybe there was one. It&#x27;s hard to tell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather spend my money on a professional job.</li>
            <li> Nope, it doesn&#x27;t work. It tastes bad, I feel myself trying not to gag or swallow directly after using it. Blah blah blah, this doesn&#x27;t work. For anyone who has wasted money on whitening strips or trays, or any of these mediocre mid- priced products.... you get what you pay for. It is best to just save up and pay for actual teeth whitening from a dentist. The prices are going down every year.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of Diet Coke and Coffee so I have often tried to whiten my teeth from the stains. This is by far one of the easiest products I have used and has about the same results as the others. Not as white as I would like for them to be but a definant improvement. The application process is so much better than using the trays.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, this product is nice because there is no trays, easy to apply and fairly non--messy.  You literally &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; and go.  With that said, I went through the product pretty fast and had minimal whitening.  I am a coffee drinker though, so just even some whitening made me happy.  The taste is not the best and I can see it getting old with long term use.  As for the price, it&#x27;s fair...but I think I should just try my dentist to get the results I want.</li>
            <li> This product was not effective for me. The whitening pen ran out after 4 applications. I do believe it was dried out. The gel was very thick and hard to spread on my teeth. I had to turn the dial around 4 times before anything came out. I noticed no whitening happening during the four applications.  This product was a complete failure for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different whitening products over the years including some expensive one and what I realized is that they all have pretty much the same ingredients.  What it comes down to is delivery method and price and this product wins on both counts.  It&#x27;s a simple to use two-step pen system: you paint on the booster then paint on the whitener.  Done.  And the most important thing is that it works - in just a few days my teeth were noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> I have to admit first off that I only used Prime Time Smile Dual Action Teeth Whitening for about five days, but had to stop because my gums were getting irritated, so I don&#x27;t know how helpful this review will be. Occasionally I will have slight problems with my gums, but usually due to stress or other issues, so I can&#x27;t be sure this caused it or not. However, my gum inflammation eased up a few days after I stopped using it, so it is likely. During that time, since it promises results within a few days, I examined my teeth pretty well and it did appear that my teeth whitened a teeny-tiny amount, so it might work for others who don&#x27;t have sensitive gums. Before I had even tried the whitening, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the packaging as the whitening gel had dried gunk on it, which led me to believe it had probably leaked at one time leaving me with less product as well. Even though the directions said that it&#x27;d take a few clicks to get both the pre-whitening treatment and teeth whitening gel to come up to the brush, it took way more then that and made me wonder if there was even that much product in the tubes. For the price, it makes me worry. While the brush is a nice aspect, I had a hard time seeing if the gels had covered my tooth since they&#x27;re practically clear. I assume they did, but I&#x27;d like to know I&#x27;m not using too much, or too little either. Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a chancy product to buy, I can see it drying up pretty fast, it possibly leaks, and it&#x27;s hard to figure out if there&#x27;s enough on your teeth. I won&#x27;t say don&#x27;t get it, but I will caution to get it on sale to first try it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really fair for me to review this product, because I have tetracycline staining on my teeth.  Most stains on my teeth are not going anywhere. However, like anybody else, my teeth get darker when I drink a lot of tea or berry smoothies, or anything like that.  This did help with those stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel tastes nice, not minty, maybe fruity but not very flavored at all.  I didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity, but then I use Sensodyne toothpaste anyway.  It took quite a lot twists of the bottom of the tubes to get any gel to come up to the brush, so beware of that.  I haven&#x27;t used it for many days in a row, so I don&#x27;t know how many days this stuff will actually last.  I like the idea of a brush on gel, instead of strips, just because it&#x27;s easier, but you do have to brush your teeth before you apply it, and that may make you lazy about it, it stopped me from doing it a few times.  Eh, if you&#x27;re motivated, you will do it regularly!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how effective this was for me. My teeth were pretty gnarly to begin with from years of drinking black teas. I hadn&#x27;t used a whitening product in years since it never seemed worth the expense and hassle from sensitivity issues. I would say before using this product my teeth were in the medium yellow category. After use, they improved to pale yellow/borderline white. Noticeable for me, and as much as I could expect from a product in this price range. I had a glass of icy water nearly immediately after rinsing out my mouth after waiting 30 minutes, and felt no sensitivity at all. The taste was subtle mint and chlorine - it kind of reminded me of pool water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some issues with the dispensing mechanism. The product in the whitening pen didn&#x27;t last past the 2nd day. I wasn&#x27;t particularly heavy-handed (imo) with the amount used so the amount included was really small or the turning-clicking base failed at some point and no more product got pushed up through the top so I had to throw the pen away. The results I had were after basically one day of using the product, and it was still okay for me, but I wonder if it could have done better if I had more whitening product - or if that really is all that is normally included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the way the product got pushed up. With both pens, often I would turn two-three times at the base and no product would come out. After turning the next time, all the product from the previous turns included would come gushing out all at once so it would be a nothing or landslide effect of product coming out which was hard to regulate when you&#x27;re trying to ration it out over several uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left my mouth closed while this product was on my teeth while saliva gathered since I didn&#x27;t want to swallow. At about the halfway point I spat out the saliva since it felt overflowing. I was worried the product would wash off my teeth from my salivating mouth, spitting, and having my lips over my teeth, but the product was still effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope a little more work goes into the quality of the dispensing pen so the product gets pushed out consistently and smoothly. If so, I would be happy to come back to this product time and again.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this product. When I first opened the package, I noticed that the white pen had already leaked a little. I started using the blue pen and then when I tried to apply the white one, it just leaked down the side of my pen. I could get a little on the tip, so I applied that to my teeth and cleaned off the pen where it had leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these for a consecutive week and I could tell that my teeth were getting whiter. However, the white pen continued to leak worse and worse and ended up getting completely stuck to my bathroom counter. If this product had worked as stated, I would have really enjoyed it. Maybe I can give it another try to see if the next pen I get leaks.</li>
            <li> Ive tried this for 2 and a half days and my teeth are really white! I&#x27;m so glad I bought this. But BEWARE buyers don&#x27;t buy this from Amazon buy it from WALMART.</li>
