            <li>I have all the Eminence Bright Skin lines (cleanser, moisturizer and mask).</li>
            <li>I like the eminence Bright Skin Moisturizer for the day.</li>
            <li>Do you have the Bright Skin advance skin serum?</li>
            <li>Loved the idea of this product being organic and still having a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used three &#x27;flavors&#x27; of Eminence SPF cream, and have loved them all.  </li>
            <li>but I feel like this is good for a hr than you gotta wash and reapply.</li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer/sunscreen at a great price.</li>
            <li>Does a good job as a daytime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen doing a good job.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to use organic products on my face.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent and leaves you skin feeling calm.</li>
            <li>This is the best because my make-up looks fresh all day without the oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of all Eminence products too!</li>
            <li>Love product!</li>
            <li>I have decided I love Eminence!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I really love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE that!  </li>
            <li>Better then the spa!</li>
            <li>The products go on smoothly and feel great throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I love the Eminence Bright Skin Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Nice that it has a sunscreen of 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Northeast Ohio</li>
            <li>The smell is nice.  </li>
            <li>The SPF is effective</li>
            <li>Great skin cream, light refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>Best skincare line available and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>The Eminence bright skin moisturizer arrived ahead of schedule and was packaged securely.</li>
            <li>Great Moisturizer - worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The vanilla sun- protection from Eminence seems to do a better job moisturizing on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Love the 30 SPF as well.</li>
            <li>The difference between the two is that this one is thicker and more moisturizing... which is better suited for my combination/oily (but not overly oily) skin.  </li>
            <li>one doesn&#x27;t have the fressness :) anymore.</li>
            <li>I love anything Eminence makes.</li>
            <li>I love all of my Eminence products.</li>
            <li>Love Eminence products :-)</li>
            <li>great product and I received it very quickly...will buy it again.</li>
            <li>After using Obagi for couple of years this product is all Organics and much better for your face.  </li>
            <li>Im really enjoying it and see results</li>
            <li>With so much chemical concerns these days I am happy that Eminence is on the market.</li>
            <li>I suggest that everyone use various Eminence products to get the best organic results.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Eminence product.  </li>
            <li>WELL, I&#x27;m glad I took the chance anyway.</li>
            <li>Wonderful daily moisturizer with SPF 30.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten facials from a nearby Spa that have used Eminence products, which I really enjoyed, so I decided to give this product a try since I have \\&quot;sun spots\\&quot; on my face.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nice and light, smells really nice (also light and fades) and doesn&#x27;t break me out at all.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it and bought it on Amazon that night.</li>
            <li>and I love how it has SPF.</li>
            <li>but otherwise I love the smell and texture.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I tried most of the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; ones...</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments about my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin felt more moisturized when I used a syrum before putting it on.</li>
            <li>It also spreads better on the skin and smells better.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li>Love Eminence and</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and love that it has sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this on my face and the SPF 30</li>
            <li>I love the Emience line, but this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t prevent my face from feeling ashy.</li>
            <li>The more I pushed these mini-maggots around, trying to make them go away, the more that I created.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks very flat/matte after it dries and to me, that is not an attractive look.</li>
            <li>O love so many of the Eminence products.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better and hope to always use it.</li>
            <li>Looking for more Eminence products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this as a sunscreen and moisturizer in one.</li>
            <li>And i have been using it almost more than 6 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the Eminence Persimmon and Cantaloupe moisturizer with SPF 32, and I liked it so much I was nervous to switch to this one, but I&#x27;m glad I did because I like this one even more!  </li>
            <li>I love this product, its light and perfect and it meets all of my facial needs.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I find it to be a good moisturizer for hot humid summer weather.  </li>
            <li>but it was drying and made my fine lines appear more visible.</li>
            <li>I certainly hope that it works at reducing the hyperpigmentation, I am looking forward to good results.</li>
            <li>It smells so lovely, is so creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;ll be more effective if they use higher dosages of the whitening ingredients?</li>
            <li>It minimizes my pores and fine lines, it is rich and moisturizing but does not leave my face greasy!  </li>
            <li>this has been great for day or night use leaving my face feeling soft and smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely investigate more Eminence products since I&#x27;m so happy with this one.  </li>
            <li>(The more I save, the more I can spend on facials and massages, right?)</li>
            <li>My skin has been brighter and provides a good balance for &#x27;normal&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li>Oh, and my skin is a nice, toasty brown, which makes finding the right sunscreen SO much more fun.  </li>
            <li>The product is smooth and satiny and it doesn&#x27;t conflict with my foundation when I choose to wear it.  </li>
            <li>I also like how my face powder goes on over the moisturizer (smooth and even).  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, gives some sun protection and really seems to be brightening my skin and sun spots.</li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Light, not greasy (</li>
            <li>product has a light, green-herb scent, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be overpowering or bothersome -- and I am super-sensitive to fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved every product I&#x27;ve tried from Eminence so far.  </li>
            <li>It blends quickly and easily, and I didn&#x27;t notice a hint of whiteness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t count on this to erase a lot of sun damage, more a of supporting character-not a lead role-in that department.&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT, since I am using both the stone crop and bright skin line, I can definitely say the combination is making a difference to my skin.  </li>
            <li>The Bright Skin Moisturizer is none of the above.</li>
            <li>The persimmon and cantaloupe one is probably better suited for those with oily skin looking for something really lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Has helped my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is my skin only, but every time that put my tinted moisturizer (both Stila and Laura Mercier) on top of Eminence Bright Skin Moisturizer I ended up with some kind of reaction between the products that caused little mealy ovals on my face.</li>
            <li>It feels very refreshing but its kind of hard to blend out a bit.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !!</li>
            <li>I have recently started using the Eminence line of products and I really like the Bright Skin Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have the most temperamental skin EVER - acne-prone, hyperpigmentation-prone and sensitive.</li>
            <li>I love Eminence, but it is natural sun screen</li>
            <li>no chemicals, with a lovely natural scent and SPF.  </li>
            <li>I keep using Eminence products because I love their natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>so it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Great protection for aging skin, especially her in sunny central Texas.</li>
            <li>Love this daily daytime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It was also a better price than my local spas...</li>
            <li>My skin looks more even-toned and healthier overall.  </li>
            <li>I get lots of compliments on my skin and how pretty and glowing it looks.</li>
            <li>stings a bit when you first put it on</li>
            <li>I love this brand and have used the facewash for the last year.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Most of all, I usually don&#x27;t like moisturizers with sunscreen, but I love this one as it does not smell funny, irritate my skin, or have any of the problems I normally associate with moisturizers containing sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time and like finding it at a better price than the spa.</li>
            <li>I got it because i&#x27;m pregnant and needed an all natural moisturizer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a nice feeling moisturizer that I mix with a real brightener each day now for dark spots.</li>
            <li>It took a couple more days and when I contacted Amazon, I was rudely informed that upon checkout, this fact was in the fine print.</li>
            <li>mature, dry, sun damaged skin...experienced when having facial at spa...much better price here!!</li>
            <li>I used to not be able to leave the house without at least light foundation to even my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Every product seems to provide real benefits.  </li>
            <li>I really, really like this SPF moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really comment on the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34</li>
            <li>is very practical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say too much because I just started using.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer works very well under my make up.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>and this really helped.</li>
            <li>Nice- heavy moisturizer with sod.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer by Eminence - it feels thick, rich, and creamy, yet when you put it on it feels so lightweight</li>
            <li>The scent is light and clean, the formula is moisturizing without being heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>And I love that it doesn&#x27;t give me that masky/chalky appearance that some other moisturizers can give that have SPF.</li>
            <li>I thought at first that this cream would be too heavy, since it was very rich, but, it absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>feels good and light unlike other blockers which feel thick and sticky.</li>
            <li>am a big fan of Eminence products, natural and fresh!</li>
            <li>Go natural!!</li>
            <li>I find that most natural suncreens are heavy, tacky, pasty and make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li>I do like their facial moisturizers very much.  </li>
            <li>and I looked like an old lady!</li>
            <li>For nearly $50, I&#x27;ll go back to Nordstrom and buy something with chemicals in it, thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the moisturizer for a week, but I could see improvement from the first day.  </li>
            <li>My esthetician used this on me during my first facial.</li>
            <li>but I ended having to buy other moisturizers to compensate for the lack of moisture in the product, I actually even felt like it was drying my skin more than anything.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d rather spend the money on products to clear my skin rather than to hide it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Does not react well on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Can’t seem to get natural sunscreen to be perfectly clear.</li>
            <li>burned when applied to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Does not leave my skin feeling greasy - just soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 45 year old woman with combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone, sun damaged skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have finally found a moisturizer w sunscreen that really works.</li>
            <li>but so far I haven&#x27;t seen a visible difference on my brown/aging spots.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend if you have sensitive skin at a lll..</li>
            <li>and I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When it dried, I liked that it wasn&#x27;t all greasy but quite matte for a great makeup base.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the brightening effect is true, but it could be!</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t very moisturizing - my skin is still dry after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 40 year old female who lives in Texas, with the major problem of hyper pigmentation and sun spots.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft, protects against the sun and has started fading a sunspot I have from earlier years.</li>
            <li>Its not oily, may burn a little when you  first put it on, but my skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li>It is thick enough to feel nice on your skin without feeling overly heavy.</li>
            <li>I have used this product several times and although I have not noticed a decrease in dark spots, it certainly leaves your skin feeling silky and refreshed.</li>
            <li>You only need to use a little bit because it is really creamy and coats well.</li>
            <li>I tend towards dry skin (and live in a dry climate)</li>

            <li> Nice that it has a sunscreen of 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Northeast Ohio</li>
            <li> The smell is nice.  </li>
            <li> The SPF is effective</li>
            <li> Great skin cream, light refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> Best skincare line available and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> The Eminence bright skin moisturizer arrived ahead of schedule and was packaged securely.</li>
            <li> Great Moisturizer - worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The vanilla sun- protection from Eminence seems to do a better job moisturizing on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Love the 30 SPF as well.</li>
            <li> The difference between the two is that this one is thicker and more moisturizing... which is better suited for my combination/oily (but not overly oily) skin.  </li>
            <li> one doesn&#x27;t have the fressness :) anymore.</li>
            <li> I love anything Eminence makes.</li>
            <li> I love all of my Eminence products.</li>
            <li> Love Eminence products :-)</li>
            <li> great product and I received it very quickly...will buy it again.</li>
            <li> After using Obagi for couple of years this product is all Organics and much better for your face.  </li>
            <li> Im really enjoying it and see results</li>
            <li> With so much chemical concerns these days I am happy that Eminence is on the market.</li>
            <li> I suggest that everyone use various Eminence products to get the best organic results.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Eminence product.  </li>
            <li> WELL, I&#x27;m glad I took the chance anyway.</li>
            <li> Wonderful daily moisturizer with SPF 30.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten facials from a nearby Spa that have used Eminence products, which I really enjoyed, so I decided to give this product a try since I have \\&quot;sun spots\\&quot; on my face.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nice and light, smells really nice (also light and fades) and doesn&#x27;t break me out at all.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it and bought it on Amazon that night.</li>
            <li> and I love how it has SPF.</li>
            <li> but otherwise I love the smell and texture.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I tried most of the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; ones...</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments about my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin felt more moisturized when I used a syrum before putting it on.</li>
            <li> It also spreads better on the skin and smells better.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Love Eminence and</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and love that it has sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this on my face and the SPF 30</li>
            <li> I love the Emience line, but this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t prevent my face from feeling ashy.</li>
            <li> The more I pushed these mini-maggots around, trying to make them go away, the more that I created.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks very flat/matte after it dries and to me, that is not an attractive look.</li>
            <li> O love so many of the Eminence products.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks better and hope to always use it.</li>
            <li> Looking for more Eminence products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this as a sunscreen and moisturizer in one.</li>
            <li> And i have been using it almost more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the Eminence Persimmon and Cantaloupe moisturizer with SPF 32, and I liked it so much I was nervous to switch to this one, but I&#x27;m glad I did because I like this one even more!  </li>
            <li> I love this product, its light and perfect and it meets all of my facial needs.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I find it to be a good moisturizer for hot humid summer weather.  </li>
            <li> but it was drying and made my fine lines appear more visible.</li>
            <li> I certainly hope that it works at reducing the hyperpigmentation, I am looking forward to good results.</li>
            <li> It smells so lovely, is so creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;ll be more effective if they use higher dosages of the whitening ingredients?</li>
            <li> It minimizes my pores and fine lines, it is rich and moisturizing but does not leave my face greasy!  </li>
            <li> this has been great for day or night use leaving my face feeling soft and smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely investigate more Eminence products since I&#x27;m so happy with this one.  </li>
            <li> (The more I save, the more I can spend on facials and massages, right?)</li>
            <li> My skin has been brighter and provides a good balance for &#x27;normal&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> Oh, and my skin is a nice, toasty brown, which makes finding the right sunscreen SO much more fun.  </li>
            <li> The product is smooth and satiny and it doesn&#x27;t conflict with my foundation when I choose to wear it.  </li>
            <li> I also like how my face powder goes on over the moisturizer (smooth and even).  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, gives some sun protection and really seems to be brightening my skin and sun spots.</li>
            <li> and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Light, not greasy (</li>
            <li> product has a light, green-herb scent, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be overpowering or bothersome -- and I am super-sensitive to fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved every product I&#x27;ve tried from Eminence so far.  </li>
            <li> It blends quickly and easily, and I didn&#x27;t notice a hint of whiteness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t count on this to erase a lot of sun damage, more a of supporting character-not a lead role-in that department.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT, since I am using both the stone crop and bright skin line, I can definitely say the combination is making a difference to my skin.  </li>
            <li> The Bright Skin Moisturizer is none of the above.</li>
            <li> The persimmon and cantaloupe one is probably better suited for those with oily skin looking for something really lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Has helped my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my skin only, but every time that put my tinted moisturizer (both Stila and Laura Mercier) on top of Eminence Bright Skin Moisturizer I ended up with some kind of reaction between the products that caused little mealy ovals on my face.</li>
            <li> It feels very refreshing but its kind of hard to blend out a bit.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !!</li>
            <li> I have recently started using the Eminence line of products and I really like the Bright Skin Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have the most temperamental skin EVER - acne-prone, hyperpigmentation-prone and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I love Eminence, but it is natural sun screen</li>
            <li> no chemicals, with a lovely natural scent and SPF.  </li>
            <li> I keep using Eminence products because I love their natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Great protection for aging skin, especially her in sunny central Texas.</li>
            <li> Love this daily daytime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It was also a better price than my local spas...</li>
            <li> My skin looks more even-toned and healthier overall.  </li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments on my skin and how pretty and glowing it looks.</li>
            <li> stings a bit when you first put it on</li>
            <li> I love this brand and have used the facewash for the last year.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Most of all, I usually don&#x27;t like moisturizers with sunscreen, but I love this one as it does not smell funny, irritate my skin, or have any of the problems I normally associate with moisturizers containing sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and like finding it at a better price than the spa.</li>
            <li> I got it because i&#x27;m pregnant and needed an all natural moisturizer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a nice feeling moisturizer that I mix with a real brightener each day now for dark spots.</li>
            <li> It took a couple more days and when I contacted Amazon, I was rudely informed that upon checkout, this fact was in the fine print.</li>
            <li> mature, dry, sun damaged skin...experienced when having facial at spa...much better price here!!</li>
            <li> I used to not be able to leave the house without at least light foundation to even my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Every product seems to provide real benefits.  </li>
            <li> I really, really like this SPF moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really comment on the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34</li>
            <li> is very practical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t say too much because I just started using.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works very well under my make up.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> and this really helped.</li>
            <li> Nice- heavy moisturizer with sod.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer by Eminence - it feels thick, rich, and creamy, yet when you put it on it feels so lightweight</li>
            <li> The scent is light and clean, the formula is moisturizing without being heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> And I love that it doesn&#x27;t give me that masky/chalky appearance that some other moisturizers can give that have SPF.</li>
            <li> I thought at first that this cream would be too heavy, since it was very rich, but, it absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> feels good and light unlike other blockers which feel thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> am a big fan of Eminence products, natural and fresh!</li>
            <li> Go natural!!</li>
            <li> I find that most natural suncreens are heavy, tacky, pasty and make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li> I do like their facial moisturizers very much.  </li>
            <li> and I looked like an old lady!</li>
            <li> For nearly $50, I&#x27;ll go back to Nordstrom and buy something with chemicals in it, thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the moisturizer for a week, but I could see improvement from the first day.  </li>
            <li> My esthetician used this on me during my first facial.</li>
            <li> but I ended having to buy other moisturizers to compensate for the lack of moisture in the product, I actually even felt like it was drying my skin more than anything.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d rather spend the money on products to clear my skin rather than to hide it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Does not react well on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Can’t seem to get natural sunscreen to be perfectly clear.</li>
            <li> burned when applied to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Does not leave my skin feeling greasy - just soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 45 year old woman with combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone, sun damaged skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have finally found a moisturizer w sunscreen that really works.</li>
            <li> but so far I haven&#x27;t seen a visible difference on my brown/aging spots.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend if you have sensitive skin at a lll..</li>
            <li> and I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When it dried, I liked that it wasn&#x27;t all greasy but quite matte for a great makeup base.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the brightening effect is true, but it could be!</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t very moisturizing - my skin is still dry after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old female who lives in Texas, with the major problem of hyper pigmentation and sun spots.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft, protects against the sun and has started fading a sunspot I have from earlier years.</li>
            <li> Its not oily, may burn a little when you  first put it on, but my skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li> It is thick enough to feel nice on your skin without feeling overly heavy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times and although I have not noticed a decrease in dark spots, it certainly leaves your skin feeling silky and refreshed.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit because it is really creamy and coats well.</li>
            <li> I tend towards dry skin (and live in a dry climate)</li>
            <li> I also like the other Eminence products that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products and have never had such dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sort of disappointed at the Bright Skin line.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything, ranging from cheap to expensive, including Sisley skin care products.</li>
            <li> 2 oz goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When it first went on, it actually stung in a couple areas that I was broken out.</li>
            <li> As long as I can eat it, I&#x27;ll wear it!</li>
            <li> The inner seal was lifted on one third of the edge, so the product spilled into the small inner box.  </li>
            <li> My face gets really dry from acne topicals I use</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably not enough for someone with very dry skin and the price is a little steep but one jar lasts around 4 months.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Because I spent $40.00 for this product I am determined to use it up</li>
            <li> Using only a small amount, in a month&#x27;s time, age spots have faded, are smaller, clearly less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and my skin soaks it up.  </li>
            <li> Smells a little strange</li>
            <li> With all the products a little goes a long way and</li>
            <li> and I am extremely please with how my face is looking.</li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;m using other products from this line.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Not sure I will purchase Eminence products from Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> and saw no difference whatsoever in the dark spots I have on my face.</li>
            <li> my &amp;#34;sunspots&amp;#34; are moderately dark..</li>
            <li> Nor does it brighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> Other than the price and the tiny amount of product the serums provide, I haven&#x27;t a single real complaint.  </li>
            <li> Am still looking into less pricey brands, though.  </li>
            <li> so expect to have a slightly whiter face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some slight improvement in sun spots and acne scars</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but I only use a little at a time and it will last a while</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t leave my face oily OR dry and was having a hard time finding something that wasn&#x27;t loaded with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I have my husband using it on the back of his hands; he, too, said it works and we are tough critics.  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t as heavy as I thought it would be for an SPF.</li>
            <li> Some of the natural products I&#x27;ve used leave a bit of a tacky texture which makes putting on powder difficult.  </li>
            <li> My uneven skin tone was visibly lighter and brighter after a month of using this product.  </li>
            <li> however I felt the feel of the cream was heavy.</li>
            <li> Like it is dried.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, and it does not make my skin oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> I use the rhubarb scrub every few days</li>
            <li> and I get enzyme ram and pumpkin peels every few months.  </li>
            <li> I waited so long for this product and it finally came but to my disappointment it was opened, cream leackimg from its package .....</li>
            <li> This does irritate my skin a little, causing small whiteheads to form.</li>
            <li> Natural, physical sunscreens tend to feel heavy and greasy, and the chalky-white cast is annoying.</li>
            <li> It also left me with a bit of a white haze, making me appear somewhat sick and pale.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I think the ingredients are really pure.</li>
            <li> This one can give a small tingling sensation, but not a turn-off.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievably moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep this shipment because I was so anxious to try the moisturizer, but if another arrives opened and spilled I will return it.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> the moisturizer tub usually lasts me 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> not very good for my skin, it makes skin dry, sorry.</li>
            <li> At least on my skin it does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to thick</li>
            <li> Seriously, I looked in the mirror about 10 minutes after applying</li>
            <li> Wanted my sensitive skin to tolerate this, but it was extremely irritating and broke me out all over my face:(</li>
            <li> I was not happy about this broken seal for both health reasons and loosing some product</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t just matte</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also wicked expensive, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of Eminence products and unfortunately am not impressed by any yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and have seen a very dramatic improvement in my skin tone, consistency and reduction of my sun spots.  </li>
            <li> Lame!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s very expensive).  </li>
            <li> Disappointed ;(- I don&#x27;t have time to deal with returns</li>
            <li> I hate makeup</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> for the moisturizer itself, I thought it was terrible.</li>
            <li> Dr. Jart ---they all broke me out in horrible acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this daily daytime moisturizer.  A little goes a long way and my skin soaks it up.  Love the 30 SPF as well.</li>
            <li> Use every day! Makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> awesome product...mature, dry, sun damaged skin...experienced when having facial at spa...much better price here!!</li>
            <li> This is an Organic skin care line of excellent products...will order more and I am recommending them to friends and family!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved every product I&#x27;ve tried from Eminence so far.  This is my favorite moisturizer by Eminence - it feels thick, rich, and creamy, yet when you put it on it feels so lightweight and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  It has definitely brightened my skin, and it&#x27;s such a plus that there&#x27;s SPF in it too.  I&#x27;ve also tried the Eminence Persimmon and Cantaloupe moisturizer with SPF 32, and I liked it so much I was nervous to switch to this one, but I&#x27;m glad I did because I like this one even more!  The difference between the two is that this one is thicker and more moisturizing... which is better suited for my combination/oily (but not overly oily) skin.  The persimmon and cantaloupe one is probably better suited for those with oily skin looking for something really lightweight.  I love the smell of all Eminence products too!</li>

            <li> Love Eminence products :-)</li>
            <li> Nice- heavy moisturizer with sod. Smells a little strange though- husband does not like. Makes me sneeze some too</li>
            <li> This is wonderful addition to my Eminence regiment!! A little goes along way. Just love it!!</li>
            <li> great product and I received it very quickly...will buy it again.</li>
            <li> After using Obagi for couple of years this product is all Organics and much better for your face.  Im really enjoying it and see results</li>
            <li> Loved the idea of this product being organic and still having a sunscreen. It was also a better price than my local spas...BUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s listed as Prime for shipping and this is NOT the case. It took a couple more days and when I contacted Amazon, I was rudely informed that upon checkout, this fact was in the fine print. Lame! Why are you advertising 2-day shipping?!?! :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the moisturizer itself, I thought it was terrible. When it first went on, it actually stung in a couple areas that I was broken out. OUCH! When it dried, I liked that it wasn&#x27;t all greasy but quite matte for a great makeup base. Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t just matte but it was drying and made my fine lines appear more visible. Seriously, I looked in the mirror about 10 minutes after applying and I looked like an old lady! I actually gasped. It also left me with a bit of a white haze, making me appear somewhat sick and pale. I just don&#x27;t get what all the hype is about. For nearly $50, I&#x27;ll go back to Nordstrom and buy something with chemicals in it, thanks!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Isn&#x27;t as heavy as I thought it would be for an SPF.</li>
            <li> I do like their facial moisturizers very much.  I&#x27;ve used three &#x27;flavors&#x27; of Eminence SPF cream, and have loved them all.  Am still looking into less pricey brands, though.  This one can give a small tingling sensation, but not a turn-off.  Not sure if the brightening effect is true, but it could be!</li>
            <li> seal on product was partially open</li>
            <li> the BEST anti aging cream out there!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to use organic products on my face. With so much chemical concerns these days I am happy that Eminence is on the market. I have been using these products for 6 weeks and I am extremely please with how my face is looking. I suggest that everyone use various Eminence products to get the best organic results. Go natural!!</li>
            <li> Great skin cream, light refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !! Love product!</li>
            <li> Had a facial at a spa and had to buy this because it was used on my face. Unbelievably moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Eminence product.  Using only a small amount, in a month&#x27;s time, age spots have faded, are smaller, clearly less noticeable.  I have my husband using it on the back of his hands; he, too, said it works and we are tough critics.  Never found this to be greasy as one reviewer said.  Nice that it has a sunscreen of 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Northeast Ohio</li>
            <li> I have the most temperamental skin EVER - acne-prone, hyperpigmentation-prone and sensitive. Oh, and my skin is a nice, toasty brown, which makes finding the right sunscreen SO much more fun.  I read reviews that mentioned the ghosting issues that lots of sunscreens cause and was concerned.  WELL, I&#x27;m glad I took the chance anyway. I have no breakouts. My face is never white after application.  The product is smooth and satiny and it doesn&#x27;t conflict with my foundation when I choose to wear it.  When I don&#x27;t, I only need this and no additional product for SPF. When I need to reapply SPF, I&#x27;m also treating my pigmentation issues at the same time - BONUS. AND it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin, even after exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it deserve it&#x27;s &#x27;bright skin&#x27; moniker? I can&#x27;t say.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.  Plus, I&#x27;m using other products from this line.  BUT, since I am using both the stone crop and bright skin line, I can definitely say the combination is making a difference to my skin.  The hyperpigmentation isn&#x27;t gone (way too soon for that), but it&#x27;s faded enough that I don&#x27;t feel I need to always wear foundation.  I hate makeup and I&#x27;d rather spend the money on products to clear my skin rather than to hide it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one Eminence product, and suddenly I have 5.  Other than the price and the tiny amount of product the serums provide, I haven&#x27;t a single real complaint.  Every product seems to provide real benefits.  Go FIGURE.</li>
            <li> The Eminence bright skin moisturizer arrived ahead of schedule and was packaged securely. I have used this product several times and although I have not noticed a decrease in dark spots, it certainly leaves your skin feeling silky and refreshed. It is not oily and only a dab is needed to cover the entire face. It has a wonderful scent and leaves you skin feeling calm. I certainly hope that it works at reducing the hyperpigmentation, I am looking forward to good results.</li>
            <li> Wonderful daily moisturizer with SPF 30. Moisturizer and sunscreen in one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten facials from a nearby Spa that have used Eminence products, which I really enjoyed, so I decided to give this product a try since I have \\&quot;sun spots\\&quot; on my face.  I&#x27;ve only been using the moisturizer for a week, but I could see improvement from the first day.  My skin looks more even-toned and healthier overall.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a difference on the spots yet, but I&#x27;m hoping with time I will.  The scent is light and clean, the formula is moisturizing without being heavy or greasy.  I tend towards dry skin (and live in a dry climate) this has been great for day or night use leaving my face feeling soft and smooth and silky.  I also like how my face powder goes on over the moisturizer (smooth and even).  Some of the natural products I&#x27;ve used leave a bit of a tacky texture which makes putting on powder difficult.  I&#x27;ll come back and give it 5 stars if it fades my spots!  Will definitely investigate more Eminence products since I&#x27;m so happy with this one.  One problem in packaging/shipping.  The inner seal was lifted on one third of the edge, so the product spilled into the small inner box.  I was not happy about this broken seal for both health reasons and loosing some product (it&#x27;s very expensive).  I decided to keep this shipment because I was so anxious to try the moisturizer, but if another arrives opened and spilled I will return it.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice.  I love Eminence, but it is natural sun screen so expect to have a slightly whiter face.  Can’t seem to get natural sunscreen to be perfectly clear.</li>
            <li> burned when applied to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really, really like this SPF moisturizer. I find that most natural suncreens are heavy, tacky, pasty and make my skin breakout. Not this one. It goes on nice and light, smells really nice (also light and fades) and doesn&#x27;t break me out at all. I took away one star for the packaging. I think dipping my fingers in isn&#x27;t the cleanest way to dispense a product. It&#x27;s also wicked expensive, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have recently started using the Eminence line of products and I really like the Bright Skin Moisturizer.  Lives up to its name.  My uneven skin tone was visibly lighter and brighter after a month of using this product.  Does not leave my skin feeling greasy - just soft and supple.</li>
            <li> This works great with my skin. It smells nice, gives some sun protection and really seems to be brightening my skin and sun spots. I get lots of compliments on my skin and how pretty and glowing it looks. I&#x27;ll be 50 next month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 45 year old woman with combination skin. I had been looking for a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t leave my face oily OR dry and was having a hard time finding something that wasn&#x27;t loaded with harmful chemicals. My esthetician used this on me during my first facial. I fell in love with it and bought it on Amazon that night. It smells so lovely, is so creamy and smooth. I apply it with moist fingertips to help spread it and use on my face, neck and chest. A little goes a long way! It has definitely brightened my skin and I love how it has SPF. Great protection for aging skin, especially her in sunny central Texas.</li>
            <li> The SPF is effective however I felt the feel of the cream was heavy. I prefer the Vanilla Day Cream</li>
            <li> Great Moisturizer - worth the money.  Heard about it on the Today Show, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. I have decided I love Eminence! I use 4 of their products now and they are all terrific.</li>
            <li> I waited so long for this product and it finally came but to my disappointment it was opened, cream leackimg from its package ..... Disappointed ;(- I don&#x27;t have time to deal with returns</li>
            <li> It feels very refreshing but its kind of hard to blend out a bit. After a couple hours it gets spotty And you can rub it off. Like it is dried. Idk If that suppose to happen but I feel like this is good for a hr than you gotta wash and reapply.</li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing but otherwise I love the smell and texture. I got it because i&#x27;m pregnant and needed an all natural moisturizer but it isn&#x27;t very moisturizing - my skin is still dry after. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again unfortunately. :/</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t find it to thick and it goes on smoothly.  I like the smell as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it everyday, and it does not make my skin oily. Exactly what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li> I love this product, its light and perfect and it meets all of my facial needs.  I am happy I purchased it!</li>
            <li> feels good and light unlike other blockers which feel thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.  Good price too.</li>
            <li> I used this cream for over 8 mos. and saw no difference whatsoever in the dark spots I have on my face. Not only that, but I ended having to buy other moisturizers to compensate for the lack of moisture in the product, I actually even felt like it was drying my skin more than anything. I have tried a bunch of Eminence products and unfortunately am not impressed by any yet.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer/sunscreen at a great price.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  Skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone, sun damaged skin and this is just what it needs. I was at the end of my rope looking for a moisturizer with sunscreen that would not irritate. I tried most of the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; ones...Nia 24, Skinceuticals, La Roche-Posay, Dr. Jart ---they all broke me out in horrible acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stings a bit when you first put it on (I assume this is the brightening ingredients) but no irritation at all and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months with no increase in acne. I&#x27;ve noticed some slight improvement in sun spots and acne scars but I wouldn&#x27;t count on this to erase a lot of sun damage, more a of supporting character-not a lead role-in that department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy moisturizer it&#x27;s probably not enough for someone with very dry skin and the price is a little steep but one jar lasts around 4 months.</li>
            <li> Love this product and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> This does irritate my skin a little, causing small whiteheads to form.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a moisturizer w sunscreen that really works. I get so many compliments about my skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this cream because it says it&#x27;s a moisturizer and has spf. For my skin type (mix) it didn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I wanted. My skin felt more moisturized when I used a syrum before putting it on. The vanilla sun- protection from Eminence seems to do a better job moisturizing on it&#x27;s own. It also spreads better on the skin and smells better. At least on my skin it does.</li>
            <li> Eminence makes the best skin products on the market</li>
            <li> Does a good job as a daytime moisturizer.  Can&#x27;t really comment on the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; aspect..probably too soon and my &amp;#34;sunspots&amp;#34; are moderately dark..so will just wait and see.  Otherwise, I find it to be a good moisturizer for hot humid summer weather.  Light, not greasy (but then I haven&#x27;t a greasy Eminence moisturizer yet!), no chemicals, with a lovely natural scent and SPF.  What&#x27;s not to like!</li>
            <li> Natural, physical sunscreens tend to feel heavy and greasy, and the chalky-white cast is annoying. The Bright Skin Moisturizer is none of the above. The product provides a wonderful level of moisture and sun protection. It blends quickly and easily, and I didn&#x27;t notice a hint of whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;The product has a light, green-herb scent, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be overpowering or bothersome -- and I am super-sensitive to fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus: the spatula which is included, so you don&#x27;t have to dig into the product with your fingers.</li>
            <li> It appeared to have been a returned product already used.  Very disappointed. Not sure I will purchase Eminence products from Amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used. Has helped my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer! You only need to use a little bit because it is really creamy and coats well. It is thick enough to feel nice on your skin without feeling overly heavy. And I love that it doesn&#x27;t give me that masky/chalky appearance that some other moisturizers can give that have SPF. I haven&#x27;t yet noticed an overall brightening to my skin yet, but I just started using the product recently. Overall, I am very happy and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Love Eminence and this is no exception. Sunscreen doing a good job.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and love that it has sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li> I have all the Eminence Bright Skin lines (cleanser, moisturizer and mask). I&#x27;ve been using them for about a year but so far I haven&#x27;t seen a visible difference on my brown/aging spots. I keep using Eminence products because I love their natural ingredients. But I&#x27;m sort of disappointed at the Bright Skin line. Maybe it&#x27;ll be more effective if they use higher dosages of the whitening ingredients?</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t leave the house without using this moisturizer. I love the feel of this on my face and the SPF 30 is very practical. 2 oz goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Been using for years !  Great stuff !</li>
            <li> I love the Emience line, but this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t prevent my face from feeling ashy. Nor does it brighten dark spots. It&#x27;s just a nice feeling moisturizer that I mix with a real brightener each day now for dark spots. I would prefer a nicer smell too.</li>
            <li> I just started using this moisturizer because I wanted some sun protection. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and I like this cream a lot. It appears to hydrate my skin while evening my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my skin only, but every time that put my tinted moisturizer (both Stila and Laura Mercier) on top of Eminence Bright Skin Moisturizer I ended up with some kind of reaction between the products that caused little mealy ovals on my face. The more I pushed these mini-maggots around, trying to make them go away, the more that I created.  Because I spent $40.00 for this product I am determined to use it up so I use it at night, before bed.  Is this product supposed to stand alone?  My skin looks very flat/matte after it dries and to me, that is not an attractive look.</li>
            <li> I like the eminence Bright Skin Moisturizer for the day. Do you have the Bright Skin advance skin serum? That&#x27;s great for the night cream.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and have used the facewash for the last year. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is healthier and so I wanted to try the lotion. It is expensive, but I only use a little at a time and it will last a while so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this product and will continue to use it in the future. My skin does seem to be brighter just like the name claims.&lt;br /&gt;It has an SPF too, which makes it perfect for daytime wear under my make up.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer smells great.  O love so many of the Eminence products.  I thought at first that this cream would be too heavy, since it was very rich, but, it absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  Very nice product! Waiting to see the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; part of the moisturizer, but I really like this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best because my make-up looks fresh all day without the oily feeling.  My skin looks better and hope to always use it. Looking for more Eminence products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say too much because I just started using. Must give it time to work. Its not oily, may burn a little when you  first put it on, but my skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old female who lives in Texas, with the major problem of hyper pigmentation and sun spots.  I have Scandinavian roots and tend towards redness.  I initially started using this product suggested to me after a facial in a salon.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year and have seen a very dramatic improvement in my skin tone, consistency and reduction of my sun spots.  I used to not be able to leave the house without at least light foundation to even my skin tone. I have no issue with going out in public without a bit of make up and I LOVE that!  I&#x27;ve tried many other products and have never had such dramatic results.  I use the coconut milk skin cleanser, stone crop toner and then moisturizer.  I use the rhubarb scrub every few days and I get enzyme ram and pumpkin peels every few months.  Very happy with Eminence products.  They are not the cheapest but they are definitely not the most expensive I&#x27;ve used either.  With all the products a little goes a long way and the moisturizer tub usually lasts me 2-3 months.  The products go on smoothly and feel great throughout the day.  This moisturizer works very well under my make up.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great suncreen!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and like finding it at a better price than the spa. (The more I save, the more I can spend on facials and massages, right?)</li>
            <li> Love this as a sunscreen and moisturizer in one.</li>
            <li> I love the Eminence Bright Skin Moisturizer. I also like the other Eminence products that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Wanted my sensitive skin to tolerate this, but it was extremely irritating and broke me out all over my face:(</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients  and what can do for the skin, but...I do not recommend if you have sensitive skin at a lll.. it may cause stinging and irritation</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this moisturizer.  Keeps my skin soft, protects against the sun and has started fading a sunspot I have from earlier years. Bought this twice and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Better then the spa!</li>
            <li> For some reason this makes my skin sting and I do not have sensitive skin. It&#x27;s too bad because I think the ingredients are really pure.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. My face gets really dry from acne topicals I use and this really helped. I like it for day use because of the SPF but for night use I use a different one from the same line. It does not leave my face oily or cause me to break out at all. Great stuff for the price.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, wrinkles, and sun damage/uneven skin tone.  I have tried everything, ranging from cheap to expensive, including Sisley skin care products. This moisturizer addresses all of my concerns. It is greatly helping with the skin tone issues (along with the bright skin mask periodically).  It minimizes my pores and fine lines, it is rich and moisturizing but does not leave my face greasy!  Most of all, I usually don&#x27;t like moisturizers with sunscreen, but I love this one as it does not smell funny, irritate my skin, or have any of the problems I normally associate with moisturizers containing sunscreen. Does not break my acne-prone skin out either.</li>
            <li> Does just what it says. My skin has been brighter and provides a good balance for &#x27;normal&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product. I cannot use it because upon application, my skin tingles and feels like it is burning.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t see no improvements plus it always burns my face when i apply it. And i have been using it almost more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> not very good for my skin, it makes skin dry, sorry.</li>
            <li> lasts me almost a year! Best skincare line available and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Product just want I have come to expect.  Great product.  Eminence has a lot of great products for your skin.</li>
