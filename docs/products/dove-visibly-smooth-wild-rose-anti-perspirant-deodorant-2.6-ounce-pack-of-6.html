    <ol>
            <li>Excellent!!!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and works as an antipersperant should!</li>
            <li>Very happy with both products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh, did I mention it also works great as a deodorant?!?</li>
            <li>It was wonderful at eliminating the need for shaving.</li>
            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>Maybe some advertising would help sales and then great items wouldn&#x27;t be discontinued</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, you can tell  think it is great.  </li>
            <li>So happy I found it.</li>
            <li>I am once again happily hairless.</li>
            <li>I just love the way it made the \\&quot;stubble feel\\&quot; go away!!</li>
            <li>but I just LOVE it!!  </li>
            <li>really nice!</li>
            <li>The good points about this deodorant?</li>
            <li>Did not do a really good job as an anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>Lasts for a good 24 hours also.</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant !</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think this deodorant does an amazing job making the hair under my armpits any lighter, either.</li>
            <li>There may be a hint of rose</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and silky and smells nice.</li>
            <li>This is a outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>Well, part of the product&#x27;s name, \\&quot;Visibly Smooth\\&quot;, is unfortunately appropriate.</li>
            <li>But then I realized that I was also sweating more on the weekends when I was at home.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>So upset Dove discontinued this deodorant, it was my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve not been able to go without, I fell in love and I haven&#x27;t found anything that comes close.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon</li>
            <li>My underarm is smoother, and i love this scent.</li>
            <li>One good thing I can say about this item is that it smells good when you take off the cap...and after that I have no more good things to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As far as wetness protection goes it isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>This product is great if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I found this Dove \\&quot;antiperspirant\\&quot; and liked the idea of the \\&quot;wild rose\\&quot; scent, as rose is one of my favorite florals.  </li>
            <li>The smell is too strong and overbearing.</li>
            <li>It is true that you need to apply it more than once a day</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have found that hasn&#x27;t agitated my underarms and not to mention the smell is very lovely!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this for the &#x27;visibly smooth&#x27; effect or antiperspirant because I don&#x27;t have issues in that department.</li>
            <li>As for as the visibly smooth part, i found it that it made my underarm hair grow faster.</li>
            <li>It does keep my armpits feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>The rose is a nice, subtle rose - not a granny smell at all.  </li>
            <li>It smells good for a short time, then you&#x27;ll smell of BO.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product was the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, light and fun.</li>
            <li>I found Dove Wild Rose Anti-perspirant</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like wild rose at all to me, but it still smells very pretty and feminine.     </li>
            <li>I have tried this in the nature fresh scent and the wild rose scent and like them both, although I do prefer the wild rose over the nature fresh...</li>
            <li>and I should be good with deodorant now for a very long time, since I got 6 of them.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this on accident and when I went to use it for the first time I was like \\&quot;oh, yeah</li>
            <li>It really makes it easier to shave and smooth at the touch.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having the product available and for the &amp;#34;Visibly Smooth&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It works well, and I rarely need to re-apply.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that leaves fresh rose scent on my skin.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been able to detect any rose scent, but I&#x27;m assuming it must be my body chemistry since others seem to have been able to enjoy the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My issue is with the Anti-Persirant/Deodorant aspect of it (which is the point of it in the first place, right?)</li>
            <li>Made the purchase, it arrived super fast, was packaged neatly</li>
            <li>/&gt;The huge issue, for me, is that whatever combination of ingredients they&#x27;re using in this product seem to completely cancel out any effectiveness as an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it is suposed to.</li>
            <li>I would readily recommend this product!</li>
            <li>i bought this at a store when the commercials first came out.</li>
            <li>but that is simply a matter of preference which varies from person to person. :)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use when working out or when hot out.  </li>
            <li>I expected a rose scent.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says on the label.  </li>
            <li>I got very excited to use this deodorant since I have coarse hair</li>
            <li>I just originally purchased in a local store and only chose it because I like Dove deodorant and noticed this has a rose scent.  </li>
            <li>it was the only place I could get dove wild rose deodorant.</li>
            <li>when it says over time, it must be a LONG time, i&#x27;ve been using it for months, and NO change what-so-ever, but i do love the long lasting fragrance, i may keep using it, but if u buy it, dont buy it for the claims, it works great as a normal deodorant, and stays on pretty much all day</li>
            <li>The last time I ran out I decided to try something new; maybe something with a more floral scent.  </li>
            <li>Right around the time I started using this product I also got transferred to a new work area.  </li>
            <li>cause it really work.</li>
            <li>For me and my lifestyle and the job I have, I really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li>But after using it for a month I do notice that my underarm hair is much much softer when it starts to grow out.</li>
            <li>It really does reduce underarm hair.  </li>
            <li>Remember they are much stronger than underarm hair.  </li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t give you much protection unless you sit around or work at the office and don&#x27;t use the stairs.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give u much b.o. protection or anything else</li>
            <li>It smells really fragrant</li>
            <li>(however, I don&#x27;t have much underarm hair anyway.)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I recd the product fast and it was packaged and not damaged.  </li>
            <li>(tho it doesn&#x27;t seem to help the chin area quite as much).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell at this point, and it isn&#x27;t the reason I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, Dove Visibly Smooth was the ONLY over-the-counter product I&#x27;ve tried that does NOT irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>or you will perspire, but if you&#x27;re looking for an economical option for sensitive skin, then this is the deodorant for you.</li>
            <li>After using it for about 3 months I started noticing I only had to shave underarms very rarely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those overly sealed up new buildings and tends to be a bit stuffy, so at first I attributed the visible wetness under my arms to that.  </li>
            <li>just more active than sitting at a desk all day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this particular Dove product anywhere</li>
            <li>But, if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin that reacts to certain deodorants, give this a try.</li>
            <li>The only dove deodorant I like so far is the cucumber and green tea which has a light and mild smell.</li>
            <li>When removing the lid you have to be very careful or you will do what I did, and pull off the entire top of your deodorant with it  </li>
            <li>, little did I know all these years how much sweat I&#x27;m capable of producing, because the Secret must have contained it LOL.</li>
            <li>It is no longer available at stores, so I had to hunt it down on the web and buy a 6-pack.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant might not be good for the athlete or those who sweat excessively, but it&#x27;s good to wear on a normal day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat any more than the average person, nor do I exercise in white shirts, but the shirts gets messed up</li>
            <li>I really love Dove products but this just was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li>So far, good&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as other types, so my armpit skin appears more rough and bumpy.</li>
            <li>it has also stained all of my clothing in the arm pit area and my underarms are no less hairy thent</li>
            <li>u finally do, it onli takes a few strokes and that pesky underarm hair is gone so easily.</li>
            <li>It is a solid with a whitish color...but is completely invisible when you put it on.</li>
            <li>Only comes in one scent: \\&quot;Wild</li>
            <li>As soon as I switched back to another anti-perspirant deodorant my underarm hair went back to its normal growing cycle so</li>
            <li>And not only that it really worked at keeping you dry!  </li>
            <li>By slightly active, I do not mean exercising...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they stopped making this. I does reduce the need for constant shaving. Maybe some advertising would help sales and then great items wouldn&#x27;t be discontinued</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! 5-5  i was lookimg for this product for months cause it really work. My underarms skin is lighter and the hair is less visible.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is suposed to. I noticed after a couple weeks of use that my underarm hair was growing in less coarse, and at a slower rate.     It doesn&#x27;t smell like wild rose at all to me, but it still smells very pretty and feminine.     It does go on invisible unless you put on a ton, but that is the same as any other invisible solid.     As far as wetness protection goes it isn&#x27;t great. It does work, but if you lead a very active lifestyle or have a job where you are up and on your feet all day, you will either need to re-apply during the day, or you might start to have odor problems by the end of the day.     For me and my lifestyle and the job I have, I really like this deodorant. It works well, and I rarely need to re-apply. I would readily recommend this product!</li>
            <li> i bought this at a store when the commercials first came out. it states that it \\&quot;minimizes the visual appearance of hair over time\\&quot;. when it says over time, it must be a LONG time, i&#x27;ve been using it for months, and NO change what-so-ever, but i do love the long lasting fragrance, i may keep using it, but if u buy it, dont buy it for the claims, it works great as a normal deodorant, and stays on pretty much all day</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this on accident and when I went to use it for the first time I was like \\&quot;oh, yeah right\\&quot;. But after using it for a month I do notice that my underarm hair is much much softer when it starts to grow out. I can usually feel the stubble almost immediately upon growing back (I typically use Nair instead of shaving)...but after using this for a month I couldn&#x27;t feel it growing back at all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as for it&#x27;s anti-perspirant abilities....it&#x27;s only so-so. If you are an inactive person it is probably just right for you, but if you are a slightly active person, it only lasts about half of the day. By slightly active, I do not mean exercising...just more active than sitting at a desk all day. So off goes a star for that. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smell...really nice! I have tried this in the nature fresh scent and the wild rose scent and like them both, although I do prefer the wild rose over the nature fresh...but that is simply a matter of preference which varies from person to person. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you wear that little black dress without everybody seeing your deodorant? Yes! It is a solid with a whitish color...but is completely invisible when you put it on. As with all invisible solids tho...don&#x27;t overdo it or you will have little white balls appear in your armpit later in the day as you rub it off your skin and form the balls. A little goes a long way and too much causes it to rub off and become ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I only rated it 4 stars, I will never go back to wearing regular deodorant/anti-perspirant...I just love the way it made the \\&quot;stubble feel\\&quot; go away!!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and silky and smells nice. It is not sticky and it doesn&#x27;t leave stains on your clothes. Also it takes a lot longer time for under arm hair to grow back and when it does it is not as coarse. It is too bad that Dove discontinued this product!</li>
            <li> This is a outstanding product.  It really does reduce underarm hair.  To the point where it doesn&#x27;t grow anymore.  I used it for a period of time a few years ago and I had a friend check and there is still no hair growing!  Well, except for four which must have escaped.  Now I am using it on my chin whiskers.  Yes I am a woman.  I have been working on them for quite a while.  Remember they are much stronger than underarm hair.  The whiskers are diminishing in number, the white taking longer.  I use it for a couple of months and then don&#x27;t to see how things are going.  So far, good&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you can tell  think it is great.  And not only that it really worked at keeping you dry!  Another thing, it came so fast it was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> this just smells weird when my body temperature incrases. it has also stained all of my clothing in the arm pit area and my underarms are no less hairy thent hey were before. it just doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Wish this was still on the market.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use when working out or when hot out.  It smells good for a short time, then you&#x27;ll smell of BO.  It really doesn&#x27;t give you much protection unless you sit around or work at the office and don&#x27;t use the stairs.  I bought it cuz I like the smell.  Doesn&#x27;t give u much b.o. protection or anything else it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The good points about this deodorant? It smells really fragrant (I&#x27;ve gotten compliments because of it) and it lasts a very long time. This deodorant might not be good for the athlete or those who sweat excessively, but it&#x27;s good to wear on a normal day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad? Well, part of the product&#x27;s name, \\&quot;Visibly Smooth\\&quot;, is unfortunately appropriate. I have to be careful when I put on a shirt after using this product because it rubs and becomes visible on my shirt. I basically stopped buying white tops because if I wear them after showering and using this deodorant, the shirt gets yellow stains in the armpit area, and these are really hard to wash out. I don&#x27;t sweat any more than the average person, nor do I exercise in white shirts, but the shirts gets messed up anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this deodorant does an amazing job making the hair under my armpits any lighter, either. It may have improved the hair a little bit, but since I still shave my armpits and shaving causes hair thickening, I couldn&#x27;t expect the deodorant to make my hair drastically less visible anyway. At any rate, the hair-thinning claim made by the Dove company wasn&#x27;t what convinced me to use this product, since I shave my armpits often anyway.</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed in this product, and here is an organized list why:  1) Only comes in one scent: \\&quot;Wild Rose\\&quot;  2) The way the lid is built makes it difficult to remove  3) When removing the lid you have to be very careful or you will do what I did, and pull off the entire top of your deodorant with it  4)I did not see any difference in the growth of my underarm stubble after using this product for two weeks.    All in all, not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I expected a rose scent. There may be a hint of rose but this was not a real rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that leaves fresh rose scent on my skin.</li>
            <li> One good thing I can say about this item is that it smells good when you take off the cap...and after that I have no more good things to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in hair growth (however, I don&#x27;t have much underarm hair anyway.) My issue is with the Anti-Persirant/Deodorant aspect of it (which is the point of it in the first place, right?) The anti-perspirant doesn&#x27;t work. I feel \\&quot;soggy\\&quot; as soon as I put it on. If I&#x27;m wearing a tshirt, I can feel that it&#x27;s not working through my tshirt! Also, the deodorant doesn&#x27;t work well either. It doesn&#x27;t even last 6 hours! If I take a shower at 11 I am gross by 5! I don&#x27;t smell like a dead skunk or anything but you can definately tell I had sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that claims to help the hair growth issue and also want to have pit stains and smell bad then this is for you. But if you want underarm anti-perspirant/deodorant to do what it&#x27;s made to do but with the added benefit of taming hair growth then keep looking!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this particular Dove product anywhere or they&#x27;ve (again) changed the formula but I just LOVE it!!  It smells wonderful and works as an antipersperant should!</li>
            <li> My favourite deodorant and the only one I trust. This is the only product that I have found that hasn&#x27;t agitated my underarms and not to mention the smell is very lovely! I didn&#x27;t buy this for the &#x27;visibly smooth&#x27; effect or antiperspirant because I don&#x27;t have issues in that department. It does what I need it to do.&lt;br /&gt;I had to result to buying this pack off of amazon because i don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s on the market anymore... Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was having problems locating this product at home in any of our local stores. I recd the product fast and it was packaged and not damaged.  Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with both products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I could actually feel the difference when shaving. It really makes it easier to shave and smooth at the touch. Loved it!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is no longer available at stores, so I had to hunt it down on the web and buy a 6-pack.  I find the other scents of Dove Anti-perspirant Deodorant make me gag.  This scent agrees with me.</li>
            <li> This stuff with the &#x27;diminish the growth of hair over time&#x27; in it has become impossible to find in stores.  I think every deodorant should have it.  I also use it on my mustache and chin where we woman have a little trouble with unwanted hair.  Definitely working on the mustache and underarms (tho it doesn&#x27;t seem to help the chin area quite as much).  I would still be sad had I not found it here (I hope they have not discontinued it :-() I am hoping that the strength will not diminish over time because it will take me awhile to use up six of them.  Oh, did I mention it also works great as a deodorant?!?</li>
            <li> Downside: It claims to \\&quot;minimize the visual appearance of hair over time\\&quot;; I have been using this for well over a month and I still have stubble the day after I shave per usual. Also, it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as other types, so my armpit skin appears more rough and bumpy. If anything, it&#x27;s made that area appear worse, not better. And it gets on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upside: It smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product was the fragrance. Did not do a really good job as an anti-perspirant. As for as the visibly smooth part, i found it that it made my underarm hair grow faster. I usually shave every few days but i noticed i had to shave everyday. I really love Dove products but this just was a huge disappointment. I actually toughed it out and went a 6 months using it, but enough was enough. As soon as I switched back to another anti-perspirant deodorant my underarm hair went back to its normal growing cycle so, I definitely know it was the Dove deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It was wonderful at eliminating the need for shaving. But it stopped being sold in food stores and drugstores. So I had no choice but to order online. So happy I found it. I am once again happily hairless.</li>
            <li> Been using this deodorant for about 6 months.  It does exactly what it says on the label.  I just originally purchased in a local store and only chose it because I like Dove deodorant and noticed this has a rose scent.  After using it for about 3 months I started noticing I only had to shave underarms very rarely.  Then I began to notice I could not find it in our local stores.  Went online and found it offered here on this website.  Made the purchase, it arrived super fast, was packaged neatly and I should be good with deodorant now for a very long time, since I got 6 of them.  Thanks for having the product available and for the &amp;#34;Visibly Smooth&amp;#34; transaction.</li>
            <li> I buy this in bulk!  It is so hard to find in the store.  I have been using this since it was introduced.  The rose is a nice, subtle rose - not a granny smell at all.  If anything, it reminds me of &amp;#34;Her Majesty&#x27;s Rose&amp;#34; -a fragrance sold by Victoria&#x27;s Secret in the 90&#x27;s.  It works well, though I am not a great sweater - and I don&#x27;t work out.  But it holds up on a muggy Southern night out dancing, which is something, indeed!  It does keep my armpits feeling smooth.  The stubble that grows out is noticeably softer - not the angry, poking wires that it was in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a top-ten pick for body care for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Secret for years - possibly decades.  The last time I ran out I decided to try something new; maybe something with a more floral scent.  I found this Dove \\&quot;antiperspirant\\&quot; and liked the idea of the \\&quot;wild rose\\&quot; scent, as rose is one of my favorite florals.  Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been able to detect any rose scent, but I&#x27;m assuming it must be my body chemistry since others seem to have been able to enjoy the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the hair minimizing: I&#x27;ve been using the product for several weeks and it might be working to reduce hair.  I can&#x27;t really tell at this point, and it isn&#x27;t the reason I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The huge issue, for me, is that whatever combination of ingredients they&#x27;re using in this product seem to completely cancel out any effectiveness as an antiperspirant.  Right around the time I started using this product I also got transferred to a new work area.  It&#x27;s one of those overly sealed up new buildings and tends to be a bit stuffy, so at first I attributed the visible wetness under my arms to that.  But then I realized that I was also sweating more on the weekends when I was at home.  And I&#x27;m not talking about annoying \\&quot;break through\\&quot; sweat here, I&#x27;m talking about genuinely WET armpits... I can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing antiperspirant because the wetness starts up immediately.  I even tried triple-layering before leaving for work (waiting a few minutes between each application) and that still didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, little did I know all these years how much sweat I&#x27;m capable of producing, because the Secret must have contained it LOL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dry all day and smell like roses!</li>
            <li> I got very excited to use this deodorant since I have coarse hair and I&#x27;m a hairy girl.  I put it on my legs after shaving them and my underarms.  It gave me a headached and a dizzy fainting feeling. The smell is too strong and overbearing. I will no longer use this.  The only dove deodorant I like so far is the cucumber and green tea which has a light and mild smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. Not overpowering, light and fun. So upset Dove discontinued this deodorant, it was my favorite.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant !</li>
            <li> I found Dove Wild Rose Anti-perspirant and I&#x27;ve not been able to go without, I fell in love and I haven&#x27;t found anything that comes close.</li>
            <li> Since I started to use this, people no longer cross the street when they see me coming! Call be Rosebud!</li>
            <li> I ran out and could not find this in the stores, so I bought another Dove AP/Deodorant.  Within a week I was shaving 3 -4 times a week instead of once a week.  I hope they never discontiue this product.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon it was the only place I could get dove wild rose deodorant. So I bought six of them.</li>
            <li> Really does make it so that you can go a few extra days without shaving and wen u finally do, it onli takes a few strokes and that pesky underarm hair is gone so easily. Sometimes i dnt even need to use soap. My underarm is smoother, and i love this scent. Lasts for a good 24 hours also.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you have sensitive skin. I cannot wear typical over the counter, anti-perspirants due to an allergy and sensitive skin. It makes me break out in a rash. HOWEVER, Dove Visibly Smooth was the ONLY over-the-counter product I&#x27;ve tried that does NOT irritate my skin. It is true that you need to apply it more than once a day or you will perspire, but if you&#x27;re looking for an economical option for sensitive skin, then this is the deodorant for you. They actually stopped carrying it for me locally and I tried another similar product that Dove carries that was similar and immediately broke out in a rash. It works so well that I am now buying it online. I did notice less stubble, but nothing incredibly dramatic. My hair is fine/blond anyways, so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for darker or thicker hair. But, if you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin that reacts to certain deodorants, give this a try.</li>
            <li> Solid. Got this for the girlfriend and she&#x27;s been using this stuff for years. Purchased on Amazon to save some money. She doesn&#x27;t smell, so I guess it&#x27;s working.</li>
