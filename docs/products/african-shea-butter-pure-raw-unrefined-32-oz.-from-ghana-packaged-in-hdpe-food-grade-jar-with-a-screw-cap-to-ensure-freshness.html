            <li>Will order more soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true fan and will continue to shop with this company!</li>
            <li>Perfect in combination with other oils to make a hair mask</li>
            <li>The description states that it also helps with psoriasis (I have a very mild case), but it does not.  </li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t absorb it easily</li>
            <li>Its in a container that is strong.  </li>
            <li>I liked it at first</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>this jar is HUGE-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge and it works.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product one of the best cream to use on daily</li>
            <li>I saw a significant difference of my spots fading and my skin evening out.  </li>
            <li>It took about a month to see a significant difference</li>
            <li>Will almost be a month since I received my shea butter and have noticed a significant difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Good quality African Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I gotten it a day before my birthday which was cool...</li>
            <li>I am 7 months pregnant</li>
            <li>It is smooth &amp; silky, very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The quantity and quality is worth it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using African Shea butter for over a year and love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>It feels grainy and it is more yellow than what appears on the pictures.</li>
            <li>I mix it with coconut oil and other stuff to make my own skin care products.</li>
            <li>It was very gritty which I&#x27;ve only experienced when the shea butter is old.</li>
            <li>The shea butter seems to be very high quality.</li>
            <li>This is much harder and more crumbly in texture.  </li>
            <li>Soooooooo much shea</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>you so much.</li>
            <li>I just prefer it very creamy.</li>
            <li>This was a gift, but my friends found it very helpful.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Feels greasy at first but skin stays soft all day.</li>
            <li>Well after a steady regiment of applying the shea butter mornings before work and at night before i went to bed</li>
            <li>And I was surprised at how fast I received it...</li>
            <li>but when you make your whipp melted down completely the grit goes away when it back cool it will be smooth like butter...</li>
            <li>The shea butter was described as 100% pure unrefined shea butter when it is actually kpangan butter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kpangan butter, a completely separate species.</li>
            <li>I personally did not like the texture it was very crumbly</li>
            <li>Just received this in the mail and so far haven&#x27;t used it</li>
            <li>it works fine, but is a little intensely yellow for my liking in lotions.</li>
            <li>Once I got this I was amazed on how soft and smooth it is than the ones I saw,in stores that was rock hard.</li>
            <li>The scent is much lighter than traditional shea, which is a big plus!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for my skin although I&#x27;ve been applying it every single day after my shower.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product for the first time about a year ago because I had an uneven skin tone and scars from acne.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this product for the first time about a year ago because I had an uneven skin tone and scars from acne.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is raw and pure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased shea butter before and was excited to get this quantity however the quality was poor.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would become my all natural skin moisturizer especially for my winter dry skin and my rough heels.  </li>
            <li> so it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This last a long time.</li>
            <li> In the end I had to go back to using the product that I know works for my winter dry skin - &amp;#34;Aveeno&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is not really shea butter, but a similar African tree that also has beneficial properties for your skin.</li>
            <li> it lasted a long time and never went bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be buttered up for a long time.</li>
            <li> The previous time I bought it (which was same seller, but obviously different producer-now Plant Guru)</li>
            <li> I even tried mixing other oils such as coconut oil, jojoba oil etc.</li>
            <li> it is kpangan butter, it has my hair and skin dry even made my hair fall out in some places,can&#x27;t return .I</li>
            <li> My skin remained rough, dry and scaly with each use.  </li>
            <li> with it hoping that I&#x27;d find a combination that worked, but my skin was still dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> Bought this one instead of getting from the city and find it to be very gritty and has black spots in it.  </li>
            <li> I also bought a body shower oil to assist with moisturization, but that only helped a little.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little gritty...</li>
            <li> This Shea butter felt a bit grainy compared to my other Shea butter I purchased.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with real Shea butter.</li>
            <li> i do t melt it down.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I just wish the jar wasn&#x27;t so tall and narrow.</li>
            <li> The opened one has gone bad, and it doesn&#x27;t look too promising for</li>
            <li> or if it really does just stink that bad.</li>
            <li> This makes it difficult to scoop it out and use it for different recipes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I would order this again....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I will even rub it on my skin?</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s sort of greasy and hard to work in to skin</li>
            <li> This product is thick and works like a charm to seal my hair after I moisturize.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> It arrived on the mean day</li>
            <li> The jar is caved in and it is totally dry and has gone bad.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with it at all and will not order from here again.</li>
            <li> so idk if I&#x27;m just smell sensitive and that&#x27;s why it smells so horrible</li>
            <li> the unopened one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with this product and will need to find a different brand to purchase.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I like it alot, but believe it&#x27;s wrong to mislead by calling it something it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> Ill defiantly be ordering my Organic Shea Butter through this company again...</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s so awful idk</li>
            <li> set that I bought, which is Plant Guru has gone bad.  </li>
            <li> I have it bad on my face...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Awesome packaging, beautiful texture. Speedy shipping! Very happy and will absolutely shop with this seller again. Thank you</li>
            <li> Very nice quality shea butter!!</li>
            <li> This is very smooth and perfect!  I made lip balm using my doTERRA essential oils and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2-15-17&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product for the second time in January 2016.  It was definitely lower quality than the one I had bought before.  This is much harder and more crumbly in texture.  This makes it difficult to scoop it out and use it for different recipes.  I don&#x27;t use it every month, but just grabbed the jar to make something.  The jar is caved in and it is totally dry and has gone bad.  The previous time I bought it (which was same seller, but obviously different producer-now Plant Guru) it lasted a long time and never went bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set that I bought, which is Plant Guru has gone bad.  I only used 3/4 of one container and I have one unopened.  The opened one has gone bad, and it doesn&#x27;t look too promising for the unopened one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with this product and will need to find a different brand to purchase.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would become my all natural skin moisturizer especially for my winter dry skin and my rough heels.  This product did not moisturize at all!  It did not even penetrate into my skin!  My skin remained rough, dry and scaly with each use.  I used it for about 2 months thinking maybe my skin needed time to condition to it or something, but still no change.  I even tried mixing other oils such as coconut oil, jojoba oil etc. with it hoping that I&#x27;d find a combination that worked, but my skin was still dry and rough.  I also bought a body shower oil to assist with moisturization, but that only helped a little.  The description states that it also helps with psoriasis (I have a very mild case), but it does not.  In the end I had to go back to using the product that I know works for my winter dry skin - &amp;#34;Aveeno&amp;#34;.  I would not recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little gritty...but when you make your whipp melted down completely the grit goes away when it back cool it will be smooth like butter...</li>
            <li> Not sure I would order this again....it works fine, but is a little intensely yellow for my liking in lotions. Nice product though and works great.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! I made body butters with it, they turned out awesome!</li>
            <li> That product is a magic, works nice with skin</li>
            <li> This is not Shea butter it is kpangan butter, it has my hair and skin dry even made my hair fall out in some places,can&#x27;t return .I do not recommend this product, DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> Soooooooo much shea I LOVE IT. I have to whip it to get rid of the gritty consistency though.</li>
            <li> I liked it at first but it&#x27;s sort of greasy and hard to work in to skin</li>
            <li> I received this item today.  It was not packaged properly, but was not damaged. The label as advertised is not the same as what I received.  It appears to be the same product.  I will not return it.  Once I open and use the product I will update my review.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Good quality and it comes packaged just as the picture shows... A fully packed tall plastic tub with an airtight kid</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s labeled &amp;#34;shea&amp;#34;. Used it in making soap and I love it, but found out it is NOT shea butter. It&#x27;s kpangan butter, a completely separate species. Like I said, I like it alot, but believe it&#x27;s wrong to mislead by calling it something it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have been using she&#x27;s butter for about 20 years and I will continue to use it.  This is the real deal.  I will be ordering again</li>
            <li> I brought this Shea Butter to make face moisturizer and it works great will buy again</li>
            <li> The shea butter seems to be very high quality. 32 Oz. for $10.00 is an awesome deal. I will order again but this container will last me a while (:</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product .Thank you so much. Every thing was great. It arrived on the mean day</li>
            <li> This Shea butter felt a bit grainy compared to my other Shea butter I purchased. still a good product I just prefer it very creamy.</li>
            <li> Very very very amazing. The best moisturizing ever.  But i dont know if it&#x27;s suitable for face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased shea butter before and was excited to get this quantity however the quality was poor. It was very gritty which I&#x27;ve only experienced when the shea butter is old.</li>
            <li> This has a waxy oily consistency and I think Id use pulpy as well. Keep in mind this is not really shea butter, but a similar African tree that also has beneficial properties for your skin. I mix it with coconut oil and other stuff to make my own skin care products. Feels greasy at first but skin stays soft all day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the first time about a year ago because I had an uneven skin tone and scars from acne.  i red how unrefined shea butter could help even my skin out and get rid of the scars I&#x27;d accumulated over the years.  I was a bit skeptical but decided to try it anyway.  Well after a steady regiment of applying the shea butter mornings before work and at night before i went to bed I saw a significant difference of my spots fading and my skin evening out.  It took about a month to see a significant difference and i always get compliments on how beautiful my skin is.  My daughter also uses it for her ezcema, it does a wonderful job of mousterizing her skin without any type of irritation.  I&#x27;m a true fan and will continue to shop with this company!</li>
            <li> This product is thick and works like a charm to seal my hair after I moisturize. Will order again, once I use up this batch.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for eczema- I have it bad on my face... everytme I get out of the shower I rub this in- within 10mins my redness and itching is gone.  Will buy more when out... this jar is HUGE- so it will last a long time.  Great price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> This last a long time. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It is smooth &amp; silky, very moisturizing.  The scent is much lighter than traditional shea, which is a big plus!</li>
            <li> It works well and feels nice on the skin!  I do not like how it smells and how yellow it is, but when i add my scents and color it will resolve (hopefully).</li>
            <li> Creamy texture. I use it everyday. I just wish the jar wasn&#x27;t so tall and narrow. I am worried I will have problems getting the product out from the bottom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using African Shea butter for over a year and love the way my skin feels. Bought this one instead of getting from the city and find it to be very gritty and has black spots in it.  I use it just the way it is, i do t melt it down. Not happy with it at all and will not order from here again.</li>
            <li> I have used Shea butter before. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works well. This was a gift, but my friends found it very helpful.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product one of the best cream to use on daily</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with real Shea butter. Works fine. Happy to find a source.</li>
            <li> Good quality African Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge and it works.</li>
            <li> Its in a container that is strong.  The product itself is raw and pure.  I use it on my skin and hair.  I am allergic to sulfa products so I know with this product I dont have to worry about getting hives and shortness of breath.</li>
            <li> Once I got this I was amazed on how soft and smooth it is than the ones I saw,in stores that was rock hard.I love how it moisturizes my skin with absolutley no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for  over 3 months now.  It didn&#x27;t do much for my skin although I&#x27;ve been applying it every single day after my shower.  My skin doesn&#x27;t absorb it easily so I&#x27;ve seen yellow spots on my clothes.  It feels grainy and it is more yellow than what appears on the pictures. I&#x27;ve been mixing it with coconut oil and that has improved my skin.  I won&#x27;t be buying more of this product because I feel the quality is not that good and I&#x27;ve had better results with the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Love this products will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great. Well worth the price. Just remember it has a gritty feel.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who values Shea butter. The container and quantity of the product is excellent.</li>
            <li> It was just was the picture shows. I will be buttered up for a long time.</li>
            <li> delivered on time - product was as described</li>
            <li> The shea butter was described as 100% pure unrefined shea butter when it is actually kpangan butter.  I personally did not like the texture it was very crumbly and I decided to return for a refund.</li>
            <li> Perfect in combination with other oils to make a hair mask</li>
            <li> Arrived in excellent condition. Will order more soon.</li>
            <li> Will almost be a month since I received my shea butter and have noticed a significant difference in my skin tone. And I was surprised at how fast I received it...I gotten it a day before my birthday which was cool...Ill defiantly be ordering my Organic Shea Butter through this company again...The quantity and quality is worth it...</li>
            <li> Just received this in the mail and so far haven&#x27;t used it but the smell is horrid!!! I mean it&#x27;s so awful idk if I will be able to stand it! I am 7 months pregnant so idk if I&#x27;m just smell sensitive and that&#x27;s why it smells so horrible or if it really does just stink that bad. Also it&#x27;s so thick I&#x27;m not sure how I will even rub it on my skin?</li>
            <li> Good quality and price.</li>
