    <ol>
            <li>Also very happy that they came dual ended.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll make great arts &amp; crafts materials for my grandchildren when I nip the pointed ends off of them.</li>
            <li>Great price.  </li>
            <li>These are very handy.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect and cheap!</li>
            <li>Good product, good price.  </li>
            <li>Good price for good orange sticks.  </li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I love using these with my nail art!</li>
            <li>but I use mine on my own mani-pedi&#x27;s, plus when I&#x27;m quilting as a stiletto.  </li>
            <li>I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li>But I CAN say that they were shipped promptly, and that&#x27;s a very important consideration because when you need an orange stick, you need one</li>
            <li>DELIVERT SPEED WAS OK</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very happy to have found these at such an afforable price.</li>
            <li>, these are ok.</li>
            <li>Much better than sewing through your finger.  </li>
            <li>There are many times</li>
            <li>The quality is good, no spliters, I love orange sticks and this got me a lot for not too much money.</li>
            <li>WORK FINE FOR WHAT I AM USING THEM FOR, MORE BRITTLE THAN</li>
            <li>But overall, a very good purchase.</li>
            <li>A huge package</li>
            <li>Fabulous purchase.</li>
            <li>Just seems to fit nails.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t worth the wait or the money, and they don&#x27;t do such a great job.  </li>
            <li>Nothing to start a fireworks display, but they do exactly what they are supposed to do!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not even worth returning.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>Nice to have extra orange sticks for both personal nail use and little cleaning projects; great to remove melted wax from sterling silver</li>
            <li>arrived very speedily.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find these at a reasonable price in my drug stores.</li>
            <li>Arrived much sooner than expected, and for that I am quite thrilled.....as I am not the most patient person in the world.</li>
            <li>FIrst of all, these took soooooooo long to get to me that I gave up on them and ordered a more expensive stainless steel tool that I could have permanently and would do a good job, AND that was Amazon Prime, so it got to me in two days.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, I just wish one of the ends was pointy instead of both being the same sort of flat ege.</li>
            <li>The size is a little unwieldy and the shape makes it harder to push the cuticles as compared to just kind of scraping them along the nail.</li>
            <li>These soft sticks don&#x27;t bruise the nail bed, yet allow for thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell when I ordered these that the tips were square and not round.  </li>
            <li>These orange sticks are small , 4 1/2 inches long, but fine for a mani or pedi at home or on the go.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Meaning that they have a pointed end and a flat end.</li>
            <li> The ones I recieved were only about 4 1/2 inches long.</li>
            <li> I expected the traditional wooden orange sticks used to push back cuticles.</li>
            <li> (that one end was pointy instead of both being flat)</li>

            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> These came finally, and they are just plain old pieces of pointed wood that you might be afraid</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use shish kabob skewers to push back your cuticles and clean nasty stuff off your tow nails.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality, just sharp sticks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re so tough to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I prefer round tips on my cuticle sticks because I&#x27;m afraid of accidentally jabbing myself with the corners on the square tipped sticks.  </li>

            <li> I love using these with my nail art!</li>
            <li> just what I expected and arrived early.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.  The size is a little unwieldy and the shape makes it harder to push the cuticles as compared to just kind of scraping them along the nail.</li>
            <li> Not bad, I just wish one of the ends was pointy instead of both being the same sort of flat ege.</li>

            <li> What&#x27;s not to like. These are wooden stick cuticle purshers, and are just the same as any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> arrived very speedily.  they were packed in  a postage/postage conscience.  i&#x27;m very happy to have found these at such an afforable price.</li>
            <li> Arrived much sooner than expected, and for that I am quite thrilled.....as I am not the most patient person in the world. Also very happy that they came dual ended. Meaning that they have a pointed end and a flat end. But I do wish they were a bit longer. The ones I recieved were only about 4 1/2 inches long. But overall, a very good purchase.</li>
            <li> These soft sticks don&#x27;t bruise the nail bed, yet allow for thorough cleaning. And I have enough to put them everywhere I might need one. Fabulous purchase.</li>

            <li> These orange sticks are small , 4 1/2 inches long, but fine for a mani or pedi at home or on the go.  They arrived within 10 days, all the way form China!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!! I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, just sharp sticks.I expected the traditional wooden orange sticks used to push back cuticles. Not what expected.</li>
            <li> Nice to have extra orange sticks for both personal nail use and little cleaning projects; great to remove melted wax from sterling silver</li>
            <li> These are perfect and cheap! I have been very satisfied with them. I would purchase again in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> Nothing to start a fireworks display, but they do exactly what they are supposed to do!  Of course, I would buy again!</li>
            <li> These orange wood cuticle wood sticks were just what I wanted.  I couldn&#x27;t find them in any of my local stores.  They arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> A huge package but I use mine on my own mani-pedi&#x27;s, plus when I&#x27;m quilting as a stiletto.  Much better than sewing through your finger.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> FIrst of all, these took soooooooo long to get to me that I gave up on them and ordered a more expensive stainless steel tool that I could have permanently and would do a good job, AND that was Amazon Prime, so it got to me in two days.  These came finally, and they are just plain old pieces of pointed wood that you might be afraid will give you a splinter.  They weren&#x27;t worth the wait or the money, and they don&#x27;t do such a great job.  There are many times I&#x27;ve bought something that is not Amazon Prime, and it&#x27;s always been worth the wait, but this was just a waste of money and the time I spent waiting for them.  They&#x27;re not even worth returning.  They&#x27;ll make great arts &amp; crafts materials for my grandchildren when I nip the pointed ends off of them.</li>
            <li> Just as described. I grew up using some similar.  Just seems to fit nails. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing batter for pushing back cuticles than orange sticks. Don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re so tough to find in stores.</li>
            <li> These are very handy.  Great price.  Couldn&#x27;t find these at a reasonable price in my drug stores.</li>
            <li> Good price for good orange sticks.  I wish the ends of the sticks were different (that one end was pointy instead of both being flat) but I knew this before I bought them.  The quality is good, no spliters, I love orange sticks and this got me a lot for not too much money.</li>
            <li> They are still here!  You don&#x27;t have to use shish kabob skewers to push back your cuticles and clean nasty stuff off your tow nails.  What can I say about orange sticks?  But I CAN say that they were shipped promptly, and that&#x27;s a very important consideration because when you need an orange stick, you need one and you don&#x27;t want to wait two weeks for it to show up.</li>
