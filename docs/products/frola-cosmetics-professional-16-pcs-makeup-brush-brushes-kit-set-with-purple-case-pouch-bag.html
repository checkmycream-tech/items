            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the brushes will last, but they get the job done for at least a little while.</li>
            <li> I took them out of the case, and it seems to be less pronounced, but I keep these brushes in the basement and go and get them when I need them.</li>
            <li> I did have trouble wondering why all these brushes but no blending brush</li>

            <li> There is a smell but it&#x27;s mainly with the pouch. The brushes don&#x27;t smell at all. They are super soft, but almost too soft. Besides that they&#x27;re pretty good. Love the colors!</li>
            <li> Absoulty perfect for the price! These make my make up come out amazing!</li>
            <li> Some brushes can&#x27;t even pick up the eyeshowder or powder , like the product won&#x27;t stick to some brushes so that&#x27;s y I didn&#x27;t like some but some brushes r great , I use them everyday n I did have trouble wondering why all these brushes but no blending brush</li>

            <li> These are relatively nice brushes, a really good buy for the price. The only problem is the incredibly strong, harsh chemical smell. I took them out of the case, and it seems to be less pronounced, but I keep these brushes in the basement and go and get them when I need them. That&#x27;s how stinky they are. The smell will give you a headache if you keep them nearby.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a good product, soft brushes that don&#x27;t shed too much.</li>
            <li> This is a very cute brush set. I&#x27;m not sure how long the brushes will last, but they get the job done for at least a little while.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush set is an amazing deal!  I bought it as a travel brush set, and because I cannot resist anything purple!  I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars only because there are brushes out there that are slightly better quality, but, you will pay an arm and a leg for them!  You can get this whole set for less than you would pay for one prestige brand makeup brush!  The brushes are well made,  I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> While these brushes are pretty, there is such a strong chemical smell, I&#x27;m concerned about keeping them in my house.  They smelled up my whole room with a harsh smell.</li>
            <li> My sister I bought this for is completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Wow!  How wonderful to have them all together:)</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used all the brushes, but I have them if needed. I love the eye brow, blush, eye shadow brushes a lot. I&#x27;d recommend this item because the finish is great.</li>
            <li> Love it and love that it&#x27;s purple</li>
