            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I plan to try  more Avalon products since I am in love with this one.</li>
            <li>Mostly organic ingredients</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Love the smell and feel of this moisturizing face wash.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 years now and am sticking with it:)</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 3 years and love how it cleanses my skin.  </li>
            <li>Organic is always better for everyone, and this one sure makes your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this skin cleanser does a great job without irritation.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this facial cleanser for over 10 years and believe it&#x27;s very good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m trying to get into the habit of using organic products, and after some research I finally settle on these as it has very good ingredients; with this price for two</li>
            <li>Great product refreshes your face keepsit feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Softer, smoother, balanced, and most importantly, it does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I also did not like how strong the lavendar smell was.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my true love.</li>
            <li>My skin is combination, and I keep having to find better products with a full time student&#x27;s budget.</li>
            <li>there is no lather, which is fine.</li>
            <li>It could be an allergic reactions to organic ingredients, I supposed, but I went with Dessert Essence moisturizer and was fine.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and is soft and not soapy/foamy.</li>
            <li>I am looking for better products than the ones I currently use and the ingredients in this is good.</li>
            <li>When I got it I read that it was soap free and wondered how well it would clean my face.  </li>
            <li>my face feels clean and it works on removing eye make up, too.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean with no dryness or redness and it is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought the full line for my daughter as well.</li>
            <li>This is the best cleansing product for my delicate skin that I have used.</li>
            <li>And apparently nine more words are required before this &amp;#34;spontaneous&amp;#34; review is acceptable!</li>
            <li>but it is moisturizing and leaves face feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more hydrated, has a healthier glow, and does get clean even though I was initially concerned about that.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and have NEVER been so satisfied with anything I have put on my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also made of mostly natural ingredients (ones you can actually read and pronounce), which is good for the environment and for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is picky, sadly; though the package was nice and I support organic products, but good luck with this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice wash and creamy, but if you have very dry skin don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was because it was My first time using it</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling smooth and silky with no harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it there first, and was amazed by how it changed my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought it, use about 1/3 of the first bottle and threw both away.</li>
            <li>I am becoming a BIG fan of Avalon Organics</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave face dry like most face washes.</li>
            <li>My face is apparently very sensitive, I get acne here and there, and it is prone to drying and flaking if I don&#x27;t use the right product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much either.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>The wash is milky and creamy (not soapy), which I think is partly why my skin loves it so much.</li>
            <li>Well, with this cleaner, your face feels soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>well, i&#x27;m trying to \\&quot;go organic\\&quot;, but am in late 40&#x27;s, so  need good skin care products.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes your face feel clean.</li>
            <li>I originally became aware of this cleanser through my local Natural Foods Co-Op.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Right after using it My entire face was bright red and stayed that way for a few hours.</li>
            <li>skin feels clean without feeling dry.</li>
            <li>I got right up close to the mirror and looked for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Unlike a similar cleaning product with a similar feel, this rinsed off easily and left my face feeling nourished.</li>
            <li>Using only this on my face and using coconut oil as a moisturizer, my face has really stayed clear.</li>
            <li>this cleanser did leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and care about the planet, and this product seems to address both of those concerns.  </li>
            <li>now use burts bees sensitive</li>
            <li>so much that I have since tried other Avalon products with equal success.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean and not dry and tight.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft and never dry.</li>
            <li>and i have to really rub this cleanser around my eyes for a long time to get it off, but this is the only con.</li>
            <li>Drag queens not so much</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this is just what I needed in a facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin and have never had any cleanser irritate My skin like</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For normal to slightly dry skin</li>
            <li>Nothing seems to work for my skin, but this seems to be better than other products, at least.</li>
            <li>I only use natural products (which at times are difficult to find without reading many labels) and this product fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive, temperamental skin.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this, I was afraid the milky feel of the cleanser wouldn&#x27;t wash off my face cleanly ...</li>

            <li> I recently purchased another facial cleanser and it left my face dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin was tightening on dry days even though I was applying the same amount of moisturizer after cleansing and toning.  </li>
            <li> I battled acne for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I ended up having strangely oily skin that gets dry after rinsing with water.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> but the next few washings did the same.</li>
            <li> Granted, I haven&#x27;t compared this to any other facial cleansing milk, but I did look carefully when deciding some years ago to switch from washing my face with Ivory soap to this.  </li>
            <li> But as soon as I go back to using this, it calms down.</li>
            <li> It gave me dry patches and made my face feel tight.</li>
            <li> I think I could go without any other moisturizer ...</li>
            <li> A little tight and dry?</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting harsh chemicals on your face or down the drain.</li>
            <li> Feels a little greasy when you&#x27;re washing</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this is one of the few cleansers that doesn&#x27;t make my skin redder after using it.</li>
            <li> It does not leave it dried out, but also not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what is causing this.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out ever since I started washing my face with it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t remove my mascara, which makes me wonder how much other stuff it isn&#x27;t removing:(  </li>
            <li> I was Shocked after using it!  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> this does have a texture like that of a moisturizer but it feels so good on the face.  i would definitely buy it again. my face feels clean and it works on removing eye make up, too.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes your face feel clean. Don&#x27;t need much either. Does in fact come in a pack of 2.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased another facial cleanser and it left my face dry and flaky.  My pores were magnified and I wasn&#x27;t happy.  I tried Avalon&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner and had been impressed so I thought I&#x27;d try this cleanser.  When I got it I read that it was soap free and wondered how well it would clean my face.  I was Shocked after using it!  Amazing stuff.  I got right up close to the mirror and looked for a long time.  I couldn&#x27;t find any dirt in my pores and they were signifigantly smaller.  My face looked and felt fresher.  I have pretty sensitive skin and have NEVER been so satisfied with anything I have put on my face.  I must say, the shampoo did the same for my scalp.  I am becoming a BIG fan of Avalon Organics</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin and have never had any cleanser irritate My skin like this cleanser did. Right after using it My entire face was bright red and stayed that way for a few hours. I thought maybe it was because it was My first time using it but the next few washings did the same. Not sure what is causing this. I have never had a reaction like this to any facial products. I emailed Avalon about it and never heard back. I also did not like how strong the lavendar smell was.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and this 2 pack is the best deal I have seen.  Leaves my face feeling clean and not dry and tight.</li>
            <li> Nice, creamy texture to this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great product refreshes your face keepsit feeling soft.</li>
            <li> well, i&#x27;m trying to \\&quot;go organic\\&quot;, but am in late 40&#x27;s, so  need good skin care products. this cleanser did leave my skin soft. skin feels clean without feeling dry. there is no lather, which is fine. i wear a washable mascara and i have to really rub this cleanser around my eyes for a long time to get it off, but this is the only con.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t remove my mascara, which makes me wonder how much other stuff it isn&#x27;t removing:(  it is moisturizing, so if your a dude u may like it. Drag queens not so much</li>
            <li> I love the CoQ10 my students tell me you are so beautiful! I always purchase this product when I run out of the CoQ10 repir. It actually works!&lt;br /&gt;Nica</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleansing cream that I have been using for years.  It leaves my face feeling smooth and silky with no harsh chemicals.  Amazon offers best price !</li>
            <li> Granted, I haven&#x27;t compared this to any other facial cleansing milk, but I did look carefully when deciding some years ago to switch from washing my face with Ivory soap to this.  My skin feels more hydrated, has a healthier glow, and does get clean even though I was initially concerned about that.  I have sensitive skin and care about the planet, and this product seems to address both of those concerns.  It&#x27;s gentle, smells nice, and does a good job.  I use it in conjunction with the toner and the daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin. Once I reached 40 I noticed that my skin was tightening on dry days even though I was applying the same amount of moisturizer after cleansing and toning.  So I switched from a foaming cleanser to this cleansing milk and the dryness/tightness that comes with aging skin went away.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! I have dry, sensitive, temperamental skin. I originally became aware of this cleanser through my local Natural Foods Co-Op. I purchased it there first, and was amazed by how it changed my skin. Softer, smoother, balanced, and most importantly, it does not irritate my skin at all. But, it was 15.00 a bottle at my co-op. I researched it on Amazon, and was able to purchase a 2 pack for just about 18.00. I would highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for a great product I have been using for years.  It cleans my face and removes eye makeup without stinging.  It smells great and is organic. Can you ask for anything else?</li>
            <li> Organic is always better for everyone, and this one sure makes your skin smooth. I don&#x27;t use soap anymore, only organic facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great face wash! Both cleansing and moisturizing, and great for pimple prone skin</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have very sensitive skin and this skin cleanser does a great job without irritation.  Price is great.</li>
            <li> Best product ever - can only get it online.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 5 years and I really like it.  It goes with my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I use anymore. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now, prior to that I was changing washes constantly. My face is apparently very sensitive, I get acne here and there, and it is prone to drying and flaking if I don&#x27;t use the right product. I&#x27;m 23 and female if it matters to those with similar face conditions. I&#x27;ve had the misfortune to forget this on trips and had to use different washes - my face immediately freaks out, breaks out, and dries up. But as soon as I go back to using this, it calms down. The wash is milky and creamy (not soapy), which I think is partly why my skin loves it so much. It&#x27;s also made of mostly natural ingredients (ones you can actually read and pronounce), which is good for the environment and for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t foresee myself using anything else in the future. It&#x27;s my true love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice wash and creamy, but if you have very dry skin don&#x27;t bother. This is not your solution. It gave me dry patches and made my face feel tight. I gave it to my son and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use burts bees sensitive and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For normal to slightly dry skin this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li> This is the only facial cleanser I can use.  It&#x27;s wonderful on my tender, very allergic face.  And this was a GREAT price.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to work for my skin, but this seems to be better than other products, at least. It smells really good and is soft and not soapy/foamy.</li>
            <li> Love it. I bought the full line for my daughter as well.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful.  Love this!</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have ever tried! It leaves my skin feeling so soft and never dry. The best part is it is safe and free of harmful chemicals. I plan to try  more Avalon products since I am in love with this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this facial cleanser for over 10 years and believe it&#x27;s very good for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have ever used. Mostly organic ingredients so you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting harsh chemicals on your face or down the drain. I haven&#x27;t broken out ever since I started washing my face with it. Love it...Yay!</li>
            <li> Always come through and the results are what I want:  beauty!  And apparently nine more words are required before this &amp;#34;spontaneous&amp;#34; review is acceptable!</li>
            <li> When I first bought this, I was afraid the milky feel of the cleanser wouldn&#x27;t wash off my face cleanly ... but I was worried for no reason. Unlike a similar cleaning product with a similar feel, this rinsed off easily and left my face feeling nourished. You know how your face feels after washing with soap? A little tight and dry? Well, with this cleaner, your face feels soft and fresh. I think I could go without any other moisturizer ... but I like to use the Avalon toner and facial serum afterward ... WHAT A NICE FEELING FACE!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m trying to get into the habit of using organic products, and after some research I finally settle on these as it has very good ingredients; with this price for two it&#x27;s a good deal. My skin is combination, and I keep having to find better products with a full time student&#x27;s budget. I bought it, use about 1/3 of the first bottle and threw both away. Wasteful, I know, but my skin does not agree with this. I ended up having strangely oily skin that gets dry after rinsing with water. It could be an allergic reactions to organic ingredients, I supposed, but I went with Dessert Essence moisturizer and was fine. My skin is picky, sadly; though the package was nice and I support organic products, but good luck with this.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this is one of the few cleansers that doesn&#x27;t make my skin redder after using it. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of this moisturizing face wash. Will buy again. It doesn&#x27;t leave face dry like most face washes. Great for my combination skin. Feels a little greasy when you&#x27;re washing but it is moisturizing and leaves face feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Really great for my skin.  It does not leave it dried out, but also not greasy.  I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is just what I needed in a facial cleanser.  I use it twice a day and get especially great results when I combine it with my Clarsonic brush.  I have been using it for 3 years now and am sticking with it:)</li>
            <li> I love this face wash and it works great. I am looking for better products than the ones I currently use and the ingredients in this is good.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 years and love how it cleanses my skin.  I only use natural products (which at times are difficult to find without reading many labels) and this product fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for maybe a year.  Using only this on my face and using coconut oil as a moisturizer, my face has really stayed clear. I battled acne for a long time.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleansing product for my delicate skin that I have used. It leaves my skin clean with no dryness or redness and it is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much that I have since tried other Avalon products with equal success.</li>
