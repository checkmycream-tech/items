    <ol>
            <li>The Brushes are a very good quality!!!!</li>
            <li>Work great!</li>
            <li>i just love the shape of these sponges, works wonderful.</li>
            <li>however it was a good job I ordered well in advance of me going as it would not have arrived in time</li>
            <li>That said, they apply nicely (I always dab on and pat to blend, fwiw) and get the job done.</li>
            <li>I find them very easy to use.</li>
            <li>That one more than doubles in size and is so soft and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It arrived in time to take which I was pleased about</li>
            <li>Love love love xxx üòç</li>
            <li>Love the material.</li>
            <li>I have used the Beauty Blender, and this has more durability.</li>
            <li>I had a beautyblender and like this one way more.  </li>
            <li>They got here ahead of time and when I tried them they left my makeup flawless.</li>
            <li>Recommending them to anyone and everyone :).</li>
            <li>The sponge itself is ok.</li>
            <li>These sponges are fantastic and make applying makeup so easy.  </li>
            <li>Super cheap!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;very smoothly and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Make sure you wet these before using, I didn&#x27;t know until I saw on you tube, these work really good</li>
            <li>The brushes seriously make my face flawless.</li>
            <li>So far I like these ok.</li>
            <li>These are a pretty good buy for the price, but they are certainly not on par with the Beauty Blenders brand.</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>Almost like a rock really!</li>
            <li>For that it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>The price in comparison to similar type items is excellent especially since it does exactly the same as higher priced items.  </li>
            <li>This is the first set I buy</li>
            <li>they ok i would of thought of them more soft but they too hard for my skin</li>
            <li>I really like these.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item for a friend in Poland she really rates it</li>
            <li>so cannot really comment about it myself.</li>
            <li>I rather spend a lot of money for the real one</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this purchase which has caused me to consider other Cheeky items.</li>
            <li>So soft &amp; it makes makeup application so much easier!</li>
            <li>With this one, more of your makeup goes on your face and less in the sponge.</li>
            <li>I bought enough to try out for myself and my pro kit; definitely getting more of these.</li>
            <li>High quality sponges that perform as described.</li>
            <li>So order early and get a real bargain.</li>
            <li>Do not by better u buy ordinary wedges .</li>
            <li>So initial thoughts are that they could be a little softer and spread the foundation better-</li>
            <li>They break down quickly, though.</li>
            <li>The little tip also helps be precise in smaller areas like under the eye.</li>
            <li>I really got them because I needed something easier to hold due to my carpal tunnel.</li>

            <li> They came with no instructions whatsoever, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using them right as far as whether to use them wet, dry, etc.</li>

            <li> either way thank god i paid less then 4 dollars but still</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting use to.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase unless you want to waste your money.</li>
            <li> I can tell you they are extremely firm.  </li>
            <li> Or don&#x27;t, but don&#x27;t waste your $$$$ on this product.</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> After soaking up the water they expanded a little bit in size but were still rock hard.</li>
            <li> Waste money!</li>
            <li> Not really sure it qualifies as a sponge.</li>
            <li> They are hard as rocks an don&#x27;t even obsorb any water nor dose ur expand.</li>
            <li> In blending &amp; reaching the hard to reach spots</li>
            <li> So hard that I can&#x27;t even squeeze it.</li>
            <li> They were rock hard.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if they&#x27;re suppose to be so hard!</li>
            <li> So much less expensive than the name brand Beauty Blender</li>
            <li> Very hard.</li>
            <li> I certainly wasted mine!!!</li>
            <li> These are definitely useless they are way to hard</li>
            <li> This is false advertising by saying they are beauty blenders.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are nothing like the Sephora sponges sold. They are hard and almost impossible to use. Buyer beware! Do not purchase unless you want to waste your money.</li>
            <li> Have not tried them yet.  I can tell you they are extremely firm.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how they make my foundation look!</li>
            <li> I really like these.  So much less expensive than the name brand Beauty Blender and you get 4 sponges instead of just one.</li>
            <li> Did not care for these.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a friend in Poland she really rates it so cannot really comment about it myself. It arrived in time to take which I was pleased about however it was a good job I ordered well in advance of me going as it would not have arrived in time had I left it 2 or 3 days later.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they&#x27;re suppose to be so hard! But I didn&#x27;t like how it felt on my skin . Almost like a rock really! You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> they ok i would of thought of them more soft but they too hard for my skin either way thank god i paid less then 4 dollars but still</li>
            <li> These applicators make it cleaner and easier to put on foundation.  The are varying colors so you can use one and distinguish it from another in your cosmetic bag.  Soft and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend!! The Brushes are a very good quality!!!! Also, it came earlier than I expected! The brushes seriously make my face flawless. Love love love xxx üòç</li>
            <li> These are definitely useless they are way to hard they dont get bigger when wet i threw them away. I rather spend a lot of money for the real one</li>
            <li> So far I like these ok. I really got them because I needed something easier to hold due to my carpal tunnel. For that it works pretty well. They came with no instructions whatsoever, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using them right as far as whether to use them wet, dry, etc. So initial thoughts are that they could be a little softer and spread the foundation better- but again, this could be my error as I&#x27;ve never used blending sponges before.</li>
            <li> Super cheap! Very tough on skin! Waste money!</li>
            <li> High quality sponges that perform as described. The price in comparison to similar type items is excellent especially since it does exactly the same as higher priced items.  I am extremely satisfied with this purchase which has caused me to consider other Cheeky items.</li>

            <li> Eta was as expected, over one month. Very rock hard. Does not blend makeup. Does not expand in water, but will eat makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought an 8 dollar cat toy.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wet these before using, I didn&#x27;t know until I saw on you tube, these work really good In blending &amp; reaching the hard to reach spots</li>
            <li> Not really sure it qualifies as a sponge. Very hard. Spend a little more and get a Beautyblender or a little less for the Sephora Perfectionist. Or don&#x27;t, but don&#x27;t waste your $$$$ on this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible! Do not by better u buy ordinary wedges . It&#x27;s rubber not sponge. I got a blender sponge from another s I urce that actuallt swells and is sponge . Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!! I certainly wasted mine!!!</li>
            <li> So hard that I can&#x27;t even squeeze it. Wasted money.</li>
            <li> These sponges are fantastic and make applying makeup so easy.  The little tip also helps be precise in smaller areas like under the eye.</li>
            <li> Terrible! What I received was not what was pictured. There were four sponges in a unmarked plastic bag. I would not recommend them. They were rock hard.  After soaking up the water they expanded a little bit in size but were still rock hard. would not bounce these on my face. I recommend going to Marshals or TJ Max and getting the one they sell there by the brand Swissco. That one more than doubles in size and is so soft and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> i just love the shape of these sponges, works wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have used the Beauty Blender, and this has more durability. I bought enough to try out for myself and my pro kit; definitely getting more of these.</li>
            <li> I had a beautyblender and like this one way more.  The beautyblender absorbs your makeup.  With this one, more of your makeup goes on your face and less in the sponge.</li>
            <li> I had never seen sponges like this before.I find them very easy to use. They do not drink up the make up. They go on&lt;br /&gt;very smoothly and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These are a pretty good buy for the price, but they are certainly not on par with the Beauty Blenders brand. That said, they apply nicely (I always dab on and pat to blend, fwiw) and get the job done. They break down quickly, though.</li>
            <li> This is the first set I buy and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. They got here ahead of time and when I tried them they left my makeup flawless. Recommending them to anyone and everyone :).</li>
            <li> You get four sponges for the price of one!  They work beautifully - only issue - they do take a while in shipping. So order early and get a real bargain.</li>
            <li> The sponge itself is ok. It takes a little getting use to. It did expand once I got it wet and was soft. I tried using it a few times dry and it was awful. My mistake as I didn&#x27;t know it needed to be wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping took forever! Almost 2 months. So if you want it in a hurry I would purchase from another seller.</li>
            <li> Work great! I like to dampen them with water and they make an even mother finish.</li>
