            <li>Please feel free to reply to this comment, if you have any questions.</li>

            <li>they are cheap look cheap</li>
            <li>These are super clips.</li>
            <li>Not the best purchase due to me having natural hair.</li>
            <li>The very first clip I put on my hair broke.</li>
            <li>For being this cheap, the banana clips are amazingly pretty and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight and fine, and when my annual perm grows out, clips just slip out of my hair gradually.  </li>
            <li>Gives you the look that you want, but is losing hair really worth it. --I</li>
            <li>.these are perfect for thin hairs like mine</li>
            <li>Anyways, coming to point, i found the size right.</li>
            <li>and so far they are holding just fine.    </li>
            <li>;)    </li>
            <li>They are exactly as the picture and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>They are pretty sturdy, considering the low price and the clip at the top stays together all day.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping it got like 3 weeks before the estimate  date...  </li>
            <li>It does makes differ in how much hair they can hold.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>they are gentle and hold well.</li>
            <li>Very satisfy with this.</li>
            <li>Just a tad small for my abundant hair,</li>
            <li>There are 5 in total though and most have held up and seem sturdy enough for my hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item if you use a banana clip to hold your hair up.</li>
            <li>having straight hair and it is also thin stranded, these kind of clips work very well.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it stays in place nicely.</li>
            <li>All are small clips, which is great if you have thin or fine hair like I do.  </li>
            <li>I kept hunting for banana clips all over, but was unable to find good ones for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>although it took long to get delivered , was exactly what i wanted!</li>
            <li>It holds my hair tightly and securely.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd time buying the exact same clips and the first 5 all broke, and so far the 2nd time</li>
            <li>I have Asian wavy hair, i wouldn&#x27;t call them too thick, but i&#x27;m sure they are not thin either(Ask</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that they all look very much the same once they are in my hair.</li>
            <li>If you look clearly in the pic i posted of all clips side by side, you will notice the middle one is longest one, and the one at far left is smallest one.</li>
            <li>The color is basic (black) to go with everything, the size is right, and the shapes give a bit of variety.</li>
            <li>They are just slightly different from each other in design, but all function exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>Using smallest one, i could barely make the clip close, but using longest one i had some gap left even after clipping it fully.    </li>
            <li>I use banana clips faithfully and have seen my idea of &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; clips these were not even small I would call them cute little microscopic baby barrettes.</li>
            <li>She is always cribbing about how much time it takes for her to dry my hair as they are thick ;-) ).    </li>

            <li> They broke fast and thier where to small for my hair and hair</li>
            <li> If they were any bigger, they would be slipping from my hair.    </li>
            <li> Not as big as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair that is slightly thin, and for that reason I could never wear big hair clips.</li>
            <li> Came quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> this is definitely not the waste of money.</li>
            <li> I only gave them 3 stars because a few of the clips seems to be a little loose or just not well put together</li>
            <li> As expected!</li>
            <li> I ordered a single clip for 7$ and that broke after few days.  </li>
            <li> so not worth it.</li>
            <li> Still ended up being a less than a dollar for each clip.</li>
            <li> I got 5 black banana clips in the order.  </li>
            <li> Makes my ponytails remain tight and in placed. .</li>
            <li> But the other 4 did it&#x27;s job, at least until they break, which I hope not.</li>
            <li> Depending on my mood, i pick the design one or plain one</li>
            <li> I thought I was being sent jewlery by mistake because the packaging was so small.</li>
            <li> The shipping, however, took longer than Amazon merchandise usually takes, about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> have broke not made for thick hair at all!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I had one to use in the mean time but it was one that I repaired, hinged together with jewelry wire.</li>
            <li> [...] I try very hard to test all features before giving my unbiased opinion to users.</li>
            <li> ha is is thin</li>
            <li> too small - kid size - disappointed</li>
            <li> they are very poor quality.</li>
            <li> that goes well with casual wear!</li>
            <li> I was so mad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my 2nd time buying the exact same clips and the first 5 all broke, and so far the 2nd time i purchased them 4 out the 5 have broke not made for thick hair at all!&lt;br /&gt;Will not be purchasing them again!</li>
            <li> Not the best purchase due to me having natural hair. The combs were quite aggressive. The look I was trying to go for was a curly mo-hawk look. I used two of these and learned after removing them I had lost hair. Gives you the look that you want, but is losing hair really worth it. --I think not!</li>
            <li> Good clips for the prize.  I ordered a single clip for 7$ and that broke after few days.  These clips are great and they are perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li> These are super clips. I have thick hair and it stays in place nicely. Buy them!</li>
            <li> I bought these trying to replace another type of banana clip.  These are better for my purpose!!  My hair is straight and fine, and when my annual perm grows out, clips just slip out of my hair gradually.  These are tighter, though, and don&#x27;t slip all day!!!  I was so excited to discover that I now have FIVE great clips when I couldn&#x27;t find one of my other kind in stores.</li>
            <li> Not fancy,  but good hold.</li>
            <li> These clips are just what I was looking for.They are a good size for my hair,  it&#x27;s fine and curly.  Just know they are shipped from China so it takes a couple of weeks.  I had one to use in the mean time but it was one that I repaired, hinged together with jewelry wire. FYI in case the hinge breaks easily it might work on these.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping it got like 3 weeks before the estimate  date...  I really love this hair accessories  they hold my hair good and the stay in place...I think I would order some more and I recommend  them...</li>
            <li> The very first clip I put on my hair broke. It was cheap so the materials were cheap. But the other 4 did it&#x27;s job, at least until they break, which I hope not. Still ended up being a less than a dollar for each clip. Came quicker than expected.</li>

I have Asian wavy hair, i wouldn&#x27;t call them too thick, but i&#x27;m sure they are not thin either(Ask the lady in the hair saloon... She is always cribbing about how much time it takes for her to dry my hair as they are thick ;-) ).    Anyways, coming to point, i found the size right. It holds my hair tightly and securely.

            <li> I kept hunting for banana clips all over, but was unable to find good ones for a reasonable price. FInally found this here and ordered them, although it took long to get delivered , was exactly what i wanted!</li>
            <li> I love it. Makes my ponytails remain tight and in placed. .</li>
            <li> too small - kid size - disappointed</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve read the questions or something because when they arrived I thought I was being sent jewlery by mistake because the packaging was so small. Turns out it was these clips which are more intended for people with super fine hair on even toddlers. I use banana clips faithfully and have seen my idea of &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; clips these were not even small I would call them cute little microscopic baby barrettes. I havnt even taken them out the plastic I was so mad! Just threw away $5!</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair that is slightly thin, and for that reason I could never wear big hair clips. These are the perfect size so they stay in my hair, they&#x27;re also very reasonably priced. I only gave them 3 stars because a few of the clips seems to be a little loose or just not well put together so I feel like they will break eventually. There are 5 in total though and most have held up and seem sturdy enough for my hair so I am pleased :)</li>
            <li> They broke fast and thier where to small for my hair and hair ha is is thin so i dnt recommended</li>
            <li> Not as big as I expected. My hair doesn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> They are exactly as the picture and exactly what I was looking for. Love them. Thanks</li>
            <li> having straight hair and it is also thin stranded, these kind of clips work very well. they don&#x27;t pull your hair which barrettes and pony tail elastics can. they are gentle and hold well. depending the thickness of your hair the longer clips would be best for thicker hair. i have used these types clips for many years and glad i can still find them.</li>
            <li> looks easy to break but light</li>
            <li> For being this cheap, the banana clips are amazingly pretty and sturdy.  The shipping, however, took longer than Amazon merchandise usually takes, about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love these clips. There are 5 of them. They are perfect for the pony tail look. My only criticism is that they all look very much the same once they are in my hair. Some colors or rhinestones would help.</li>
            <li> Love them! its what Ive been looking for my hair.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> not well made the joint of it is somewhat fragile</li>
            <li> If you like banana clips for your long-ish hair, this is a package you&#x27;ll want to get.  The color is basic (black) to go with everything, the size is right, and the shapes give a bit of variety.</li>
            <li> Its really good, durable n gives style :)</li>
            <li> I got 5 black banana clips in the order.  They are just slightly different from each other in design, but all function exactly the same.  All are small clips, which is great if you have thin or fine hair like I do.  These would also be good for a child.  They are pretty sturdy, considering the low price and the clip at the top stays together all day.  I highly recommend this item if you use a banana clip to hold your hair up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money buying this they are cheap look cheap so not worth it. I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be so cheapy</li>
            <li> they are very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Very satisfy with this. I got them all in good shape and they look of good quality!</li>
            <li> Satisfied with it !! As expected! Plastic material..that goes well with casual wear! this is definitely not the waste of money.</li>
            <li> finally something that holds my hair.</li>
