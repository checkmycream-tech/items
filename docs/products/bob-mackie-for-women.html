            <li>I hope the product stays available forever.</li>
            <li>I think I have found the new love of my life!  </li>
            <li>I love Bob Mackie after the first hour.</li>
            <li>Came in original box with plastic wrapping.</li>
            <li>spray works fine and the bottle is pretty</li>
            <li>It arrived so quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>She was so happy to find it for less than $20 on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Bob Mackie is precisely what my wife wants and will accept.  </li>
            <li>That is rare on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is always such a nice fragrance</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>It has such a nice smell and everyone seems to really like it.</li>
            <li>It is the only Toilette Spray my wife will wear and she receives more compliments from people when she does</li>
            <li>so I know for sure I will have it in the future!!!  </li>
            <li>Does not smell like the last bottle i got from you, but OK</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Love this...have ordered it several times.</li>
            <li>After the blast, I&#x27;m luxuriating in the most warm and sensual blend of florals - not sweet, but truly floral like actual flowers to my nose - and spices that take their time to develop.  </li>
            <li>I feel the perfume bottle is really old, so I don&#x27;t get the full benefit of the aroma that I was expecting.</li>
            <li>The only way I can describe the scent is dark, great for an evening</li>
            <li>It is on the strong side, so spray with caution, especially if someone has fragrance allergies</li>
            <li>Great perfume, hard to find where I live</li>
            <li>When I decided to look at Amazon for certain perfume choices I found it.</li>
            <li>I have been given other popular fragrances that are contemporary, but none of them hold a candle to this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It more than met what I expected.</li>
            <li>Arrived Fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Bob</li>
            <li>soon thanks</li>
            <li>The price and quality of service was better  than expected.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it very often in stores.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reshipping undamaged products this time.</li>
            <li>The initial blast of Mackie&#x27;s earthy spices seduces me instantly and envelops me in a warm embrace...</li>
            <li>old memories one day -- finding the fragrance on Amazon!!!  </li>
            <li>Original perfume, not knock off or generic!</li>
            <li>and I will continue to do so as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>Classic scent that will always be in style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic scent combination.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is a more heavy floral</li>
            <li>I am henry&#x27;s wife,tried the spray cologne &amp; it works as it  should mention this due to buying one at the mall and spray comes out as a stream not as a fine mist.</li>
            <li>Going to have to find a new perfume</li>
            <li>This is highly subjective, but it strikes me as neither sensual nor professional, and thus I would not have the occasion to wear this.</li>
            <li>an unknown, long awaited love affair has now begun with this new-to-me classic.  </li>
            <li>First smelled on a woman in public, had to ask what she was wearing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance since it&#x27;s debut in the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I am constantly complimented on my fragrance and agree with the posters who say that men really appreciate it...  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reminiscent of Enjoli which I frequently weared in the 80&#x27;s but isn&#x27;t sold in stores only online at a drastically marked up price.</li>
            <li>I know Mackie doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Safari, but there must be something in common because my soul produces the same reaction to the first spray of either scent.  </li>
            <li>How did I live this long without finding this gem before now?  </li>
            <li>This is a powerful white floral scent, heavy on the gardenia.</li>

            <li> This is a powerful white floral scent, heavy on the gardenia.</li>
            <li> It is a large bottle and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Safari has been my signature scent for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> This perfume has been around a long time.</li>
            <li> This has been out a long time but just heard of it.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the scent might be &amp;#34;spoiled&amp;#34; because I imagine this is &amp;#34;new old stock&amp;#34; and I was not sure how it has been stored all these years...  </li>
            <li> It was just as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> Not much to comment</li>
            <li> I have tried other fragrances since this one disappeared from the stores...  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when they quit, but now that I have found it again, I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li> I almost cannot believe that this bottle of perfume is HALF off on what you would pay in any store.  </li>
            <li> I wear this scent everyday</li>
            <li> but this bottle smells &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; in that it was past it&#x27;s expiration date.</li>
            <li> scent is a very hard thing to purchase online if one is not familiar with it to begin with...  </li>
            <li> Hard to describe the scent.</li>
            <li> As the base notes rise up, it is nothing but pure bliss.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to hear anything negative about it and continue to receive compliments on it every time I wear it.....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has been discontinued and thus cannot be found in stores</li>

            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for about 25 years, and still get compliments on it, and asked &amp;#34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34; Whenever my kids smell this perfume, they start looking around for me! I absolutely love this perfume and hope they continue to make it. I know variety is the spice of life, but this is one thing that I do not want to change. It has such a nice smell and everyone seems to really like it.</li>
            <li> Very good product, had it before it smells really great &amp; people always ask me who it is. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Loved the service and perfume.</li>
            <li> It more than met what I expected. The size is great! My favorite perfume of all times....&lt;br /&gt;  Theresa</li>
            <li> Thrilled with this purchase &amp; everything was perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother. She loves it and says she gets so many compliments, she asks for it every holiday!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a great price! I love Mackie! My best friend wore it in high school and I fell in love! Couldn&#x27;t find it in any local store. It is a large bottle and a little goes a long way. I will be buying more bottles.</li>
            <li> Just beautiful, wonderful fragrance! Still the same.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in one piece, and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Great service, great price !</li>
            <li> Classic scent that will always be in style.</li>
            <li> Great scent, reasonably priced. Like any scent very personal. Try it and see if it works for you. Not a big loss if it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife wears scents that cost from $20 to $250 a bottle, don&#x27;t get hung up on who the producing house is , just try it and see what you think.</li>
            <li> feels like it is watered down,just not the same.  been using this for 20 yrs.Going to have to find a new perfume</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s reminiscent of Enjoli which I frequently weared in the 80&#x27;s but isn&#x27;t sold in stores only online at a drastically marked up price. Anyway Bob Mackie smells just like it and at an affordable price you just can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> Does not smell the same as buying in store</li>
            <li> Fantastic fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> great product, good price, great condition, item as described, provided with tracking code, highly recommended, everybody likes its smell, though my ability to feel smells is still low after car accident but even I felt this great aroma</li>
            <li> My mom loves this fragrance.  Delivery packaging. Well satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Oh. My. Word.  I think I have found the new love of my life!  Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Safari has been my signature scent for as long as I can remember.  I know Mackie doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Safari, but there must be something in common because my soul produces the same reaction to the first spray of either scent.  The initial blast of Mackie&#x27;s earthy spices seduces me instantly and envelops me in a warm embrace...an unknown, long awaited love affair has now begun with this new-to-me classic.  After the blast, I&#x27;m luxuriating in the most warm and sensual blend of florals - not sweet, but truly floral like actual flowers to my nose - and spices that take their time to develop.  I can&#x27;t believe the incredible longevity and good sillage!  That is rare on my skin.  I don&#x27;t pick up on the fruity notes, but that is OK.  It is perfect as it is.  Also, although I love patchouli, it has a tendency to make me cough...not here.  As the base notes rise up, it is nothing but pure bliss.  I just want to curl up and let this beautiful cloud envelop me completely for hours!  What a dream to hibernate with this incredible juice!  How did I live this long without finding this gem before now?  I have no idea. But I can tell you I will NEVER be without it again if I can possibly help it.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick! Love my perfume.</li>
            <li> Ok....smell doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same. I&#x27;ve been wearing this product for 20 years and I see a difference from the 72.00 price!!</li>
            <li> My favorite.  I ALWAYS get a comment when I wear it.  I have been wearing it for years and can&#x27;t change my fragrance because it just goes with my personality.  I have been given other popular fragrances that are contemporary, but none of them hold a candle to this fragrance.  It&#x27;s Bob Mackie.  Like his designs, it&#x27;s timeless.</li>
            <li> It was just as I expected it to be.  It arrived so quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> I wear this scent everyday and I have for several years. I get complimented on it all the time and asked where to get it.  I almost cannot believe that this bottle of perfume is HALF off on what you would pay in any store.  The package arrived quickly and was packed very nicely. I will definitely be ordering my Mackie from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> My wife orders this all the time. It is the only Toilette Spray my wife will wear and she receives more compliments from people when she does</li>
            <li> Used to love this fragrance but this bottle smells &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; in that it was past it&#x27;s expiration date.</li>
            <li> I ordered it, it came. Not much to comment</li>
            <li> Mackie is a definite 5 to me. I&#x27;m always getting compliments from both men and women  Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived Fast.  Love this perfume.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;This product gets me so many compliments!&lt;br /&gt;It is the most beautiful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The only fragrance that I use.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume and I always get her a bottle for her birthday.&lt;br /&gt;It makes her happy and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance since it&#x27;s debut in the early 90&#x27;s. I have yet to hear anything negative about it and continue to receive compliments on it every time I wear it.....that&#x27;s almost 25 years of compliments! It&#x27;s a classic scent combination.</li>
            <li> My favorite since the 80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I loved wearing this fragrance when it was first introduced...  I have tried other fragrances since this one disappeared from the stores...  imagine my surprise when &amp;#34;surfing&amp;#34; old memories one day -- finding the fragrance on Amazon!!!  I was worried that the scent might be &amp;#34;spoiled&amp;#34; because I imagine this is &amp;#34;new old stock&amp;#34; and I was not sure how it has been stored all these years...  so I bought one bottle and was thrilled to find that it smelled exactly as I remember!!!  I now have six bottles of this fragrance stored in my refrigerator so I know for sure I will have it in the future!!!  I am constantly complimented on my fragrance and agree with the posters who say that men really appreciate it...  that has not changed since the &amp;#34;old days&amp;#34;...  scent is a very hard thing to purchase online if one is not familiar with it to begin with...  I would say that this is a more heavy floral but it is just wonderful to me!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my grandma and she loved it</li>
            <li> I HAVE WORN THIS PERFUME FOR YEARS AND EVERYWHERE I GO, SOMEONE STOPS ME TO ASK WHAT I AM WEARING.  I CAN&#x27;T SMELL IT MYSELF BUT I HAVE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN TELL ME I SMELL TERRIFIC.</li>
            <li> Loves this cologne, and is so happy to be able to find it so available for such a great price!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for 15 years now and I absolutely love it!! I always get compliments! Definitely would recommend beautiful scent that lasts...:)</li>
            <li> This is a powerful white floral scent, heavy on the gardenia. As such, it seems somewhat dated. This is highly subjective, but it strikes me as neither sensual nor professional, and thus I would not have the occasion to wear this.</li>
            <li> I feel the perfume bottle is really old, so I don&#x27;t get the full benefit of the aroma that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes.  My son&#x27;s ex girlfriend introduced me to it about 15 years ago and I just love it.</li>
            <li> Original perfume, not knock off or generic! My favorite perfume for 20 yrs. need to stock up while available~thank you</li>
            <li> This is the best deal for Mackie that I&#x27;ve ever got!</li>
            <li> Nice size for the price and the smell is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the last bottle i got from you, but OK</li>
            <li> It is a good perfume it smells really good i love it.</li>
            <li> Best smelling perfume in town...</li>
            <li> Bob Mackie is precisely what my wife wants and will accept.  She appreciates all of my gifts to her but I wind up returning many of them. She is totally satisfied with this choice. Thanks, Bob</li>
            <li> My wife loves the stuff and can&#x27;t get enough of it.  Anybody sell it by the gallon?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I started wearing this fragrance when I could get it at Dillards.  I was so disappointed when they quit, but now that I have found it again, I am so pleased.  And the price was great.  I not only got myself one but my sister.</li>
            <li> this is the best eau de toilette spray they have around but we can not buy it here that is why I order it I love it will order soon thanks</li>
            <li> No matter where I go if i&#x27;ve used this cologne, someone always compliments the scent and asks what am I wearing.  I&#x27;ve used Mackie for 15 years and I never tire of it&#x27;s scent. ;-)</li>
            <li> Great perfume, hard to find where I live i got it for my mother who loves it more than anything!</li>
            <li> This perfume has been around a long time. I used to wear it years ago, so I purchased it and I still love it!</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i was looking for.  I hope the product stays available forever. spray works fine and the bottle is pretty</li>
            <li> I used to purchase at Dillard&#x27;s but had not in a while. When I decided to look at Amazon for certain perfume choices I found it. The only way I can describe the scent is dark, great for an evening but I will wear anytime.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance on my wife.  Gets me in the mood when I smell it.  Boomchickawowwow!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom. She had been paying over $50 for this same thing. She was so happy to find it for less than $20 on Amazon. This is the only perfume she will wear.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s signature perfume. It is always such a nice fragrance and she gets lots of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I love Bob Mackie after the first hour. It is on the strong side, so spray with caution, especially if someone has fragrance allergies</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Mackie since the beginning.  Still love it!  I get compliments and &amp;#34;where can I purchase it?&amp;#34; questions often.</li>
            <li> Elegant  fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> Always get compliments!</li>
            <li> great! The price and quality of service was better  than expected.</li>
            <li> I have worn Bob Mackie for years - my kids and grandkids recognize me by the scent. Unfortunately it has been discontinued and thus cannot be found in stores so I was extremely happy to learn that I could still get it through Amazon and I will continue to do so as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Great stuff won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> First smelled on a woman in public, had to ask what she was wearing. This has been out a long time but just heard of it. It smells the same on me that it did on her, sometimes that doesn&#x27;t happen. Price was very good, seller was very fast. Would recommend both the perfume and the seller. Do NOT over spray. Husband sneezed in car for 10 minutes, oops!! Hard to describe the scent. Not floral. More woodsy musk to it. Nice big bottle for the price. Came in original box with plastic wrapping.</li>
            <li> Great Product...great price!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, however I did not receive on the scheduled date.</li>
            <li> I use to wear this fragrance years ago, do happy to see I can replenish this through Amozon</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  Can&#x27;t find it very often in stores.</li>
            <li> What can I say, this is my favorite perfume. Its amazing!</li>
            <li> I am henry&#x27;s wife,tried the spray cologne &amp; it works as it  should mention this due to buying one at the mall and spray comes out as a stream not as a fine mist. I love Mackie  dusting powder and cream always will. Thanks for reshipping undamaged products this time.</li>
            <li> Has been my favorite for a long time and it is great to still get it at such a great price!!</li>
            <li> Love this...have ordered it several times.</li>
