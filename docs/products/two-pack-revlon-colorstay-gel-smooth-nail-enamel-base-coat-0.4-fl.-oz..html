            <li>Simply the best base coat I&#x27;ve used and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>For some reason it has been discontinued so naturally I bought 6 bottles on here</li>

Lasts for over a week or 2 no prob.. My natural nail is grown out now looks great.. But I use this so my nails don&#x27;t break and polish lasts without chips.. Cost is next to nothing compared to nail shop and it&#x27;s as easy as polishing nails.. Love this!</li>
