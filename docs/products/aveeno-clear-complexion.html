            <li>BEST PROBLEM SKINCARE ON THE MARKET</li>
            <li>Very pleased!!</li>
            <li>By the end of the week it was perfect.</li>
            <li>I was so happy  to find this product!!!!</li>
            <li>What a great price!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find this awesome soap in stores for some reason.  </li>
            <li>This soap smells so good!</li>
            <li>It smells really good too!</li>
            <li>Great seller.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It works great for my skin &amp; blackheads.</li>
            <li>It was a great bargain at under $3.00 in most places, and I&#x27;m not as happy with the cleansing scrub or pads as I was with the soap.  </li>
            <li>Would not buy again, it does smell good though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good cleansing bar, it takes off layers of makeup without makeup remover or toner getting involved, and it keeps spots and pimples away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, been using it for some 20 years(in the family).  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>more can I say!</li>
            <li>and I think it has helped a bit, better than nothing!</li>
            <li>I wash my face more than I probably should, and this bar is still sticking around!</li>
            <li>I use them with a somewhat abrasive hand scrub - the kind that looks like what you&#x27;d use to remove bugs off the front of your car.  </li>
            <li>But I stumbled up a bar of Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleansing soap at TJMAXX and found it to work wonderfully well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>okay, I must have some kind of hormonal flareup.</li>
            <li>I love this soap for my face; it cleared up all all all all all my acne within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>soap is very creamy and has a wonderful fresh scent.</li>
            <li>And this is coming from someone with allergies who is not fond of most scents.  </li>
            <li>I normally love Aveeno, but this is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s a bar soap, so I can travel with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>On top of it started getting more acne.</li>
            <li>I hope to find more of this online.  </li>
            <li>I had great skin all through high school</li>
            <li>also love that it&#x27;s a BAR- no annoying tubes to squeeze or bottles to pump</li>
            <li>EASY.  </li>
            <li>i dont know if i broke out from the drying or from irritation from an ingredient or the strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this soap, very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be working fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no longer available in my area in bar form.  </li>
            <li>And my face feels really clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Normally, I would have had many pimples and zits in this period of time.</li>
            <li>The Aveeno clear complexion cleansing bar is far the best facial soap out there.  </li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t flaky or dry after washing, and finally, it is clear and beautiful again.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin (more oily than dry) and tend to breakout easily.</li>
            <li>Then when I found out they had a bar I bought it right away.  </li>
            <li>I need to find the right balance for a moisturizer</li>
            <li>Normal or oily skin types should enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I like the aveeno day moisturizer very much so thought will give this soap a try.</li>
            <li>To cut down on the grossness factor I wash my hands with antibacterial soap before touching the bar/washing my face and I make sure the bar is able to dry out after use.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s not all natural, it&#x27;s not fragrence free -</li>
            <li>and ive tried it enough times to be sure.</li>
            <li>I like the pump better for facial use.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this facial cleansing bar.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t relate it to the soap.</li>
            <li>I had tried new face washes but nothing was really helping, I finally asked my sister what she had been using since her skin has been looking so nice</li>
            <li>Aveeno clear complexion cleansing bar leaves my face clean, without the greasy film that some soaps leave on your face.</li>
            <li>Bar soap can be kind of gross, but since I&#x27;m the only one using it I make sure it keeps clean and dry between uses.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap and each bar lasts forever, which is nice because it keeps my costs down!</li>
            <li>The two work seem to work very well together.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon seller for carrying this product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s consistently fit all my needs.  </li>
            <li>I really like to exfoliate my skin</li>
            <li>I think the hydrogen peroxide helps kill the bacteria that may cause acne, and the witch hazel is a gentle astringent - alcohol</li>
            <li>Thank you so much my son needed it</li>
            <li>My husband uses the aveeno face wash and really likes it.</li>
            <li>This works pretty good for occasional use do to a build up on my oily skin but not for everyday use.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re under the skin, they never surface like a zit, they&#x27;re not red like a pimple, they&#x27;re not painful or irritated, they&#x27;re just THERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The older</li>
            <li>Since 2 more soaps were left over and also each and every person skin type and tolerance level are different.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Speedy Delivery, product as advertised, would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>This really helped clear my son&#x27;s acne</li>
            <li>I was glad to be able to purchase several bars on Amazon, even though the price is a rip-off.</li>
            <li>He skin is normal and never had problem with breakouts.</li>
            <li>When I found this 3 pack I thought, WOW!</li>
            <li>My skin is clear, but I do have some acne scars.  </li>
            <li>, I think it helps remove old scars, and this soap is gentle enough to allow me to do that.  </li>
            <li>helps keep the skin clear without overdrying skin and no bleaching</li>
            <li>Just using Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleansing Bar.</li>
            <li>I used the dove sensitive bar of soap for my face in the morning and use moisturizer with spf 15, aveeno or olay.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>ughh this stuff definitely dries my very oily skin out, and this causes breakouts for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to this bar instead, being EXTRA gentle with the washing, and combined with my toner and moisturizer</li>
            <li>Of course, being an adult of some years, I was beside myself.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my face clear of adult acne flareups while leaving my face feeling smooth and well-hydrated, not dry and tight like some soaps.</li>
            <li>About a month ago&lt;br /&gt;I got cheap and bought a different product because it cost about a $1 less.</li>
            <li>He has very oily skin and some minor acne.</li>
            <li>Aveeno clear complexion bar is the only thing that has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li>am using this soap with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>When I used to use this for my face, it never really helped much with my acne, maybe just a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same bar for almost 2 months, and I&#x27;m sure it will last another month at least.</li>
            <li>Finally, I found the clear complexion line at target, but the only thing is I don&#x27;t like the bead things.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a really big problem with acne, but lately I&#x27;ve developed tiny bumps on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>my face cleared right up, including those mysterious little bumps.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent three times as much on liquid facial soaps, only to have them leak in a plane&#x27;s cargo</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it dries out my skin a bit too much (but that is partially my fault for not moisturizing enough).</li>
            <li>I learned after buying this bar, that if you have sensitive skin or trouble with acne, you should try to steer clear of anything in BAR form.</li>

            <li> I learned after buying this bar, that if you have sensitive skin or trouble with acne, you should try to steer clear of anything in BAR form.</li>
            <li> These bars are affordable and last a reasonably long time.  </li>
            <li> other general skin advice, I also apply a cotton ball of hydrogen peroxide and one of witch hazel to my face each morning, and another of witch hazel each night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that this product isn&#x27;t so readily available anymore.</li>
            <li> This works so well on acne prone skin, helps clear up your skin in the matter of a few days and won&#x27;t overdry your skin so your skin won&#x27;t be flakey during the day.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and so I couldn&#x27;t use the soap because it dried it out.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this for as long as I can find it!</li>
            <li> It is ok,doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like some soap in its category.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d describe my skin as both oily and dry.  </li>
            <li> But it made the skin very very dry.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> This product has given a since of relief with acne breakout like none other.</li>
            <li> Not something you could say for the average acne wash or soap.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I usually wash my face with this at night because it has salicylic acid, and a red face during the day is not cute, and I also apply a night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This creamy soap does break down a little messy as you use it over time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but when you can&#x27;t find it in the stores you have to pay what you have to pay.</li>
            <li> is too harsh for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate trying to remember how I got my skin clear, and couldn&#x27;t find this product.  </li>
            <li> usually body washes for blemishes are 2%</li>
            <li> Not one zit or even a small pimple.</li>
            <li> (The only other bar Aveeno makes is the oatmeal formula, but it smells bad and he won&#x27;t use it.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years and started having a hard time finding it in stores</li>
            <li> either way it sucks</li>
            <li> At least not on oily skin like mine.</li>
            <li> stuff works, at least for me, and I will never take the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; route again.</li>
            <li> the grapefruit whatever made my breakouts even worse and not to mention dried up my skin.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not sure if this was the bar&#x27;s fault or if my skin is just having a field day being irritating, but my skin got worse using this product.  </li>
            <li> Skin is so difficult.</li>
            <li> I would get zits all along my cheeks and chin, I was so unhappy.</li>
            <li> Now that this product has been discontinued I am in a mad dash to stalk up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tones of product to treat and control my oily skin and acne that have disappointed and failed me.  </li>
            <li> so b bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Aveeno cleansing bar for over 30 years, and am very disappointed that Aveeno has decided to stop manufacturing it.  </li>
            <li> A 3 pack of soap for under $8 is an insane deal for Aveeno products!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Aveeno clear complexion cleansing bar is far the best facial soap out there.  It prevents pimples and dryness.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was desperate trying to remember how I got my skin clear, and couldn&#x27;t find this product.  I opted for neutrogena which was a total disaster the grapefruit whatever made my breakouts even worse and not to mention dried up my skin.  Finally, I found the clear complexion line at target, but the only thing is I don&#x27;t like the bead things.  Then when I found out they had a bar I bought it right away.  I usually wash my face with this at night because it has salicylic acid, and a red face during the day is not cute, and I also apply a night time moisturizer. I used the dove sensitive bar of soap for my face in the morning and use moisturizer with spf 15, aveeno or olay. My skin is clear, but I do have some acne scars.  For that I am going to try the dermaroller and see if that will get rid of those scars.</li>
            <li> BEST PROBLEM SKINCARE ON THE MARKET</li>
            <li> usually body washes for blemishes are 2% but it seems to be working fine so maybe have a stronger wash for current breakouts and this one for all over/maintenance.  try it out!</li>
            <li> I have a child prone to eczema. When he graduated from Aveeno Baby Wash to bar soap, this is the only bar soap that wouldn&#x27;t cause a skin reaction. (The only other bar Aveeno makes is the oatmeal formula, but it smells bad and he won&#x27;t use it.) Even though it&#x27;s technically an acne soap, and he&#x27;s not using it for acne, he uses it all over, and even washes his hair with it with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it is about Aveeno that makes it work for sensative skin - it&#x27;s not all natural, it&#x27;s not fragrence free - but it works, so we&#x27;ll keep on using it.</li>
            <li> Had been searching in every store for this complexion bar that works so well. Finally decided to look on Amazon and there it was. Excellant price and in stock. Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> Aveeno clear complexion cleansing bar leaves my face clean, without the greasy film that some soaps leave on your face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Aveeno cleansing bar for over 30 years, and am very disappointed that Aveeno has decided to stop manufacturing it.  It was a great bargain at under $3.00 in most places, and I&#x27;m not as happy with the cleansing scrub or pads as I was with the soap.  I was glad to be able to purchase several bars on Amazon, even though the price is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years and started having a hard time finding it in stores so signed up for automatic renewal on amazon.  It helps keep my face clear of adult acne flareups while leaving my face feeling smooth and well-hydrated, not dry and tight like some soaps.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I have used everything from proactive to prescriptions. Aveeno clear complexion bar is the only thing that has ever worked for me. Now that this product has been discontinued I am in a mad dash to stalk up.</li>
            <li> ughh this stuff definitely dries my very oily skin out, and this causes breakouts for me. i dont know if i broke out from the drying or from irritation from an ingredient or the strong fragrance. either way it sucks and ive tried it enough times to be sure.</li>
            <li> Great seller. Great product. I love this soap for my face; it cleared up all all all all all my acne within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Made my wife happy&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say!</li>
            <li> I know everybody&#x27;s skin is different, but this bar is TERRIFIC on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a really big problem with acne, but lately I&#x27;ve developed tiny bumps on my forehead.  No clue what they are- they&#x27;re under the skin, they never surface like a zit, they&#x27;re not red like a pimple, they&#x27;re not painful or irritated, they&#x27;re just THERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using an exfoliating scrub, thinking I might have a clogged pore or something that needed clearing, but that irritated my skin and I broke out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to this bar instead, being EXTRA gentle with the washing, and combined with my toner and moisturizer my face cleared right up, including those mysterious little bumps.  My forehead looks and feels GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it&#x27;s a BAR- no annoying tubes to squeeze or bottles to pump, just open the box, throw the cardboard in the recycling and put the bar in my shower.  EASY.  LOVE IT.  USE IT EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li> Not something you could say for the average acne wash or soap.&lt;br /&gt;This soap is very creamy and has a wonderful fresh scent. And this is coming from someone with allergies who is not fond of most scents.  This creamy soap does break down a little messy as you use it over time.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this soap about 12 days and I have not had another breakout since I started using it. Not one zit or even a small pimple. Normally, I would have had many pimples and zits in this period of time. The older I get the oilier my skin gets.&lt;br /&gt;I am using this soap with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer. The two work seem to work very well together.</li>
            <li> Did not see any result, my pimples spots still remains. Did not like! Would not buy again, it does smell good though.</li>
            <li> It is ok,doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like some soap in its category.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is a little pricey, but when you can&#x27;t find it in the stores you have to pay what you have to pay. It&#x27;s sad that this product isn&#x27;t so readily available anymore.</li>
            <li> When I used to use this for my face, it never really helped much with my acne, maybe just a bit. I now use it for my bacne and I think it has helped a bit, better than nothing! I like the pump better for facial use.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good! And my face feels really clean after using it. I am very pleased with this purchase. My face began clearing up almost immediately!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tones of product to treat and control my oily skin and acne that have disappointed and failed me.  But I stumbled up a bar of Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleansing soap at TJMAXX and found it to work wonderfully well.  So I went to local stores to try to purchase but could not find anywhere.  Thanks to Amazon seller for carrying this product.  This product has given a since of relief with acne breakout like none other.</li>
            <li> If you use it twice a day every day then trust me when i say that it will help your skin. It won&#x27;t do overnight miracles or make your skin look like a magazine model but it will help you remove some blemishes. It smells really good too!</li>
            <li> I learned after buying this bar, that if you have sensitive skin or trouble with acne, you should try to steer clear of anything in BAR form. Now, I&#x27;m not sure if this was the bar&#x27;s fault or if my skin is just having a field day being irritating, but my skin got worse using this product.  I normally love Aveeno, but this is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I adore this bar - it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s consistently fit all my needs.  I&#x27;ve had mild-to-moderate acne issues since middle school, and I&#x27;ve been working over 15 years to try to come up with a concoction that would protect both my skin and my pocket.  These bars are affordable and last a reasonably long time.  I use them with a somewhat abrasive hand scrub - the kind that looks like what you&#x27;d use to remove bugs off the front of your car.  I really like to exfoliate my skin, I think it helps remove old scars, and this soap is gentle enough to allow me to do that.  I also love that it&#x27;s a bar soap, so I can travel with it.  I&#x27;ve spent three times as much on liquid facial soaps, only to have them leak in a plane&#x27;s cargo hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other general skin advice, I also apply a cotton ball of hydrogen peroxide and one of witch hazel to my face each morning, and another of witch hazel each night.  I think the hydrogen peroxide helps kill the bacteria that may cause acne, and the witch hazel is a gentle astringent - alcohol is too harsh for my skin.  I&#x27;m no dermatologist, but this works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d describe my skin as both oily and dry.  I have to use moisturizer every morning or it will crack and peel, but without makeup I get shiny within an hour.  Sigh.  Skin is so difficult.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and have used it for years. It&#x27;s no longer available in my area in bar form.  I prefer the bar over the foam.  It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin.  Tyra also uses it and recommended it on her show.</li>
            <li> my son LOVES it! He has very oily skin and some minor acne. He tried this soap and within two days his skin was already clearing up. By the end of the week it was perfect. You&#x27;d never know that he has oily skin, it evened it out without drying it. My skin is sensitive and so I couldn&#x27;t use the soap because it dried it out. Normal or oily skin types should enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> What do you need to know? It&#x27;s a good cleansing bar, it takes off layers of makeup without makeup remover or toner getting involved, and it keeps spots and pimples away. I&#x27;ve used this bar for years, and I like that I can now order it off Amazon.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good for occasional use do to a build up on my oily skin but not for everyday use. At least not on oily skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I was so happy  to find this product!!!! Thank you so much my son needed it so b bad.</li>
            <li> Ever since I turned 25 my skin has been acting up. I had great skin all through high school so I thought, well maybe it was just &amp;#34;my time&amp;#34; to have break outs. I would get zits all along my cheeks and chin, I was so unhappy. I had tried new face washes but nothing was really helping, I finally asked my sister what she had been using since her skin has been looking so nice and she said, &amp;#34;Aveeno!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I popped on Amazon and did some looking around. When I found this 3 pack I thought, WOW! What a great price! A 3 pack of soap for under $8 is an insane deal for Aveeno products! Bar soap can be kind of gross, but since I&#x27;m the only one using it I make sure it keeps clean and dry between uses. To cut down on the grossness factor I wash my hands with antibacterial soap before touching the bar/washing my face and I make sure the bar is able to dry out after use. I wash my face more than I probably should, and this bar is still sticking around! I&#x27;ve been using the same bar for almost 2 months, and I&#x27;m sure it will last another month at least. I love the scent of this soap, very fresh and clean. My skin isn&#x27;t flaky or dry after washing, and finally, it is clear and beautiful again. I will continue to use this for as long as I can find it! I am so thankful I found something that worked for me, I hope it works for you, too!</li>
            <li> I like the aveeno day moisturizer very much so thought will give this soap a try. But it made the skin very very dry. On top of it started getting more acne. So discontinued using. I got a pack of 3. My husband uses the aveeno face wash and really likes it. Since 2 more soaps were left over and also each and every person skin type and tolerance level are different. We thought he would try using it. But it made him break out immediately. He skin is normal and never had problem with breakouts. So that is it.. We thrashed it and never thought about buying again.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as expected. Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, been using it for some 20 years(in the family).  It cleared up my brothers face back when he was younger.</li>
            <li> This really helped clear my son&#x27;s acne</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this facial cleansing bar. I have combination skin (more oily than dry) and tend to breakout easily. This works so well on acne prone skin, helps clear up your skin in the matter of a few days and won&#x27;t overdry your skin so your skin won&#x27;t be flakey during the day. I use it with the Aveeno Clear Complexion Daily Moisturizer. I 100% recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I hope to find more of this online.  Can&#x27;t find this awesome soap in stores for some reason.  It works great for my skin &amp; blackheads.</li>
            <li> Speedy Delivery, product as advertised, would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> helps keep the skin clear without overdrying skin and no bleaching</li>
            <li> I have been buying this soap for years to use just on my face. About a month ago&lt;br /&gt;I got cheap and bought a different product because it cost about a $1 less. Well,&lt;br /&gt;my acne came back and I am no teen. At first I didn&#x27;t relate it to the soap. I thought, okay, I must have some kind of hormonal flareup. I had one zit on my upper left cheek, then one on my forehad, then one on my chin by my mouth, then another&lt;br /&gt;on my forehead, need I go on? Of course, being an adult of some years, I was beside myself. I decided to buy Aveeno again and chuck the cheaper soap.&lt;br /&gt;Know what? Acne cleared up like that! Just using Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleansing Bar. Overnight the zits stopped. I can now go out without makeup if I want and feel comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff works, at least for me, and I will never take the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; route again.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap and each bar lasts forever, which is nice because it keeps my costs down! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it dries out my skin a bit too much (but that is partially my fault for not moisturizing enough). I need to find the right balance for a moisturizer and I&#x27;ll go back to using this twice a day as I was. For reference, I have oily, acne-prone skin and it definitely gave me a clearer complexion over time.</li>
