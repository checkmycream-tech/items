            <li>Good quality,  but very fragile.</li>
            <li>But after using them they are fantastic and worth every penny.</li>

            <li>A friend recommended them and she was right.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, what I really like about these glass nail files is that they are easier to use than the metal ones that we normally use and the edges are so SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely noticed less breakage and the cuticle stick is EXCELLENT for toes!</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple of passes and the nail is smooth and strong.  </li>
            <li>and it made my nails smooth and without the struggle of bending and breaking like normal nail files.</li>

            <li>I first ordered a single file and loved it so much I ordered the set.</li>

            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>They are sleek, colorful and file down edges really nicely.</li>
            <li>the files work better than any other I&#x27;ve ever used , smoothes edges fast and fabulously.</li>
            <li>After using these, I&#x27;ll never use any other kind of file.</li>
            <li>They deliver a superior result in very little time.  </li>
            <li>The files work nicely to sand down callused finger and toe pads as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a guy and due to some health issues my nails peel and crack very easily.</li>
            <li>This file does not leave any rough edges which makes my nails smoother and more consistent looking.  </li>

            <li>I really do like these files.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this set</li>
            <li>These files leave such a smooth edge that my nails are no longer snagging on something every time I turn around, and scratching into my skin when I itch.</li>
            <li>Not as much grit as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>I used to like diamond nail files, but you can&#x27;t buy the real thing anymore.  </li>
            <li>I really brittle nails, and</li>
            <li>They are made of high quality glass and the colors just shine!</li>
            <li>really like the colors, the quantity, and the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very much,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He absolutely hates mittens and gets them off no matter what trick we try to keep them on and always ends up scratching himself.</li>
            <li>I also really like the cuticle pusher.  </li>
            <li>They are the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>So much nicer on the nails than an emery board</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to continue to have pretty nails and in much less time now :)</li>
            <li>I constantly use gel polish which doesn&#x27;t allow nails to breathe and so over time have become very soft and  will easily split or fray at the edges.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also nice to have the little pencil-shaped tool for getting into places that normal files don&#x27;t get to.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a little concerned about popping one into my purse as i&#x27;m pretty sure it could shatter or chip (like a ceramic knife).  </li>
            <li>But probably the tool I have used the most and could not live without is the cuticle pusher!!!</li>
            <li>I like them a lot better than Emory boards because they don&#x27;t have that sulfuric burning smell when you really get down to filing your nails.</li>
            <li>Having previously used one of the Bona Fide Beauty nail files I expected that I would end up with great results.</li>
            <li>Better than average performance.</li>
            <li>Eveyone I gave one to wants more, so, the only suggestion I can make is to put a design of some sort on the handle and maybe give a choice for the middle size with a rounded tip</li>
            <li>Really a new experience!</li>
            <li>One of the main benefits of this product is that it does not damage your nails.</li>
            <li>I love that these are one solid piece, which makes disinfecting/cleaning them very simply and thorough.</li>
            <li>She likes things that are high quality and that stand out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>These Czech Glass nail files are my first purchase from Bona Fide Beauty and certainly won&#x27;t be the last!</li>
            <li>Unless it says &amp;#34;Czech&amp;#34; glass--don&#x27;t be fooled--you won&#x27;t get a better LONG lasting nail file!</li>
            <li>No longer do I have to struggle with the rubber ones or risk more damage with the harsh metal ones.</li>
            <li>I am going to reorder a few more sets &amp; keep one for myself.</li>
            <li>They are easily cleaned and they don&#x27;t wear down either.</li>
            <li>Still works but wanted a new one.</li>
            <li>I recently heard of glass nail files and was interested in trying one.  </li>
            <li>was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this file.</li>
            <li>This set has everything I needed in order to have nails that look professionally done.</li>
            <li>After my teen daughter telling me how much gentler glass files are your nails I decided to research which one to purchase.</li>
            <li>Gentle on thin nails, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and do not create peeling or ragged edges like emery boards or other files do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe, because when you look at them (and feel them) they seem smooth.  </li>
            <li>I had an old one from China and there is a very definite difference between the two.  </li>
            <li>Feels like its not filing but be careful you can take too much off.</li>
            <li>it is hard to get them smooth enough not to catch on things and tear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ll be using them for a long, long time!</li>
            <li>The foot file is lovely on the skin and doesn&#x27;t take off so much skin as to be dangerous (like some of the metal files can).</li>
            <li>Each of the pieces come in individual plastic sleeves (white on the back and clear on the front).</li>
            <li>Usually I am forced to use a buffer following regular filing or filing after a breakage, but with these I don&#x27;t need a buffer and the nail is smooth.</li>
            <li>MY newborn inherited my thick fingernails that also, might I add, grow really quickly.  </li>
            <li>When I did file them with other files I always had to file them really low in order for them to even look decent.</li>

            <li> I love that they came in their own plastic holder that I can keep in my purse.</li>

            <li> Perfect for either the low maintenance or high maintenance gal.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought the price for nail files was way high.</li>
            <li> One side is great for removing the gunk from your finger and toenails, and the other is perfect for gently pushing back your cuticles.</li>
            <li> Came on time definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using Czech glass files &amp; I love it.  </li>
            <li> She is thrilled with her new Czech glass files.</li>
            <li> They file quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Super smooth finish...</li>
            <li> No more wasting time with old nail files and the breaking and having to buy new ones so often cause these glass ones are the best and great quality.</li>
            <li> just right!).</li>
            <li> Good quality,  but very fragile.</li>
            <li> But after using them they are fantastic and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Bona Fide Beauty sent them out super fast and followed up to make sure all went well with delivery.</li>
            <li> First time users go easy as your nail will get shorter &amp;#60;quicker!&amp;#62; before you know it.</li>
            <li> Came well packaged and quickly delivered-</li>
            <li> Arrived quick.</li>
            <li> and they were super.</li>
            <li> I love them for myself as well as I like to keep my nails long, but No longer worry about poking or scratching as the tips of my nails are very smooth.</li>
            <li> I never bothered with cuticles before and the cuticle tool makes it so fast and easy, I have started doing them.  </li>
            <li> Fast service, easy to order and well packaged.</li>
            <li> The most gentle, efficient &amp; high quality file you will ever use!!</li>
            <li> The grain is fine and it is gentle on my nails.</li>
            <li> Cuts very well, leaves a silky smooth edge.</li>
            <li> Am so glad to have them as my nails are troublesome and need frequent attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They leave my nails feeling soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> ; look.. Love the professional feel of my nails.  </li>
            <li> The glass makes them easy to clean and so far none of the material has changed.</li>
            <li> The large one is great for my feet, no worrying about puncturing myself with a sharp tip!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended them and she was right.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, what I really like about these glass nail files is that they are easier to use than the metal ones that we normally use and the edges are so SMOOTH!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed less breakage and the cuticle stick is EXCELLENT for toes!</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of passes and the nail is smooth and strong.  </li>
            <li> and it made my nails smooth and without the struggle of bending and breaking like normal nail files.</li>
            <li> They are super long lasting and do a great job.</li>
            <li> I first ordered a single file and loved it so much I ordered the set.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews about this 3 piece Czech Glass Nail File, I&#x27;m so tempted to order one for myself right away.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They are really nice files and they can&#x27;t absorb any water so one doesn&#x27;t have to worry about getting it wet and having to toss it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>

            <li> i love having the big one for sanding my toenails.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> They are sleek, colorful and file down edges really nicely.</li>
            <li> the files work better than any other I&#x27;ve ever used , smoothes edges fast and fabulously.</li>
            <li> After using these, I&#x27;ll never use any other kind of file.</li>
            <li> They deliver a superior result in very little time.  </li>
            <li> The files work nicely to sand down callused finger and toe pads as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a guy and due to some health issues my nails peel and crack very easily.</li>
            <li> This file does not leave any rough edges which makes my nails smoother and more consistent looking.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like be them so much</li>
            <li> I recommend these highly!</li>
            <li> They were sent immediately and arrived very promptly.  </li>
            <li> I really do like these files.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this set</li>
            <li> These files leave such a smooth edge that my nails are no longer snagging on something every time I turn around, and scratching into my skin when I itch.</li>
            <li> Not as much grit as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> I used to like diamond nail files, but you can&#x27;t buy the real thing anymore.  </li>
            <li> I really brittle nails, and</li>
            <li> They are made of high quality glass and the colors just shine!</li>
            <li> really like the colors, the quantity, and the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you very much,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He absolutely hates mittens and gets them off no matter what trick we try to keep them on and always ends up scratching himself.</li>
            <li> I also really like the cuticle pusher.  </li>
            <li> They are the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So much nicer on the nails than an emery board</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to continue to have pretty nails and in much less time now :)</li>
            <li> I constantly use gel polish which doesn&#x27;t allow nails to breathe and so over time have become very soft and  will easily split or fray at the edges.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also nice to have the little pencil-shaped tool for getting into places that normal files don&#x27;t get to.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a little concerned about popping one into my purse as i&#x27;m pretty sure it could shatter or chip (like a ceramic knife).  </li>
            <li> But probably the tool I have used the most and could not live without is the cuticle pusher!!!</li>
            <li> I like them a lot better than Emory boards because they don&#x27;t have that sulfuric burning smell when you really get down to filing your nails.</li>
            <li> Having previously used one of the Bona Fide Beauty nail files I expected that I would end up with great results.</li>
            <li> Better than average performance.</li>
            <li> Eveyone I gave one to wants more, so, the only suggestion I can make is to put a design of some sort on the handle and maybe give a choice for the middle size with a rounded tip</li>
            <li> Really a new experience!</li>
            <li> One of the main benefits of this product is that it does not damage your nails.</li>
            <li> I love that these are one solid piece, which makes disinfecting/cleaning them very simply and thorough.</li>
            <li> She likes things that are high quality and that stand out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These Czech Glass nail files are my first purchase from Bona Fide Beauty and certainly won&#x27;t be the last!</li>
            <li> Unless it says &amp;#34;Czech&amp;#34; glass--don&#x27;t be fooled--you won&#x27;t get a better LONG lasting nail file!</li>
            <li> No longer do I have to struggle with the rubber ones or risk more damage with the harsh metal ones.</li>
            <li> I am going to reorder a few more sets &amp; keep one for myself.</li>
            <li> They are easily cleaned and they don&#x27;t wear down either.</li>
            <li> Still works but wanted a new one.</li>
            <li> I recently heard of glass nail files and was interested in trying one.  </li>
            <li> was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this file.</li>
            <li> This set has everything I needed in order to have nails that look professionally done.</li>
            <li> After my teen daughter telling me how much gentler glass files are your nails I decided to research which one to purchase.</li>
            <li> Gentle on thin nails, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and do not create peeling or ragged edges like emery boards or other files do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe, because when you look at them (and feel them) they seem smooth.  </li>
            <li> I had an old one from China and there is a very definite difference between the two.  </li>
            <li> Feels like its not filing but be careful you can take too much off.</li>
            <li> it is hard to get them smooth enough not to catch on things and tear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ll be using them for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> The foot file is lovely on the skin and doesn&#x27;t take off so much skin as to be dangerous (like some of the metal files can).</li>
            <li> Each of the pieces come in individual plastic sleeves (white on the back and clear on the front).</li>
            <li> Usually I am forced to use a buffer following regular filing or filing after a breakage, but with these I don&#x27;t need a buffer and the nail is smooth.</li>
            <li> MY newborn inherited my thick fingernails that also, might I add, grow really quickly.  </li>
            <li> When I did file them with other files I always had to file them really low in order for them to even look decent.</li>
            <li> This nail file set contains 3 different sized files that range from small to large, and a nail pick.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a foot file for a long time now, finally found one online.</li>
            <li> Lost one and the other 2 finely got broken.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed how much the emery boards and metal files would leave my nails looking dull.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t had them long</li>
            <li> Emery boards left my nails rough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the biggest one on my heel edges to see if that takes the rough skin off since it&#x27;s a bit too big for my toes.</li>
            <li> and it arrived only a few days later, used it that same day</li>
            <li> They are so smooth and the grit is so fine that not only did they file the length to less dangerous levels with little to no pressure, but the tip of the nail stayed &amp;#34; sealed&amp;#34; meaning there were no more mishaps with scratching his face or poking himself with jagged edges.</li>
            <li> files are gentle enough for little fingers and tough enough to tackle stubborn man nails.</li>
            <li> The files work wet or dry.</li>
            <li> These file my nails way smoother than regular files and with less effort.</li>
            <li> I found that when I used a metal nail file or an emery board it was always rough on my nails.</li>
            <li> But when you file your nails, they remove the rough spots and give a smoother finish than my &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; file did.  </li>
            <li> unlike some of my other items.</li>
            <li> Will be checking out other products.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure i&#x27;ll ever need replacements, but if i do, i&#x27;m coming back here.</li>
            <li> It took me a minute to do all my fingernails and I&#x27;m used to taking at least 10 minutes with regular nail files.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never go back to using those harsh emery boards nail files again!!</li>
            <li> They would bend and crack under the thick harsh grain of regular files.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My brittle nails already have less breakage.</li>
            <li> The glass file doesn&#x27;t rip up the nail edges as other files are prone to do, and I no longer have to be diligent to to file in one direction and then over the tip to close out raw edges.  </li>
            <li> Shapes with little effort or pressure.</li>
            <li> I am going to give a few of these files for xmas presents.</li>
            <li> After a few attempts at clipping his nails with the baby clippers (that almost resulted in injury)</li>
            <li> they feel like they mean business.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick and tired with the traditional metal and board nail files because they get blunt and dusty after each use.  </li>
            <li> i have very hard nails...</li>
            <li> I hated how worn and terrible my emery boards, metal files, and buffers would look after a few uses and how difficult it was to clean them.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this nail file! So smooth and even.  I had an old one from China and there is a very definite difference between the two.  This one is great!</li>
            <li> The work great and last forever.</li>
            <li> I have this nails and filing then has always been an issue. They would bend and crack under the thick harsh grain of regular files.&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed the comments of this nail file and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this file. The grain is fine and it is gentle on my nails. Since using this product I have noticed fewer cracks and my nails are even.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> These files are magnificent.  Also this is a great package for the price...it&#x27;s like getting two pieces free.  They are made to be handled lady like.</li>
            <li> Everything they claimed it was.  I do my own gel nails and needed something for shaping.  This is definitely a quality product.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and I love these mail files. They feel great on the nails.</li>
            <li> This nail file set contains 3 different sized files that range from small to large, and a nail pick. They each come in their own plastic casing to allow for easy storage, this comes in handy for me so I don&#x27;t lose them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These files are gentle enough for little fingers and tough enough to tackle stubborn man nails. They are sleek, colorful and file down edges really nicely. I like them a lot better than Emory boards because they don&#x27;t have that sulfuric burning smell when you really get down to filing your nails. They do not break apart when I use them, and they are fine when my nails are a bit damp. The files work nicely to sand down callused finger and toe pads as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slender manicure stick has 2 matte sides for easy gripping. One side is great for removing the gunk from your finger and toenails, and the other is perfect for gently pushing back your cuticles. These tools keep my nails looking their best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Files provided in return for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Everything was as described. Fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like be them so much the colors are perfect and I use them on my acrylic nails and jamberry nail shields.</li>
            <li> I have never used glass files before but these are wonderful.  I love them, and the glass manicure stick is so great.  I never would have imagined they would be better than diamond files, but they are gentler on my nails but just as effective.  I recommend these highly!</li>
            <li> This nail file is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Doesn&#x27;t break and easy to clean. Came on time definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> These Czech Glass nail files are my first purchase from Bona Fide Beauty and certainly won&#x27;t be the last! I love the bright colors and they work amazingly well! My nails feel very smooth, what a difference from Emory boards.</li>
            <li> Good quality,  but very fragile.</li>
            <li> what i wanted at a good price and it came quickly and the follow up email was among the best i&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li> My last ones lasted 8 years.  Still works but wanted a new one.</li>
            <li> I recently heard of glass nail files and was interested in trying one.  I will be using these in the future instead of the paper ones from the beauty supply store.  This file does not leave any rough edges which makes my nails smoother and more consistent looking.  I defintely would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the files.The file for the feet is great.Will tell all my friends about them. Thank You</li>
            <li> Love them! Came well packaged and quickly delivered- unlike some of my other items. They file so smooth! Love the cuticle pusher as well! Going to buy this as a Christmas gifts this year!</li>
            <li> These are fantastic files - very finely made and easy to use.  A friend recommended them and she was right.  They were sent immediately and arrived very promptly.  Am so glad to have them as my nails are troublesome and need frequent attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lady Cinnamon</li>
            <li> Love these nail files will never buy emery boards again just rinse off when you are done they worked great</li>
            <li> Great product,  I love it</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Better than average performance. Will be checking out other products.</li>
            <li> Great files, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Filed my nails perfectly!</li>
            <li> Everything was fine. Thank you. JiSun Bartels</li>
            <li> I really do like these files.  Much better than the emery board type.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for the price! Fast delivery. Unless it says &amp;#34;Czech&amp;#34; glass--don&#x27;t be fooled--you won&#x27;t get a better LONG lasting nail file! First time users go easy as your nail will get shorter &amp;#60;quicker!&amp;#62; before you know it. You&#x27;ll never go back to using those harsh emery boards nail files again!!</li>
            <li> Works great, and really pretty color design. Will buy more for gifts!</li>
            <li> After using these, I&#x27;ll never use any other kind of file. These are superb!</li>
            <li> This is my second set of files. I first ordered a single file and loved it so much I ordered the set. I showed them to my sister and she loves them too. They seem like they will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> These are great! The various sizes make them convenient to stash around the house.</li>
            <li> I came across these from Amazon Recommendations and so glad I bought them. They haven&#x27;t had them long but I will never go back to a regular file to trim my nails again. They are easily cleaned and they don&#x27;t wear down either. My brittle nails already have less breakage. But probably the tool I have used the most and could not live without is the cuticle pusher!!! No longer do I have to struggle with the rubber ones or risk more damage with the harsh metal ones. Try it with a drop of cuticle removal lotion and it is just amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to start doing my own pedicures but didn&#x27;t have the right tools to do it. Having previously used one of the Bona Fide Beauty nail files I expected that I would end up with great results. My expectations were met and I ended up having healthy looking toe-nails to match my healthy nails. One of the main benefits of this product is that it does not damage your nails. I found that when I used a metal nail file or an emery board it was always rough on my nails. I also noticed how much the emery boards and metal files would leave my nails looking dull. Another recurring problem that I experienced with my nails was splitting. When I did file them with other files I always had to file them really low in order for them to even look decent. After using this product I have seen improvements in the overall health of my nails. My nails don&#x27;t split anymore, there is now a shine to both my nails and toe-nails, and I am able to shape my nails the way that I want them. They are easy to store and especially very easy to clean. I hated how worn and terrible my emery boards, metal files, and buffers would look after a few uses and how difficult it was to clean them. Thanks to this set it is no longer a concern for me.  Since I already own one of the nail files I can say that this product does have durability. My nail file still looks just as good as when I first got it. This set has everything I needed in order to have nails that look professionally done. The quality of this set is very amazing and is worth giving it a try. If you don&#x27;t purchase it for yourself it is a nice gift to purchase for someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review. This in no way had any effect on my opinion or rating of this product**</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of these files.  I&#x27;ve had others that were a joke.  The service was great as well.</li>
            <li> These files work so well.  It&#x27;s hard to believe, because when you look at them (and feel them) they seem smooth.  But when you file your nails, they remove the rough spots and give a smoother finish than my &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; file did.  The set was good, because I can have a file for my purse, my desk, and my manicure set.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these nail files.  They are super long lasting and do a great job.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I honestly thought the price for nail files was way high. But after using them they are fantastic and worth every penny. I am a guy and due to some health issues my nails peel and crack very easily. These files leave such a smooth edge that my nails are no longer snagging on something every time I turn around, and scratching into my skin when I itch. I never bothered with cuticles before and the cuticle tool makes it so fast and easy, I have started doing them.  I know what to give the ladies in my life this Christmas.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail files I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought a set several years ago from QVC but broke the pedicure file so this is a replacement. It&#x27;s the best file BY FAR for my cracked heels.</li>
            <li> The nail files made from Czech glass are the best nail files I&#x27;ve ever owned and they actually last after multiple uses.</li>
            <li> These are great files.  They are just as described and I love them.  Now I can have a file in all the places I need one.</li>
            <li> Seem ok.  Not as much grit as I had hoped.  Arrived in a timely fashion and are nice looking.</li>
            <li> Good packaging -- arrived promptly and intact. They&#x27;re a good size and a good grit (not too intense, not too fine.... just right!).</li>
            <li> Perfect! I will get great use out of the files. I love that they came in their own plastic holder that I can keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> They are really nice files and they can&#x27;t absorb any water so one doesn&#x27;t have to worry about getting it wet and having to toss it. They are of very nice quality and the best part is the file never wears down and one doesn&#x27;t have to replace them when they get old. I would suggest anyone to get them and stop waisting money on files you have to trash . They even come in some really cute colors and have their own case.</li>
            <li> They work Great! Great price!!!</li>
            <li> Cuts very well, leaves a silky smooth edge. Feels like its not filing but be careful you can take too much off. This file is injury free u don&#x27;t end up poking yourself. I am going to give a few of these files for xmas presents.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick. Great files and pretty too. Worked great on my natural nails and on my jamberry nail wraps.</li>
            <li> These files are great! They leave my nails feeling soft and smooth!  Awesome product, super fast shipping, highly recommend this seller!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> These are amazing files. Having a multi-pack allows me to have one in my bedroom, in my office and in my car (and two to spare). They file quickly and smoothly.  They&#x27;re lovely and although I don&#x27;t anticipate needing more anytime soon - when I do I will be reordering these ones.</li>
            <li> These work great!  Love the multiple sizes.</li>
            <li> Using this for one week. At this point I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with these nail and toe files.  They deliver a superior result in very little time.  and they are beautiful to look at, too.</li>
            <li> Gentle on thin nails, easy to use. Quality product!</li>
            <li> These files work better than any metal file.  Plus, they&#x27;re red, white &amp; blue.</li>
            <li> This are very nice. I had another set and I dropped the largest one, so I was very excited to see these. I love the glass files and they are also easy to clean with just soap and water. My favorite files.  LOVE THEM</li>
            <li> I used to like diamond nail files, but you can&#x27;t buy the real thing anymore.  I really brittle nails, and it is hard to get them smooth enough not to catch on things and tear.  These were amazing.  Just the slightest touch and my mails were smoother than they had been in years.  The texture is very fine.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found these.  The files are thicker than a metal file, and thought it might be a problem, but it hasn&#x27;t been.</li>
            <li> Great nail files!  Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this on sale for an honest review and now I see what makes glass nail files so much better! I used this as soon as I got it and it made my nails smooth and without the struggle of bending and breaking like normal nail files. It took me a minute to do all my fingernails and I&#x27;m used to taking at least 10 minutes with regular nail files. No more wasting time with old nail files and the breaking and having to buy new ones so often cause these glass ones are the best and great quality. Can&#x27;t wait to continue to have pretty nails and in much less time now :)</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Are Awesome! I received the set of 3 files and 1 cuticle remover. They are made of high quality glass and the colors just shine! The smallest file will be great for use on the motorcycle, I can just toss it in the tool pouch and have it any time I need it. The large one is great for my feet, no worrying about puncturing myself with a sharp tip! The medium is fantastic for home manicures. I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ll be using them for a long, long time!</li>
            <li> Love these files.  Bought some years ago.  Lost one and the other 2 finely got broken.  So glad I could purchase more.  Best I have ever used.  Fast service, easy to order and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Arrived yesterday and I&#x27;m so pleased. Not only is the quality exceptional, the price is great.</li>
            <li> i have very hard nails...i even wear out the metal files.  I&#x27;ve bought glass files before, but they wore out, too (and they weren&#x27;t very effective when they were new either).  i was told that Czech glass would last longer.  i tried these out...and they&#x27;re wonderful.  they have a nice grit to them...they feel like they mean business.  i love having the big one for sanding my toenails.  it&#x27;s also nice to have the little pencil-shaped tool for getting into places that normal files don&#x27;t get to.  i&#x27;m a little concerned about popping one into my purse as i&#x27;m pretty sure it could shatter or chip (like a ceramic knife).  however, all-in-all this was a great buy: i  really like the colors, the quantity, and the price.  i&#x27;m not sure i&#x27;ll ever need replacements, but if i do, i&#x27;m coming back here.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using Czech glass files &amp; I love it.  I get a gel manicure once a month and need to file my nails in between the appointments.  Emery boards left my nails rough so I won&#x27;t use them again.  This glass file leaves my nails smooth &amp; clean,  I am very pleased with this product!  I&#x27;ll give two of it to my daughter who will appreciate it.  Thank you for such an EXCELLENT product!</li>
            <li> Awesome set-  As beautiful as they are functional!  The best files you can buy, and they are elegant looking!  Bought 2 sets &amp; have already given every file away except the one I use. (Every friend that I showed them to, wanted one!). I am going to reorder a few more sets &amp; keep one for myself. The most gentle, efficient &amp; high quality file you will ever use!!</li>
            <li> Great glass nail files at a great price. Perfect for either the low maintenance or high maintenance gal.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  Great glass nail files of all sizes!  Does a better job than metal files!</li>
            <li> I love your files!  They make great gifts. Eveyone I gave one to wants more, so, the only suggestion I can make is to put a design of some sort on the handle and maybe give a choice for the middle size with a rounded tip also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat and Dan Wiles</li>
            <li> MY newborn inherited my thick fingernails that also, might I add, grow really quickly.  He absolutely hates mittens and gets them off no matter what trick we try to keep them on and always ends up scratching himself. After a few attempts at clipping his nails with the baby clippers (that almost resulted in injury) i decided I would only use nail files.  I already had these on hand and went to work on his claws while he slept.  They are so smooth and the grit is so fine that not only did they file the length to less dangerous levels with little to no pressure, but the tip of the nail stayed &amp;#34; sealed&amp;#34; meaning there were no more mishaps with scratching his face or poking himself with jagged edges. I love them for myself as well as I like to keep my nails long, but No longer worry about poking or scratching as the tips of my nails are very smooth. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed less breakage and the cuticle stick is EXCELLENT for toes!</li>
            <li> After my teen daughter telling me how much gentler glass files are your nails I decided to research which one to purchase. I made a great choice! I actually bought two, as I was so impressed reading about them I decided I needed one also. These are a nice size and fit comfortably in my hand. Best of all, my nails felt nice and smooth after using this file. I have no doubt we will both get many years of use from our Czech Glass files.</li>
            <li> Great file! Works very quickly and does not split my nails. I lik the fact that there are different sizes.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic set.  The files are very different from any others I have used.  It only takes a couple of passes and the nail is smooth and strong.  I also really like the cuticle pusher.  It is very gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery of a great set of high quality files.</li>
            <li> Love these files.  They are the real deal.  They are hands down the BEST to use on your nails.  Super smooth finish... Very gentle and do not create peeling or ragged edges like emery boards or other files do.  I will never use another nail file again.  I&#x27;ve bought several to give to friends and family. Bona Fide Beauty sent them out super fast and followed up to make sure all went well with delivery. Excellent buying experience all the way around.</li>
            <li> This is a great manicure set. Each of the pieces come in individual plastic sleeves (white on the back and clear on the front). The files work wet or dry. They glass is incredibly sturdy and handles being dropped, carried in a cluttered purse, etc. The foot file is lovely on the skin and doesn&#x27;t take off so much skin as to be dangerous (like some of the metal files can). It can be used in the shower, as well, without worrying about rusting. I love that these are one solid piece, which makes disinfecting/cleaning them very simply and thorough. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully on my fingernails.  I constantly use gel polish which doesn&#x27;t allow nails to breathe and so over time have become very soft and  will easily split or fray at the edges.  The glass file doesn&#x27;t rip up the nail edges as other files are prone to do, and I no longer have to be diligent to to file in one direction and then over the tip to close out raw edges.  I&#x27;ve had another glass file before and didn&#x27;t like the feel of it, but decided to try the Czech Glass file because of the great reviews.  Really glad I did.  I&#x27;m going to try the biggest one on my heel edges to see if that takes the rough skin off since it&#x27;s a bit too big for my toes.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a foot file for a long time now, finally found one online. Ordered one and it arrived only a few days later, used it that same day and I Love It!!! Feet feel amazing and the service was great!</li>
            <li> I bought these fancy and interesting nail files for my girlfriend. She likes things that are high quality and that stand out. So when I Saw them I knew she would love it and she did! My reward was a smooth and relaxing manicure and pedicure. I even got to enjoy them before she did :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, what I really like about these glass nail files is that they are easier to use than the metal ones that we normally use and the edges are so SMOOTH! These file my nails way smoother than regular files and with less effort. I also think this is very great for the price, cost just $12.97 when I purchased and I got the free manicure stick with the set of 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girl friend is hiding it from her sisters because she doesn&#x27;t want to share it with anyone else. These nail files are not just durable and file smooth but they are also fancy, the colors are attractive and for her its something that she doesn&#x27;t mind to take out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to say thanks to Bona Fide Beauty for this amazing glass nail file and I will be ordering some more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and is really a beautiful set--works great!!</li>
            <li> Love this set of nail files!</li>
            <li> I already own a set of these files, and they are the best files I have ever used. They shape and smooth nails without ripping or damage, and work better then emery boards or metal files. I love that they are washable. My favorite tool is the cuticle stick, it is awesome and perfect, and makes the area around cuticle look great.</li>
            <li> These nail files are the best I&#x27;ve ever had. They make very quick work of filing and leave a smooth edge. These are very nice files.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, 100% recommend .! Best combo ever</li>
            <li> I found these files lived up to expectations, very precise, clean.  They do a  thorough job without having a lot of experience with glass files, they file smooth and easy, leaving a &amp;#34;well groomed&amp;#34; look.. Love the professional feel of my nails.  Happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and product is nice.</li>
            <li> I find these files to be remarkably easy on my nails, not at all course like others. Usually I am forced to use a buffer following regular filing or filing after a breakage, but with these I don&#x27;t need a buffer and the nail is smooth. The glass makes them easy to clean and so far none of the material has changed. I love them! Really a new experience!</li>
            <li> Great product and it works well. I used one of these files while applying Jamberry nail wraps and they were super. Definitely recommend these files. They were well protected for shipping and arrived intact and on time.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this purchase.  The nail files are beautiful and excellent quality...as promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the set.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife. She is thrilled with her new Czech glass files. I also gave them a try. What an improvement over Emory boards or metal files. Leaves nails very smooth. Shapes with little effort or pressure. Highly recommended. Fast shipping. An excellent shopping experience.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some real nice elegant nail files.  After reading all the positive reviews about this 3 piece Czech Glass Nail File, I&#x27;m so tempted to order one for myself right away.  I&#x27;m sick and tired with the traditional metal and board nail files because they get blunt and dusty after each use.  I am giving this set a try and remain a star till my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Love these!! So much nicer on the nails than an emery board and they last forever. I only replaced mine because I lost the one I had after 3 or 4 years.</li>
            <li> Awesome set of files.  Funny I hadn&#x27;t heart of glass files before these.  I am so happy to have them...they are great.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> These are very special files.  I love them and use them for myself and my kitty.</li>
            <li> WOW, this Bona fide Czech crystal glass nail file kit is awesome , I was impressed with the look and the files work better than any other I&#x27;ve ever used , smoothes edges fast and fabulously. I  absolutely love it , what a great gift idea too . It&#x27;s an awesome find on Amazon.com</li>
