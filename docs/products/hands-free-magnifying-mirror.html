            <li>She has found it usefull and a good vallue, otherwise I can not commet on its value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have purchased a great deal of merchandise from Amazon and have always been pleased.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this one &amp; I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>The mirror is inexpensive and feels a bit flimsy, but at this price is easy to replace if damaged, and therefore was a great find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of flimsy as it hangs on your neck</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this kind of mirror for years.  </li>
            <li>I liked it an wasexcited to find it</li>
            <li>It seems kind of off balance, and swings around a lot.  </li>
            <li>Company was very easy to deal with however.</li>
            <li>This mirror was made of plastic, it was very cheap and broke within 2 weeks after I received it.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It is very cheap.  </li>
            <li>If anyone knows of a better product I would appreciate it.</li>
            <li>They made these years ago and I have not been able to find one.  </li>
            <li>and I really am enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find this mirror.  </li>
            <li>You used to be able to find round-the-neck mirrors any place that sold cosmetics and hair care items.  </li>
            <li>Anyway I was glad to get this one.  </li>
            <li>rather than the more costly one.</li>
            <li>OK, I had to tighten the screw.  </li>
            <li>She loves the mirror but just wishes it was constructed better.</li>
            <li>I bought a nicer metal version of this for my mom years ago &amp; out of EVERYTHING she owns she uses the neck mirror the most.</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t Rucci make a more durable product?  </li>
            <li>Glad to find this item...can&#x27;t seem to find in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>and up price for one and also read too many negatives in the comments for something</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>I should have known better.</li>
            <li>Amazon, you can do better than that.</li>
            <li>We should have been more mindful of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they should use a nut and add a washer with, each with a crimp in it, to provide a better hold...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Therefore, for at home, I hope to get another more substantial one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was cheap plastic and broke right away!!!</li>
            <li>She is delighted and I am a hero, as it is exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>I wanted a mirror that I could see the back of my head and this just doesn&#x27;t work very good for me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay cheap made</li>
            <li>The plastic is much more flimsy and light weight.  </li>
            <li>This is a very helpful neck mirror - that&#x27;s the good news.  </li>
            <li>I can adjust it around my neck to get the angle I want, but the plastic arm that goes around your neck breaks off too easy if you use it a lot</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons: flimsy plastic(seems too easy to break plastic neck</li>
            <li>I order two or three at one time because they break easy</li>
            <li>but overtighening is easy to do.</li>
            <li>I realize it is cheap</li>
            <li>This mirror really comes in handy when you need both hands to work with.</li>
            <li>It was made of cheap plastic, but I thought it would serve the purpose.</li>
            <li>The mirror flips around too freely.  </li>
            <li>For years, my 87 year-old mother has used mirrors that hang around her neck to fix her hair, having both hands free.  </li>
            <li>The stand was sturdy and felt comfortable</li>
            <li>It was cheap and acted like it.  </li>
            <li>Can you say CHEAP?  </li>
            <li>The mirrors had come out of the cheap plastic frame they were just glued into.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could find a decent version of this kind of mirror</li>
            <li>my original and the neck piece has a guard on it</li>
            <li>It is light weight and very easy to use to for make-up or hair and to do so completely hands free.  </li>
            <li>I will just have to put up with this one until I can afford to spend more for the other one, which I have heard does a good holding job.</li>
            <li>The reason I bought this mirror is because I cut my own hair and this would allow me to easily line up my neckline and assure all hair is even in length in the back.</li>
            <li>The product was received quickly after being ordered.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I went to use it the neck attachment broke off the mirror...</li>
            <li>I could not style my hair without this type of mirror, so am very glad to have found not only one, but two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good mirror that I can wear around my neck for a long time.  </li>
            <li>These were popular back in the 60&#x27;s, and are something you would expect to find in a \\&quot;Fingerhut/Harriet Carter\\&quot; type of catalogue.  </li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t worth the postage money to return it.</li>
            <li>But it is the only kind I can find at this time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found the kind I had sought.  </li>
            <li>It is somewhat useful however.</li>
            <li>so I was really excited to be able to get several.  </li>
            <li>I plan to use this at home and use the plastic Rucci for travel, so it won&#x27;t get nearly as much use as my original mirror did.  </li>
            <li>On a side note, I am right handed and</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s on the right; it has a plastic &#x27;stop&#x27; to keep it from rotating.</li>
            <li>She can apply makeup with this right from her wheelchair.</li>
            <li>You can see a rear view, but you have stand just right.</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>The mirror broke on the first use, right at the pivot point where the lock-down screw is located, that connects the piece that goes around your neck to the mirror stalk.  </li>
            <li>Luckily mine was not broken.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this mirror and at such a low price!  </li>
            <li>I would spend a few dollars more and get the better mirror.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable but they do break after a while because the adjustment screw can be overtightened.</li>
            <li>; if the product was not broken I would have had to sand most of the edges because they were sharp and could easily cut into the skin.</li>
            <li>Ladies would love seeing back of hair.</li>
            <li>The sister who gets married in \\&quot;Sixteen</li>
            <li>This mirror was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It broke on the first use.</li>
            <li>the neck piece broke the first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li>First the hook snapped off, which defeated the &amp;#34;hands-free&amp;#34; operation.</li>
            <li>Only three stars because I love the mirror</li>
            <li>Handle broke within first week.</li>
            <li>I Googled the mirror and the results were first and foremost, Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my mother in law who is wheelchair bound and likes the hands free option that this offers.</li>
            <li>This mirror broke the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>we have to send it back and replace it with a better product - this time made of metal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However....I just opened the package and can see that this Rucci mirror is not made nearly as well as my original one.  </li>
            <li>it broke at the hinge the first time I used it, even being plastic it should be strong enough to withstand moving the neck wrap without breaking</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews first, this was cheap and broke the second time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I will look long and hard to make sure it has a good size mirror and</li>
            <li>I really do not want to spend $40 or more for the stainless steel version offered.</li>
            <li>My purpose was a hands free mirror in order to style the back of my hair.</li>
            <li>and you have to tighten it in place alot, and even then it still won&#x27;t stay very well.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this for someone who wants a mirror to apply makeup hands-free, but not for anything else...</li>
            <li>Unless you stand at a really funky angle, it just doesn&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li>I really needed it to cut my hair.</li>
            <li>Was very disappointed!!!!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This one is all plastic and very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as durable as I would like, but it was also very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s serviceable and didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li>I am not upset because it was a very inexpensive item</li>
            <li>but it would cost too much in shipping to return.</li>
            <li>and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Tighten too much and it cracks the plastic.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with very brittle plastic and</li>
            <li>I think I will remain calm, relaxed and natural and look for another one on another web site.</li>
            <li>He could not stand up to use the bathroom mirror in order to shave and mirror was very helpful to him.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made out of cheap, brittle plastic and the stress point (where mine broke) isn&#x27;t reinforced properly or enough.  </li>
            <li>went back to Amazon and ordered the Emerae Hands Free Mirror (ASIN:</li>
            <li>The mirror was very flimsy.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t make very well, and the plastic snapped.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic broke on the third use!  </li>
            <li>Very inexpensive too.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the nut and bolt really does not hold.  </li>
            <li>like I had in the 90s with a second rotating screw near the top.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this neck mirror from Amazon due to not being able to find one in any of the stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I PURCHASED TWO OF THESE FOR MY 93 YEAR OLD MOTHER, THE FIRST TIME SHE TRIED TO PUT IT AROUND HER NECK, IT BROKE.</li>
            <li>but the nut you have to tighten to hold it steady has already loosened.</li>
            <li>It is the only one I can use to see the back of my head, especially when I am trimming my own hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is fine for what I use it for.    </li>
            <li>this mirror does not go aroun the right side  of the neck,only the left</li>
            <li>I knew this mirror was cheap, but I couldn&#x27;t find any other.  </li>
            <li>My fault, I had been looking for a new mirror for some time</li>
            <li>The screw on the new mirror has no groove, so I can see already that this will be a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The actual mirror part is way too small &amp; the neck/stem  is too short to fit safely around my neck</li>
            <li>THE PLASTIC IS NOT VERY GOOD, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, WON&#x27;T BUY ANY OF THESE AGAIN.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a neck mirror, so I am just glad to have one without spending a ton of money.</li>
            <li>I have used neck mirrors for 30 years and this one was by far the cheapest, poorest one that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>My old ones used to also have a screw so the mirror could be tightened so it didn&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li>It is very flimsy and the wing nut has to be constantly adjusted.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your $.</li>
            <li>Sorry, but I can&#x27;t find 1 good thing to say about this mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little flimsy, but the plastic seems strong enough to take some of the flimsiness -- which also makes me think it will not break during travel.  </li>
            <li>The hand mirror is made of very cheap plastic with a large nut that screws into the side that juts out making it uncomfortable to grab hold of.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t fit around my neck and the mirror is way too small.</li>
            <li>It was only in some thin bubble wrap and squashed up paper on the top of the mirror only; the bottom was right next to the box.</li>
            <li>but I should have been able to use it at least once!</li>
            <li>I have purchased many items through Amazon over the past 4 years and find this product to be only the second one that I returned.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to help me see the back of my head clearly while trimming my hair.  </li>
            <li>All in all very flimsy and doubt that it will last long before it breaks.  </li>
            <li>so it only moves so far.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s angled positions so far probably because the low weight of the mirror frame</li>
            <li>There is only one wing nut, where there were two places with wingnuts for adjustment on the old mirror.  </li>
            <li>Delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are good and bad things to say, but, for the price, it is a decent purchase, especially for traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item is very cheaply made and not comfortable to use because it is too small and the magnafying is way to low.</li>
            <li>Hard to get at an angle that is useful for the intended purpose.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It is light weight and very easy to use to for make-up or hair and to do so completely hands free.  </li>
            <li> I will just have to put up with this one until I can afford to spend more for the other one, which I have heard does a good holding job.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this mirror is because I cut my own hair and this would allow me to easily line up my neckline and assure all hair is even in length in the back.</li>
            <li> The product was received quickly after being ordered.  </li>
            <li> The very first time I went to use it the neck attachment broke off the mirror...</li>
            <li> I could not style my hair without this type of mirror, so am very glad to have found not only one, but two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good mirror that I can wear around my neck for a long time.  </li>
            <li> These were popular back in the 60&#x27;s, and are something you would expect to find in a \\&quot;Fingerhut/Harriet Carter\\&quot; type of catalogue.  </li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t worth the postage money to return it.</li>
            <li> But it is the only kind I can find at this time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found the kind I had sought.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat useful however.</li>
            <li> so I was really excited to be able to get several.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use this at home and use the plastic Rucci for travel, so it won&#x27;t get nearly as much use as my original mirror did.  </li>
            <li> On a side note, I am right handed and</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s on the right; it has a plastic &#x27;stop&#x27; to keep it from rotating.</li>
            <li> She can apply makeup with this right from her wheelchair.</li>
            <li> You can see a rear view, but you have stand just right.</li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> The mirror broke on the first use, right at the pivot point where the lock-down screw is located, that connects the piece that goes around your neck to the mirror stalk.  </li>
            <li> Luckily mine was not broken.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this mirror and at such a low price!  </li>
            <li> I would spend a few dollars more and get the better mirror.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable but they do break after a while because the adjustment screw can be overtightened.</li>
            <li> ; if the product was not broken I would have had to sand most of the edges because they were sharp and could easily cut into the skin.</li>
            <li> Ladies would love seeing back of hair.</li>
            <li> The sister who gets married in \\&quot;Sixteen</li>
            <li> This mirror was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It broke on the first use.</li>
            <li> the neck piece broke the first time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> First the hook snapped off, which defeated the &amp;#34;hands-free&amp;#34; operation.</li>
            <li> Only three stars because I love the mirror</li>
            <li> Handle broke within first week.</li>
            <li> I Googled the mirror and the results were first and foremost, Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother in law who is wheelchair bound and likes the hands free option that this offers.</li>
            <li> This mirror broke the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> we have to send it back and replace it with a better product - this time made of metal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However....I just opened the package and can see that this Rucci mirror is not made nearly as well as my original one.  </li>
            <li> it broke at the hinge the first time I used it, even being plastic it should be strong enough to withstand moving the neck wrap without breaking</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first, this was cheap and broke the second time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I will look long and hard to make sure it has a good size mirror and</li>
            <li> I really do not want to spend $40 or more for the stainless steel version offered.</li>
            <li> My purpose was a hands free mirror in order to style the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> and you have to tighten it in place alot, and even then it still won&#x27;t stay very well.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this for someone who wants a mirror to apply makeup hands-free, but not for anything else...</li>
            <li> Unless you stand at a really funky angle, it just doesn&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li> I really needed it to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed!!!!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This one is all plastic and very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as durable as I would like, but it was also very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s serviceable and didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li> I am not upset because it was a very inexpensive item</li>
            <li> but it would cost too much in shipping to return.</li>
            <li> and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Tighten too much and it cracks the plastic.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with very brittle plastic and</li>
            <li> I think I will remain calm, relaxed and natural and look for another one on another web site.</li>
            <li> He could not stand up to use the bathroom mirror in order to shave and mirror was very helpful to him.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made out of cheap, brittle plastic and the stress point (where mine broke) isn&#x27;t reinforced properly or enough.  </li>
            <li> went back to Amazon and ordered the Emerae Hands Free Mirror (ASIN:</li>
            <li> The mirror was very flimsy.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t make very well, and the plastic snapped.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic broke on the third use!  </li>
            <li> Very inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> the nut and bolt really does not hold.  </li>
            <li> like I had in the 90s with a second rotating screw near the top.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this neck mirror from Amazon due to not being able to find one in any of the stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED TWO OF THESE FOR MY 93 YEAR OLD MOTHER, THE FIRST TIME SHE TRIED TO PUT IT AROUND HER NECK, IT BROKE.</li>
            <li> but the nut you have to tighten to hold it steady has already loosened.</li>
            <li> It is the only one I can use to see the back of my head, especially when I am trimming my own hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is fine for what I use it for.    </li>
            <li> this mirror does not go aroun the right side  of the neck,only the left</li>
            <li> I knew this mirror was cheap, but I couldn&#x27;t find any other.  </li>
            <li> My fault, I had been looking for a new mirror for some time</li>
            <li> The screw on the new mirror has no groove, so I can see already that this will be a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The actual mirror part is way too small &amp; the neck/stem  is too short to fit safely around my neck</li>
            <li> THE PLASTIC IS NOT VERY GOOD, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, WON&#x27;T BUY ANY OF THESE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a neck mirror, so I am just glad to have one without spending a ton of money.</li>
            <li> I have used neck mirrors for 30 years and this one was by far the cheapest, poorest one that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> My old ones used to also have a screw so the mirror could be tightened so it didn&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> It is very flimsy and the wing nut has to be constantly adjusted.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your $.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I can&#x27;t find 1 good thing to say about this mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little flimsy, but the plastic seems strong enough to take some of the flimsiness -- which also makes me think it will not break during travel.  </li>
            <li> The hand mirror is made of very cheap plastic with a large nut that screws into the side that juts out making it uncomfortable to grab hold of.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t fit around my neck and the mirror is way too small.</li>
            <li> It was only in some thin bubble wrap and squashed up paper on the top of the mirror only; the bottom was right next to the box.</li>
            <li> but I should have been able to use it at least once!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many items through Amazon over the past 4 years and find this product to be only the second one that I returned.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help me see the back of my head clearly while trimming my hair.  </li>
            <li> All in all very flimsy and doubt that it will last long before it breaks.  </li>
            <li> so it only moves so far.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s angled positions so far probably because the low weight of the mirror frame</li>
            <li> There is only one wing nut, where there were two places with wingnuts for adjustment on the old mirror.  </li>
            <li> Delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are good and bad things to say, but, for the price, it is a decent purchase, especially for traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item is very cheaply made and not comfortable to use because it is too small and the magnafying is way to low.</li>
            <li> Hard to get at an angle that is useful for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li> The thing is-the mirror portion is just too small to be of much use when trying to work with the back of your hair.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to be careful while using the mirror, but a small amount of &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; pressure on the hook or mirror-holding arms will snap them right off.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product is flimsy and I don&#x27;t expect it to stay intact for long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like it will last very long.</li>
            <li> This mirror is not quite long enough for a person with a long neck, but I can make it work.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be long before it breaks.  </li>
            <li> The portion that hangs onto your neck is not fixed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to change it from putting it on from the left side to the right side making it extremely difficult to see the back of the head.</li>
            <li> Little smaller then the last one I had, but serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> I could really tighten the wing nut on my first mirror by using a screwdriver in the groove in the head of the screw to hold it firmly while I twisted the wing nut.  </li>
            <li> I can only blame myself for not listening to the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Pay a little extra for one that will last.</li>
            <li> I can use it for dying one side of the back of my head, the other side it doesn&#x27;t stay in place because of the nect holder...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this small, flimsy mirror is worth even a dollar!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The more expensive ones listed on Amazon and other online inventories is what I had expected but was not willing to pay the $35.</li>
            <li> Still a difficult process the mirror does not swivel left or right.  </li>
            <li> It shipped, and was delivered in a timely fashion, but was just not worth even the very low price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> and it was not worth the red tape to resolve the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know why they keep selling it; it&#x27;s not worth the money it would cost to send it back!  </li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, is that the screw loosens and the mirrow drops down</li>
            <li> Very hard to maintain a certain position.</li>
            <li> the mirror itself was only about half the side needed.</li>
            <li> Due to the remarkably low price, I ordered two of these mirrors, giving one to my mother and keeping the other in reserve in case</li>
            <li> , it was only a bit higher-I just went for the black.</li>
            <li> It seems a little fragile, had already broke and reglued.</li>
            <li> It does not have a long enough length from neck to mirror and keeps falling down no matter how tight I make it.  </li>
            <li> The mirrors are harder to find</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to send back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mirror does not hold in place, so, I am using a wide rubberband around the frame to prevent the mirror from turning.&lt;br /&gt;And,</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that this mirror broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply too lightweight and small to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Agree with other reviews.</li>
            <li> The concept may be good but the item is difficult to adjust so it stays balanced instead of moving around making it inconvenient to use.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stay in place and is too small to see the back of my head if my hair is down.  </li>
            <li> When this Rucci black neck mirror arrived, it was difficult to even get it to stay in one position long enough to see the back of my head.</li>
            <li> The actual mirror part is very small, so small you can&#x27;t really see past your face in the mirror to be able to see your hair behind you; so it is almost impossible to fix your hair using it.</li>
            <li> The ones I have purchased before looked similar but at least have had Screws with wing nuts holding them together.  </li>
            <li> It just flops down.  </li>
            <li> With that said, this product is very poorly made as it does not sit on your neck very well</li>
            <li> B002ZG96L6 Rucci Neck Mirror, Black, 1X/3X]]</li>
            <li> B002ZG96L6 Rucci Neck Mirror, Black, 1X/3X]]</li>
            <li> B002ZG96L6 Rucci Neck Mirror, Black, 1X/3X]]</li>
            <li> and I ordered the black plastic one and should have ordered the metal, like I had previously.</li>
            <li> I have used a metal neck mirror for years, I mean like 50 years, and it is starting to slip a little.</li>
            <li> It has to be tightened tight or it fall down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the trouble and expense to return.  </li>
            <li> The view from the mirror was smaller than I expected and the view from the back was awkward.</li>
            <li> The quality has gotten so bad, that I&#x27;m lucky if I get 2 months use of the mirror before it breaks.    </li>
            <li> ,l the plastic is a little flimsy</li>
            <li> I wondered whether this item was a little too inexpensive for what it does</li>
            <li> It was plactic and worked for a little while, but soon it was boken.  </li>
            <li> It is a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li> I usually struggle with one hand holding the mirror and the other hand holding the T-Liners trying to lineup the back of my head, behind my ears and my sides, but not with this mirror.</li>
            <li> The tightening screw is very loose even when turned hard, and there&#x27;s no way to tighten the mirror</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just going back to rolling a big mirror into the bathroom with me, and twisting and turning my head into awkward angles to increase my ability to view it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in Jan 2010 and after a few months it broke.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> she finds a way of destroying the one I gave her.  </li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t yet received the metal mirror, so can&#x27;t  compare them, but I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend the Rucci for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Taking it off the second time left a long, bloody scratch on my neck from the unfinished edge of the \\&quot;hook\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this mirror as it is too small, the handle is too short and its movement can not be secured so that you can see behind.  </li>
            <li> When her last one broke and half the Scotch tape in North America failed to repair it, I began a quest to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> and I have to tighten it down really hard to make it stay in place.</li>
            <li> This mirror is plastic and therefore user is unable to bend a little to see the back of your head when grooming.</li>
            <li> had three small spots of glue (about the size of George Washington&#x27;s nose on a U.S. quarter).</li>
            <li> I have used this type of mirror for more than 30 years and these are the worst!!!  </li>
            <li> I have used this type of mirror for many years, but this one is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Consequently, the mirror (which I glued back together) flops around and is basically useless.  </li>
            <li> small.</li>
            <li> too small must be for a child.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this mirror!  </li>
            <li> Not pleased....</li>
            <li> The mirror is too small.</li>
            <li> I had it for 3 months and the plastic neck just snapped right off the base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal but felt awkward.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because I thought it would make cutting the back of my hair easier.  </li>
            <li> (At least it does not seem to be a brittle plastic, which would probably break.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the negative posters on this one.</li>
            <li> It was impossible to see the back of my head and</li>
            <li> small size of mirror making it difficult to view entire head for hair cutting</li>
            <li> The part that goes around the neck is tight and difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> the neck hook broke at the weak point where it screws to the mirror.</li>
            <li> Wanted to use this so I could see the back of my head when I used curling iron - to prevent burns - but it didn&#x27;t work - this mirror STINKS!</li>
            <li> Will flip around if you don&#x27;t move very slowly.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase at all.  </li>
            <li> Have bought 3 of these since October, 2010 and all 3 have broken.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything could be made that poorly.</li>
            <li> The product was packed well just came broken the plastic holding the mirrors together</li>
            <li> It arrived already broken and without a packing slip.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one screw at the base, which cannot be tightened because there is nothing to hold onto on the opposing side of the screw.  </li>
            <li> It was broken when I got it</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> The neck ring is awkward and the double-sided mirror is on the small side.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not a quality item.</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate that this was damaged when we got it, but that happens.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> is useless.</li>
            <li> well, it tilts at the wrong angle.  </li>
            <li> It arrived broken!  </li>
            <li> this works very poorly and broke after maybe one or two uses.</li>
            <li> If you were cutting your hair in the rear you might make a mistake.</li>
            <li> Consequently, lots of swearing and bad hair days.  </li>
            <li> this thing isn&#x27;t as bad as it could be, but this is not at all what I thought it was going to be ...</li>
            <li> The bad news is that the plastic piece that goes around your neck breaks away at the fastener...easily.  </li>
            <li> What I was really disappointed in though is that Amazon did not pack this mirror well.</li>
            <li> I used it,needless to say I was disappointed-----</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.   </li>
            <li> I turned the screw at the base to tighten it and the plastic cracked and split apart.</li>
            <li> I would hope the manufacturer could strengthen the base that holds the mirror</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this mirror.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with these mirrors.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very bad product!</li>
            <li> Completely pathetic product.</li>

            <li> Screws won&#x27;t tighten to hold mirror in place so I would not recommend it. The plastic where the nut and bolt are broke when tried to tighten it.Company was very easy to deal with however.</li>
            <li> I thought the mirror would swivel but it doesn&#x27;t.  I can adjust it around my neck to get the angle I want, but the plastic arm that goes around your neck breaks off too easy if you use it a lot and I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neck Mirrors for years - how else do you style the back of your hair?  The quality has gotten so bad, that I&#x27;m lucky if I get 2 months use of the mirror before it breaks.    It flops around, one has to constantly be tightening the screw, and eventually the handle just breaks off.  Consequently, lots of swearing and bad hair days.  If there is a quality neck mirror out there,  I would like to hear about it.</li>
            <li> the connection between the mirror handle and the neck apparatus broke in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in Jan 2010 and after a few months it broke. I purchased another one in mid Aug 2010 and it broke already. I did not even get two months out of it. I realize it is cheap but it should last longer than six weeks. This is the only around the neck mirror I can find. If anyone knows of a better product I would appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Luv this product-use daily-keep selling. GREAT PRODUCT. Amazon only one selling them.  Ladies would love seeing back of hair.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had such a mirror and was once again looking for one. My purpose was a hands free mirror in order to style the back of my hair. This one must have been designed for a midget! It was impossible to see the back of my head and the mirror itself was only about half the side needed. (A magnifying mirror was NOT needed. I wasted my money. It doesn&#x27;t begin to met the need.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase at all.  It was cheap plastic and broke right away!!! I did not mishandle it! It was the second time I&#x27;d even had my hands on it!!  Very disappointing.   [[ASIN:B002ZG96L6 Rucci Neck Mirror, Black, 1X/3X]]</li>
            <li> I guess for what I paid for it this thing isn&#x27;t as bad as it could be, but this is not at all what I thought it was going to be ... I was wanting a neck mirror with which I could fix my hair hands-free and this is not at all what this is .... This is a neck mirror (in my opinion, anyway) to do makeup up-close and hands-free. The actual mirror part is very small, so small you can&#x27;t really see past your face in the mirror to be able to see your hair behind you; so it is almost impossible to fix your hair using it. It&#x27;s kind of flimsy as it hangs on your neck and you have to tighten it in place alot, and even then it still won&#x27;t stay very well. I would suggest this for someone who wants a mirror to apply makeup hands-free, but not for anything else...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good mirror that I can wear around my neck for a long time.  These were popular back in the 60&#x27;s, and are something you would expect to find in a \\&quot;Fingerhut/Harriet Carter\\&quot; type of catalogue.  The sister who gets married in \\&quot;Sixteen Candles\\&quot; uses one.  Well, this mirror is not \\&quot;it.\\&quot;  This mirror is a low budget item, and I guess, in this instance, you get what you pay for.  The thing is-the mirror portion is just too small to be of much use when trying to work with the back of your hair.  I was looking for something to help me see the back of my head clearly while trimming my hair.  Unless you stand at a really funky angle, it just doesn&#x27;t do.  It shipped, and was delivered in a timely fashion, but was just not worth even the very low price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this kind of mirror for years.  This mirror was exactly what I wanted.  They made these years ago and I have not been able to find one.  I never thought to look here.  I was very happy to find it.  I received my product in a timely manner and I really am enjoying it.  Thank you to the seller who has a great product for a good price.</li>
            <li> This mirror really comes in handy when you need both hands to work with. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that this mirror broke the first time I used it. I turned the screw at the base to tighten it and the plastic cracked and split apart. I really needed it to cut my hair. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This mirror was made of plastic, it was very cheap and broke within 2 weeks after I received it.  I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror a month ago to help see the back of my head when I color my hair. It was made of cheap plastic, but I thought it would serve the purpose. The second time I used it the neck hook broke at the weak point where it screws to the mirror. Hoping I can get a refund. Was very disappointed!!!!![[ASIN:B002ZG96L6 Rucci Neck Mirror, Black, 1X/3X]]</li>
            <li> I have used neck mirrors for 30 years and this one was by far the cheapest, poorest one that I have purchased.  The very first time I went to use it the neck attachment broke off the mirror...no longer a neck mirror!  The ones I have purchased before looked similar but at least have had Screws with wing nuts holding them together.  This one is all plastic and very flimsy.  I know it was \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; but I should have been able to use it at least once! My recommendation for you is to stay away from the Rucci neck mirror!</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first, this was cheap and broke the second time I used it.  I ordered 2 dif. mirrors at the same time, they looked dif and cost was totally dif but it was the mirror was the same.  Don&#x27;t be fooled/ if you want this item I recomend trying only a metal mirror.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this mirror.  It&#x27;s not as durable as I would like, but it was also very inexpensive.  You used to be able to find round-the-neck mirrors any place that sold cosmetics and hair care items.  They suddenly disappeared from stores about three years ago.  How come?  Lawsuits?  Anyway I was glad to get this one.  It&#x27;s serviceable and didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li> This a good neck mirror for the price.  I wish there was a way to also tighten the mirror in place in the same manner the neck strap is attached. My old ones used to also have a screw so the mirror could be tightened so it didn&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> I recently broke a mirror similar to this one that I had since the 60&#x27;s.  This replacement mirror is smaller then my original and the neck piece has a guard on it so it only moves so far.  It is doable.  I use it to cut the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> The attaching wing nut screw is an incorrect solution with this lightweight plastic neck arm.  It broke on the first use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is not a quality item. The hand mirror is made of very cheap plastic with a large nut that screws into the side that juts out making it uncomfortable to grab hold of. The neck ring is awkward and the double-sided mirror is on the small side. Overall, the product is flimsy and I don&#x27;t expect it to stay intact for long.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this mirror.  It doesn&#x27;t stay in position, it moves everytime you lift your arms.  The mirror flips around too freely.  The length of the arm from where it sits on your chest to the mirror is too short.  It&#x27;s simply too lightweight and small to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JLS</li>
            <li> Read the title above!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have purchased a great deal of merchandise from Amazon and have always been pleased.  It is unfortunate that this was damaged when we got it, but that happens.  I am not upset because it was a very inexpensive item and it was not worth the red tape to resolve the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to be a happy customer with Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike</li>
            <li> This item is very cheaply made and not comfortable to use because it is too small and the magnafying is way to low. I ordered 3 each and one broke while unpacking it.  I would have sent the order back but it would cost too much in shipping to return. I would not recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> Since I use it only once every six weeks or so and I need to say money, I ordered the [[ASIN:B002ZG96L6 Rucci Neck Mirror, Black, 1X/3X]] rather than the more costly one. It arrived promptly, just like all Amazon orders do. I took it out of the package, put it around my neck - and it fell off.  OK, I had to tighten the screw.  Did that, it fell off again.  The tightening screw is very loose even when turned hard, and there&#x27;s no way to tighten the mirror so it stays at your chosen angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking it off the second time left a long, bloody scratch on my neck from the unfinished edge of the \\&quot;hook\\&quot;. I know why they keep selling it; it&#x27;s not worth the money it would cost to send it back!  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay cheap made and I have to tighten it down really hard to make it stay in place. I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be long before it breaks.  It&#x27;s not worth the trouble and expense to return.  It is very flimsy and the wing nut has to be constantly adjusted.  I gave it two stars:  One for usefulness and one for price.  It will suffice for the price.  On a side note, I am right handed and the wing nut is on the left.  It&#x27;s not a big deal but felt awkward.  No, you can&#x27;t swing the mirror through the handle so it&#x27;s on the right; it has a plastic &#x27;stop&#x27; to keep it from rotating.</li>
            <li> The portion that hangs onto your neck is not fixed. Very hard to maintain a certain position. If you were cutting your hair in the rear you might make a mistake.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a neck mirrow for sometime.  Used to have one and it worked very well.  I use it when I color my hair to see if it is all covered in the back.    Only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, is that the screw loosens and the mirrow drops down and I need to stop and retighten it.    Other than that it is fine for what I use it for.    Grace Matyskiela</li>
            <li> As a hairdresser I use this type of mirror to see to cut my hair and have for years.  The mirrors are harder to find so I was really excited to be able to get several.  I plan to give a one to a friend also.</li>
            <li> Have bought 3 of these since October, 2010 and all 3 have broken.  Each broke at the point where the wing nut is tightened.  Tighten too much and it cracks the plastic.  You could try placing a washer between the wing nut and the plastic to see if that prevents breakage.  My mother-in-law uses this mirror as she cannot stand at a bathroom mirror to put on her makeup.  She loves the mirror but just wishes it was constructed better. I really do not want to spend $40 or more for the stainless steel version offered.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED TWO OF THESE FOR MY 93 YEAR OLD MOTHER, THE FIRST TIME SHE TRIED TO PUT IT AROUND HER NECK, IT BROKE. THE PLASTIC IS NOT VERY GOOD, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, WON&#x27;T BUY ANY OF THESE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> My fault, I had been looking for a new mirror for some time and I ordered the black plastic one and should have ordered the metal, like I had previously. The arm was shorter than the metal one   and the mirror was smaller.  I use to get my mirrors from Sally&#x27;s and they discontinued them.  Thanks I will order the metal next time.</li>
            <li> The view from the mirror was smaller than I expected and the view from the back was awkward.</li>
            <li> For years, my 87 year-old mother has used mirrors that hang around her neck to fix her hair, having both hands free.  When her last one broke and half the Scotch tape in North America failed to repair it, I began a quest to find a replacement.  Due to the remarkably low price, I ordered two of these mirrors, giving one to my mother and keeping the other in reserve in case she finds a way of destroying the one I gave her.  She is delighted and I am a hero, as it is exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> this mirror does not go aroun the right side  of the neck,only the left and it does not stay when used.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very cheaply made. It&#x27;s made with very brittle plastic and the neck piece broke the first time I tried to use it.  Wouldn&#x27;t bother to spend money on it if you plan to use it the way it is intended.</li>
            <li> I knew this mirror was cheap, but I couldn&#x27;t find any other.  It broke by the screw the second time I tried to use it.  I didn&#x27;t think anything could be made that poorly.</li>
            <li> I bought a nicer metal version of this for my mom years ago &amp; out of EVERYTHING she owns she uses the neck mirror the most. I didn&#x27;t want to spend $45 on a metal one so I ordered this one &amp; I LOVE it! I even bought my sister one too. This is perfect for women who love to pick their face!</li>
            <li> This mirror broke the second time my wife used it. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone selling something so fragile. Besides that, the screw that tightened the mirror to the neck loop would not tighten enough to hold the mirror in place. Very bad product!</li>
            <li> This is a very helpful neck mirror - that&#x27;s the good news.  The bad news is that the plastic piece that goes around your neck breaks away at the fastener...easily.  I have to replace my neck mirrors within a year.  Why can&#x27;t Rucci make a more durable product?  Just asking.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this item...can&#x27;t seem to find in stores anymore.  Now I can see back of hair when styling.</li>
            <li> I received the Rucci Neck Mirror in a box that was in great condition. The product was packed well just came broken the plastic holding the mirrors together had three small spots of glue (about the size of George Washington&#x27;s nose on a U.S. quarter). Separating the two mirrors was what looks like 3 scraps of cardboard (each about the sizes of a standard post-it and the thickness of 2 post-its); if the product was not broken I would have had to sand most of the edges because they were sharp and could easily cut into the skin. I would not recommend this product to anyone look for something different.</li>
            <li> I ordered this neck mirror from Amazon due to not being able to find one in any of the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently they aren&#x27;t in local shop inventories as they once were. The more expensive ones listed on Amazon and other online inventories is what I had expected but was not willing to pay the $35. and up price for one and also read too many negatives in the comments for something so pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this one:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: price and availability&lt;br /&gt;Cons: flimsy plastic(seems too easy to break plastic neck piece)&lt;br /&gt;and small size of mirror making it difficult to view entire head for hair cutting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional: the hinge mechanism seems to hold it&#x27;s angled positions so far probably because the low weight of the mirror frame</li>
            <li> I order two or three at one time because they break easy and I have to have one to fix the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> OMG!  This is the best mirror a Barber/Cosmetologist, do your own hair could have.  I did my hair this weekend and my line up is Banging!  I usually struggle with one hand holding the mirror and the other hand holding the T-Liners trying to lineup the back of my head, behind my ears and my sides, but not with this mirror. I could see and lineup everything.  I just wish it was meta,l the plastic is a little flimsy but I love it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product was received quickly after being ordered.  It is light weight and very easy to use to for make-up or hair and to do so completely hands free.  The price is very reasonable but they do break after a while because the adjustment screw can be overtightened.</li>
            <li> I should have known better. I read reviews but I needed help for the back of my head. This thing does NOT STAY where you can see the back of your head. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> I have used a metal neck mirror for years, I mean like 50 years, and it is starting to slip a little. When this Rucci black neck mirror arrived, it was difficult to even get it to stay in one position long enough to see the back of my head. It really isn&#x27;t worth the postage money to return it.</li>
            <li> I have order several and they are not well constructed but I have to have them to put color on my hair (sectioning off the back).  the wings that hold the mirror are too flexible and after a bit of use the mirror drops out and breaks.  I have used this type of mirror for more than 30 years and these are the worst!!!  But it is the only kind I can find at this time and I must continue to buy them.  I would hope the manufacturer could strengthen the base that holds the mirror so it doe snot fall out and break....this has happened three times with me....not just once but three!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this small, flimsy mirror is worth even a dollar!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why Amazon is even bothering to sell it.</li>
            <li> This is a very fragile item. I broke mine in two places. First the hook snapped off, which defeated the &amp;#34;hands-free&amp;#34; operation. Then, a week or so later, one of the arms that holds the mirror snapped off. I was trying to be careful while using the mirror, but a small amount of &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; pressure on the hook or mirror-holding arms will snap them right off.</li>
            <li> Only three stars because I love the mirror but the nut you have to tighten to hold it steady has already loosened. It has to be tightened tight or it fall down. but overtighening is easy to do.</li>
            <li> The mirror portion has nothing to stabilize it.  Will flip around if you don&#x27;t move very slowly.  All in all very flimsy and doubt that it will last long before it breaks.  Hard to get at an angle that is useful for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li> The mirror fell apart as soon as I received it so I do not recommend it at all.  Do not waste your $.</li>
            <li> Handle broke within first week.</li>
            <li> Agree with other reviews. This product is a waste of money. Enough said!</li>
            <li> This mirror is not quite long enough for a person with a long neck, but I can make it work. It is hard to find a neck mirror, so I am just glad to have one without spending a ton of money. What I was really disappointed in though is that Amazon did not pack this mirror well. It was only in some thin bubble wrap and squashed up paper on the top of the mirror only; the bottom was right next to the box. Amazon, you can do better than that. Luckily mine was not broken.</li>
            <li> The construction is so flimsy, the mirror would not stay up despite repeated adjustments. Returned.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this mirror as it is too small, the handle is too short and its movement can not be secured so that you can see behind.  I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for a rear view mirror to put up my hair with and to comb the back of my hair.  I ordered 2 thinking I&#x27;ve finally found the kind I had sought.  Boy was I wrong.  I can&#x27;t use them and now I will have to look at the $40 version to see if it fits the bill.  I will look long and hard to make sure it has a good size mirror and the mirror can be held in one place.  I Googled the mirror and the results were first and foremost, Amazon.  I think I will remain calm, relaxed and natural and look for another one on another web site.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother in law who is wheelchair bound and likes the hands free option that this offers. She had been looking for one of these for years. She can apply makeup with this right from her wheelchair. The mirror is inexpensive and feels a bit flimsy, but at this price is easy to replace if damaged, and therefore was a great find. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I can&#x27;t find 1 good thing to say about this mirror. The part that goes around the neck is tight and difficult to put on. I&#x27;m not a big woman &amp; it hurts and scratches to put on or take off. There&#x27;s no way to change it from putting it on from the left side to the right side making it extremely difficult to see the back of the head. I would not recommend this item for anyone.</li>
            <li> Now I can see to fix the back of my hair--awesome!  For all of you that have only 1 bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror in order to see the back of my head (when curling my hair) Still a difficult process the mirror does not swivel left or right.  You can see a rear view, but you have stand just right.</li>
            <li> It arrived already broken and without a packing slip.  Fell out of the bag in four pieces.  I have used this type of mirror for many years, but this one is terrible.  The piece that holds the mirrors in the frame had fallen out.  The two mirrors fell into my lap.  There&#x27;s only one screw at the base, which cannot be tightened because there is nothing to hold onto on the opposing side of the screw.  The mirror end has no screw.  Consequently, the mirror (which I glued back together) flops around and is basically useless.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this.  I wanted a mirror that I could see the back of my head and this just doesn&#x27;t work very good for me.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wanted to use this so I could see the back of my head when I used curling iron - to prevent burns - but it didn&#x27;t work - this mirror STINKS!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a wheelchair bound friend living in a nursing home.  He could not stand up to use the bathroom mirror in order to shave and mirror was very helpful to him.  It did the trick and helped him to keep his independence longer.</li>
            <li> Mirrow should be larger it was differcult to see in back of hair.  The stand was sturdy and felt comfortable</li>
            <li> This mirror is plastic and therefore user is unable to bend a little to see the back of your head when grooming.</li>
            <li> it broke at the hinge the first time I used it, even being plastic it should be strong enough to withstand moving the neck wrap without breaking</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item. It was broken when I got it &amp; it broke totally apart while I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with these mirrors. When I turned the wing nut to adjust the neck band it broke. Also the mirror is&lt;br /&gt;very small. Bought 4, what a mistake.</li>
            <li> the product came apart when I lifted it out of the package. I will try to glue it back together. Too much trouble to send back.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this mirror is because I cut my own hair and this would allow me to easily line up my neckline and assure all hair is even in length in the back. With that said, this product is very poorly made as it does not sit on your neck very well and the screw used to add tension to the bracket to lock the angle of the mirror in place is useless. The mirror dangles and sways freely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just going back to rolling a big mirror into the bathroom with me, and twisting and turning my head into awkward angles to increase my ability to view it.</li>
            <li> The actual mirror part is way too small &amp; the neck/stem  is too short to fit safely around my neck</li>
            <li> too small must be for a child. won&#x27;t fit around my neck and the mirror is way too small.</li>
            <li> Little smaller then the last one I had, but serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> I wondered whether this item was a little too inexpensive for what it does and I was right. The mirror broke on the first use, right at the pivot point where the lock-down screw is located, that connects the piece that goes around your neck to the mirror stalk.  It&#x27;s made out of cheap, brittle plastic and the stress point (where mine broke) isn&#x27;t reinforced properly or enough.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to Amazon and ordered the Emerae Hands Free Mirror (ASIN: B0087QFTOG UPC: 798304220476 Item model number: emerae-1) for $29.95.</li>
            <li> The second time I attempted to use this mirror, it broke where the neck piece attaches to the mirror..  Do not buy one of these!</li>
            <li> The mirror was very flimsy. The plastic is low quality and the tightening screws do not hold the mirror in place.</li>
            <li> The screw on the neck ring cannot be tightened enough to allow the mirror to stay positioned correctly.  It just flops down.  I requested a return of this product.  I have purchased many items through Amazon over the past 4 years and find this product to be only the second one that I returned.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I thought it would make cutting the back of my hair easier.  It is too short, does not expand enough and falls off.</li>
            <li> When tightening the screw it broke. I never got to use it. I want my money back. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This mirror broke the first day I used it. It wasn&#x27;t make very well, and the plastic snapped. So I ordered another neck mirror.</li>
            <li> I bought a plastic Rucci neck mirror about 20 years ago.  It has served me well and would still be serving me if my husband hadn&#x27;t sat on it!  A couple of years ago I searched stores and the internet for a replacement neck mirror so I&#x27;d have one if mine broke.  I could find nothing.  I was so happy to find this mirror and at such a low price!  I ordered it on Monday and it was here on Thursday.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However....I just opened the package and can see that this Rucci mirror is not made nearly as well as my original one.  The plastic is much more flimsy and light weight.  There is only one wing nut, where there were two places with wingnuts for adjustment on the old mirror.  I could really tighten the wing nut on my first mirror by using a screwdriver in the groove in the head of the screw to hold it firmly while I twisted the wing nut.  The screw on the new mirror has no groove, so I can see already that this will be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, I also ordered another brand of neck mirror from Amazon that is made of metal.  I plan to use this at home and use the plastic Rucci for travel, so it won&#x27;t get nearly as much use as my original mirror did.  I could not style my hair without this type of mirror, so am very glad to have found not only one, but two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t yet received the metal mirror, so can&#x27;t  compare them, but I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend the Rucci for everyday use.  It doesn&#x27;t look like it will last very long.</li>
            <li> I liked it an wasexcited to find it but---neck peice broke 2 nd time I used it,needless to say I was disappointed-----</li>
            <li> Absolutely a waste of my money.  I kinda knew it after reading the reviews. Completely pathetic product. Shouldn&#x27;t be allowed on Amazon.  Don&#x27;t buy this.  Buy a tri fold mirror.</li>
            <li> I like to use them when we travel</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic broke on the third use!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of junk.,  It was cheap and acted like it.  G Perry</li>
            <li> It was plactic and worked for a little while, but soon it was boken.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> We should have been more mindful of the reviews.  It is an inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;Now we have to send it back and replace it with a better product - this time made of metal.</li>
            <li> It does not have a long enough length from neck to mirror and keeps falling down no matter how tight I make it.  It is very&lt;br /&gt;light-weight, so maybe this it why.  It seems kind of off balance, and swings around a lot.  It is somewhat useful however.</li>
            <li> the mirrow does not adjust so I can see the back of my hair well, it tilts at the wrong angle.  Probably will not ever use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for this mirror without any luck. It is the only one I can use to see the back of my head, especially when I am trimming my own hair. Very inexpensive too. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The concept may be good but the item is difficult to adjust so it stays balanced instead of moving around making it inconvenient to use. I&#x27;ve resorted to tying it on for stabilization which helps but then the screws still keep loosening.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product at all. It is very cheap.  I would spend a few dollars more and get the better mirror.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flimsy and I can&#x27;t see the back of my head that well the way it&#x27;s made.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased it.</li>
            <li> It is a little flimsy.  I wish I had gone to the next item, it was only a bit higher-I just went for the black.</li>
            <li> I can only blame myself for not listening to the other reviews.  Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this mirror!  I&#x27;ve had 3 of them and they&#x27;re junk.  Now I&#x27;m finally going to buy the metal one.</li>
            <li> It seems a little fragile, had already broke and reglued. Nothing else to say about this product at all - all</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too terribly impressed with this product.  I had it for 3 months and the plastic neck just snapped right off the base.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are good and bad things to say, but, for the price, it is a decent purchase, especially for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little flimsy, but the plastic seems strong enough to take some of the flimsiness -- which also makes me think it will not break during travel.  (At least it does not seem to be a brittle plastic, which would probably break.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror does not hold in place, so, I am using a wide rubberband around the frame to prevent the mirror from turning.&lt;br /&gt;And, the nut and bolt really does not hold.  Maybe they should use a nut and add a washer with, each with a crimp in it, to provide a better hold...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, for at home, I hope to get another more substantial one.  I will just have to put up with this one until I can afford to spend more for the other one, which I have heard does a good holding job.</li>
            <li> The handle snapped off the second time I used it. Can you say CHEAP?  I wish I could find a decent version of this kind of mirror like I had in the 90s with a second rotating screw near the top.  That one lasted for years.  I looked and looked.  I should have listened to the negative posters on this one.</li>
            <li> Go ahead and spring for the metal mirror....this works very poorly and broke after maybe one or two uses. Pay a little extra for one that will last.</li>
            <li> Bought this mirrow for my wife.  She has found it usefull and a good vallue, otherwise I can not commet on its value.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it for doing my hair and seeing the back of it..it doesn&#x27;t stay in place and is too small to see the back of my head if my hair is down.  I can use it for dying one side of the back of my head, the other side it doesn&#x27;t stay in place because of the nect holder... Not pleased....</li>
            <li> The mirror is too small. The positon adjustment does not stay in place. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It arrived broken!  The mirrors had come out of the cheap plastic frame they were just glued into.  A piece of junk!!</li>
