            <li>This product works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Best thing ever!  </li>
            <li>The best price and it does work - it takes awhile.  </li>
            <li>It is the best fungicide, I have used.</li>
            <li>apply twice a day for best results or you probably will not get the result you need and paid for.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>It works like magic!!!</li>
            <li>I wanted my toenails to look beautiful for this summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked great on the fungus</li>
            <li>great.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is great and it works too.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great</li>
            <li>I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li>The thumb nail should take about 5 to 6 months to grow out, but I am so happy it is no longer splitting.</li>
            <li>THIS FUNGICIDE IS BASED ON UNDECYLENIC ACID.A VERY EFFECTIVE</li>
            <li>excellent product works quickly would definately  recommend the order isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>but it seems to have had good results</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product after applying, rub in and the oil seeks into the nail bed.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen has always been good to me.</li>
            <li>Its a good idea to stop then.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>This is good but it seems to take a while.</li>
            <li>I take the time to read some of the reviews,,and they seen to be good ...</li>
            <li>Bought as  Sally&#x27;s products have a good reputation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>your stanky, itchy feet feel soooo much better!</li>
            <li>My Dr, even told me to have my liver tested during this treatment to make sure I was not overburdening my liver!</li>
            <li>Maybe I had more than a fungus!</li>
            <li>This product works amazingly.</li>
            <li>so I moved to home remedies in the meantime to see if I could get the remainder to go away on my own.  </li>
            <li>I had a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; fungus spot on my nail after wearing some &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; nails for a week that were not the waterproof kind.</li>
            <li>Although the vinegar is excellent for a whole host of ailments one could have, it did not work effectively on the toenail fungus.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this and get laser treatment, but in all honesty it&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t proved to be effective for me.</li>
            <li>but it is effective</li>
            <li>Smells nice though.</li>
            <li>This is really doing a great job clearing up my problem!</li>
            <li>niceEshop manicure drill file works good, but is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>the more effective and expedient the medicine will work.</li>
            <li>Great product, much cheaper than getting a prescrioption</li>
            <li>plus it works quicker and better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got healthy nails now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product works for skin fungus just not nails.</li>
            <li>After these many, many months I still have the problem.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;no more fungus&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Since there are many strains of fungus or types.</li>
            <li>I tried this product after reading many reviews.  </li>
            <li>I did not want to use any powerful oral drugs and read good things about this, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to file the nail before application and keep the nail trimmed.</li>
            <li>Seems to be OK for my nail fungus.</li>
            <li>not Onchomycosis which is what most people have looking for products like these.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot, better then the medicine at the dermatologist recommend.</li>
            <li>I was also impressed by the price, which is very low for so many doses of product.</li>
            <li>It took almost a year for my toe nails to grow completely healthy.</li>
            <li>I cut off the white part (2/3 of the nail ) and applied on the skin and nail every morning and night with excellent results.</li>
            <li>love this product, want to show off my toe nails in the summer</li>
            <li>Works okay.  </li>
            <li>there are no horrible side effects as with Rx.</li>
            <li>Most OTC products, including this one, are marginal.  </li>
            <li>and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Guess if I had athletes foot, I would buy another bottle as is did clean that up!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great so far</li>
            <li>The nail is becoming clearer than it has been.</li>
            <li>I really think it is a good product.</li>
            <li>both my parents have fungus on their nails, it helped but didnt heal as fast as we wanted to, but a good product nevertheless</li>
            <li>I am not seeing any great change with this, however it came quickly and was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>No problems - easy transaction.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as strong smelling as before.</li>
            <li>Good ingredients high quiality</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Read the fine print?</li>
            <li>The first review with 5 stars makes it sound like this product is a magic cure with notable improvement in weeks.</li>
            <li>This little guy works perfectly.</li>
            <li>&quot; It was so cheap</li>
            <li>The brush to apply this is sooo cheap.</li>
            <li>Living fungus free.</li>
            <li>But since my primary purpose was to stop the spread of the fungus in my nail, it&#x27;s two stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked great for me, I only wish I had discovered it sonner.</li>
            <li>WHICH HAS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE FOR YEARS.I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>Now, about seven months later, the fungus in the toenail is greatly diminished; I am not embarrassed to go without shoes and socks.  </li>
            <li>But, the nails on my right foot need more treatment.</li>
            <li>For this price though I figured it was worth a try!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a work in progress on that and very satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li>I was originally using a product that cost $40 per bottle which was</li>
            <li>It is actually cheaper and more effective than Lotrimin Ultra.</li>
            <li>I have read many of these reviews and here is the real scoop.</li>
            <li>but I have used it for a month twice a day and the bottle is still full.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and the pain stopped on application.  </li>
            <li>so this is by no means a quick solution.</li>
            <li>Got rid of a spot of tinea corporis on my wrist quickly.</li>
            <li>Worked very well, and very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>left foot is quite nice.</li>
            <li>but the true is after 2 months of using this nothing is happening the fungus are the same ,,but is ok</li>
            <li>mostly right after getting out of a hot bath.</li>
            <li>Hoping this will finally give me healthy skin on my hands once again.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because it said makes fingers and toes look and feel better, The problem was with several of my nails.</li>
            <li>DMSO is available on amazon or at a pharmacy in a natural grocery, or from a vet office/hospital.</li>
            <li>Fungus in skin around toes (Athletes Feet) cleared up after the first day.</li>
            <li>I tried many products in the last 2 years !</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen undecylenic acid works from first application.</li>
            <li>Before the first application I used a nail file to rub out the surface irregularities, which is the unsightly result of fungus.</li>
            <li>I then applied 1 drop to the discolored area of the nail being sure to get the fluid against the sides and bottom of the nail.</li>
            <li>Buying an extra one for my Mother-In-Law. :)</li>
            <li>Then I used a manicurists drill and filed the top of the nails as close to the skin underneath as possible.</li>
            <li>As you file the top, if you are close enough you will feel your toe burning.</li>
            <li>I would imagine that it would take 3-4 months for the entire nail to grow out, and that is when I will be able to (hopefully) give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>It took about four months of consistent application to achieve cure.  </li>
            <li>Each bottle lasts for most of a year because i only need 2 dabs with the brush a day.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first day- just using like the bottle days, twice a day.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 5 days now and my nails and the skin around them are back to perfectly healthy looking nails.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t exactly follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>I got very excited because it made a short term improvement.  </li>
            <li>did apply pretty much nightly for about a month and try to remember to keep it up now that it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li>No More Fungus is a good one because it is a high dose of Undecylenic Acid.</li>
            <li>and I am very encouraged.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work, Very running solution and the bottle leaks</li>
            <li>I was really looking for something for finger nails, but seems this is just for toes.  </li>
            <li>I have had to wait for the whole ghastly thing to grow out.</li>
            <li>Keep doing this until the nail is practically gone , the whole time treating the nails with ANY product.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why Amazon does this, very misleading advertisement for this product</li>
            <li>It is virtually oderless and dries fast.</li>
            <li>really doing the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I used it on my toenail and not using it for 4-weeks straight got me what I wanted...</li>
            <li>My nails are clearing up fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as Rx</li>
            <li>None of the drug store medications currently available in local drugstores work for me</li>
            <li>The real kicker is this isn&#x27;t even meant for nail fungus.</li>
            <li>Buy it, really works.</li>
            <li>the bottle says it is not supposed to be for nails, but it worked really well on my toenails.</li>
            <li>So naturally, I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>I applied freely and still have quite a bit left.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>One of few effective treatments against fungus infection</li>
            <li>(note - get the waterproof kind by imPress - I did not get a green spot from those).  </li>
            <li>a clear grown nail!!!</li>
            <li>It works to look beeter superficial but at long term does not cure the fungus.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to say, you can&#x27;t shine your skin, after you shower you can see your dry skin again with fungus, is a good cover up but not a cure.</li>
            <li>So far doing all right.</li>
            <li>I clipped my toenails to the quick and filed the top of my nails until the nail felt soft and slightly tender.</li>
            <li>THE TIME OF THE MORE CONVENTIONALLY USED MEDICATIONS.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the product yet, as I am first trying to get rid of the fungus naturally, using</li>
            <li>To my astonishing amazement my big toenails were not sensitive to being squeezed after the first day.  </li>
            <li>File the nails down to nothing, if it hurts wait til another night and file some more.</li>
            <li>I figured this 25% stuff is better than that with less.  </li>
            <li>I did research on the main ingredient that helps eliminate fungus.</li>
            <li>I filed my toenails back to the quick.</li>
            <li>So, folks, there is no time like the present to start getting your toenails as lovely as my left foot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- cut the nail as short as was possible without exposing the nail bed; did this weekly to be sure there was no exposed nail overhanging my toenail bed</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for nail fungus.</li>
            <li>I bought this when I was in high school about 4 or 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>It has to be more bushy and little shorter and stronger.</li>
            <li>More Fungus has a higher concentration of the active ingredient (25%) and only costs $10 and doesn&#x27;t need a prescription.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was gonna work for me, but I started to see a difference after a few weeks , and i like that it doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li>and I have a normal nail.  </li>
            <li>a nice thick brush to apply and to reach under the nail.</li>
            <li>Continued for a few more weeks after the new nail was in.  </li>
            <li>Continued for a few more weeks after the new nail was in.  </li>
            <li>I bought a tube of Campho Phenique, apply it to my big toenail morning a nite, and after four weeks no new evidence and healthy toenail is growing out.</li>
            <li>I think my right toenails were slower because it is easier working on my left foot.</li>
            <li>My toenails look like new nails</li>
            <li>It will not affect the nails themselves however, it WILL cure the fungus problem on your toes which will eventually grow new nails.</li>
            <li>Found it could take up to a year to grow a new nail, and that was even under doctor&#x27;s care with prescription drugs taken orally.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, but I have had fungi toe on both my big toes for over 2 years and its hard to heal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve try other at 5X the price and thanks for the quick delivery, Michael J.</li>
            <li>The fungus is the same from what I can tell, the skin around my nails is healthy and hydrated looking mainly because this is extremely oily.</li>
            <li>No More Fungus and have gotten more relief in a shorter period of time than anything else...</li>
            <li>At first I was debating on buy this product or not because of numerous of products that I had bought and had seen no results...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- applied the Sally Hansen after my daily shower; applied at the top edge of my toenail as well as on the top surface of the toenail where I had filed it flat and thin</li>
            <li>In a few weeks I could see new clean healthy nail beginning to grow, in a few months the effect was obvious, and in about 6 months the problem was completely cleared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been using lamisil for over 4 months with no results ( i was told it would take up to a year for the infection to clear and for the nail to fall out and regrow.  </li>
            <li>If you have the time to go on and on applying this and patiently waiting, you may clear your nail.</li>
            <li>I used this for a nail fungus, even though it states clearly on the bottle that it is not intended for this.  </li>
            <li>and clear up.  </li>
            <li>It will clear any systemic intrusions</li>
            <li>Apply only one drop directly to the affected nail, not too much is needed.</li>
            <li>only thing that works, is a REAL prescribed nail laquer..or laser treatment.</li>
            <li>after a month i can not see a marked improvement.</li>
            <li>Enough to really work with..</li>
            <li>Very oily feel, didn&#x27;t notice any improvement even after several weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>As others have mentioned it takes time as the old damaged nail must grow out completely.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;bad\\&quot; nail is almost completely grown out.</li>
            <li>It takes almost one year for a toenail to grow out completely.  </li>
            <li>I have long suffered from fairly mild but chronic toe fungus underneath both big toes.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I used this stuff religiously for about 4 months just to make sure I did it long enough.  </li>
            <li>For too many years the big toe on my left foot was black with fungus.  </li>
            <li>This one had the right active ingredient.</li>
            <li>My toe nail is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>I wanted something topical and heard about Jublia, so I actually went to the site where it was reviewed and most people with the same ailment said that the active ingredient does work</li>
            <li>There were others, but I chose Hanson because none of the others had such a large size for the same amount of money.</li>
            <li>You can pay five times more for the same ingredient in common drugstore remedies.</li>
            <li>It also is not as overwhelmingly repulsive-smelling as some of the other brush-on fungus cures on the market that use the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li>It has completely smoothed out one toe and really made a noticeable difference on the other.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product until the big toenail on my left foot is as pink and clear as the one on my right foot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using it unless I can see clearly that it is beginning to move back up the nail, in which case I will move on to a podiatrist.  </li>
            <li>big toe nail was almost completely destroyed by unsightly brown fungus.</li>
            <li>When I looked at the nail I could barely believe it.</li>
            <li>Expecting it to take the entire bottle, I quickly stroked it on and really barely looked at the nail for a few weeks of using it about twice a day.  </li>
            <li>It may have helped to fade it a tiny bit, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was that or the light filing that I have done several times.  </li>
            <li>I knew it was fungus just from seeing the commercials, but other than that, didn&#x27;t know much.  </li>
            <li>Two years and the infection got worse (larger, covered more surface</li>
            <li>As a runner, I&#x27;m used to the occassional dark or broken toenail and calloused skin, but whatever I had always cleared up on its own.  </li>
            <li>As soon there was significant brittle, I&#x27;d wait a few days and cut it down again.  </li>
            <li>Slow but steady progress against the fungus was observable as the toenail renewed with new growth from the nail bed</li>
            <li>It will absorb literally anything on your skin into your blood stream immediately, good or bad.</li>
            <li>Works ok, really the only way to treat the bad nail fungus is with Laser removal or Medication</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This product works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever!  </li>
            <li> The best price and it does work - it takes awhile.  </li>
            <li> It is the best fungicide, I have used.</li>
            <li> apply twice a day for best results or you probably will not get the result you need and paid for.</li>

            <li> This stuff is great</li>
            <li> I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> The thumb nail should take about 5 to 6 months to grow out, but I am so happy it is no longer splitting.</li>

            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> This is a good product after applying, rub in and the oil seeks into the nail bed.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen has always been good to me.</li>
            <li> Its a good idea to stop then.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> This is good but it seems to take a while.</li>
            <li> I take the time to read some of the reviews,,and they seen to be good ...</li>
            <li> Bought as  Sally&#x27;s products have a good reputation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> your stanky, itchy feet feel soooo much better!</li>
            <li> My Dr, even told me to have my liver tested during this treatment to make sure I was not overburdening my liver!</li>
            <li> Maybe I had more than a fungus!</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly.</li>
            <li> so I moved to home remedies in the meantime to see if I could get the remainder to go away on my own.  </li>
            <li> I had a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; fungus spot on my nail after wearing some &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; nails for a week that were not the waterproof kind.</li>
            <li> Although the vinegar is excellent for a whole host of ailments one could have, it did not work effectively on the toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and get laser treatment, but in all honesty it&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t proved to be effective for me.</li>
            <li> but it is effective</li>
            <li> Smells nice though.</li>
            <li> This is really doing a great job clearing up my problem!</li>
            <li> niceEshop manicure drill file works good, but is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> the more effective and expedient the medicine will work.</li>
            <li> Great product, much cheaper than getting a prescrioption</li>
            <li> plus it works quicker and better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got healthy nails now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product works for skin fungus just not nails.</li>
            <li> After these many, many months I still have the problem.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;no more fungus&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Since there are many strains of fungus or types.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after reading many reviews.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to use any powerful oral drugs and read good things about this, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be sure to file the nail before application and keep the nail trimmed.</li>
            <li> Seems to be OK for my nail fungus.</li>
            <li> not Onchomycosis which is what most people have looking for products like these.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, better then the medicine at the dermatologist recommend.</li>
            <li> I was also impressed by the price, which is very low for so many doses of product.</li>
            <li> It took almost a year for my toe nails to grow completely healthy.</li>
            <li> I cut off the white part (2/3 of the nail ) and applied on the skin and nail every morning and night with excellent results.</li>
            <li> love this product, want to show off my toe nails in the summer</li>
            <li> Works okay.  </li>
            <li> there are no horrible side effects as with Rx.</li>
            <li> Most OTC products, including this one, are marginal.  </li>
            <li> and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Guess if I had athletes foot, I would buy another bottle as is did clean that up!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great so far</li>
            <li> The nail is becoming clearer than it has been.</li>
            <li> I really think it is a good product.</li>
            <li> both my parents have fungus on their nails, it helped but didnt heal as fast as we wanted to, but a good product nevertheless</li>
            <li> I am not seeing any great change with this, however it came quickly and was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> No problems - easy transaction.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as strong smelling as before.</li>
            <li> Good ingredients high quiality</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Read the fine print?</li>
            <li> The first review with 5 stars makes it sound like this product is a magic cure with notable improvement in weeks.</li>
            <li> This little guy works perfectly.</li>
            <li> &quot; It was so cheap</li>
            <li> The brush to apply this is sooo cheap.</li>
            <li> Living fungus free.</li>
            <li> But since my primary purpose was to stop the spread of the fungus in my nail, it&#x27;s two stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked great for me, I only wish I had discovered it sonner.</li>
            <li> WHICH HAS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE FOR YEARS.I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li> Now, about seven months later, the fungus in the toenail is greatly diminished; I am not embarrassed to go without shoes and socks.  </li>
            <li> But, the nails on my right foot need more treatment.</li>
            <li> For this price though I figured it was worth a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a work in progress on that and very satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I was originally using a product that cost $40 per bottle which was</li>
            <li> It is actually cheaper and more effective than Lotrimin Ultra.</li>
            <li> I have read many of these reviews and here is the real scoop.</li>
            <li> but I have used it for a month twice a day and the bottle is still full.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and the pain stopped on application.  </li>
            <li> so this is by no means a quick solution.</li>
            <li> Got rid of a spot of tinea corporis on my wrist quickly.</li>
            <li> Worked very well, and very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> left foot is quite nice.</li>
            <li> but the true is after 2 months of using this nothing is happening the fungus are the same ,,but is ok</li>
            <li> mostly right after getting out of a hot bath.</li>
            <li> Hoping this will finally give me healthy skin on my hands once again.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because it said makes fingers and toes look and feel better, The problem was with several of my nails.</li>
            <li> DMSO is available on amazon or at a pharmacy in a natural grocery, or from a vet office/hospital.</li>
            <li> Fungus in skin around toes (Athletes Feet) cleared up after the first day.</li>
            <li> I tried many products in the last 2 years !</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen undecylenic acid works from first application.</li>
            <li> Before the first application I used a nail file to rub out the surface irregularities, which is the unsightly result of fungus.</li>
            <li> I then applied 1 drop to the discolored area of the nail being sure to get the fluid against the sides and bottom of the nail.</li>
            <li> Buying an extra one for my Mother-In-Law. :)</li>
            <li> Then I used a manicurists drill and filed the top of the nails as close to the skin underneath as possible.</li>
            <li> As you file the top, if you are close enough you will feel your toe burning.</li>
            <li> I would imagine that it would take 3-4 months for the entire nail to grow out, and that is when I will be able to (hopefully) give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> It took about four months of consistent application to achieve cure.  </li>
            <li> Each bottle lasts for most of a year because i only need 2 dabs with the brush a day.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first day- just using like the bottle days, twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 5 days now and my nails and the skin around them are back to perfectly healthy looking nails.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t exactly follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> I got very excited because it made a short term improvement.  </li>
            <li> did apply pretty much nightly for about a month and try to remember to keep it up now that it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li> No More Fungus is a good one because it is a high dose of Undecylenic Acid.</li>
            <li> and I am very encouraged.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, Very running solution and the bottle leaks</li>
            <li> I was really looking for something for finger nails, but seems this is just for toes.  </li>
            <li> I have had to wait for the whole ghastly thing to grow out.</li>
            <li> Keep doing this until the nail is practically gone , the whole time treating the nails with ANY product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why Amazon does this, very misleading advertisement for this product</li>
            <li> It is virtually oderless and dries fast.</li>
            <li> really doing the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I used it on my toenail and not using it for 4-weeks straight got me what I wanted...</li>
            <li> My nails are clearing up fast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as Rx</li>
            <li> None of the drug store medications currently available in local drugstores work for me</li>
            <li> The real kicker is this isn&#x27;t even meant for nail fungus.</li>
            <li> Buy it, really works.</li>
            <li> the bottle says it is not supposed to be for nails, but it worked really well on my toenails.</li>
            <li> So naturally, I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li> I applied freely and still have quite a bit left.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> One of few effective treatments against fungus infection</li>
            <li> (note - get the waterproof kind by imPress - I did not get a green spot from those).  </li>
            <li> a clear grown nail!!!</li>
            <li> It works to look beeter superficial but at long term does not cure the fungus.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to say, you can&#x27;t shine your skin, after you shower you can see your dry skin again with fungus, is a good cover up but not a cure.</li>
            <li> So far doing all right.</li>
            <li> I clipped my toenails to the quick and filed the top of my nails until the nail felt soft and slightly tender.</li>
            <li> THE TIME OF THE MORE CONVENTIONALLY USED MEDICATIONS.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product yet, as I am first trying to get rid of the fungus naturally, using</li>
            <li> To my astonishing amazement my big toenails were not sensitive to being squeezed after the first day.  </li>
            <li> File the nails down to nothing, if it hurts wait til another night and file some more.</li>
            <li> I figured this 25% stuff is better than that with less.  </li>
            <li> I did research on the main ingredient that helps eliminate fungus.</li>
            <li> I filed my toenails back to the quick.</li>
            <li> So, folks, there is no time like the present to start getting your toenails as lovely as my left foot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- cut the nail as short as was possible without exposing the nail bed; did this weekly to be sure there was no exposed nail overhanging my toenail bed</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for nail fungus.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I was in high school about 4 or 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> It has to be more bushy and little shorter and stronger.</li>
            <li> More Fungus has a higher concentration of the active ingredient (25%) and only costs $10 and doesn&#x27;t need a prescription.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was gonna work for me, but I started to see a difference after a few weeks , and i like that it doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> and I have a normal nail.  </li>
            <li> a nice thick brush to apply and to reach under the nail.</li>
            <li> Continued for a few more weeks after the new nail was in.  </li>
            <li> Continued for a few more weeks after the new nail was in.  </li>
            <li> I bought a tube of Campho Phenique, apply it to my big toenail morning a nite, and after four weeks no new evidence and healthy toenail is growing out.</li>
            <li> I think my right toenails were slower because it is easier working on my left foot.</li>
            <li> My toenails look like new nails</li>
            <li> It will not affect the nails themselves however, it WILL cure the fungus problem on your toes which will eventually grow new nails.</li>
            <li> Found it could take up to a year to grow a new nail, and that was even under doctor&#x27;s care with prescription drugs taken orally.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I have had fungi toe on both my big toes for over 2 years and its hard to heal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve try other at 5X the price and thanks for the quick delivery, Michael J.</li>
            <li> The fungus is the same from what I can tell, the skin around my nails is healthy and hydrated looking mainly because this is extremely oily.</li>
            <li> No More Fungus and have gotten more relief in a shorter period of time than anything else...</li>
            <li> At first I was debating on buy this product or not because of numerous of products that I had bought and had seen no results...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- applied the Sally Hansen after my daily shower; applied at the top edge of my toenail as well as on the top surface of the toenail where I had filed it flat and thin</li>
            <li> In a few weeks I could see new clean healthy nail beginning to grow, in a few months the effect was obvious, and in about 6 months the problem was completely cleared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been using lamisil for over 4 months with no results ( i was told it would take up to a year for the infection to clear and for the nail to fall out and regrow.  </li>
            <li> If you have the time to go on and on applying this and patiently waiting, you may clear your nail.</li>
            <li> I used this for a nail fungus, even though it states clearly on the bottle that it is not intended for this.  </li>
            <li> and clear up.  </li>
            <li> It will clear any systemic intrusions</li>
            <li> Apply only one drop directly to the affected nail, not too much is needed.</li>
            <li> only thing that works, is a REAL prescribed nail laquer..or laser treatment.</li>
            <li> after a month i can not see a marked improvement.</li>
            <li> Enough to really work with..</li>
            <li> Very oily feel, didn&#x27;t notice any improvement even after several weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> As others have mentioned it takes time as the old damaged nail must grow out completely.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;bad\\&quot; nail is almost completely grown out.</li>
            <li> It takes almost one year for a toenail to grow out completely.  </li>
            <li> I have long suffered from fairly mild but chronic toe fungus underneath both big toes.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I used this stuff religiously for about 4 months just to make sure I did it long enough.  </li>
            <li> For too many years the big toe on my left foot was black with fungus.  </li>
            <li> This one had the right active ingredient.</li>
            <li> My toe nail is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> I wanted something topical and heard about Jublia, so I actually went to the site where it was reviewed and most people with the same ailment said that the active ingredient does work</li>
            <li> There were others, but I chose Hanson because none of the others had such a large size for the same amount of money.</li>
            <li> You can pay five times more for the same ingredient in common drugstore remedies.</li>
            <li> It also is not as overwhelmingly repulsive-smelling as some of the other brush-on fungus cures on the market that use the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li> It has completely smoothed out one toe and really made a noticeable difference on the other.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product until the big toenail on my left foot is as pink and clear as the one on my right foot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using it unless I can see clearly that it is beginning to move back up the nail, in which case I will move on to a podiatrist.  </li>
            <li> big toe nail was almost completely destroyed by unsightly brown fungus.</li>
            <li> When I looked at the nail I could barely believe it.</li>
            <li> Expecting it to take the entire bottle, I quickly stroked it on and really barely looked at the nail for a few weeks of using it about twice a day.  </li>
            <li> It may have helped to fade it a tiny bit, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was that or the light filing that I have done several times.  </li>
            <li> I knew it was fungus just from seeing the commercials, but other than that, didn&#x27;t know much.  </li>
            <li> Two years and the infection got worse (larger, covered more surface</li>
            <li> As a runner, I&#x27;m used to the occassional dark or broken toenail and calloused skin, but whatever I had always cleared up on its own.  </li>
            <li> As soon there was significant brittle, I&#x27;d wait a few days and cut it down again.  </li>
            <li> Slow but steady progress against the fungus was observable as the toenail renewed with new growth from the nail bed</li>
            <li> It will absorb literally anything on your skin into your blood stream immediately, good or bad.</li>
            <li> Works ok, really the only way to treat the bad nail fungus is with Laser removal or Medication</li>
            <li> It is hard to see though, unless you are looking right over it.</li>
            <li> The problem with natural or other topical anti-fuguls is that to treat the fungus you have to get it under the nail to where the fungus is.</li>
            <li> SENSITIVE SKIN AREAS.ESPECIALLY JOCK ITCH!THIS IS THE SAME ACTIVE INGREDIENT FOUND IN NP27</li>
            <li> I have only a minor condition to be treated, and I used it religiously, and it did nothing.  </li>
            <li> so much for feeling better :-(</li>
            <li> I have had white dry brittle nails for ten years that haven&#x27;t responded to anything that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I used Lamisil for 6 months and while it did deter the infection from moving further up the nail, it did not completely eradicate the fungus.  </li>
            <li> I discovered that this inexpensive product has the same active ingredient as the more expensive similar products at my Walgreen store.  </li>
            <li> I filed the area down a bit, without going too far into the nail, and faithfully put this on.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to know when you have gone down thin enough.</li>
            <li> Cut off dead nail as new grew in.  </li>
            <li> Cut off dead nail as new grew in.  </li>
            <li> I wore only cotton socks, change them every day and took off the shoes during the day to keep my feet dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now twice a day morning and night, I have been cutting down and filling away the free end of my right and left big toes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in conjunction with the Blue Goo Nail Fungus treatment, one in the morning and the other in the evening, and have seen some obvious progress!  </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, there are other more expensive products to try.  </li>
            <li> Works well for minor fungus issues.</li>
            <li> Have been battling nail fungus for a long time, laser treatment....</li>
            <li> I knew this was going to take a long time.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful, but after 3 months of using the product frequently (2 - 4 times a day; with daily filing down of nail surface; working the brush down around nail edges, etc.)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- filed the top surface of the nail flat and thin; my toenail was thick and ridged underneath the fungus trail.  </li>
            <li> My doctor gave me two different prescriptions, one after the other,  for curing neither of which worked.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for a discolored big toenail and when I received it it clearly displays on the bottle that it is, and I am quoting from the bottle, \\&quot;This product is not effective on the scalp or nails.\\</li>
            <li> After application you can put socks on a dry nail in about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I put it all over my dry areas and then put socks on overnight.</li>
            <li> I now use this product after washing dishes daily, and can already tell a difference after only a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> is $60/bottle and is only 10% undecylenic acid, which is the active ingredient that will get through the nails.  </li>
            <li> It has been months since I bought this product for a single toenail problem that has plagued me for years.</li>
            <li> If you are into natural meds then use Tea Tree Oil or some other antiseptic but get it down to the nail where the problem is and that means attacking the nail!</li>
            <li> Cut the brittle nail down as low as I could.  </li>
            <li> There is only one tiny little spot that is still healing due to a blood clot.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting Eczema on my fingertips and spreading to the inside of my hands for the last two and a half years.</li>
            <li> Well the bottle is only half gone so I will use it until it is gone, but after not seeing any change in the fungus under the nails, I am not holding out hope.  </li>
            <li> I was judicious in following the instructions and applying it twice a day for a month and a half.  </li>
            <li> I had this little bottle for years and finally had to order another.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out ,but after nearly a month of use I would say that it looks as if the damaged area of my nails, which went about 2/3 the way down my nails, is now about 1/2 way down my nail, which is slightly improved.</li>
            <li> There are times my feet get real dry and</li>
            <li> This stuff works AT LEAST as well as the Lamisil and is far cheaper and easier on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to go to a podiatrist for the Lamisil prescrips, but that became a drag esp.</li>
            <li> I figured it&#x27;s only a few dollars, and if it wasn&#x27;t working after a couple of months, I&#x27;d try something else or go to the</li>
            <li> Looked down one day and saw I had a dark brittle big toe nail.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work so far, it takes a long time to determine positive results, also depends on how bad your fungal is.</li>
            <li> No More Fungus keeps my 50 year chronic athlete&#x27;s foot next to my little toe from being a problem as long as I remember to use it once a day.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the other reviews but this product didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> but I read some of the other reviews and thought it may work.</li>
            <li> Use for other fungus, I guess</li>
            <li> There are no more white spots.</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen No More Fungus, 1.3 Fluid Ounce seem to be working</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I sent for this.</li>
            <li> you still have to wait for it to grow out --- and this was only a topical green from water under an artificial nail fungus, not the type that gets into the whole nail and turns it thick and yellow.  </li>
            <li> So noticing this product had the maximum strength of its active ingredient and was inexpensive</li>
            <li> The active ingredient,undecylenic acid 25% was never indicated in the literature and advertisement when purchased.</li>
            <li> Half bottle gone and minimal effect, it does work but slightly.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks small but it goes a long ways, after my 6 month usage there is at least 3/4 of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> Early in the game</li>
            <li> really worked well and was much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> The nail would just split and I had had to file it down, exposing the nail bed.</li>
            <li> but, and I have tried lots of other things!</li>
            <li> when you apply it they devide in half.</li>
            <li> That nasty yellow toenail color is gone....and in an amount to be able put on a generous amount.  </li>
            <li> BUT NOT EXACTLY MILD</li>
            <li> I previously had no nail where the nail came out of the cuticle.</li>
            <li> It smells slightly antiseptic</li>
            <li> no matter how tight I tighten the cap.</li>
            <li> And with summer coming I need to put a stop to this little problem.</li>
            <li> It looks like a little bottle</li>
            <li> Theres a trick, Get a rotary style nail file and wear the nail down, keep them that way so the liquid works,,,,,ANY liquid for fungus!</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t do anything for the fungus just another disappointing waste of money.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s clear nail behind it!</li>
            <li> Everyday my toenails would get whiter looking and I would cut my toenails to reveal what looked like dead fungus on the underside.  </li>
            <li> Bleach will work every few days.</li>
            <li> In my case this took about 6 months, but I could see improvement within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!This product does not work.</li>
            <li> Three times EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months now, and no problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few months now, and no problems.</li>
            <li> In August, 2012, I grew impatient with this condition and set out in search of a product to cure it.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get rid of the fungus and the push is too weak too long for my test.  </li>
            <li> Without giving you a lot of disgusting TMI, I will say that this product works in as little as one application for all types of skin fungus and most nail fungus, too.</li>
            <li> I have used prescription Ointments and cremes, with very little relief...</li>
            <li> So for me, this was a very inexpensive way to get rid of a bad nail.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it is working.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is formulated to paint around the toe nails on the skin only.</li>
            <li> No More Fungus at Walgreens, with 25% undecylenic acid.  </li>
            <li> A small town pharmacist turned me on to it.</li>
            <li> HAVE FOUND THAT UNDECYLENIC WILL USUALLY ERADICATE AN INFECTION IN ABOUT 1/3</li>
            <li> but it usually takes time and price was</li>
            <li> but you gotta be on top of cutting all the bad nail parts.</li>
            <li> The applicator was not very good.</li>
            <li> I read nail fungus is hard to treat since it&#x27;s under the nails and medications won&#x27;t penetrate unless taking a prescribed pill.</li>
            <li> Hard to find the correct fungus removal.</li>
            <li> It could be because my nails are slow to grow out.  </li>
            <li> have tried tenacide and now this, but it is a slow process.  </li>
            <li> NO more problems!  </li>
            <li> No more fungus!</li>
            <li> they were not too bad, but enough to where I needed something.</li>
            <li> Not a good choice.</li>
            <li> In fact, it even made it worse in</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Had no noticeable effect on fungus, seemed to make it worse in fact</li>
            <li> Alas</li>
            <li> In addition,the product was falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> Forget tough actin tinactin!</li>
            <li> Seems crazy</li>
            <li> The smell was so toxic it would have been impossible to put on a person&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> I have it bad on one foot.</li>
            <li> This product works but not for a bad problem.</li>
            <li> I use it every night after the shower and my nails were bad.  </li>
            <li> and of course the oral medicine has bad side effects.  </li>
            <li> My husband have really bad fungus ..</li>
            <li> Smells bad and states it&#x27;s not for nail fungus.</li>
            <li> Depending on how bad your situation is of course.</li>
            <li> After a painful night of throbbing from my infected toenail, i ordered this product.</li>
            <li> Worthless.  </li>
            <li> This product was a terrible disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because I thought I was buying something to help with my finger nail fungus.</li>
            <li> and it is literally kicking the crap out of my fungus UNDER the nail!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worthless.  Just another FAD fungal treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing that works, is a REAL prescribed nail laquer..or laser treatment.</li>
            <li> Product came before Estimated Delivery Date.  No problems - easy transaction.  Haven&#x27;t used the product yet, as I am first trying to get rid of the fungus naturally, using epsom salt soaks eith essential oils.  I will use this product: 1) If the homeopathic remedy doesn&#x27;t work and/or 2) To keep the fungus from returning, oce gone.  I will purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product was a terrible disappointment. The smell was so toxic it would have been impossible to put on a person&#x27;s nails. Then it said to not even put it on the affected nail - but on the skin! Not a good choice.</li>
            <li> Early in the game but it seems to have had good results</li>
            <li> after a month i can not see a marked improvement. Not sure it is working. will continue for another month</li>
            <li> I had been using lamisil for over 4 months with no results ( i was told it would take up to a year for the infection to clear and for the nail to fall out and regrow.  After a painful night of throbbing from my infected toenail, i ordered this product. Shipping was quick and the pain stopped on application.  Three weeks later my nail is clearing up and looking almost normal!!!!It looks like it is actually healing from the nail bed so I am ecstatic.  Great product, much cheaper than getting a prescrioption plus it works quicker and better. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got a water fungus in four fingernails.  I now use this product after washing dishes daily, and can already tell a difference after only a few weeks.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a discolored big toenail and when I received it it clearly displays on the bottle that it is, and I am quoting from the bottle, \\&quot;This product is not effective on the scalp or nails.\\&quot; It was so cheap I&#x27;m not going to return it, but just don&#x27;t purchase for nail fungus.</li>
            <li> Had a persistent infection in the nails of my left foot from years of wearing nail polish and the only remedy my doctor could offer was something that I had to ingest for 4-6 months that would adversely affect my liver. I wanted something topical and heard about Jublia, so I actually went to the site where it was reviewed and most people with the same ailment said that the active ingredient does work but Jublia requires a prescription, is $60/bottle and is only 10% undecylenic acid, which is the active ingredient that will get through the nails.  No More Fungus has a higher concentration of the active ingredient (25%) and only costs $10 and doesn&#x27;t need a prescription.  It&#x27;s worked great on the fungus and I&#x27;ve got healthy nails now.</li>
            <li> its the only thing that I know works!!</li>
            <li> I have been fighting Eczema on my fingertips and spreading to the inside of my hands for the last two and a half years. I have used prescription Ointments and cremes, with very little relief...I have just started using the Sally Hansen No More Fungus and have gotten more relief in a shorter period of time than anything else...And believe me I have tried everything including Tea Tree oils and soaps, lotions, Apple Cider Vinegar(natural), and gloves...You name it I have tried it! This stuff is great so far and I am very encouraged.  Hoping this will finally give me healthy skin on my hands once again.  Kathryn</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - IT DOES NOT WORK.  I have only a minor condition to be treated, and I used it religiously, and it did nothing.  In fact, it even made it worse in that is dyed my toes a hideous bluish color.</li>
            <li> OMG! Forget tough actin tinactin! A couple applications at night with cotton socks on and your stanky, itchy feet feel soooo much better!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it said makes fingers and toes look and feel better, The problem was with several of my nails. Then when it arrives, says does not work on nails..so much for feeling better :-(</li>
            <li> Used the same nail file as a hippie roomie who has nail fungus and didn&#x27;t tell me they used my file. Also got athlete&#x27;s foot from them. Sally hansen worked only after I used it with DMSO. DMSO helps draw whatever is on skin surfaces into the skin. It will absorb literally anything on your skin into your blood stream immediately, good or bad. I read nail fungus is hard to treat since it&#x27;s under the nails and medications won&#x27;t penetrate unless taking a prescribed pill. I tried sally hansen by itself, but with no luck. I pre-mixed the acid with DMSO 50/50 in the Sally Hansen bottle, used as directed on the sally bottle, and the fungus is GONE!  DMSO is available on amazon or at a pharmacy in a natural grocery, or from a vet office/hospital. Seems crazy but it worked!</li>
            <li> I found this listed under toenail fungus.........not for this! Read the fine print?.......I&#x27;m sure the product works for skin fungus just not nails.</li>
            <li> The brush to apply this is sooo cheap. I think there is 6 strands to&lt;br /&gt;the brush and when you apply it they devide in half. There should&lt;br /&gt;be a nice thick brush to apply and to reach under the nail.</li>
            <li> One of few effective treatments against fungus infection</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, Very running solution and the bottle leaks no matter how tight I tighten the cap. Meh</li>
            <li> I have had fungus and yellow toes forever, this product seemed to be the only one that actually worked, my yellow toes are almost healed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a paint-on, fungal nail treatment that I could wear underneath toenail polish.  Unfortunately, this is formulated to paint around the toe nails on the skin only.</li>
            <li> It has been months since I bought this product for a single toenail problem that has plagued me for years. After these many, many months I still have the problem. It appears that I may have had improvement but it hasn&#x27;t as yet cleared up so this is by no means a quick solution. If you have the time to go on and on applying this and patiently waiting, you may clear your nail. I am still trying and waiting.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the other reviews but this product didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;m still looking for something that will do the job and is affordable.</li>
            <li> Got to admit, my skin fungus is 90% gone after 4 weeks of use, but the toenail fungus is still raging away despite my three times a day application.  Well the bottle is only half gone so I will use it until it is gone, but after not seeing any change in the fungus under the nails, I am not holding out hope.  Guess if I had athletes foot, I would buy another bottle as is did clean that up!</li>
            <li> That nasty yellow toenail color is gone....and in an amount to be able put on a generous amount.  Not like the skimpy amount in those pen types.  Same stuff.  Enough to really work with..</li>
            <li> I know this isn&#x27;t for nail fungus but I read some of the other reviews and thought it may work. It is not working for the nail issue and I can&#x27;t say if it would work for anything else because I have not tried it. This is why I gave it a neutral three stars/</li>
            <li> Fungus in skin around toes (Athletes Feet) cleared up after the first day. Working wonders on the nail fungus after 1 week. Finally! Something over the counter, that works.</li>
            <li> I tried many products in the last 2 years ! No cure for my fungus. This product did it !&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sally !</li>
            <li> great. Works for me.  It feels like oil. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I was really looking for something for finger nails, but seems this is just for toes.  I was very disappointed because I thought I was buying something to help with my finger nail fungus.</li>
            <li> I used this for a nail fungus, even though it states clearly on the bottle that it is not intended for this.  It seems to be helping, however.  I used Lamisil for 6 months and while it did deter the infection from moving further up the nail, it did not completely eradicate the fungus.  It could be because my nails are slow to grow out.  However, my doctor did not want to keep me on the medication for longer so I moved to home remedies in the meantime to see if I could get the remainder to go away on my own.  I have been using this in conjunction with the Blue Goo Nail Fungus treatment, one in the morning and the other in the evening, and have seen some obvious progress!  I&#x27;ll continue using it unless I can see clearly that it is beginning to move back up the nail, in which case I will move on to a podiatrist.  For this price though I figured it was worth a try!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is great and it works too. My husband uses it o his toe nails and it works!!!!Thank You!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered incorrectly. Not for what I needed. Will work on skin but not under nails which I did not read.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  I had a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; fungus spot on my nail after wearing some &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; nails for a week that were not the waterproof kind. (note - get the waterproof kind by imPress - I did not get a green spot from those).  I filed the area down a bit, without going too far into the nail, and faithfully put this on.  Basically it did nothing.... I have had to wait for the whole ghastly thing to grow out. It may have helped to fade it a tiny bit, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was that or the light filing that I have done several times.  &amp;#34;no more fungus&amp;#34;  ha!  you still have to wait for it to grow out --- and this was only a topical green from water under an artificial nail fungus, not the type that gets into the whole nail and turns it thick and yellow.  It would NEVER work on that.  My husband has had to get laser treatment on that type, several times, and use topical brush on meds from the doctor afterwards and it still took almost a year for it to look like it was improving.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever!  Would use again if needed!  Hope I never do, but I know where to go for what I need!</li>
            <li> Tried and gave up on it.</li>
            <li> Works well for minor fungus issues. Cured my toenails. I would recommend he use this product again. Living fungus free.</li>
            <li> I have it bad on one foot. Half bottle gone and minimal effect, it does work but slightly. Since there are many strains of fungus or types. Hard to find the correct fungus removal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for a fungus remover for my nails and the picture on the front of this box showed a foot or a hand with nails, so I purchase this product, When I received this product, it says on the box &amp;#34;this product should not be used on nails&amp;#34;. I wouldn&#x27;t have paid the shipping charges if I knew what it said on the box.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after reading many reviews.  Worked very well, and very quickly.  NO more problems!  Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I used on a fungal infection in my toenail. Didn&#x27;t cure it, but with twice daily application and filing, it helped improve the appearance quite a but, and I have tried lots of other things!</li>
            <li> I had a couple of yellowed big toe nails that were separating from the toes AND hurt when pressured applied to them. I just ignored these toenails for years because I didnt care what they looked like, but when they started hurting, it was time to act! I saw this Sally Hansen No More Fungus at Walgreens, with 25% undecylenic acid.  I figured this 25% stuff is better than that with less.  I used the brush applicator to put the medicine between the toenail and the toe bed to saturate under the toenail once a day (in the morning).  To my astonishing amazement my big toenails were not sensitive to being squeezed after the first day.  Secondly, I used this stuff religiously for about 4 months just to make sure I did it long enough.  Everyday my toenails would get whiter looking and I would cut my toenails to reveal what looked like dead fungus on the underside.  I wish I could post before and after pictures of these two rascals because you would not believe the drastic improvement!!  My toenails look like new nails and I would recommend this product to anyone with fungus.  I know the box says not for nail fungus, but this stuff WORKED for me!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get rid of the fungus and the push is too weak too long for my test.  It has to be more bushy and little shorter and stronger.</li>
            <li> Item was leaking when it arrived. 0 star.  I still used whatever was left but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Keeps my toe fungus at bay.</li>
            <li> The applicator was not very good. It was frayed and I could not apply the liquid properly. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> spend money for nothing</li>
            <li> I am not seeing any great change with this, however it came quickly and was reasonably priced.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I have had fungi toe on both my big toes for over 2 years and its hard to heal.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried tenacide and now this, but it is a slow process.  Went to doctor for laser and some pills to&lt;br /&gt;try and clear up.  This is a good product after applying, rub in and the oil seeks into the nail bed.</li>
            <li> I have read many of these reviews and here is the real scoop. The first review with 5 stars makes it sound like this product is a magic cure with notable improvement in weeks. The one with 1 star says his Dr. told him the only cure was to take oral drugs. Think about it, oral drugs put poison in your bloodstream and poisons the fungus. My Dr, even told me to have my liver tested during this treatment to make sure I was not overburdening my liver! Forget that! The problem with natural or other topical anti-fuguls is that to treat the fungus you have to get it under the nail to where the fungus is. To treat the fungus with any product you must attack the nails. File the nails down to nothing, if it hurts wait til another night and file some more. Keep doing this until the nail is practically gone , the whole time treating the nails with ANY product. Sally Hansen No More Fungus is a good one because it is a high dose of Undecylenic Acid. Bleach will work every few days. IF you use a product use it two or three times a day. If you are into natural meds then use Tea Tree Oil or some other antiseptic but get it down to the nail where the problem is and that means attacking the nail! This will take time, 6 months to a year, every night and every morning.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful, but after 3 months of using the product frequently (2 - 4 times a day; with daily filing down of nail surface; working the brush down around nail edges, etc.), changing and washing socks often, sterilizing shoes with UV sterilizer..... fungus has spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one improvement I had was that generalized soreness around one affected toenail did stop after two or three weeks of use and hasn&#x27;t returned. But since my primary purpose was to stop the spread of the fungus in my nail, it&#x27;s two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off to the podiatrist I go.</li>
            <li> works.&lt;br /&gt;Takes time - because there are thousands of types of Fungii and types of infection - total cure tales time.&lt;br /&gt;If it is a topical skin infection this will work well. But for systemic infections where it manifests here and there on skin you need multi-prong strategy.&lt;br /&gt;1) Use this topical oil&lt;br /&gt;2) Take oral undecylenic acid pills like Candida Force or Thorne SF722&lt;br /&gt;3) Get off sugars and ROH.&lt;br /&gt;I had a topical infection for which I used OTC antifungals, prescription ointments, Pills - They give 10 day prescriptions - it just kept coming back.&lt;br /&gt;This Sally Hansen undecylenic acid works from first application. But I will use it for next four months daily.&lt;br /&gt;I am so fed up - I am planning a six month strategy mentioned above. It will clear any systemic intrusions also.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t get to what it is in one day - it wouldn&#x27;t get back to what it was in one day either.&lt;br /&gt;- her Hubby</li>
            <li> This product does virtually nothing.  Note that it is does not work on nails.</li>
            <li> Searched under toenail fungus and this showed up when recieved not to be used on nails, don&#x27;t know why Amazon does this, very misleading advertisement for this product</li>
            <li> Bought this for my left foot. On it are 3 nails that have fungus. It will not affect the nails themselves however, it WILL cure the fungus problem on your toes which will eventually grow new nails. I&#x27;m a work in progress on that and very satisfied with the results so far. Nothing else I tried even came close. I even used something I take as a health benefit all the time Apple Cider Vinegar. Although the vinegar is excellent for a whole host of ailments one could have, it did not work effectively on the toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> Seems to work so far, it takes a long time to determine positive results, also depends on how bad your fungal is.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was gonna work for me, but I started to see a difference after a few weeks , and i like that it doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now twice a day morning and night, I have been cutting down and filling away the free end of my right and left big toes. The fungus is the same from what I can tell, the skin around my nails is healthy and hydrated looking mainly because this is extremely oily. I will continue to use this and get laser treatment, but in all honesty it&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t proved to be effective for me.</li>
            <li> Does not work since the fungus is actually under the nail. Ask your doctor...</li>
            <li> Very oily feel, didn&#x27;t notice any improvement even after several weeks of use.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and I can see the difference when I go get my pedicure! The nail is becoming clearer than it has been. I really think it is a good product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great but you gotta be on top of cutting all the bad nail parts. It definately beats perscription pills from what i hear but for me its the price that satisfies me and quality</li>
            <li> Have been battling nail fungus for a long time, laser treatment....Nothing.....Try this try that...Nothing. I read a review on another product for nail fungus and saw that this stuff was recommended and it is literally kicking the crap out of my fungus UNDER the nail! Theres a trick, Get a rotary style nail file and wear the nail down, keep them that way so the liquid works,,,,,ANY liquid for fungus! Sally Hansen is working so Im sticking with it. niceEshop manicure drill file works good, but is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This was the answer for my toe nail fungus problem, it worked 100% for me. As others have mentioned it takes time as the old damaged nail must grow out completely. In my case this took about 6 months, but I could see improvement within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big toe nail was almost completely destroyed by unsightly brown fungus. I did not want to use any powerful oral drugs and read good things about this, so I gave it a try. Before the first application I used a nail file to rub out the surface irregularities, which is the unsightly result of fungus. I then applied 1 drop to the discolored area of the nail being sure to get the fluid against the sides and bottom of the nail. I followed this proceedure about 3 times a week, mostly right after getting out of a hot bath. By soaking the foot the nail softens and helps the product penetrate. In a few weeks I could see new clean healthy nail beginning to grow, in a few months the effect was obvious, and in about 6 months the problem was completely cleared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to file the nail before application and keep the nail trimmed. The bottle looks small but it goes a long ways, after my 6 month usage there is at least 3/4 of the bottle left. Apply only one drop directly to the affected nail, not too much is needed. It is virtually oderless and dries fast. After application you can put socks on a dry nail in about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for nail fungus. It worked great for me, I only wish I had discovered it sonner.</li>
            <li> really worked well and was much less expensive.  Good ingredients high quiality</li>
            <li> Had no noticeable effect on fungus, seemed to make it worse in fact</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. I have long suffered from fairly mild but chronic toe fungus underneath both big toes. I used to go to a podiatrist for the Lamisil prescrips, but that became a drag esp. with all the required liver tests, etc. This stuff works AT LEAST as well as the Lamisil and is far cheaper and easier on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did apply pretty much nightly for about a month and try to remember to keep it up now that it&#x27;s summer and I sport polish on my toenails. It has completely smoothed out one toe and really made a noticeable difference on the other. Whatever the formula, Sally Hansen has managed to make even the tea tree oil in here smell OK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this product in record time by mail. Sally Hansen has always been good to me. No more fungus!</li>
            <li> Seems to be OK for my nail fungus.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!This product does not work. Saw a podiatrist today and he explained that a toe nail fungus has to be treated with oral medication or laser treatment.</li>
            <li> Bought for toenails, but product label says it&#x27;s not for that use.  Use for other fungus, I guess</li>
            <li> I was originally using a product that cost $40 per bottle which was&lt;br /&gt;not really doing the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff just works!  Buying an extra one for my Mother-In-Law. :)</li>
            <li> did not work on my toe nail fungus problem.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of Campho Phenique, apply it to my big toenail morning a nite, and after four weeks no new evidence and healthy toenail is growing out. A small town pharmacist turned me on to it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work. There is no known topical cure for toe fungus since its blood borne and anything topical will not get to where it needs to.&lt;br /&gt;This might work for a superficial fungus, but not Onchomycosis which is what most people have looking for products like these.</li>
            <li> At first I was debating on buy this product or not because of numerous of products that I had bought and had seen no results...but I bought it and yes it does say skin and cuticle fungus only but I used it on my toenail and not using it for 4-weeks straight got me what I wanted...a clear grown nail!!! It works like magic!!!</li>
            <li> I did research on the main ingredient that helps eliminate fungus. This one had the right active ingredient. There were others, but I chose Hanson because none of the others had such a large size for the same amount of money. Shipping was 4 days! And with summer coming I need to put a stop to this little problem. I will update on how it goes- when it goes!&lt;br /&gt;Day #5&lt;br /&gt;I followed the advice of a review I read. I filed my toenails back to the quick. Then I used a manicurists drill and filed the top of the nails as close to the skin underneath as possible. Its easy to know when you have gone down thin enough. As you file the top, if you are close enough you will feel your toe burning. Its a good idea to stop then. You see it isn&#x27;t the nail that has fungus- it is below, and around it. And the closer you can get the medicine to that area- the more effective and expedient the medicine will work. I&#x27;m all for expediting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Please be diligent and thorough. It will take awhile. The instructions say do not use ON the nail. That is because the fungus is UNDER the nail. I clipped my toenails to the quick and filed the top of my nails until the nail felt soft and slightly tender. Three times EVERYDAY I applied the product. I wanted my toenails to look beautiful for this summer. Well, almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My left foot is quite nice. But, the nails on my right foot need more treatment. Oh, and I STILL have enough product left. I think my right toenails were slower because it is easier working on my left foot. I knew this was going to take a long time. But, the process works. So, folks, there is no time like the present to start getting your toenails as lovely as my left foot.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, better then the medicine at the dermatologist recommend. I would buy this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> THIS FUNGICIDE IS BASED ON UNDECYLENIC ACID.A VERY EFFECTIVE BUT NOT EXACTLY MILD MEDICATION.DO NOT USE ON SENSITIVE SKIN AREAS.ESPECIALLY JOCK ITCH!THIS IS THE SAME ACTIVE INGREDIENT FOUND IN NP27 WHICH HAS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE FOR YEARS.I HAVE FOUND THAT UNDECYLENIC WILL USUALLY ERADICATE AN INFECTION IN ABOUT 1/3 THE TIME OF THE MORE CONVENTIONALLY USED MEDICATIONS.</li>
            <li> Without giving you a lot of disgusting TMI, I will say that this product works in as little as one application for all types of skin fungus and most nail fungus, too. It also is not as overwhelmingly repulsive-smelling as some of the other brush-on fungus cures on the market that use the same active ingredient. I was also impressed by the price, which is very low for so many doses of product.</li>
            <li> I have had white dry brittle nails for ten years that haven&#x27;t responded to anything that I&#x27;ve tried. - nail hardeners, buffing, wearing no nail polish, various nail treatments, etc. All the pictures that I have looked at online of nails with fungus don&#x27;t look like mine, but I figured I&#x27;d give this a try anyway because I feel like the \\&quot;whiteness\\&quot; on my nails is \\&quot;spreading\\&quot;. The jury is still out ,but after nearly a month of use I would say that it looks as if the damaged area of my nails, which went about 2/3 the way down my nails, is now about 1/2 way down my nail, which is slightly improved. I would imagine that it would take 3-4 months for the entire nail to grow out, and that is when I will be able to (hopefully) give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;3 months later... This product worked when nothing in 10 years worked on my nails! As I said, I didn&#x27;t think I had nail fungus because my nails were just white and peeling,not yellow and gross like the pictures of nail fungus I saw online, but the white never went away. I have used this product for 3 months now; I just use it once a week on my manicure day. The \\&quot;bad\\&quot; nail is almost completely grown out. There are no more white spots. This product worked for me. I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> both my parents have fungus on their nails, it helped but didnt heal as fast as we wanted to, but a good product nevertheless</li>
            <li> It took almost a year for my toe nails to grow completely healthy. I cut off the white part (2/3 of the nail ) and applied on the skin and nail every morning and night with excellent results. I wore only cotton socks, change them every day and took off the shoes during the day to keep my feet dry. I had tried laser but one treatment wasn&#x27;t enough. I tried oral Lamisil 3 times in 5 years and it didn&#x27;t work . My last option was this Sally&#x27;s Antifugal but I think the consistency and the dryness helped a lot in the healing process.</li>
            <li> excellent product works quickly would definately  recommend the order isn&#x27;t great but it is effective would use again if needed</li>
            <li> «:::P:::» «:::E:::» «:::R:::» «:::F:::» «:::E:::» «:::C:::» «:::T:::»</li>
            <li> I tested the acidity of this product with litmus paper and another pH paper with a scale of 0 - 13. Neither of the papers changed color even the slightest.</li>
            <li> My nails are clearing up fast. The smell is not bad,&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, want to show off my toe nails in the summer</li>
            <li> I use it and take a while to improve my fungus foot nail and hope thing improving as well. good</li>
            <li> Works okay.  I believe if you have a problem with toe nail fungus,  you&#x27;ll have to get something from doctor or laser removal.  This product works but not for a bad problem.</li>
            <li> Product came as described and on time delivery</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as Rx but it does work and there are no horrible side effects as with Rx.</li>
            <li> It cured a brown toenail within 2 months or so. I applied the product after showering and drying, about twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> The best price and it does work - it takes awhile.  I use it every night after the shower and my nails were bad.  They are clearing up!</li>
            <li> I had a fungal toenail infection (NOT bacterial) for the last ten years.  My doctor gave me two different prescriptions, one after the other,  for curing neither of which worked.  I diligently applied those scrips daily and removed them weekly per directions for a year each.  Two years and the infection got worse (larger, covered more surface area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried several homeopathic remedies.  Used them according to the folk lore on the Internet.  Examples: vinegar soaks, tea tree oil, etc., etc.  None of them worked.  Another couple of years move by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting together some Internet research, I decided to try Campho Phenique.  I got very excited because it made a short term improvement.  Alas and alack, the infection would always return.  The Campho Phenique would just beat it back for a short while and then it would return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sally Hansen order I placed was a &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve got nothing to lose&amp;#34; type of proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the regimen I followed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- cut the nail as short as was possible without exposing the nail bed; did this weekly to be sure there was no exposed nail overhanging my toenail bed&lt;br /&gt;- filed the top surface of the nail flat and thin; my toenail was thick and ridged underneath the fungus trail.  I actually overdid the filing a couple of times and filed through the nail&lt;br /&gt;- applied the Sally Hansen after my daily shower; applied at the top edge of my toenail as well as on the top surface of the toenail where I had filed it flat and thin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked.  I consider my toenail fungus cured.  It took about four months of consistent application to achieve cure.  Slow but steady progress against the fungus was observable as the toenail renewed with new growth from the nail bed</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day for about 3-4 weeks and my thumb nail has grown in about 3/16 of an inch. I previously had no nail where the nail came out of the cuticle. The nail would just split and I had had to file it down, exposing the nail bed. I no longer have to wear a bandage over this nail all the time. The thumb nail should take about 5 to 6 months to grow out, but I am so happy it is no longer splitting.</li>
            <li> I tried to get in touch with the company and they just never answer. I suffer and this product put my feet and skin on fire, boy did it burn</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen No More Fungus, 1.3 Fluid Ounce seem to be working but it usually takes time and price was&lt;br /&gt;great. I&#x27;ve try other at 5X the price and thanks for the quick delivery, Michael J.</li>
            <li> I used this product as soon as I got it. I used it twice a day for 4 weeks. My toe nail is almost back to normal. There is only one tiny little spot that is still healing due to a blood clot. It is hard to see though, unless you are looking right over it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I switched to this after California banned Lotrimin Ultra. Sally Hansen No More Fungus keeps my 50 year chronic athlete&#x27;s foot next to my little toe from being a problem as long as I remember to use it once a day. None of the drug store medications currently available in local drugstores work for me so I order this from Amazon. Each bottle lasts for most of a year because i only need 2 dabs with the brush a day. I wipe the brush on the rim of the bottle because it only needs to be damp and not dripping. It is actually cheaper and more effective than Lotrimin Ultra. It smells slightly antiseptic but you never notice it after it is applied.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any results after 2 weeks of use. Will continue using and re-evaluate.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t do anything for the fungus just another disappointing waste of money. Our government shouldn&#x27;t let these companies stay in business.</li>
            <li> I have had a fungal toenail for years.  I was told that any topical treatments would never work- and of course the oral medicine has bad side effects.  After reading the other reviews I sent for this. Expecting it to take the entire bottle, I quickly stroked it on and really barely looked at the nail for a few weeks of using it about twice a day.  When I looked at the nail I could barely believe it. It has grown halfway out and there&#x27;s clear nail behind it! The real kicker is this isn&#x27;t even meant for nail fungus.Thank you Sally Hansen</li>
            <li> This is good but it seems to take a while.</li>
            <li> So far doing all right.</li>
            <li> My husband have really bad fungus ..I take the time to read some of the reviews,,and they seen to be good ...but the true is after 2 months of using this nothing is happening the fungus are the same ,,but is ok I think we just need to trie different things ....</li>
            <li> I bought this when I was in high school about 4 or 5 years ago. This did not work for me at all. It&#x27;s just like liquidy oil. Smells nice though.</li>
            <li> It is the best fungicide, I have used. Buy it, really works.</li>
            <li> Kept fungus at bay, did not cure it.  Most OTC products, including this one, are marginal.  Have some luck with cocoanut oil. Try it.</li>
            <li> This really works! It looks like a little bottle but I have used it for a month twice a day and the bottle is still full.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly. the bottle says it is not supposed to be for nails, but it worked really well on my toenails. they were not too bad, but enough to where I needed something. I noticed a difference after the first day- just using like the bottle days, twice a day. I have been using it for about 5 days now and my nails and the skin around them are back to perfectly healthy looking nails. I definitely recommend this- especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Looked down one day and saw I had a dark brittle big toe nail.  It truly snuck up on me.  Well, maybe it didn&#x27;t.  As a runner, I&#x27;m used to the occassional dark or broken toenail and calloused skin, but whatever I had always cleared up on its own.  This time it looked different--more brittle than ever before--so I went researching.  I knew it was fungus just from seeing the commercials, but other than that, didn&#x27;t know much.  Found it could take up to a year to grow a new nail, and that was even under doctor&#x27;s care with prescription drugs taken orally.  So noticing this product had the maximum strength of its active ingredient and was inexpensive, I decided to give it a try.  I figured it&#x27;s only a few dollars, and if it wasn&#x27;t working after a couple of months, I&#x27;d try something else or go to the doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been almost six months now and I have a normal nail.  So naturally, I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t exactly follow the directions.  Here&#x27;s what I did:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Cut the brittle nail down as low as I could.  As it regrew, it grew back stronger and reattached to skin.  As soon there was significant brittle, I&#x27;d wait a few days and cut it down again.  I cut every 3-4 weeks, only the brittle portion, which was smaller each time.  From what I read in various articles, I was \\&quot;growing out\\&quot; the fungus.&lt;br /&gt;2)  Didn&#x27;t necessarily apply twice per day.  I applied after showering, so sometimes it was only once per day.  On days I showered two or three times, I applied two or three times.&lt;br /&gt;3)  I applied all over the nail and surrounding skin.  The skin around the toenail grew healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While only 1.3 ounces, this is a lot of product.  I applied freely and still have quite a bit left.  So for me, this was a very inexpensive way to get rid of a bad nail.  Give it a try.  It&#x27;s cheap.  If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, there are other more expensive products to try.  And you can always go to the doctor and be on a prescription for the next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The brown nail returned. I removed what I think was the source, which was removing my sweaty socks at the gym, not waiting until I got home.  I had seen the Facebook post for various uses of vapor rub and decided to try.  It works! Not in two weeks like the post says, but about 4 months for me.  Applied all over nail and surrounding skin every time I put on socks, especially before working out.  Cut off dead nail as new grew in.  Continued for a few more weeks after the new nail was in.  It&#x27;s been a few months now, and no problems. Try the vapor rub before anything else.ved what I think was the source, which was removing my sweaty socks at the gym, not waiting until I got home.

            <li> It worked for me.  I was judicious in following the instructions and applying it twice a day for a month and a half.  My toenail fungus is gone.  You can pay five times more for the same ingredient in common drugstore remedies.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.Maybe I had more than a fungus!</li>
            <li> It works to look beeter superficial but at long term does not cure the fungus.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to say, you can&#x27;t shine your skin, after you shower you can see your dry skin again with fungus, is a good cover up but not a cure.</li>
            <li> This product is basically the same as using a antifungal spray. Smells bad and states it&#x27;s not for nail fungus.</li>
            <li> My savior! This little guy works perfectly. 2-3 month and you are healed. Depending on how bad your situation is of course.</li>
            <li> This product appears not to do the job of reducing nail fungus. The directions are conflicting because in one place it indicates efficacy for use on nails and in another place,it says it does not work on fungus nails. The active ingredient,undecylenic acid 25% was never indicated in the literature and advertisement when purchased. When I applied it to toenails as surrounding area as indicated in their literature,the surrounding tissue became inflamed and I had to stop using the product.In addition,the product was falsely advertised.</li>
            <li> Works ok, really the only way to treat the bad nail fungus is with Laser removal or Medication</li>
            <li> This is really doing a great job clearing up my problem!</li>
            <li> Bought this in error as my problem was under the nail and the instructions on the bottle state that it is ineffective for this. The listing did not point this out. Will utilse the product later if necessary. Bought as  Sally&#x27;s products have a good reputation.</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet all over. There are times my feet get real dry and even with lotion it wouldn&#x27;t go away so I put it all over my dry areas and then put socks on overnight. I had this little bottle for years and finally had to order another. I noticed now it&#x27;s not as strong smelling as before. So i hope it will work as well as before!</li>
            <li> For too many years the big toe on my left foot was black with fungus.  In August, 2012, I grew impatient with this condition and set out in search of a product to cure it.  I discovered that this inexpensive product has the same active ingredient as the more expensive similar products at my Walgreen store.  I gave it a try, and it cost me about $5 with shipping included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the product once a day--after my shower.  It takes almost one year for a toenail to grow out completely.  Now, about seven months later, the fungus in the toenail is greatly diminished; I am not embarrassed to go without shoes and socks.  I will continue to use this product until the big toenail on my left foot is as pink and clear as the one on my right foot.</li>
            <li> apply twice a day for best results or you probably will not get the result you need and paid for.</li>
            <li> Got rid of a spot of tinea corporis on my wrist quickly. Just follow the directions and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. Has a bit of a tingly sensation, but doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Helps a lot!</li>
            <li> I tried the prescription meds to get rid of the fungus.  Ended up with an allergic reaction and still had fungus.  I tried the Sally Hansen&#x27;s product and it cleared it up in about 4 weeks.  Great product!</li>
            <li> It does not work on toenail fungus.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Have to be diligent about applying it daily for 2 or 3 months but it cleared up a problem toenail for me.</li>
    </ol>
