            <li>I bought these brushes right before christmas - I absolutely love them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are VERY soft, i love that!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i was originally planning on buying the brush-set from bdellium with 24 brushes, then i came across these ones.</li>
            <li>They distribute my makeup very evenly on my skin and cleaning is so easy!</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and soft with no fallout.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are worth the amount paid, brushes are soft and work perfectly with any type of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Great kit for regular use or makeup artist.</li>
            <li>this price you can get a 4 pack of face brushes &amp; these have way more &amp; probably even better quality than big name brands.</li>
            <li>- and the brushes aren&#x27;t necessary greater the more you pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>The cheap hot glue I guess didn&#x27;t hold the blending brush together like they thought it would.</li>
            <li>they pick up products very well, and they come in a cute &amp;#34;pencil-holder-book-kinda-pouch&amp;#34; which is smart for traveling.</li>
            <li>I doubt I will use all of them, but so far they are well made, clean easily (</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>For $80, this is an absolute steal!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So glad I decided to spend the extra money to invest in some dent brushes.</li>
            <li>The only con i have is that some of the face brushes i wish were more dense.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy, super soft, and hygienic!</li>
            <li>Recieved the package quickly, also these brushes are a qood quality brush, they are soft and none of the bristles fall out while applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I was so excited about getting new brushes until I used the first brush.</li>
            <li>I had a crappy smaller set, and what a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased a cheap set of 32 makeup brushes from Ebay a while back for like $20.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very picky with my brushes.</li>
            <li>that I spent way more than I should have.  </li>
            <li>Came at lightning fast speeds and 100% in tact.</li>
            <li>Alot of brushes I really needed.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t really find any reviews on youtube or on any blogs, but i went with it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s crazy how good the quality is for as many brushes</li>
            <li>They have some odd brushes that i know will never get used but for the most part this is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I synthetic brushes are easier to clean, and actually healthier to use on skin.</li>
            <li>I have used high quality brushes from it cosmetics</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend them to a makeup artist.</li>
            <li>I figured that since the price was so low, these brushes wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.</li>
            <li>I also have many Urban Decay single brushes  </li>
            <li>They are soft and do the job!</li>
            <li>I was a little worried at first because of the price plus it was my first time ordering online.</li>
            <li>I saw this set a while back and was really debating on getting it.</li>
            <li>is you are a professional</li>

            <li>The bristles are soft, they apply my foundation evenly, and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>you get a variation of brushes and the bristles are really soft.</li>

            <li> The bristles are soft, they apply my foundation evenly, and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> you get a variation of brushes and the bristles are really soft.</li>
            <li> And NO they were not wet when they started falling apart in the beginning.</li>
            <li> The first brush i used broke in half.</li>
            <li> The only downside - a couple of brushes fell apart within the second use and some (a few months later) are continuing to fall apart.</li>
            <li> and I preferred these over the other brushes.</li>
            <li> We just superglued them...but other than that, my daughter LOVES the texture and quality of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have never used sigma or mac brushes, but based on reviews of their brushes, I am going to assume that the CICI &amp; SISI brushes are extremely comparable.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brush sets cases, this one has no plastic smell.</li>
            <li> All the bristles on the brushes were very stiff and not soft at all.</li>
            <li> I did a little research on the brushes and decided to purchase them.</li>
            <li> Not much in the negative to gripe about.</li>
            <li> only bad thing i have to say is that my stippling brush fell off the handle, but that have also happend to some of my higher-end brushes earlier.</li>
            <li> I think they should have the brushes labeled because on the card sheet that says what they are its hard to tell witch is witch but</li>
            <li> I personally never liked roll brush cases.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that some of the brushes have come apart at the base between the metal part and the wood handle.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed and returning them.</li>
            <li> I was always very frustrated with applying makeup when using these brushes and there was a ton of shedding.</li>

            <li> I saw this set a while back and was really debating on getting it. I figured that since the price was so low, these brushes wouldn&#x27;t be worth it. I decided to purchase it anyway and I absolutely love it! The brushes are nice and soft with no fallout. They distribute my makeup very evenly on my skin and cleaning is so easy! I have used high quality brushes from it cosmetics and I preferred these over the other brushes. My brushes stayed put in my case and none of the handles popped off. For $80, this is an absolute steal!</li>
            <li> I was actually quite nervous with this purchase since there was no reviews yet but i am really glad that i made the purchase. the quality of the brushes is really good and the price is unbeatable! i easily pay 20-30 for a good quality brush from places like bobbi brown or lancome. This set has just equally good quality and comes with almost 30 brushes for under $80. I probably will never use all of the brushes but it is still nice to keep them around in case i need them.&lt;br /&gt;very happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> We love these brushes and the package/binder that they come in are awesome.  My only problem is that some of the brushes have come apart at the base between the metal part and the wood handle.  We just superglued them...but other than that, my daughter LOVES the texture and quality of the brushes.  She is training toward becoming a makeup artist so she is very happy.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes right before christmas - I absolutely love them.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s crazy how good the quality is for as many brushes you get.&lt;br /&gt;for this price you can get a 4 pack of face brushes &amp; these have way more &amp; probably even better quality than big name brands.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a cheap set of 32 makeup brushes from Ebay a while back for like $20. All the bristles on the brushes were very stiff and not soft at all. I was always very frustrated with applying makeup when using these brushes and there was a ton of shedding. However, I just couldn&#x27;t fathom spending hundreds of dollars on mac or sigma brushes. Then I found these CICI &amp; SISI brushes on sale for $80. Regular price was listed at $200. I did a little research on the brushes and decided to purchase them. OMG!!! I&#x27;m so glad I did! I have never used sigma or mac brushes, but based on reviews of their brushes, I am going to assume that the CICI &amp; SISI brushes are extremely comparable. ALL of the brushes are silky soft and there is a really great variety of brushes in this kit. The bristles stay put and appears to be no shedding what so ever! I have been using these brushes for about 2 weeks now and absolutely LOVE them. So glad I decided to spend the extra money to invest in some dent brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes for the price!! Would highly recommend them to a makeup artist. Its a lot of brushes just for everyday makeup, but great value!</li>
            <li> Very very good excellent, you will be happily is you are a professional, you can carry it with no worries to loss them.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes! They are soft and do the job! The packaging is also great for traveling,however, it be nice to have numbers or someway to identify each brush. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Recieved the package quickly, also these brushes are a qood quality brush, they are soft and none of the bristles fall out while applying makeup. The case they come is is great for transporting while traveling. Unlike other brush sets cases, this one has no plastic smell. All an all good purchase. There is also a guide included on the type of brush in the set.</li>
            <li> Great Brushes,&lt;br /&gt;They are worth the amount paid, brushes are soft and work perfectly with any type of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Great kit for regular use or makeup artist.</li>
            <li> I do makeup and I&#x27;m very picky with my brushes. I love dual fibers because it helps conserve your product. My brushes came and I got what I  wanted, I&#x27;m giving a 4 because even tho packaged greatly some brushes popped out of their hold as well I think they should have the brushes labeled because on the card sheet that says what they are its hard to tell witch is witch but overall their great and work well</li>
            <li> I have had this set for about 3 weeks.  I had a crappy smaller set, and what a huge difference.  I also have many Urban Decay single brushes  that I spent way more than I should have.  But this now completes my brushes.  I doubt I will use all of them, but so far they are well made, clean easily (I have brush guards for drying).  I am glad I went with this set.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for good qaulity brushes. These looked like they had brushes that i would get alot of use out of. They are VERY soft, i love that! They have some odd brushes that i know will never get used but for the most part this is exactly what i was looking for. The only con i have is that some of the face brushes i wish were more dense. They work beautifully but i like my buffing/powder/bronzer brushes to not be as flimsy.</li>
            <li> Excellent selection of brushes. Not much in the negative to gripe about. Recommended.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves them she says they are the best brushes for the priceand are great quality . applies product evenly and smoothly. Gave it to her as an early christmas gift. Came at lightning fast speeds and 100% in tact.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first because of the price plus it was my first time ordering online. I purchased these brushed a couple of months ago and I absolutely LOVE them! The bristles are soft, they apply my foundation evenly, and they don&#x27;t shed. I cleaned them a couple of times and they don&#x27;t fall apart, the price is reasonable and you get 29 brushes and the case is nice too! 80 bucks was most definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you need all these brushes had to return</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I was so excited about getting new brushes until I used the first brush. The first brush i used broke in half. The cheap hot glue I guess didn&#x27;t hold the blending brush together like they thought it would. I am disappointed and returning them.</li>
            <li> Alot of brushes I really needed. It is a bit pricey but its a great price for what you receive.  These are great quality brushes!</li>
            <li> I like them, carry glue for a bit but the brushes are nice the handles are not hoding</li>
            <li> these brushes are amazing. so happy with these super soft brushes. I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever brought to use on clients. They are sturdy, super soft, and hygienic! I synthetic brushes are easier to clean, and actually healthier to use on skin. (In my opinion) I&#x27;ve had no fall outs with these, they have a nice look of gold to then which makes a MUA (makeupartist) look like a master with these! One of the best feature with these brushes is that the case is well compact leather with a zipper! I personally never liked roll brush cases. So I find this well packaged, and sanitary which is a A++ !!!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using these brushes. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are not my favorite but I do like using them. The only downside - a couple of brushes fell apart within the second use and some (a few months later) are continuing to fall apart. And NO they were not wet when they started falling apart in the beginning.</li>
            <li> The best makeup.brushed ever  is worth to spend the money on it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m an esthetician with a huge love for makeup, so i don&#x27;t have any problem splurging on anything beauty-related - if it&#x27;s really worth it. now, when it comes to makeup-brushes, it&#x27;s always a tricky situation to find them in a good quality. i&#x27;ve tried alot of different brands, both high-end and inexspensive brands (alot, not all of them!) - and the brushes aren&#x27;t necessary greater the more you pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was originally planning on buying the brush-set from bdellium with 24 brushes, then i came across these ones. i didn&#x27;t really find any reviews on youtube or on any blogs, but i went with it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the price, these brushes are great! you get a variation of brushes and the bristles are really soft. they pick up products very well, and they come in a cute &amp;#34;pencil-holder-book-kinda-pouch&amp;#34; which is smart for traveling. you also get a chart with all the brushes listed. the shipping was also super-fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only bad thing i have to say is that my stippling brush fell off the handle, but that have also happend to some of my higher-end brushes earlier. easy thing to fix with superglue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend these brushes. i would buy these again!</li>
