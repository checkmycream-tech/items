            <li>I Love this perfume, The scent is very clean and fresh and I have been using it every day for three years.</li>
            <li>I asked my sister to recommend and light, citrusy fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smelling nice, then not so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, fresh, and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>Pure has a nice, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a light, clean floral.</li>
            <li>, everything came in original package and on time.</li>
            <li>Many thanks to seller (amazon!)</li>
            <li>It has a light, cool, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like the others in the Pure line, very light.  </li>
            <li>I love the notes consisting of freesia, vanilla, sandalwood, lotus, rose, transparent jasmine, white amber, orchid, and dew-drop petal accord.  </li>
            <li>Thats why I can only give it a GOOD rating.</li>
            <li>Knew I wanted a full size bottle.  </li>
            <li>its a subtle scent and its smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on and it seems to disappear quickly.</li>
            <li>As long as you&#x27;re not actually looking for an EDP, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and feminine, I love DKNY fragrances overall, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>that really makes an accurate statement about me.  </li>
            <li>And then found, when I went to try to send it back, because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;Hazardous Material,\\</li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;m stuck with $40 worth of stink.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;a knock off of the original PURE DKNY.</li>
            <li>Came to Amazon to order and found it right away.  </li>
            <li>This has a pleasant, soft scent which lasts for several hours.</li>
            <li>Pure is a fragrance that covers all those bases!  </li>
            <li>Firstly, this is not an EDP.  </li>
            <li>THANKS to Amazon for having the Parfume!</li>
            <li>And it is not extremely expensive.</li>
            <li>The first day i wore it, i was complimented three times.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this exact perfume from Sephora.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This clean soft smelling cologne and body wash and skin cream&lt;</li>
            <li>I first smelled Donna Karen Pure as a sample I found in a magazine.  </li>
            <li>I first smelled Pure at a department store.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a PURE DKNY product.</li>
            <li>I have the verbena one and wanted to try another of pure line.  </li>
            <li>There are two or three versions of DKNY&#x27;s Pure.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend smelling it in a store as there are two versions of the DKNY Pure.</li>
            <li>However this bottle I got from Amazon smells like straight alcohol (</li>
            <li>The perfume that I received from SAI Holdings WW Inc. smells like straight alcohol.</li>
            <li>I really like this parfume.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast also.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a different PURE perfume, but I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even smell like a decent knockoff.</li>
            <li>Packaged in a VERY pretty box was the perfume and a decent sized lotion of the same scent!</li>
            <li>It smells lovely though, a little  spicy with vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I was ordering kind of late</li>
            <li>This was a new one for me.  </li>
            <li>A little on the strong side.</li>
            <li>A subtle floral combination carrying a light fragrance that makes me smile no matter what.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t sample it before I ordered it because I live far from perfume stores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light scent that I can wear year round, and it smells like roses.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>like it&#x27;s old).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t offer much of a comment other than my very picky wife</li>
            <li>but i feel like it doesnt smell like my other dkny pure!</li>
            <li>Only down side is that it fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It actually smells like perfume that is old.</li>
            <li>Very earthy, calming, and understated -- just enough to add a little something extra without going overboard. :)</li>
            <li>Just right for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>My BFF loves this perfume - ordered it in a smaller quaintly to ensure it was under Prime - The gift was from her 10 yr old son we ordered it the 21st</li>
            <li>I expected to get Pure DKNY but it was a different DKNY that smells differently.</li>

            <li> I expected to get Pure DKNY but it was a different DKNY that smells differently.</li>

            <li> but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and I might get half my investment back.</li>
            <li> The other comes in a green package and smells completely different.</li>
            <li> directly from a company I&#x27;m not familiar with, I&#x27;m not sure if</li>
            <li> I usually get this scent at Dillard&#x27;s, but our local one has been out of stock for months.  </li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter for christmas and she loves it plus we spent alot less than in the department stores.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong version of Pure to begin with - don&#x27;t care for the other one.  </li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected and was less expensive then other places.</li>
            <li> , you pay Prime - you expect Prime - as of today it is ILL - I live in Or</li>
            <li> A little pricey but</li>
            <li> Pure was a bit of a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Scent lasts a few hours, might need to spritz a little towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I usually buy DKNY at Macy&#x27;s or Bon-Ton, but since both stores said it was discontinued</li>
            <li> This is one of two fragrances I can wear without feeling nauseated.</li>
            <li> The other perfume, from the mini bottle, did not give off a bad smell AT ALL.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the wrong scent.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I am unable to return it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not receive what I ordered!</li>
            <li> Its awful!!! :(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible!</li>

            <li> It came with lotion, too.</li>
            <li> The perfect gift for the lady in your life.  I can&#x27;t offer much of a comment other than my very picky wife has worn this for years and loves it.  A little pricey but most perfumes of any caliber are these days.</li>
            <li> I first smelled Donna Karen Pure as a sample I found in a magazine.  I haven&#x27;t worn a fragrance for years because I am unwilling to go to the effort of finding one  that really makes an accurate statement about me.  At work as a school administrator, I&#x27;m all business.  After hours, I like my jeans, boots and comfy sweaters or shorts, tee shirt and flip flops, depending on the season.  Pure is a fragrance that covers all those bases!  I&#x27;ve had it for a month or so now, and I&#x27;m really happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake.  I wanted a different PURE perfume, but I am not disappointed.  This smells wonderful too.  It has a light, cool, clean scent.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> This was a requested gift.  Pure has a nice, clean scent.  Most perfumes bother me, but this one did not give me a headache when I was around the recipient.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent! One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I found this by accident and I love it ever since. It&#x27;s very gentle and feminine, I love DKNY fragrances overall, but this one is my favorite. Good service from sender, everything came in original package and on time.</li>
            <li> A little on the strong side.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with my purchase at the time it arrived. I&#x27;m hoping this is not&lt;br /&gt;a knock off of the original PURE DKNY. The reason I say that is, I usually&lt;br /&gt;get lots of compliments when I wear DKNY parfumes. I&#x27;ve noticed I feel like&lt;br /&gt;I have to re-apply often just to be able to enjoy it myself. Since it was&lt;br /&gt;shipped directly from a company I&#x27;m not familiar with, I&#x27;m not sure if&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a PURE DKNY product. Thats why I can only give it a GOOD rating.</li>
            <li> I usually get this scent at Dillard&#x27;s, but our local one has been out of stock for months.  I ordered the wrong version of Pure to begin with - don&#x27;t care for the other one.  But this is good for day or night, light and doesn&#x27;t slap you in the face.</li>
            <li> This was a new one for me.  I have the verbena one and wanted to try another of pure line.  Firstly, this is not an EDP.  Amazon should change that in the description.  It&#x27;s just like the others in the Pure line, very light.  It smells lovely though, a little  spicy with vanilla.  As long as you&#x27;re not actually looking for an EDP, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Donna Karan  What were your market People thinking?  This clean soft smelling cologne and body wash and skin cream&lt;br /&gt;are the best thing I have ever used and I always get complements.  PLEASE BRING THIS BACK IN PRODUCTION.&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile THANKS to Amazon for having the Parfume!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for  Xmas.  It came in a nice, attractive package - good for gift giving.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> The item I ordered was substituted with a gift boxed set of greater value.  It arrived in time for gift giving and was a hit.  I loved that the product was better than ordered and there was no fuss.  Love that service.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite day to day perfumes! it smells clean and lasts all day! And it is not extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter for christmas and she loves it plus we spent alot less than in the department stores.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume. It is a light, clean floral. Perfect for spring/summer! I even gave it 5 stars because mine arrived with an added bonus - which I didn&#x27;t realize I would get! Packaged in a VERY pretty box was the perfume and a decent sized lotion of the same scent! LOVE IT! Many thanks to seller (amazon!)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it :-P but I love it. Smells so good, I bought it as gift. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not receive what I ordered! I ordered the EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY and got some kind of spray and body butter! I wanted perfume!</li>
            <li> My BFF loves this perfume - ordered it in a smaller quaintly to ensure it was under Prime - The gift was from her 10 yr old son we ordered it the 21st and still we wait on Dec 27th -, you pay Prime - you expect Prime - as of today it is ILL - I live in Or</li>
            <li> its a subtle scent and its smells wonderful.  i love it!</li>
            <li> The perfume smells great. The first day i wore it, i was complimented three times. very happy with perfume. i will order it again.</li>
            <li> Just love it. Wonderful set. I had .it realized it has lovely scented cream. Very nice. Thought I ordered the verbena scent. But things is a lovely scent,so I am very happy with it. Treated myself for my birthday!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this exact perfume from Sephora. I loved it so much that I bought it here. It came and the moment it hit my skin (I was given a mini bottle from sephora) it smelled like B.O. The other perfume, from the mini bottle, did not give off a bad smell AT ALL. It smelled divine. What is this? I had to toss it because my boyfriend asked me what on earth I just put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s out.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and great scent as well.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price for this was the best I could find anywhere at the time I purchased it.  My daughter loves it, and I don&#x27;t mind paying the price for a gift for her.</li>
            <li> This is my signature scent.  I got a sample in the mail from Ulta around Mother&#x27;s Day last year, and I&#x27;ve been hooked every since.  It&#x27;s a light scent that I can wear year round, and it smells like roses.  Amazon has a really good price, too.  It pops up on Groupon Goods sometimes, but otherwise Amazon has the best price on both sizes.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this for Christmas so I bought it for her. I love it because my wife loves it which means I&#x27;m getting lucky tonight !</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t sample it before I ordered it because I live far from perfume stores.  I asked my sister to recommend and light, citrusy fragrance.  Pure was a bit of a disappointment.  I&#x27;d love more fragrance and I&#x27;d like it to last a bit longer.  I spray it on and it seems to disappear quickly.</li>
            <li> There are two or three versions of DKNY&#x27;s Pure.  There&#x27;s a \\&quot;green\\&quot; one, a \\&quot;pure\\&quot; one and a \\&quot;rose\\&quot; one.  I had a sample of the \\&quot;rose\\&quot; one and used the sample from start to finish.  Knew I wanted a full size bottle.  Looked for it at Sephora and Ulta--no go in either store, but the \\&quot;pure\\&quot; and \\&quot;green\\&quot; versions of the scent were.  Came to Amazon to order and found it right away.  Found the labeling inconsistent here on the website and ordered the one I thought was \\&quot;rose.\\&quot;  It isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s the \\&quot;pure\\&quot; version, very floral-y, green and not my preference for scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spent over $40 to find out it&#x27;s the wrong scent.  And then found, when I went to try to send it back, because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;Hazardous Material,\\&quot; I am unable to return it.  If they can SEND IT TO ME, why can&#x27;t I SEND IT BACK TO THEM?  Yes, I remember 9/11, I know about bombs in the mail, I know that senders can intentionally mix-up their returns to defraud a company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;m stuck with $40 worth of stink.  It&#x27;ll probably end up on eBay and I might get half my investment back.</li>
            <li> This is one of two fragrances I can wear without feeling nauseated.</li>
            <li> Bought as a present, and she loved it!!</li>
            <li> I love this smell. It is very refreshing and I can smell it working all day long. I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I first smelled Pure at a department store.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it on me once I bought it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It&#x27;s very light, fresh, and clean smelling.  In addition, the scent lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this perfume and I bought for her for Christmas.  I was ordering kind of late so I am really glad that it came on time</li>
            <li> It was enjoyed by the recipient my sister for her birthday and was enjoyed by her so that is a good thing</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She loved it. It came earlier than expected and was less expensive then other places.</li>
            <li> I tried this scent on in a store and loved it but didn&#x27;t want to pay full price. This is exactly what I wanted. Smells great! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and even included a body lotion with it, which I didn&#x27;t know at the time of ordering, but am very happy with.</li>
            <li> This has a pleasant, soft scent which lasts for several hours. I especially like it in the summer and would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I am someone who can get headaches from strong scents, and this perfume has not caused me any issues! Its a great perfume that is really good quality.  Scent lasts a few hours, might need to spritz a little towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Just right for everyday wear. A subtle floral combination carrying a light fragrance that makes me smile no matter what.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and have been wearing it for years. However this bottle I got from Amazon smells like straight alcohol (like it&#x27;s old). Its awful!!! :(</li>
            <li> The perfume that I received from SAI Holdings WW Inc. smells like straight alcohol. It is definitely not the brand name perfume I thought I ordered. I have used this brand for years and this definitely isn&#x27;t DKNY. It doesn&#x27;t even smell like a decent knockoff. It&#x27;s terrible!</li>
            <li> I expected to get Pure DKNY but it was a different DKNY that smells differently.</li>
            <li> I Love this perfume, The scent is very clean and fresh and I have been using it every day for three years.</li>
            <li> I sampled this out of a magazine a while back and it is everything I was expecting. Only down side is that it fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li> smells good but i feel like it doesnt smell like my other dkny pure!</li>
            <li> I usually buy DKNY at Macy&#x27;s or Bon-Ton, but since both stores said it was discontinued I found it here.&lt;br /&gt;I did not think the perfume smelt the same as in the store. It actually smells like perfume that is old. I was very disappointed so I will not purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;thanks Mary jones</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Very light but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like this parfume. I have several of the DKNY&#x27;s varieties and this one is one of my favorites. It shipped fast also. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Not a big perfume wearer.  This is one of only two fragrances that I wear on occasion and I really like it.  I love the notes consisting of freesia, vanilla, sandalwood, lotus, rose, transparent jasmine, white amber, orchid, and dew-drop petal accord.  Very earthy, calming, and understated -- just enough to add a little something extra without going overboard. :)</li>
            <li> Smells great! I would recommend smelling it in a store as there are two versions of the DKNY Pure. The other comes in a green package and smells completely different. I personally love the smell of this and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Too flowery, drug store for me after wearing for a couple of hours. Goes on smelling nice, then not so much.</li>
