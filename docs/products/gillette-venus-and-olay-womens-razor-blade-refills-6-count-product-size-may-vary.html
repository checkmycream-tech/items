            <li>These give the best shave ever!</li>
            <li>Best razor I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Best price I could find for any Venus razors on Amazon, too.</li>
            <li>These (5 blade with moisture bars) are what I have found to be the best for shaving if you have sensitive/dry skin.</li>
            <li>but amazon had best price i found.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very effective razor and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>This six pack is a great value.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price.</li>
            <li>Best deal we found on this product even better</li>
            <li>Would be perfect if this size was available on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>The blades are still good, but I think I prefer the Venus Embrace razors</li>
            <li>$26 for a pack of 6 is a good deal.</li>
            <li>The first couple shaves are always the best!</li>
            <li>Best razor I&#x27;ve used in my whole life.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE not having to use shaving cream or gel with these.</li>
            <li>Would buy again. :)</li>
            <li>These &#x27;pads&#x27; create a nice platform for the razor to glide and smoothly cut.</li>
            <li>just a bit more even tho</li>
            <li>Love shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li>Such a good value</li>
            <li>Very nice razors, not very fond of the Olay strips though.</li>
            <li>Still, the blades are very nice like all the other Venus razors.</li>
            <li>These are my all-time favorite razors as my legs always feel silky smooth after shaving due to the Olay strips.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t travel well and once the olay products are gone on either side they don&#x27;t work very well and hurt.  </li>
            <li>Gently and close shave.</li>
            <li>High cost for razor blades</li>
            <li>the moisturizing strip is smaller, it doesn&#x27;t dry up as easily.</li>
            <li>The cost is high and the blades &amp; &#x27;gliding pads&#x27; (not sure what to call these parts) wear out far too quickly.</li>
            <li>I probably will go back to the normal one&#x27;s and shaving cream after I finish these...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one of the razor packs from it so far.</li>

            <li> razors as expected, fits with shaver</li>
            <li> The reason for the 3 star rating is due to cost and longevity of the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> The razor may stay sharp, but the Olay strip rubs away and then you&#x27;re forced to use shaving cream with them.</li>
            <li> Expensive is you do the math per razor, but I can&#x27;t find them in bulk elsewhere...</li>
            <li> Without them it&#x27;s a brutal shave.</li>

            <li> Such a good value and I didn&#x27;t have to get in my car and go get them.  This is the best razors I have EVER HAD.</li>
            <li> These give the best shave ever!</li>
            <li> Wife loves using them, especially having the moisture pads</li>
            <li> I like these but they are not very practical.  They don&#x27;t travel well and once the olay products are gone on either side they don&#x27;t work very well and hurt.  I probably will go back to the normal one&#x27;s and shaving cream after I finish these...</li>
            <li> Best deal we found on this product even better that\n the big Box stores,ie. Wal-mart- Costco, etc.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve used in my whole life. Gently and close shave.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This six pack is a great value. Would be perfect if this size was available on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> These are my all-time favorite razors as my legs always feel silky smooth after shaving due to the Olay strips. I also LOVE not having to use shaving cream or gel with these.

            <li> Very nice razors, not very fond of the Olay strips though. It clogs up the razor blades and very hard to rinse out while in the middle of shaving, and for me the strips melted off during the first use. I&#x27;ve only used one of the razor packs from it so far. Still, the blades are very nice like all the other Venus razors. Best price I could find for any Venus razors on Amazon, too.

            <li> It&#x27;s a very effective razor and does an excellent job. The reason for the 3 star rating is due to cost and longevity of the replacement blades. The cost is high and the blades &amp; &#x27;gliding pads&#x27; (not sure what to call these parts) wear out far too quickly. These &#x27;pads&#x27; create a nice platform for the razor to glide and smoothly cut. Without them it&#x27;s a brutal shave.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. As advertised and (for us) cheaper than almost any retail store nearby (without having some sort of coupon / loyalty rewards)</li>
            <li> The moisturizing strips dry up and shrink after just one use. The blades are still good, but I think I prefer the Venus Embrace razors just a bit more even tho the moisturizing strip is smaller, it doesn&#x27;t dry up as easily.</li>
            <li> Expensive is you do the math per razor, but I can&#x27;t find them in bulk elsewhere...</li>

            <li> These (5 blade with moisture bars) are what I have found to be the best for shaving if you have sensitive/dry skin. $26 for a pack of 6 is a good deal. I would recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> High cost for razor blades but my daughter loves them. Did not give 5 * because of cost but amazon had best price i found.</li>
            <li> only razor I ever use!</li>
            <li> Love shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> The Lady of the house loves it</li>
