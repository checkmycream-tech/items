            <li>Purpose Dual Treatment Moisture Lotion with SPF 15 is effective  and fair priced.</li>

            <li>The light, pleasant odor was replaced by a sunscreen-like smell.  </li>
            <li>just hope I can find a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it has sun block in it.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to cause acne when most others do for me.</li>
            <li>Great quality product and very affordable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>and I love the price.</li>
            <li>a good note for Purpose, I do use their gentle cleansing wash which is A-OK!</li>
            <li>It is light, absorbs easily, doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to itch or break out, and it has sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Shipping was perfect, great facial cream only one that can use.</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought more of the original.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and until recently had great results.  </li>
            <li>it in a drugstore, and all was fine with the order.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super affordable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure most people would probably not even notice the smell since the lotion is technically fragrance free.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and break out very easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild but it seems to keep the dryness and redness at bay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, yet does the job of keeping my skin looking fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li>oh so worth it).  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, try to look for a more natural product.  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t be buying this again, and for what it&#x27;s worth plan to tell Johnson &amp; Johnson exactly why.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker and heavier, very much like sunscreen in texture and smell (</li>
            <li>I actually use it!  :)</li>
            <li>Be sure to try out the Purpose Facial Cleanser with this product!</li>
            <li>(pretty pricey</li>
            <li>the packaging just looked clean and simple - yes, I was hoping the packaging was an indicator of what the product would do to my skin - make it look clean.</li>
            <li>Did you really think consumers wouldn&#x27;t notice?</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning and at night, and find that it works really well for me.</li>
            <li>I still have some on hand because I am now using Eucerin Wrinkle Cream with CoQ10, but that isn&#x27;t really helping me that much either.  </li>
            <li>and I think it would be too much for me to use in the summer.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve really screwed up the product with this change.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s used it for years, and likes it very well.</li>
            <li>However, I find that its scent kind of resembles that of mild baby spit-up or something else equally sour when it has lingered on skin or in facial hair throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable and quality is high.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>facts\\&quot; on the upper right corner of the label.</li>
            <li>I noticed the bottle now says \\&quot;see new drug</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin and has sun protection.</li>
            <li>also have very sensitive skin and this product causes no redness, itching, or burning.  </li>
            <li>This is the first facial moisturizer I have used that causes no redness and/or irritation at the application sites.  </li>
            <li>was wondering why I was breaking out more than usual.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the high price, the only real issue I have with Purpose is its smell.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is perfect if you live in part of the country that has cold, dry winters and you have combo skin that tends to breakout.</li>
            <li>especially if you have sensitive skin, which is why I began using it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I am 59 an not a rinkle on my face - it obsorbs the cream, leaves it moist, soft and well protected by the sun.</li>
            <li>where it was once almost completely scentless).</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a heavy cream and just absorbs in the skin making it smooth and moist.</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin looking young and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Because my face is sensitive I would always break out but when the dermotologist recommended this product I was elated and am still using it to this day.  </li>
            <li>It does what it needs to do to keep my face moisturized and looking young.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>dries my skin out considerably and my skin drinks the purpose lotion like water.  </li>
            <li>It is dermatologist recommended and my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>If they changed the formula to save money, as a consumer I&#x27;d be willing to pay a bit more for the original product, but the new formulation is worthless to</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for daily face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I finally found all these reviews about the new formula and realized what was going on.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin that also gets extremely dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>I formerly used products that contained salicylic acid because it claims to clear up/prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li>I was completely unsurprised to see numerous complaints on Amazon and elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The purpose lotion seems to come on thin enough that my face breathes better as well.  </li>
            <li>They recently changed the formula of the lotion which now contains new active ingredients including Octinoxate.  </li>

            <li> The only time it isn&#x27;t enough for me is when my skin is bone dry...</li>
            <li> Possibly even more evil is Johnson and Johnson who never made any changes to their labels to include \\&quot;New Formula\\&quot; or anything.. they still say this product is dermatologist recommended, but they must be talking to some pretty misinformed dermatologists.  </li>
            <li> corporate greed sucks and so does this new formula.</li>
            <li> My skin manages to be both dry at times and oily, so this worked wondered in solving the dry without clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin does not feel dry after application.</li>
            <li> I used to have acne and dry skin and needed a product that I could use to moisturize my face.  </li>
            <li> Without Purpose Dual Treatment Moisture Lotion we&#x27;d probably dry up and blow away!</li>
            <li> Also you need very little so a bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> , yes it is expensive, but it lasts a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding it locally</li>
            <li> My skin feels healthier and retains it&#x27;s moisture throughout the day and the sun does not bake my face when I am outside working for a few hours.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive-nosed like I am, perhaps the takeaway message is to rinse and reapply a few times, rather than letting the same coat stay on all day.</li>
            <li> I usually pay $11 for it at my local pharmacy</li>
            <li> During the past decade, I&#x27;ve paid anywhere between $4-$75 for different moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Would not use any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products</li>
            <li> And there is a slight burning sensation when you apply it.  </li>
            <li> I typically break out along my lower cheeks, but it was spreading to my temples and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gonna take a couple weeks to get rid of the mess this caused</li>
            <li> However, it was a little too moisturizer for the Midwest, soupy summers</li>
            <li> (my skin was a little too \\&quot;dewey\\&quot; by the end of the day).     </li>
            <li> It does the job without feeling greasy or too heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money on this.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used very expensive moisturizers in the past and never had the success as I&#x27;ve had with this one.</li>
            <li> never tried the past formula</li>
            <li> just bought my usual moisturizer yesterday, and I already see an improvement overnight.  </li>
            <li> and it provides my very pale skin with much-needed UV-ray protection.</li>
            <li> now it is hard to find in the stores today - please</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the allergic reactions some have complained of, but the smell is off-putting and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well.</li>
            <li> I was slow in picking that one up because it&#x27;s $15</li>
            <li> to J&amp;J (and any other company who does this): extremely BAD FORM to change the formula with absolutely no indication that you&#x27;d done so.</li>
            <li> I used Purpose for 20 years because it was the only thing I could find that didn&#x27;t smell unpleasant or make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pure evil.  </li>
            <li> I am annoyed that the stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore</li>
            <li> But the worse is yet to be told.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those people who gets bored with skincare products, and I sometimes give in to the lure of the department store lines (like clinique, origins, etc.)  </li>
            <li> So, all in all, this product is dangerous and misleading and should not be used even if you&#x27;re not allergic to it.</li>
            <li> After applying the lotion, I started breaking out in a terrible rash, which I thought was poison ivy.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My school&#x27;s doctor, though not a dermatologist, did recommend this product. My skin manages to be both dry at times and oily, so this worked wondered in solving the dry without clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is also much lighter than a lot of the heavy duty lotions, which definitely gunk up the works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently got a friend to start using the lotion and the soap and she&#x27;s loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, yes it is expensive, but it lasts a pretty long time. If you&#x27;re like I was, you&#x27;d do almost anything to solve your skin issues anyway.</li>
            <li> THIS is the best moiturizer on the market for my skin type...it WORKS!. I am 59 an not a rinkle on my face - it obsorbs the cream, leaves it moist, soft and well protected by the sun. Been using this product for 19 years.  Recommended by my sister by a dermatologist.... the very best moitureizer/ protectant and now it is hard to find in the stores today - please -manufacturerer -do -not -stop -making -this -product</li>
            <li> As others have said, this is not the same product it was. I&#x27;ve used Purpose lotion for 20 years, and when I bought a bottle recently I could tell immediately that the formula had changed. It&#x27;s thicker and heavier, very much like sunscreen in texture and smell (where it was once almost completely scentless). I haven&#x27;t had the allergic reactions some have complained of, but the smell is off-putting and it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well. I was completely unsurprised to see numerous complaints on Amazon and elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying this again, and for what it&#x27;s worth plan to tell Johnson &amp; Johnson exactly why. If they changed the formula to save money, as a consumer I&#x27;d be willing to pay a bit more for the original product, but the new formulation is worthless to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope I can find a suitable replacement. I used Purpose for 20 years because it was the only thing I could find that didn&#x27;t smell unpleasant or make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to J&amp;J (and any other company who does this): extremely BAD FORM to change the formula with absolutely no indication that you&#x27;d done so. Did you really think consumers wouldn&#x27;t notice?</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter and she loves it.  Anything that makes her happy, makes me happy.  It isn&#x27;t a heavy cream and just absorbs in the skin making it smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who gets bored with skincare products, and I sometimes give in to the lure of the department store lines (like clinique, origins, etc.)  Somehow, I always come back to this lotion, though!  It is light, absorbs easily, doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to itch or break out, and it has sunscreen!  It is just perfect- I use it in the morning and at night, and my face is happier for it!</li>
            <li> Great product!I, ve been using this product for many years.I love it.Purpose Dual Treatment Moisture Lotion with SPF 15 is effective  and fair priced.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  Always use this product in AM before applying makeup.  Keeps your skin looking young and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face lotion for awhile and it does not make me break out. Fast service. Good price. Didn&#x27;t have to run to walmart.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I use for my oily and acne skin.  I usually pay $11 for it at my local pharmacy</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best that I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s lightweight, yet does the job of keeping my skin looking fresh and hydrated. I also love the fact that it has sun block in it. I use it in the morning and at night, and find that it works really well for me. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. It is great for sensitive skin. Keeps you skin moist and does a good job on sun protection.</li>
            <li> I like this Lotion.  I still have some on hand because I am now using Eucerin Wrinkle Cream with CoQ10, but that isn&#x27;t really helping me that much either.  Maybe I will go back to the Purpose Lotion in time.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my mom as the local pharmacies in her area do not carry it anymore.  She swears by it.  I&#x27;ll take her word for it.</li>
            <li> This is the first facial moisturizer I have used that causes no redness and/or irritation at the application sites.  The SP15 ingredient prevents the redness associated with traditional \\&quot;sunburn\\&quot; when worn in an exposed setting for an extended period of time.  I accord this product a 5 star rating!</li>
            <li> Living in a dry climate such as Colorado, my husband and I have very dry, sensitive skin. Without Purpose Dual Treatment Moisture Lotion we&#x27;d probably dry up and blow away! No kidding, this lotion has saved our skin!</li>
            <li> During the past decade, I&#x27;ve paid anywhere between $4-$75 for different moisturizers. This is the only one that I still use. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin and has sun protection. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to cause acne when most others do for me. The only time it isn&#x27;t enough for me is when my skin is bone dry... then I have to keep reapplying it every 1/2 hour or so, but that only happens when my dermatologist puts me on a medication that irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin that also gets extremely dry in the winter. I heard that this is a good moisturizer, even for those with oily skin. It absorbs very quickly and does not feel greasy. My skin does not feel dry after application. However, it does not seem to improve my oily skin and I think it would be too much for me to use in the summer.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my dermatologist.  I was having trouble finding it locally and someone said they were discontinuing the product.  My dermatologist was upset and said she was going to go a buy all she could find.  I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and break out very easily.  This product works for me.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes, keeps my skin supple, has sun-protection.  Price is reasonable and quality is high.  I actually use it!  :)</li>
            <li> I have been using Purpose products ever since I was a teen.  I used to have acne and dry skin and needed a product that I could use to moisturize my face.  Because my face is sensitive I would always break out but when the dermotologist recommended this product I was elated and am still using it to this day.  It does what it needs to do to keep my face moisturized and looking young.  I am 55 now and still have smooth beautiful skin.  I recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> J&amp;J recently changed the formula for Purpose.  I&#x27;ve been using it forever, will have to change. The very light, pleasant  odor is gone - replaced with a sunscreen smell.  And there is a slight burning sensation when you apply it.  They&#x27;ve really screwed up the product with this change.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a number of years but could no longer&lt;br /&gt;find it in a drugstore, and all was fine with the order.</li>
            <li> A NYC dermatologist recommended this cream to me as i was moving to AZ.  i have used it now for over 20 years and my face hasn&#x27;t sun burned. Also you need very little so a bottle last a long time. I am annoyed that the stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore but they have&lt;br /&gt;other Purpose products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and until recently had great results.  They recently changed the formula of the lotion which now contains new active ingredients including Octinoxate.  If you haven&#x27;t done any research on this chemical, you should.  It can cause allergic reactions, it can screw up your hormones and immune system, it&#x27;s a carcinogen...it&#x27;s pure evil.  Possibly even more evil is Johnson and Johnson who never made any changes to their labels to include \\&quot;New Formula\\&quot; or anything.. they still say this product is dermatologist recommended, but they must be talking to some pretty misinformed dermatologists.  Will never trust another product before putting it in or on my body.  After applying the lotion, I started breaking out in a terrible rash, which I thought was poison ivy.  I went to the doctor who thought it was a bacterial infection or poison ivy based on the look of the rash.  I was on antibiotics and prednisone for a week, and still applying the lotion to my face, not knowing that the formula had changed.  I finally found all these reviews about the new formula and realized what was going on.  So, all in all, this product is dangerous and misleading and should not be used even if you&#x27;re not allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, but J&amp;J has recently changed the formula.  They didn&#x27;t even have the decency to note the change on the bottle itself.  I immediately noticed the difference though.  The light, pleasant odor was replaced by a sunscreen-like smell.  The lotion also felt heavier.  But the worse is yet to be told.  After one application, I broke out in a rash all over my face!!!  I once adored this product, and it has now betrayed me.  Please contact your doctor before using it . . . especially if you have sensitive skin, which is why I began using it in the first place.  Also, please note that all of the \\&quot;good reviews\\&quot; on this website are dated 2005, 2006, 2007, etc.  Check out the ones dated 2010 to the present AFTER the company changed the product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is perfect if you live in part of the country that has cold, dry winters and you have combo skin that tends to breakout. I may be close to 30 but I suffer from combo skin and the occasional breakout like a teenager. I formerly used products that contained salicylic acid because it claims to clear up/prevent breakouts. Not for me. So in my continuous search for a miracle product I decided I would give this a whirl - the packaging just looked clean and simple - yes, I was hoping the packaging was an indicator of what the product would do to my skin - make it look clean. And that it did! This moisturizer was perfect for the Midwest winter months and into spring and even fall. However, it was a little too moisturizer for the Midwest, soupy summers (my skin was a little too \\&quot;dewey\\&quot; by the end of the day).     Be sure to try out the Purpose Facial Cleanser with this product! It is just as amazing for combo, breakout-prone skin. And it&#x27;s super affordable!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years.  Would not use any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really great, not greasy, good sun protection, no fragrance.  Highly recommend for daily face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have worn this moisturizer for about 25 years. I have tried other products but I have always come back to Purpose. It does the job without feeling greasy or too heavy. Great quality product and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years as have others. I immediately noticed the difference in texture and smell. I wish I had bought more of the original. corporate greed sucks and so does this new formula. I won&#x27;t buy it again unless they change it back. shame on you Johnson&amp;johnson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wait edit review may 31 2013: I checked at Wal-Mart for the heck of it and they seemed to have changed it back. no scent again and the texture is the same as it used to be. I noticed the bottle now says \\&quot;see new drug facts\\&quot; on the upper right corner of the label.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my wife&#x27;s skin feel smoother and softer.  She&#x27;s used it for years, and likes it very well.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily now after I use my face wash.  The face wash that I use daily dries my skin out considerably and my skin drinks the purpose lotion like water.  My skin feels healthier and retains it&#x27;s moisture throughout the day and the sun does not bake my face when I am outside working for a few hours. &lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin and this product causes no redness, itching, or burning.  Some lotion that I would use would cause my face to breakout.  The purpose lotion seems to come on thin enough that my face breathes better as well.  My girlfriend introduced me to purpose and it is the only lotion I will use on my face now.</li>
            <li> When my husband&#x27;s dermatologist diagnosed him with seborrheic dermatitis back in the day, his dermatologist recommended that he use this lotion as a daily moisturizer and sunscreen. It&#x27;s mild but it seems to keep the dryness and redness at bay. I like to use it, too, because it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it provides my very pale skin with much-needed UV-ray protection. Aside from the high price, the only real issue I have with Purpose is its smell. I&#x27;m sure most people would probably not even notice the smell since the lotion is technically fragrance free. However, I find that its scent kind of resembles that of mild baby spit-up or something else equally sour when it has lingered on skin or in facial hair throughout the day. If you&#x27;re sensitive-nosed like I am, perhaps the takeaway message is to rinse and reapply a few times, rather than letting the same coat stay on all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years. A friend who had combination skin told about it and I&#x27;ve used it ever since. I have combination/oily skin and this product doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. I only have to use it in the morning before I apply my pressed powder. This 4 oz bottle lasts me for months and I love the price. I&#x27;ve used very expensive moisturizers in the past and never had the success as I&#x27;ve had with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this under makeup for years.  It is lightweight, odorless, and has the added benefit of the SPF 15.</li>
            <li> I buy this in a couple stores but your price beat theirs.  It is dermatologist recommended and my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> Shipping was perfect, great facial cream only one that can use.</li>
            <li> These recent reviews are correct.&lt;br /&gt;I never tried the past formula but this one is no good.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care for it the first couple times I tried it, but I had to give this another shot because my usual moisturizer ran out.  I was slow in picking that one up because it&#x27;s $15 (pretty pricey but oh so worth it).  I should have just broke the bank because this stuff broke my face.&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering why I was breaking out more than usual.  I typically break out along my lower cheeks, but it was spreading to my temples and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought my usual moisturizer yesterday, and I already see an improvement overnight.  It&#x27;s gonna take a couple weeks to get rid of the mess this caused, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, try to look for a more natural product.  Don&#x27;t waste your time &amp; money on this.&lt;br /&gt;On a good note for Purpose, I do use their gentle cleansing wash which is A-OK!</li>
