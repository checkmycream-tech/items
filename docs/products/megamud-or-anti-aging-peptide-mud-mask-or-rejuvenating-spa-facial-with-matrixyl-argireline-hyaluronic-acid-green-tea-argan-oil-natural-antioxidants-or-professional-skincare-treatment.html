            <li>The MegaMud is top notch!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t make me want to gag, but it wasn&#x27;t the most pleasant either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is not the most pleasant, king of a mix of sulfur and petrol.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on, perfect smooth texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got great quality ingredients that I&#x27;m comfortable using on my skin.</li>

            <li>, I liked the way it smelled.</li>
            <li>Really liked the smell and feel of the mud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mask  a handful of times and can relay that it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am glad I took the chance because I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it in the shower and was very happy to feel how soft my face was.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, leaves the skin feeling clean and rejuvenated, and both of us have noticed wrinkles disappearing around my eyes and cheeks.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and smells refreshing.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice, minty smell that made me feel clean despite the fact that I was smearing goop on my face!</li>
            <li>Then, I easily washed it off with warm water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More importantly, the product has enhanced my skin’s ability to absorb the moisturizer, which I love!  </li>
            <li>and I am GLAD</li>
            <li>After rinsing, most of the smell is gone.</li>
            <li>My girl really enjoyed this.</li>
            <li>I really love this mask.</li>
            <li>so you will get many applications from the container.</li>
            <li>I love the smell (a mix of mint and eucalyptus) and the ease of application.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m about to get more.</li>
            <li>I have not found anything better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE how this mask feels going on my skin and the feeling after.</li>
            <li>It draws out impurities from my pores like a magnet, leaving my face feeling cleaner and more renewed than ever.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes perfectly, but if you need that extra kick, you can follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t really enjoy dabbling in these kind of products.  </li>
            <li>I love this mask.  </li>
            <li>This is the part where I fell in love with the mask and my rear view mirror...</li>
            <li>so far, my skin is looking and feeling good!</li>
            <li>I like way it &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; and dries quickly; 10 minutes is usually perfect for me, even with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for letting me review it.this product, and I will be happy to use it on my face again!</li>
            <li>Overall, I was satisfied with the product and would recommend it as a nice, pleasant face mud.</li>
            <li>is just such a wonderful ingredient on its own, but when you add in all the other good stuff like the Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud Mask has, it just makes it even better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mask was easy to use and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>was easy.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It gives that genuine spa feeling to the product and it is easy to know I washed it all off this way.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Some mud products are a bit thicker and require a bit of effort to smooth onto your skin, yet this product applies and washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>My skin’s texture and pore-size have greatly improved in 3 short weeks.</li>
            <li>Since then I have used the product a few times and have been thoroughly impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>I got this MegaMud as a gift and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it was so comfortable that I forgot I had it on.</li>
            <li>Most importantly I have not broken out!</li>
            <li>I received a sample via Tomoson and was so excited.</li>
            <li>and I was expecting a more firm texture but even with the texture of this mask, it does a great job).</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What is special about this</li>
            <li>After I removed the mask, my face felt soft and clean and just amazing.</li>
            <li>I am also happy to report that it did not burn my skin off, and I was able to go to work the following day with a clean, clear, smoothed out face.</li>
            <li>It is light and overall the scent is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It always feels cool coming out of the container.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is to make sure you stir it ( as recommended) before using as it smells better.</li>
            <li>I did two treatments and barely made a dent in the supply, so I feel like you get a pretty good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>My skin is more vibrant, hydrated and even toned.</li>
            <li>Has a mild eucalyptus-y smell when on face and as it dries.</li>
            <li>Another positive is that it is easy to wash off after application.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin so most skin care products break me out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several mud/clay products before but I am really pleased with this one!</li>
            <li>I love watching this product dry onto my face and see all of the oily dots appear where I&#x27;m most oily.</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing, especially when I apply my make up.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Worth trying once to see if its a match.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how quick and easy the mask came off.  </li>
            <li>That’s right, face masks.</li>
            <li>Unlike others I&#x27;ve tried, it is not messy to apply and washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>This product  offers a lot  of ingredients for anti - aging to help with wrinkles,  fine lines, collegen build up, tighten muscles.</li>
            <li>It’s easy to clean up, so don’t worry about a huge mess.</li>
            <li>Salicylic Deep Gel Cleanser (my new favorite cleanser!)</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t expecting the  texture (It was my first mask</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>and yes, I did make it to the store before the monsters came home ;)</li>
            <li>My skin feels less abrasive, smoother, and most importantly firmer around my &amp;#34;wrinkle zones&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Even after the very first use, my skin was significantly softer and smoother - even the next morning!</li>
            <li>I was compelled to write a positive review for this very reason.</li>
            <li>I love to try new facial products-</li>
            <li>And while, after taking it off, my face felt super soft, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in appearance, in terms of clarity or &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34;-ness.</li>
            <li>I also did not notice any reduction in fine lines, but there may be further improvement with continued use.</li>
            <li>In the hot Phoenix climate, it is particularly soothing.</li>
            <li>My first mud mask experience was in high school.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about my beauty products and this is a winner.  </li>
            <li>it was starting to sound like something I wanted to eat!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That combination of ingredients really works to combine to something you don&#x27;t mind having on your face for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for letting me review it.</li>
            <li>It tightens your skin and really wakes you up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through a whole tub</li>
            <li>This is the one product that I will absolute splurge on.</li>
            <li>Very firming and clarifying.  </li>
            <li>The consistancy is smooth, not gritty, and when dry, comes off easily.</li>
            <li>There was no unpleasant smells like some of the other products I have used and the clean up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to keep using it and seeing further results.  </li>
            <li>It had a nice little glow to it that I usually do not get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay</li>
            <li>This is a lot faster and just as, if not more, effective,</li>
            <li>I feel a slight difference in my skin, but hope that with more uses, this will continue to improve.</li>
            <li>There are so many minerals in this product that I’m left here wondering how they manage to keep this price this low.</li>
            <li>The mask was easy to apply and it left my skin feeling tight, smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply AND rinse off, unlike other muds I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>had no irritation from the mask, a slight tingly feeling towards the end of my 10 minutes, but that is pretty standard for me in most masks.</li>
            <li>, this mud mask left my skin clean, clear, smooth (firm) and toned, but NOT dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Until recently, I went to monthly professional facials but don&#x27;t have time right now.  </li>
            <li>This product works wonders on my skin and it was totally noticable after my first use.</li>
            <li>Big thanks!</li>
            <li>and my skin feels smooth and tight for awhile</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, so I was a tad hesitant to try this out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a skin care/cosmetic junkie (I work in the industry as a professional makeup artist</li>
            <li>All the key benefits needed, high quality ingredients at an affordable price point!</li>
            <li>: I personally did not care for the scent, which reminded me too much of Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and experience of this face mud.</li>
            <li>The price maybe a question foe 2oz, however the product has plenty of ingredients too help the mature skin.</li>
            <li>I have oily sensitive skin that is prone to adult acne.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect; it’s not too thick, nor is it too thin.</li>
            <li>Even after one use I can already tell it has helped clear out the impurities in my pores and leaves my skin feeling SO soft, smooth and tight!</li>
            <li>I don’t know why I spent all that money on other masks when all I needed was this jar of magic.</li>
            <li>I learned that a little goes a long way; about a dime-sized dab covered most of my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I have actually come to enjoy the dark color.</li>
            <li>My face was smooth, and no kidding, I think the wrinkles between my eyebrows evened out a little!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry middle-aged skin, which has seen way too much sun in my younger days.  </li>
            <li>Upon application, during the first few minutes, I could feel a slight tingling/stinging feeling, but it quickly subsided.</li>
            <li>I am a 34 year old male</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was quite skeptical about it&#x27;s &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; benefits.</li>
            <li>The mask is a fine smooth consistency that you apply in a thin layer over your face and let dry (which takes a few minutes) and rinse off.</li>
            <li>Because it goes on so easily, and since you only need a small amount for each mask, the jar will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I allowed the mask to dry completely (it took about 10 minutes).</li>
            <li>I am a middle aged women with rosacea and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I simply smoothed it onto my freshly washed face in a thin layer (if you use too much, it won’t dry properly).</li>

            <li> I absolutely LOVE how this mask feels going on my skin and the feeling after.</li>
            <li> It draws out impurities from my pores like a magnet, leaving my face feeling cleaner and more renewed than ever.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes perfectly, but if you need that extra kick, you can follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t really enjoy dabbling in these kind of products.  </li>
            <li> I love this mask.  </li>
            <li> This is the part where I fell in love with the mask and my rear view mirror...</li>
            <li> so far, my skin is looking and feeling good!</li>
            <li> I like way it &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; and dries quickly; 10 minutes is usually perfect for me, even with my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much for letting me review it.this product, and I will be happy to use it on my face again!</li>
            <li> Overall, I was satisfied with the product and would recommend it as a nice, pleasant face mud.</li>
            <li> is just such a wonderful ingredient on its own, but when you add in all the other good stuff like the Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud Mask has, it just makes it even better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mask was easy to use and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> was easy.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It gives that genuine spa feeling to the product and it is easy to know I washed it all off this way.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Some mud products are a bit thicker and require a bit of effort to smooth onto your skin, yet this product applies and washes off easily.  </li>
            <li> My skin’s texture and pore-size have greatly improved in 3 short weeks.</li>
            <li> Since then I have used the product a few times and have been thoroughly impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I got this MegaMud as a gift and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it was so comfortable that I forgot I had it on.</li>
            <li> Most importantly I have not broken out!</li>
            <li> I received a sample via Tomoson and was so excited.</li>
            <li> and I was expecting a more firm texture but even with the texture of this mask, it does a great job).</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What is special about this</li>
            <li> After I removed the mask, my face felt soft and clean and just amazing.</li>
            <li> I am also happy to report that it did not burn my skin off, and I was able to go to work the following day with a clean, clear, smoothed out face.</li>
            <li> It is light and overall the scent is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It always feels cool coming out of the container.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is to make sure you stir it ( as recommended) before using as it smells better.</li>
            <li> I did two treatments and barely made a dent in the supply, so I feel like you get a pretty good bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> My skin is more vibrant, hydrated and even toned.</li>
            <li> Has a mild eucalyptus-y smell when on face and as it dries.</li>
            <li> Another positive is that it is easy to wash off after application.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so most skin care products break me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several mud/clay products before but I am really pleased with this one!</li>
            <li> I love watching this product dry onto my face and see all of the oily dots appear where I&#x27;m most oily.</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing, especially when I apply my make up.  </li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Worth trying once to see if its a match.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how quick and easy the mask came off.  </li>
            <li> That’s right, face masks.</li>
            <li> Unlike others I&#x27;ve tried, it is not messy to apply and washes off easily.  </li>
            <li> This product  offers a lot  of ingredients for anti - aging to help with wrinkles,  fine lines, collegen build up, tighten muscles.</li>
            <li> It’s easy to clean up, so don’t worry about a huge mess.</li>
            <li> Salicylic Deep Gel Cleanser (my new favorite cleanser!)</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t expecting the  texture (It was my first mask</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> and yes, I did make it to the store before the monsters came home ;)</li>
            <li> My skin feels less abrasive, smoother, and most importantly firmer around my &amp;#34;wrinkle zones&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Even after the very first use, my skin was significantly softer and smoother - even the next morning!</li>
            <li> I was compelled to write a positive review for this very reason.</li>
            <li> I love to try new facial products-</li>
            <li> And while, after taking it off, my face felt super soft, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in appearance, in terms of clarity or &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34;-ness.</li>
            <li> I also did not notice any reduction in fine lines, but there may be further improvement with continued use.</li>
            <li> In the hot Phoenix climate, it is particularly soothing.</li>
            <li> My first mud mask experience was in high school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my beauty products and this is a winner.  </li>
            <li> it was starting to sound like something I wanted to eat!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That combination of ingredients really works to combine to something you don&#x27;t mind having on your face for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for letting me review it.</li>
            <li> It tightens your skin and really wakes you up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a whole tub</li>
            <li> This is the one product that I will absolute splurge on.</li>
            <li> Very firming and clarifying.  </li>
            <li> The consistancy is smooth, not gritty, and when dry, comes off easily.</li>
            <li> There was no unpleasant smells like some of the other products I have used and the clean up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited to keep using it and seeing further results.  </li>
            <li> It had a nice little glow to it that I usually do not get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay</li>
            <li> This is a lot faster and just as, if not more, effective,</li>
            <li> I feel a slight difference in my skin, but hope that with more uses, this will continue to improve.</li>
            <li> There are so many minerals in this product that I’m left here wondering how they manage to keep this price this low.</li>
            <li> The mask was easy to apply and it left my skin feeling tight, smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply AND rinse off, unlike other muds I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> had no irritation from the mask, a slight tingly feeling towards the end of my 10 minutes, but that is pretty standard for me in most masks.</li>
            <li> , this mud mask left my skin clean, clear, smooth (firm) and toned, but NOT dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until recently, I went to monthly professional facials but don&#x27;t have time right now.  </li>
            <li> This product works wonders on my skin and it was totally noticable after my first use.</li>
            <li> Big thanks!</li>
            <li> and my skin feels smooth and tight for awhile</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, so I was a tad hesitant to try this out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin care/cosmetic junkie (I work in the industry as a professional makeup artist</li>
            <li> All the key benefits needed, high quality ingredients at an affordable price point!</li>
            <li> : I personally did not care for the scent, which reminded me too much of Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and experience of this face mud.</li>
            <li> The price maybe a question foe 2oz, however the product has plenty of ingredients too help the mature skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily sensitive skin that is prone to adult acne.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is perfect; it’s not too thick, nor is it too thin.</li>
            <li> Even after one use I can already tell it has helped clear out the impurities in my pores and leaves my skin feeling SO soft, smooth and tight!</li>
            <li> I don’t know why I spent all that money on other masks when all I needed was this jar of magic.</li>
            <li> I learned that a little goes a long way; about a dime-sized dab covered most of my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have actually come to enjoy the dark color.</li>
            <li> My face was smooth, and no kidding, I think the wrinkles between my eyebrows evened out a little!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry middle-aged skin, which has seen way too much sun in my younger days.  </li>
            <li> Upon application, during the first few minutes, I could feel a slight tingling/stinging feeling, but it quickly subsided.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old male</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was quite skeptical about it&#x27;s &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; benefits.</li>
            <li> The mask is a fine smooth consistency that you apply in a thin layer over your face and let dry (which takes a few minutes) and rinse off.</li>
            <li> Because it goes on so easily, and since you only need a small amount for each mask, the jar will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I allowed the mask to dry completely (it took about 10 minutes).</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged women with rosacea and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I simply smoothed it onto my freshly washed face in a thin layer (if you use too much, it won’t dry properly).</li>
            <li> It then dried quickly (within about three minutes) and felt pleasantly firm on my face.</li>
            <li> I may purchase again, but this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to begin with, considering I have super sensitive skin that easily breaks out with the wrong products</li>
            <li> Other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried in the past require a face towel, hot water, and lots of scrubbing which irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is a little bit oily.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the mud itself goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I experience burning with other mud masks, but this one was simply relaxing to apply.</li>
            <li> Wash your face, apply the paste evenly as desired and let dry for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the long lasting effects of the skin tightening, but I can definitely feel a difference when I rinse and dry my face.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards, I usually apply the Via Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel for lush hydration...</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s not harsh, I have used it withing a few days of my previous use as a skin brightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After ten minutes, your skin is cleaned of dead skin cells, brighter and also rehydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using VIA for only a few weeks</li>
            <li> The next day after using this product I could see less wrinkles around my eyes!</li>
            <li> My husband, who is about as unobservant as one could possibly be, even commented that he thought my between-the-brow wrinkles had smoothed out a little!</li>
            <li> A little bit of the mask goes a long way.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical but after reading the reviews I took the chance</li>
            <li> Take it from someone who&#x27;s uses minimal cosmetic products, this stuff is a staple and I&#x27;ll continue to use it!</li>
            <li> My face is a smoother and the pores slightly less</li>
            <li> It definitely freshened my dull skin after using just twice!</li>
            <li> the way of mud masks, I like that you can get the effects of a mud mask without having to apply a thick layer which takes 10+ minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> The color is gray which is a little off-putting.</li>
            <li> , I have been using the Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud treatment a few times per week.</li>
            <li> You only need a thin layer</li>
            <li> It was green.</li>
            <li> And, it dried out my face to a papery texture in about five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, one tub still lasts months because you only need a thin layer per use.</li>
            <li> Don’t want to waste time and money at the spa?</li>
            <li> I use a cleansing cloth or small face towel to remove, which doubles as an exfoliator when removing.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s a little expensive</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already addicted to it.  </li>
            <li> I am always very careful about what I use on my face as I have had plenty of bad experiences.</li>
            <li> now that is a disturbing image..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Great stuff! Honestly, I was quite skeptical about it&#x27;s &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; benefits. I also have sensitive skin, so I was a tad hesitant to try this out. I waited for chance where I wouldn&#x27;t be leaving the house for a while (just in case this stuff burned my skin off, or something), and applied it according to the directions. The smell is...different. I didn&#x27;t make me want to gag, but it wasn&#x27;t the most pleasant either. Upon application, during the first few minutes, I could feel a slight tingling/stinging feeling, but it quickly subsided. I left the mask on for 15 minutes, then washed it off with water. My face felt magnificent!  My face was smooth, and no kidding, I think the wrinkles between my eyebrows evened out a little! I am also happy to report that it did not burn my skin off, and I was able to go to work the following day with a clean, clear, smoothed out face. I used this product again at the end of the week, and had the same results. My husband, who is about as unobservant as one could possibly be, even commented that he thought my between-the-brow wrinkles had smoothed out a little! Now THAT is something!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with hesitation. I am glad I took the chance because I LOVE IT!  At first, I was skeptical but after reading the reviews I took the chance and I am GLAD I DID!&lt;br /&gt;1. The color is gray which is a little off-putting. I was expecting / hoping for a white cream but it is mud so it&#x27;s fine. I have actually come to enjoy the dark color. It gives that genuine spa feeling to the product and it is easy to know I washed it all off this way.&lt;br /&gt;2. The smell is very reminiscent to menthol (like Vick&#x27;s vapor rub). It clears the pores and nostrils which is great! I was worried I would have a stink mud around my nose but I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;3. The next day after using this product I could see less wrinkles around my eyes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the MegaMud twice and I&#x27;m already addicted to it.  I&#x27;m very picky about my beauty products and this is a winner.  It feels great while it&#x27;s on and then once it&#x27;s rinsed off, I feel like my skin feels smoother and younger.  I&#x27;m really excited to keep using it and seeing further results.  Stay tuned for my update!</li>
            <li> My son discovered the VIA Cosmedics products and recommended that I give them a try. I have very sensitive, dry middle-aged skin, which has seen way too much sun in my younger days.  After washing my face with the Perfect Image Salicylic Deep Gel Cleanser (my new favorite cleanser!), I have been using the Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud treatment a few times per week. I was amazed from the start at how it brought out the impurities from my problematic menopausal acne-prone areas.  My skin’s texture and pore-size have greatly improved in 3 short weeks. More importantly, the product has enhanced my skin’s ability to absorb the moisturizer, which I love!  I actually look forward to seeing my aesthetician’s reaction on our next appointment.  I am sure she will be just as impressed as I have been.</li>
            <li> Works great!  So far I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Love these products! I&#x27;ve now tried 2 of the masks (mud &amp; cucumber)...I&#x27;m a skin care/cosmetic junkie (I work in the industry as a professional makeup artist so I know the importance of a good prepped canvas!) so I&#x27;m always looking for products that work to use myself and recommend to clients! All the key benefits needed, high quality ingredients at an affordable price point! The buzz is going around about these...give a try a see for yourself!!</li>
            <li> I have used this mud mask 4 times since I purchased it.  My skin looks amazing, especially when I apply my make up.  I have recommended this product to several friends.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love to try new facial products- especially mud masks- so I was very pleased to get approved for the Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud Mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is special about this mud?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for all skin types&lt;br /&gt;for all ages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is in Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud Mask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;age-fighting peptides- Matrixyl® 3000 (Palmitoyl Oligopeptide &amp; Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide)&lt;br /&gt;bentonite clay&lt;br /&gt;kaolin clay&lt;br /&gt;botanicals&lt;br /&gt;Argireline® (Acetyl Hexapeptide)&lt;br /&gt;hyaluronic acid&lt;br /&gt;Green tea&lt;br /&gt;pumpkin&lt;br /&gt;pineapple&lt;br /&gt;pomegranate&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For a second there it was starting to sound like something I wanted to eat!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is NOT in  Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud Mask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cruelty!&lt;br /&gt;parabens&lt;br /&gt;sulfates&lt;br /&gt;harmful ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was my experience with Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud Mask?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OHHH now that is a disturbing image.. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I liked the way it smelled. That combination of ingredients really works to combine to something you don&#x27;t mind having on your face for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It always feels cool coming out of the container. In the hot Phoenix climate, it is particularly soothing. I like to use the mud masks before a shower. You can do this in the sink, but I always feel like I have it in my hair, even if I pull it all back.. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for about 10 minutes, and after I had a chance to chase the toddler around. She finds this sort of thing amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no irritation from the mask, a slight tingly feeling towards the end of my 10 minutes, but that is pretty standard for me in most masks. I rinsed it in the shower and was very happy to feel how soft my face was. It had a nice little glow to it that I usually do not get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clay is just such a wonderful ingredient on its own, but when you add in all the other good stuff like the Anti-Aging Peptide MegaMud Mask has, it just makes it even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this product, and I will be happy to use it on my face again! Thanks so much for letting me review it.this product, and I will be happy to use it on my face again! Thanks so much for letting me review it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask  a handful of times and can relay that it is very easy to use. The consistancy is smooth, not gritty, and when dry, comes off easily. I feel a slight difference in my skin, but hope that with more uses, this will continue to improve. My face is a smoother and the pores slightly less defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not the most pleasant, king of a mix of sulfur and petrol. After rinsing, most of the smell is gone. I may purchase again, but this jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Anti-Aging MegaMud about a month ago. Since then I have used the product a few times and have been thoroughly impressed with the results. My skin feels less abrasive, smoother, and most importantly firmer around my &amp;#34;wrinkle zones&amp;#34;. Not to mention the mud itself goes a long way! The price along with the longevity of the product makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting great bang for my buck. I will definitely be recommending MegaMud to my friends!</li>
            <li> My girl really enjoyed this. She said she saw a noticeable difference in the smoothness of skin and her complexion. Really liked the smell and feel of the mud. Would buy again. I feel like it&#x27;s a little expensive but what do I know.</li>
            <li> If you do not have time or money for a spa, here is your product. Easy to put on, perfect smooth texture. After ten minutes, your skin is cleaned of dead skin cells, brighter and also rehydrated.</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t expecting the  texture (It was my first mask and I was expecting a more firm texture but even with the texture of this mask, it does a great job). I really love this mask. I can feel the tightening happening and my skin feels smooth and tight for awhile after.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great mud mask to use for a weekly routine. The mask is a fine smooth consistency that you apply in a thin layer over your face and let dry (which takes a few minutes) and rinse off. I use a cleansing cloth or small face towel to remove, which doubles as an exfoliator when removing. It tightens your skin and really wakes you up. Because it&#x27;s not harsh, I have used it withing a few days of my previous use as a skin brightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the way of mud masks, I like that you can get the effects of a mud mask without having to apply a thick layer which takes 10+ minutes to dry. This is a lot faster and just as, if not more, effective,</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged women with rosacea and I have very sensitive skin. I am always very careful about what I use on my face as I have had plenty of bad experiences. I have used this product 3 times and I absolutely love it! It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and I actually look forward to the next time I use it. It is very easy to use and smells refreshing. You only need a thin layer so you will get many applications from the container. My only suggestion is to make sure you stir it ( as recommended) before using as it smells better.</li>
            <li> One of the best I&#x27;ve tried. I received a sample via Tomoson and was so excited. My first mud mask experience was in high school. It was green. It was goopey. And, it dried out my face to a papery texture in about five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this mud mask left my skin clean, clear, smooth (firm) and toned, but NOT dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is very easy to use. I simply smoothed it onto my freshly washed face in a thin layer (if you use too much, it won’t dry properly). I allowed the mask to dry completely (it took about 10 minutes). Then, I easily washed it off with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part, though, is that the mask contains no parabens, sulfates, or harmful ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old male and I have been using this product for about two weeks.  I&#x27;ve tried several mud/clay products before but I am really pleased with this one! I love the smell (a mix of mint and eucalyptus) and the ease of application.  Some mud products are a bit thicker and require a bit of effort to smooth onto your skin, yet this product applies and washes off easily.  I&#x27;m not sure of the long lasting effects of the skin tightening, but I can definitely feel a difference when I rinse and dry my face.  So far I am pleased with it!  I&#x27;ve started a regiment of this mud, vitamin C, and hyaluronic acid - so far, my skin is looking and feeling good!</li>
            <li> Pros: The color (gray) and scent (menthol) of this mud mask are gender neutral. A little bit of the mask goes a long way. I did two treatments and barely made a dent in the supply, so I feel like you get a pretty good bang for your buck. The mask was easy to use and easy to wash off. I did notice that my face was softer immediately after and for up to 24 hours later. There also appeared to be some pore minimization after the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I personally did not care for the scent, which reminded me too much of Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub. I also did not notice any reduction in fine lines, but there may be further improvement with continued use.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and experience of this face mud. It leaves a nice, minty smell that made me feel clean despite the fact that I was smearing goop on my face! I learned that a little goes a long way; about a dime-sized dab covered most of my face and neck. It then dried quickly (within about three minutes) and felt pleasantly firm on my face. And while, after taking it off, my face felt super soft, I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in appearance, in terms of clarity or &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34;-ness. Overall, I was satisfied with the product and would recommend it as a nice, pleasant face mud.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the mask has a great smell. It is light and overall the scent is very refreshing. After I removed the mask, my face felt soft and clean and just amazing. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I have sensitive skin that is a little bit oily. I&#x27;ve gone through a whole tub and I&#x27;m about to get more. I love watching this product dry onto my face and see all of the oily dots appear where I&#x27;m most oily. Sometimes, just so it lasts longer, I just put it on my T-zone and on my nose. However, one tub still lasts months because you only need a thin layer per use. This is the one product that I will absolute splurge on. Worth the cost. I have not found anything better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a couple days ago and I already received it with my prime shipping. I absolutely LOVE how this mask feels going on my skin and the feeling after. Even after one use I can already tell it has helped clear out the impurities in my pores and leaves my skin feeling SO soft, smooth and tight! (Which who doesn&#x27;t love that?!)  I will definitely be ordering more for Christmas. What a perfect gift!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mask!  Unlike others I&#x27;ve tried, it is not messy to apply and washes off easily.  More importantly, my skin is very happy afterwards!  I like way it &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; and dries quickly; 10 minutes is usually perfect for me, even with my sensitive skin.  Afterwards, I usually apply the Via Sea Whip Cucumber Detox Soothing Gel for lush hydration... I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so most skin care products break me out. I&#x27;ve been using VIA for only a few weeks and I can already see and feel the difference in my skin! My skin is more vibrant, hydrated and even toned. Most importantly I have not broken out! Definitely a must have! -Annitra</li>
            <li> Im a guy and I unabashedly like and use this pack.I was skeptical to begin with, considering I have super sensitive skin that easily breaks out with the wrong products but this pack was a joy to apply and feel on my face. Has a mild eucalyptus-y smell when on face and as it dries. Application was simple. Wash your face, apply the paste evenly as desired and let dry for 10-15 minutes. After wash, felt my skin smoother, tighter and fresher looking. There was no smell after I washed the mud away. Would recommend this for men and women alike but like any skin product, your mileage may vary. Worth trying once to see if its a match. Also, might be helpful to note, the tub would probably allow me about 30-40 applications. I would still but this as a good investment on your skin and youthful looks.</li>
            <li> Amazed how this product does not have an order while on my face. This product  offers a lot  of ingredients for anti - aging to help with wrinkles,  fine lines, collegen build up, tighten muscles. The price maybe a question foe 2oz, however the product has plenty of ingredients too help the mature skin.</li>
            <li> I got this MegaMud as a gift and it&#x27;s fantastic.  It&#x27;s easy to apply AND rinse off, unlike other muds I&#x27;ve tried.  Even after the very first use, my skin was significantly softer and smoother - even the next morning! Because it goes on so easily, and since you only need a small amount for each mask, the jar will last for a long time.  It&#x27;s got great quality ingredients that I&#x27;m comfortable using on my skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing feel and results from this MegaMud product!!  The mask was easy to apply and it left my skin feeling tight, smooth and refreshed.  I could actually see the impurities and oil being exfoliated from my skin by the mud mask.  There was no unpleasant smells like some of the other products I have used and the clean up was easy.  One of the best I have used and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Out of all of the beauty products I have bought, which category do 75% of them fall into? That’s right, face masks. That’s why I was overjoyed when I got to try out the Via Cosmetics Mud Mask. This mask is amazing. It draws out impurities from my pores like a magnet, leaving my face feeling cleaner and more renewed than ever. It’s wonderfully moisturizing, yet does not strip my face of any nutrients. Sometimes I experience burning with other mud masks, but this one was simply relaxing to apply. There are so many minerals in this product that I’m left here wondering how they manage to keep this price this low. The day after I use it, my skin still feels flawless. The consistency is perfect; it’s not too thick, nor is it too thin. It moisturizes perfectly, but if you need that extra kick, you can follow up with a moisturizer. I recommend using a Retinol Cream or Night Cream. It’s easy to clean up, so don’t worry about a huge mess. I don’t know why I spent all that money on other masks when all I needed was this jar of magic. Don’t want to waste time and money at the spa? Now you don’t have to. Just grab a tub of this mask.</li>
            <li> The MegaMud is top notch! This product works wonders on my skin and it was totally noticable after my first use. My skin looks and feels smoother and softer. Another positive is that it is easy to wash off after application. Other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried in the past require a face towel, hot water, and lots of scrubbing which irritated my skin. VIA&#x27;s mud mask has really impressed me and I&#x27;m definitely buying another once this one runs out! Big thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife picked up this stuff for me a couple months ago since she insisted I should start using something on my face to keep me looking youthful.  Being a 30yr male I generally don&#x27;t really enjoy dabbling in these kind of products.  I was compelled to write a positive review for this very reason. This stuff works!  It has a pleasant smell, leaves the skin feeling clean and rejuvenated, and both of us have noticed wrinkles disappearing around my eyes and cheeks. Take it from someone who&#x27;s uses minimal cosmetic products, this stuff is a staple and I&#x27;ll continue to use it!</li>
            <li> This is a great mask.  Very firming and clarifying.  It&#x27;s the foundation of my skincare routine.  Until recently, I went to monthly professional facials but don&#x27;t have time right now.  I find that this mask does as good a job. I have oily sensitive skin that is prone to adult acne.  I use the mask every week and my skin is beautiful.  Saves me hundreds of dollars, and I look just as good.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is awesome! I&#x27;ve been using on my face and have noticed how bright and smooth my face looks! It definitely freshened my dull skin after using just twice! I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness! I love this mask.  I am the, let me wash my face in the shower with the shampoo type of gal. I don&#x27;t  like the feel of lotions and potions. But once in awhile.... I take that glance in the mirror and say oh my! you gotta get with the program sister.  So google I went.. Got this mask and decided to give it a go. Put it on after I took a shower, then I cleaned the kitchen, the bathrooms, made the kids beds.... I know, I know I shouldn&#x27;t have but I have that OCD thingy I think.  Decided I had just enough time to run to the store and get groceries before the monsters came home... This is the part where I fell in love with the mask and my rear view mirror... Oh THANK GOD  for the rear view mirror... I was leaving for the store and forgot I had the mask on. Backing out, the corner of my eye, I see my reflection! Oops!  I ran inside to wash the mask off. I was pleasantly surprised at how quick and easy the mask came off.  I can&#x27;t believe it was so comfortable that I forgot I had it on. Trust me, that is saying a lot from the shampoo face washer lady......and yes, I did make it to the store before the monsters came home ;)</li>
