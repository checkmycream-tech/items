            <li>I would say Euphoria is more daring..and exciting...</li>

            <li>I like light floral pretty scents</li>
            <li>It may just be my new favorite floral.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent, lasts long and is very feminine.</li>
            <li>Good for people who are looking for a little strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Stays longer.&lt;br /&gt;Value for money.</li>
            <li>Smells great and long lasting what I like the most.</li>
            <li>just right, not too strong and really lasts.  </li>
            <li>By far the best fragrance by eternity moment...it has a very sexy, elegant, romantic, pretty and long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>This was a really good buy and it is of a very high standard.  </li>
            <li>And free shipping, thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>Smells better the longer it stays and at the end leaves a soft &amp;#34;blooming/spring&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>We rarely leave the house without dousing ourselves with perfume.</li>
            <li>Its a fresh floral - something you&#x27;d wear in the Spring/ Summer months.</li>
            <li>I like it far more than Eternity</li>
            <li>The smell it&#x27;s soft and elegant, fresh, chic.</li>
            <li>I have not bought this particular fragrance from Amazon but have bought others which were perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>They delivered super fast!</li>
            <li>Saw it on amazon and ordered one right away.</li>
            <li>No complaint but feel that it should be more unique and special especially from a brand name under Calvin Klein..</li>
            <li>Calvin Klein has several elegant scents which make a woman feel absolutely pretty! ...</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPMENT AND COLOGNE IS THE REAL THING!!</li>
            <li>I cant have enough of it :)</li>
            <li>It is so well-blended and really does evolve (and stay!)</li>
            <li>much!...</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Got it on Amazon without smelling it first - which was a risky first for me -</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Almost all shopping other than grocery i do online, honestly this it the first time writing a review</li>
            <li>missing a wow factor, but its a nice clean fragrance which can be worn almost anywhere.</li>
            <li>She liked the previous perfume very much, and when that finished - she wanted this particularly, even though she has a lot of perfumes.</li>
            <li>I am now my wife&#x27;s hero as she really likes this perfume.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like to buy perfumes online, but Calvin Klein</li>
            <li>The price was a bonus and the delivery fast .</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and when she saw it on her bed, she screamed, she really enjoys it</li>
            <li>and I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>but the few hours you you&#x27;ll feel fresh, and you will receive many compliments.</li>
            <li>It has is a long lasting  fresh smell I just love it.</li>
            <li>Yes, they colored the perfume pink to cover for that - but a more rounded, slightly tapered design would have worked better</li>
            <li>This is a classic Calvin Klein fragrance.</li>
            <li>Mom&#x27;s over 60 - so had to be particular to get her a fragrance that was also age-appropriate.</li>
            <li>This is a classic perfume, bought it for my mom&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li>Nice, light fragrance that can go both casual and dressy.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for any chick....</li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping and such a great deal for such an expensive product.</li>
            <li>There is also probably peony (!), or musky rose, I am not sure which.</li>
            <li>Love this classic from Calvin Klein, soft and summery not strong; flirty and feminine!!</li>
            <li>The top notes of the perfume are floral and it dries down to a Litchi note, which distinguishes it from a flat floral scent.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a early summer day in a botanical garden.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using eternity moment for a few years, love the scent, it like but definitely a fragrance people notice.</li>
            <li>So, I have decided to give each of my female-friends a small bottle of Eternity Moment on their birthdays in the next one year :)</li>
            <li>Perfectly Romantic Scent~~a mixure of Different Flowers Such as White Jasime &amp; Musk~~~~ &amp;#34;A scent that Transenting time &amp; Space, full of innocence &amp; Desire......&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Very soft yet romantic scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a soft, feminine, inoffensive floral scent, this definitely fits the bill.</li>

            <li> I would say Euphoria is more daring..and exciting...</li>
            <li> It too light.  </li>
            <li> Light floral fragrance..</li>
            <li> This is not always av available at the store</li>
            <li> I love this perfume its light and fresh and summery.</li>
            <li> Good perfume, I love this scent does not last all day.</li>
            <li> A nice floral scent that lingers (can be overpowering at first, but subsides quickly).</li>
            <li> I smells strong right after the first spray but fades into a nice floral scent...</li>
            <li> It is a clean, light scent</li>
            <li> One of my very favorite products!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this soft scent to any woman who does not want an over powering perfume</li>
            <li> Beautiful is too sharp for me now..</li>
            <li> all was great, product worked as expected and required.</li>
            <li> Delivered and received as expected and did a great job.</li>
            <li> A very sensual scent and receive many compliments already.</li>
            <li> crisp/clean/bright without being powdery too sweet or cloying.</li>
            <li> I mean, CK always make great products!</li>
            <li> I like light floral pretty scents</li>
            <li> It may just be my new favorite floral.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent, lasts long and is very feminine.</li>
            <li> Good for people who are looking for a little strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Stays longer.&lt;br /&gt;Value for money.</li>
            <li> Smells great and long lasting what I like the most.</li>
            <li> just right, not too strong and really lasts.  </li>
            <li> By far the best fragrance by eternity moment...it has a very sexy, elegant, romantic, pretty and long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> This was a really good buy and it is of a very high standard.  </li>
            <li> And free shipping, thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells better the longer it stays and at the end leaves a soft &amp;#34;blooming/spring&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> We rarely leave the house without dousing ourselves with perfume.</li>
            <li> Its a fresh floral - something you&#x27;d wear in the Spring/ Summer months.</li>
            <li> I like it far more than Eternity</li>
            <li> The smell it&#x27;s soft and elegant, fresh, chic.</li>
            <li> I have not bought this particular fragrance from Amazon but have bought others which were perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> They delivered super fast!</li>
            <li> Saw it on amazon and ordered one right away.</li>
            <li> No complaint but feel that it should be more unique and special especially from a brand name under Calvin Klein..</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein has several elegant scents which make a woman feel absolutely pretty! ...</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPMENT AND COLOGNE IS THE REAL THING!!</li>
            <li> I cant have enough of it :)</li>
            <li> It is so well-blended and really does evolve (and stay!)</li>
            <li> much!...</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Got it on Amazon without smelling it first - which was a risky first for me -</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Almost all shopping other than grocery i do online, honestly this it the first time writing a review</li>
            <li> missing a wow factor, but its a nice clean fragrance which can be worn almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> She liked the previous perfume very much, and when that finished - she wanted this particularly, even though she has a lot of perfumes.</li>
            <li> I am now my wife&#x27;s hero as she really likes this perfume.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like to buy perfumes online, but Calvin Klein</li>
            <li> The price was a bonus and the delivery fast .</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and when she saw it on her bed, she screamed, she really enjoys it</li>
            <li> and I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> but the few hours you you&#x27;ll feel fresh, and you will receive many compliments.</li>
            <li> It has is a long lasting  fresh smell I just love it.</li>
            <li> Yes, they colored the perfume pink to cover for that - but a more rounded, slightly tapered design would have worked better</li>
            <li> This is a classic Calvin Klein fragrance.</li>
            <li> Mom&#x27;s over 60 - so had to be particular to get her a fragrance that was also age-appropriate.</li>
            <li> This is a classic perfume, bought it for my mom&#x27;s birthday</li>
            <li> Nice, light fragrance that can go both casual and dressy.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for any chick....</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping and such a great deal for such an expensive product.</li>
            <li> There is also probably peony (!), or musky rose, I am not sure which.</li>
            <li> Love this classic from Calvin Klein, soft and summery not strong; flirty and feminine!!</li>
            <li> The top notes of the perfume are floral and it dries down to a Litchi note, which distinguishes it from a flat floral scent.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a early summer day in a botanical garden.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using eternity moment for a few years, love the scent, it like but definitely a fragrance people notice.</li>
            <li> So, I have decided to give each of my female-friends a small bottle of Eternity Moment on their birthdays in the next one year :)</li>
            <li> Perfectly Romantic Scent~~a mixure of Different Flowers Such as White Jasime &amp; Musk~~~~ &amp;#34;A scent that Transenting time &amp; Space, full of innocence &amp; Desire......&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very soft yet romantic scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a soft, feminine, inoffensive floral scent, this definitely fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Stays on clothes long too.</li>
            <li> excuse the delay in giving my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this, too bad it&#x27;s discontinued</li>
            <li> This perfume is getting harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume and I have ordered it in the past from Amazon multiple times.</li>
            <li> She says you need very little to spray on and it has a long effect.</li>
            <li> On my skin, this is just a bland, flat floral with poor lasting power.</li>
            <li> Give it 4 stars as the bottle, a long plain rectangular - is hardly feminine.</li>
            <li> but this was a little stronger than I remembered it to be.</li>
            <li> but then i seriously thought to leave a review  to warn people about this fake item, i bought it because i saw a lot of positive reviews on it,  </li>
            <li> I found it in 3 places this past holiday season</li>
            <li> was randomly mixed fake one.....????</li>
            <li> The smell of the perfume appears to be common.  </li>
            <li> and i thought to keep an extra piece, after months of the purchase i opened to used it today and got shocked with the smell</li>
            <li> I was not happy at all with the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find in stores</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> If you purchase this, you could never go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> because i wanted to warn buyers, it is a fake one and  has a terrible smell, i am a fan of eternity moment , there was no more EM on the market</li>
            <li> A blind purchase, couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
            <li> I like Eternity Moment and was very sad that I could not buy it anymore at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> , even my husband asked me why did you change your perfume brand, and he told me to go take a shower because i smelled bad...</li>
            <li> So when I found out that it was not being sold in stores anymore I was disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this scent. It is very womanly. I have used beautiful by estee lauder and CK Euphoria..I would say Euphoria is more daring..and exciting...this one is more elegant. Beautiful is too sharp for me now..</li>

            <li> I purchased this for my wife, at her request, for Valentine&#x27;s Day. She loves it. It is difficult to find in stores and I was glad to get it via Amazon.  I am now my wife&#x27;s hero as she really likes this perfume. We had looked for it in many stores, but found it on ebay.</li>
            <li> Okay so i ordered this to give as gift to a friend.  she  likes the scent.  i personally did not like the scent.  It too light.  anyway the price was good and shipping was fast.</li>

            <li> I just bought this perfum as a gift to my mom, and she loves it, is one of her favorite ones... Original one, excellent smell... AAA+++ I mean, CK always make great products!</li>
            <li> A great floral scent!  It is so well-blended and really does evolve (and stay!) throughout the day.  I have never gotten the fruit notes that are listed, but I do not mind!  If you are looking for a soft, feminine, inoffensive floral scent, this definitely fits the bill.</li>
            <li> This perfume is just right...not too heavy...can be worn without worrying about overwhelming people...have gotten many compliments when wearing it.  Great value for this price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like to buy perfumes online, but Calvin Klein you can&#x27;t go wrong. It&#x27;s a very sweet perfume though.</li>
            <li> This product from Calvin Klein has a beautiful scent and I love the versatility from day wear to evening wear.</li>
            <li> The top notes of the perfume are floral and it dries down to a Litchi note, which distinguishes it from a flat floral scent.  Nice sillage, I could smell it on me for 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its missing a wow factor, but its a nice clean fragrance which can be worn almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to buy some for here, if I find, as this parfum is not produced anymore. I bought 3.</li>
            <li> By far the best fragrance by eternity moment...it has a very sexy, elegant, romantic, pretty and long lasting scent. Eternity moment is my favorite women&#x27;s perfume. Great price! And free shipping, thanks amazon.</li>

            <li> Got this as a gift for my wife. Its her favorite perfume and this is a great deal. Smells better the longer it stays and at the end leaves a soft &amp;#34;blooming/spring&amp;#34; smell. Got this for her almost 3 years ago and she still has about 1/2 bottle left and it still smells great as the day I bought it.</li>

            <li> FAST SHIPMENT AND COLOGNE IS THE REAL THING!!</li>
            <li> This perfume is getting harder and harder to find.  I love the fact you can still find it out on Amazon.  Product was exactly as described and delivered quickly.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I purchase this every year for Christmas for my co-worker.  She loves it and it smell nice as well. If you purchase this, you could never go wrong.  It is not to strong.</li>
            <li> Light floral fragrance.. Longetivity is moderate on my skin... I like it and use it daily for work. I smells strong right after the first spray but fades into a nice floral scent...</li>
            <li> Quality and value real good</li>
            <li> A beautiful flowery scent, with a touch of sweetness. I bought it as a gift for my daughter in law and she totally loved it! The price was a bonus and the delivery fast . From now on this fragrance is one of my favorite top 5.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great purchase...thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Bought this for mom, who like me, is a good-scent addict. We rarely leave the house without dousing ourselves with perfume. Got it on Amazon without smelling it first - which was a risky first for me - but with the reviews, I went for it. Glad I did. Smells wonderful - she loves it!! A nice floral scent that lingers (can be overpowering at first, but subsides quickly). Stays on clothes long too. Its a fresh floral - something you&#x27;d wear in the Spring/ Summer months. Mom&#x27;s over 60 - so had to be particular to get her a fragrance that was also age-appropriate. This one covers that wonderfully - and has a smell that is both accordingly youthful and elegant. Would highly recommend! Give it 4 stars as the bottle, a long plain rectangular - is hardly feminine. Also makes the perfume &#x27;appear&#x27; cheaper than it is/ smells like (a gift-givers nightmare). Yes, they colored the perfume pink to cover for that - but a more rounded, slightly tapered design would have worked better (I guess thats the Eternity signature, and this is discontinued in stores so doesn&#x27;t matter anyway). Buy away!</li>
            <li> One of my very favorite products!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this soft scent to any woman who does not want an over powering perfume</li>
            <li> I love the light smell of Eternity Moment.  It is the perfect winter scent. This is not always av available at the store so I am happy to see it on here.</li>
            <li> Very soft yet romantic scent that lasts all day. I had many compliments on this.</li>
            <li> For me Eternity Moment is one of those perfumes to which I am forever attached. I can&#x27;t tell how many times people have asked me what it is I am wearing when i have it on. I love the pinkish color, the elegant and simple looking bottle, and the wonderful liquid inside. I like it far more than Eternity regular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for describing the perfume, it&#x27;s flowery-- I can smell water-lily, pomegranate blossom, and litchi. There is also probably peony (!), or musky rose, I am not sure which. But I do feel that this perfume has not received the attention it deserves. So, I have decided to give each of my female-friends a small bottle of Eternity Moment on their birthdays in the next one year :)</li>
            <li> Muchas gracias, compre desde Vevezuela con una Gif Card sin ningun contratiempo con el pago, me llego la mercancia acordada, gracias.</li>
            <li> The smell it&#x27;s soft and elegant, fresh, chic. Love this fragance. Arrived in perfect conditions and on time. Just one I wanted</li>
            <li> Good product to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great. Good for people who are looking for a little strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Stays longer.&lt;br /&gt;Value for money.</li>
            <li> This is a classic perfume, bought it for my mom&#x27;s birthday and she wears nothing but it</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance based on the Amazon reviews alone.  I LOVE the original Eternity fragrance and I LOVE floral scents, and after reading the existing reviews, decided why not.  So I did it...I purchased having not smelled this fragrance at all and I AM GLAD I DID. I was extremely pleased !!!  It may just be my new favorite floral.</li>
            <li> I Love love love this perfume! The smell is so good that everyone has to say something good about it. The price is awesome and I will surely buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It is very womanly.</li>
            <li> My mom love this,I got it for her a ways back and when she saw it on her bed, she screamed, she really enjoys it</li>
            <li> Love this, too bad it&#x27;s discontinued</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume and I have ordered it in the past from Amazon multiple times. She says you need very little to spray on and it has a long effect.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells on me. It is a clean, light scent and I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> The smell of the perfume appears to be common.  No complaint but feel that it should be more unique and special especially from a brand name under Calvin Klein..</li>
            <li> What else can I say, my wife loves this stuff, so what makes her happy, makes me happy, which in turn gets this a great review!</li>
            <li> I have loved this fragrance since it came out.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find.  I found it in 3 places this past holiday season but Amazon had the best price and shipped it right to my door quickly!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This was a really good buy and it is of a very high standard.  I would def purchase this perfume again from this sellar.</li>
            <li> On my skin, this is just a bland, flat floral with poor lasting power. It projects a soapy frangrance on clothes and lasts a bit longer. But my detergent can do that too - don&#x27;t need CK for that. Sorry, didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> A blind purchase, couldn&#x27;t be happier with it! Awesome sweet slightly floral fragrance in beautiful and big bottle! Highly recommend for any chick....the men like the alluring fragrance too! Great buy too!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It was shipped well and it has a wonderful scent - just right, not too strong and really lasts.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Almost all shopping other than grocery i do online, honestly this it the first time writing a review because i wanted to warn buyers, it is a fake one and  has a terrible smell, i am a fan of eternity moment , there was no more EM on the market and i thought to keep an extra piece, after months of the purchase i opened to used it today and got shocked with the smell, even my husband asked me why did you change your perfume brand, and he told me to go take a shower because i smelled bad...hehehe:(..... Now you imagine about the smell/scent, , i laughed but then i seriously thought to leave a review  to warn people about this fake item, i bought it because i saw a lot of positive reviews on it,  may be mine was randomly mixed fake one.....????</li>
            <li> very good product, more than I expected. actually fulfills posted. My wife was delighted with the product. Thank you. excuse the delay in giving my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> my favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li> Nice, light fragrance that can go both casual and dressy.  I wear it almost every day and always wear it to work.  The scent lasts all day, which is a plus.  I get nice complements from this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume does not seem that popular although I don&#x27;t know why as it seems to appeal to people of all ages due to its pleasant scent and fair price. I think Calvin Klein does not market this perfume correctly and that limits its sales.</li>
            <li> I really love this perfume. It smells like a early summer day in a botanical garden. It is so light/crisp/clean/bright without being powdery too sweet or cloying.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume! They delivered super fast! Very happy with it!</li>
