            <li>But it came well packaged and my fiance was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this ink after seeing so many great reviews....</li>
            <li>Great product even better price</li>
            <li>, The colors are great and vibrant Great addition to anyone set.</li>
            <li>These inks are the very best in my opinion, I love the vibrant colors and the consistency of the ink.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for 10 years, and my color work is still holding strong!</li>
            <li>but it could be better</li>
            <li>but like I said it could be better</li>
            <li>The colors are a bit darker and more saturated than in the photos</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it shipped and was delivered on time. :)</li>
            <li>and I love this ink</li>
            <li>moms ink bring out the live of the tats people love the look of the way it comes out bright</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t bother trying to save $ with other brands its your skin so buy the best</li>
            <li>The go in smooth as well.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with all the colors, not so much with the white.</li>
            <li>i have tried a few and for the money this is realy nice ink color stays bright and goes in smooth</li>
            <li>came as ordered and quickly.</li>
            <li>Very nice colors they go in smooth love the mixing ball in them to definitely some common colors that I will be using a lot of.</li>
            <li>but I would recommend to shop around first.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different ones but this brand is creat for color and shading!</li>
            <li>If you still want to buy this product, try with one color first and see how it works</li>
            <li>The ink doesn&#x27;t take well to skin, the healing time for this ink vs intenze is much longer.  </li>
            <li>It (the primary color set) mixes well to allow different color patterns.</li>
            <li>Never broken out or had any reactions from anyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m discarding the whole box.</li>
            <li>Glad I got quality over quantity and would definitely recommend this product to the professional and novice tattooer alike.</li>
            <li>Good Thick ink that can be diluted if needed</li>
            <li>fair price slow delivery</li>
            <li>I have used a few different inks in my time as an artist, but it seems that the moms ink is the best as far as brightness &amp; keeping the color in long after the tattoo heals, I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>, it is safe and quite a few tattoo artists use this in their shops.</li>
            <li>I got a new tattoo kit that came with ink</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t gotten to test it out yet for quality but the packaging is professional.</li>
            <li>It lays very well and will last for years and years!!</li>
            <li>And I can honestly say I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>What was sealed properly was decent.</li>

            <li> I have seen awful reactions and re worked a tattoo already...thinking it was a reaction for that person</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have just begain tattooing and the inks I have been using suck, MOM&#x27;s has been around a while.... I now see w&lt;br /&gt;Why it works. I am very happy with all the colors, not so much with the white. But then again white is hard to use.</li>
            <li> Great product.. Great seller!</li>
            <li> I actually found this set cheaper in a tattoo magazine the day after I ordered it. But it came well packaged and my fiance was very pleased with it. The ink itself is phenominal but I would recommend to shop around first.</li>
            <li> I got a new tattoo kit that came with ink but it was horrible and rely watery so I did my research and finally decided to buy this set and it is great very happy with it would r exam end toaanyone else geting into the tattoo bossiness</li>
            <li> its good but it could be better I do like it but like I said it could be better</li>
            <li> I ordered this ink after seeing so many great reviews.... And I can honestly say I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase. The ink doesn&#x27;t take well to skin, the healing time for this ink vs intenze is much longer.  I requested to return the item once complaints were brought to my attention.  And I realized the quality was not as good as the reviews said. My claim has been denied twice even though the seller never returned mr email/ calls. I will not going to use the product ever again. I&#x27;ll stick with INTENZE</li>
            <li> Colors are awesome to work with. Black does fade a bit though. Touch up time...</li>
            <li> Good Thick ink that can be diluted if needed, The colors are great and vibrant Great addition to anyone set.</li>
            <li> I forgot to leave a review when I bought this set for my son for Christmas last year. He loved it. The ink is good quality. My son is a Tattoo Artist and so he knows good quality when he sees it and uses it. Great price too.</li>
            <li> came as ordered and quickly. haven&#x27;t gotten to test it out yet for quality but the packaging is professional. The colors are a bit darker and more saturated than in the photos but that&#x27;s a great thing ^^.</li>
            <li> Moms ink is awesome. I covered up my junk work on myself from other scratchers with this and THIS INK LOOKS GREAT</li>
            <li> Great ink! I have tried many different ones but this brand is creat for color and shading! It (the primary color set) mixes well to allow different color patterns. I&#x27;ll only use Moms Ink in my tattoo shop! MOLON LABE INK!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, these are the best inks on the market. I have been using them for 10 years, and my color work is still holding strong! All inks will fade with time, but these seem to hold on the longest. The go in smooth as well. Really great inks to work with!</li>
            <li> fair price slow delivery</li>
            <li> Only ink I will use when tattooing. It is great and affordable. Never broken out or had any reactions from anyone. Got it as a birthday present one year and can&#x27;t get enough! These are beautiful colors and it was all there of course.</li>
            <li> moms ink bring out the live of the tats people love the look of the way it comes out bright makes the line bring out the tats</li>
            <li> The dark purple and white had an ink cup as a seal. Not very good. What was sealed properly was decent. This ink did it&#x27;s job, though I would suggest going to a retailer instead of buying this set online. That&#x27;s just me though. Otherwise, it shipped and was delivered on time. :)</li>
            <li> Fair price. I wish the bottles were bigger for this price, but a little ink goes a long way. Glad I got quality over quantity and would definitely recommend this product to the professional and novice tattooer alike.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different inks in my time as an artist, but it seems that the moms ink is the best as far as brightness &amp; keeping the color in long after the tattoo heals, I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am picky about tattoo inks and I love this ink, it is safe and quite a few tattoo artists use this in their shops. The colors are beautiful and you don&#x27;t have to worry about having them under your skin.</li>
            <li> i love the moms colors their brite yet bold and seem to hold their color well!!!!</li>
            <li> Great ink! Perfect addition to our ink selection.</li>
            <li> Good ink,good colors as well delivery was on time no complaints at all</li>
            <li> Very nice colors they go in smooth love the mixing ball in them to definitely some common colors that I will be using a lot of.</li>
            <li> Almost every color you could ask for and at a good price too! If you want a basic set then look no farther!</li>
            <li> i have tried a few and for the money this is realy nice ink color stays bright and goes in smooth cant wait for set #2</li>
            <li> Well I did just start but I did some digging  and found out that this is one of the few inks that Europe will buy from us and they seem to refused Asian inks... and I haven&#x27;t yet seen a recall on this ink ... red and yellow have been the most difficult colors to produce.  But I never had issue I as using this for over a year no issues</li>
            <li> These inks are the very best in my opinion, I love the vibrant colors and the consistency of the ink. It lays very well and will last for years and years!!</li>
            <li> Great product even better price</li>
            <li> moms is the best what else needs to be said...?  don&#x27;t bother trying to save $ with other brands its your skin so buy the best</li>
            <li> I have been tattooing for a while and bought this product to explore other options...I have been using ink that is alcohol based with great results...this ink has no alcohol and seems to be really hard for the body to assimilate the ink...I have seen awful reactions and re worked a tattoo already...thinking it was a reaction for that person only I used the ink on myself and had the same reaction....the color is gone...If you still want to buy this product, try with one color first and see how it works...hope this is helpful...I&#x27;m discarding the whole box.</li>
