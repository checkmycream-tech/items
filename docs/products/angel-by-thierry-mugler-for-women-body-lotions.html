            <li> Great smell. Actually better than the perfume. Cheaper than department stores. Real thing! Not a fake.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product it&#x27;s a must!!!! At one time this perfume was by invitation only .try it!!!</li>

            <li> The product is wonderful, I was very pleased. But the seller could have declared a lower value of the product not taxed either to get here, as occurred. I am qualifying with five stars for the product, but the taxes that it had been high, it makes a new purchase is thought twice.</li>
            <li> If you are an &amp;#34;Angel &amp;#34; connoisseur than this is the begin and end of the affair that fully compliments the Eau du cologne and any pairing of &amp;#34;Angel&amp;#34; and/or &amp;#34;Angel Men&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> I am using this cream for years.Is my favorite and i love it.</li>

            <li> Great, great, great and great, I love it and would recommend to all women.  The smell is out of this world.</li>

            <li> Order came right through, was even here a couple of days ahead.  Been enjoying it every day the fragrance on my skin.</li>
