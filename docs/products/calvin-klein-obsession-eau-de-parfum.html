            <li>It was just okay</li>
            <li>I love Obsession for Women by Calvin Klein.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Love love love...</li>
            <li>lovely scent for Calvin Klein.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>This my sisters favorite perfume so it was a gift.</li>
            <li>I love this purfume.  </li>
            <li>This was a last minute gift and it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was a great price.</li>
            <li>and maybe because I am 80 years old my sense of smell is not as good as it used to be!</li>
            <li>I have adored Obsession for 20 years and am please that I can buy it online at such a great price instead of waiting for someone to give me some for Christmas. :)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It is good price vs. another similar products more expensive&lt;</li>
            <li>First time using this perfume, I was sceptical about buying it but am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Its just right!</li>
            <li>Great price and delivery was faster than expected.</li>
            <li>My wife found it to sweet  smelling for her</li>
            <li>so reasonably price, was amazed!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was searching for.</li>
            <li>Maybe if my Dad was a bit more romantic, I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep buying this horrid smelling stuff for her.</li>
            <li>It really smelled as if it had been on the shelf for a long time - scent very strong - could not use it.</li>
            <li>This perfume had a much darker amber color</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Every year my mom wants me to buy her some of this stuff for Christmas.</li>
            <li>thought it was a larger bottle, I can get a better price locally, and not pay postage!</li>
            <li>The scent is not heavy or offensive.</li>
            <li>But how can I deny a 70-something year old woman her elixir of youth?</li>
            <li>Decent price and not all the extra junk you get at the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I would definitely recommend the fragrance to other buyers.</li>
            <li> I have tried other fragrances but always come back to Obsession!</li>
            <li> This must be the reformulated version of Obsession which smells cheap and awful, nothing like the original formula, save your money.</li>
            <li> I always wear Obsession at least for the last 20+</li>
            <li> About half the price I am us to paying for this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, and when I received it throught the mail, was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I DID NOT LOVE THE SCENT.  </li>
            <li> This stuff stinks.</li>

            <li> This was given as a gift and the recipient has not commented on whether or nor it meets her expectations.</li>
            <li> This must be the reformulated version of Obsession which smells cheap and awful, nothing like the original formula, save your money.</li>
            <li> I have used Obsession perfume many times over my lifetime.  This perfume had a much darker amber color and I did not think the fragrance was the same.  It was just okay and maybe because I am 80 years old my sense of smell is not as good as it used to be!</li>
            <li> I love Obsession for Women by Calvin Klein. I have worn the perfume for years. I would definitely recommend the fragrance to other buyers. The scent is not heavy or offensive. Its just right! I will buy the perfume again. Thanks</li>

            <li> Bought for my mom and she loves it. Decent price and not all the extra junk you get at the mall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lovely scent for Calvin Klein.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! It&#x27;s one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> It was very different from what I thought it would be - No, I do not like it. I should not have ordered it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, and when I received it throught the mail, was very disappointed.  It really smelled as if it had been on the shelf for a long time - scent very strong - could not use it.</li>
            <li> My wife found it to sweet  smelling for her</li>
            <li> Ugh. This stuff stinks. Every year my mom wants me to buy her some of this stuff for Christmas. And every year, I acquiesce to her request. Why? Because once upon a time, a checker in the grocery store told her she smelled good. I don&#x27;t know. I guess it was the highlight of her life. Maybe if my Dad was a bit more romantic, I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep buying this horrid smelling stuff for her. But how can I deny a 70-something year old woman her elixir of youth? No. No Calvin, I don&#x27;t have an obsession with your Obsession.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT LOVE THE SCENT.  NOT VENDOR&#x27;S ISSUE.  IT CAME QUICKLY/ WELL BOXED</li>
            <li> el producto es exacto al solicitado y en la pagina. el precio es accesible y el tiempo de entrega fue el indicado</li>
            <li> I always wear Obsession at least for the last 20+ years.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a larger bottle, I can get a better price locally, and not pay postage!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume for years. I always get compliments on how nice I smell.</li>
            <li> This my sisters favorite perfume so it was a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this purfume.  I get people complementing me all the time.  I am know for this now.  My husband likes it on me so that is always a plus.</li>
            <li> Nice price for the size. I have adored Obsession for 20 years and am please that I can buy it online at such a great price instead of waiting for someone to give me some for Christmas. :)</li>
            <li> This was a last minute gift and it was perfect.  Shipped fast and was a great price.</li>
