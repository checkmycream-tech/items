            <li>The Buf-Puf part of this scrubber is excellent; it exfoliates the skin</li>

            <li>It does not replace the washcloth, but is a very good supplement.</li>
            <li>great too if you have skin issues.</li>
            <li>It has a great reach also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for reaching that spot that you can never quite reach with your hands.</li>
            <li>I was extremely happy with the price</li>
            <li>lightweight and easy to use, not to ruff just perfect!</li>

            <li>I use it with a nice moisturizing body wash</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that you can choose a side.  </li>
            <li>My husband has been stealing mine, so I got him one of his own.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s awesome and a great way to clean your whole body.</li>
            <li>It always smells fresh and clean and works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>but I do have wonderful skin for 50 years old.</li>
            <li>This is the best back scrubber I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon stocks them.</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>A wonderful product and an essential bath product for me!</li>
            <li>I think the brush could have been a but more sturdy and a couple inches longer.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I really love this thing.</li>
            <li>Did an outstanding job.  </li>
            <li>I love Buf-Pufs.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after using it.  </li>
            <li>I love the things</li>
            <li>this  is the best back scrub i have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this product, give it for gift often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hygienic, it lasts forever, and it works gently but very effectively.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Their facial sponge is also a very good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good length and has a bit of a curve to it that helps really get some leverage.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 20 years and love it, I was glad to be able to find it on amazon at such a good price since the store I used to buy it from no longer carries this product or the sponge refills.</li>
            <li>Great skin exfoliator and back scrubber-like that new pads are available-looked for this in the stores for months and was so happy to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>Compact and affordable: hooked handle loops over showerhead and easily comes apart for storage.</li>
            <li>It is a two-part handle that easily comes apart when in use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize there was a handle ... there was no description available.  </li>
            <li>JUST LOOKS CHEAP...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t guess there are &amp;#34;refills&amp;#34; available for sponge.  </li>
            <li>My family liked it so much I have given them each one.</li>
            <li>It is helpful in the winter and summer to keep skin smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>This is great before putting on self tanner and especially after the self tanner starts to fade and it becomes blotchy, it scrubbed can get it off.  </li>
            <li>This is great for getting the conditioner residue cleaned off my back</li>
            <li>Thanks to everyone for writing such detailed reviews on Amazon, I never would have discovered the great Buf-Puf products without you!</li>
            <li>It feels great to exfoliate my back and have a tingly feeling after my shower.</li>
            <li>Great replacement for back scrubber.</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of back scrubbers and this one is the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>Far more effective at cleaning off dirt than a washcloth.</li>
            <li>Today I am replacing my old model of this that lasted a good 4-5 years.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of other (electronic) products on the market, but for a manual brush it is very good.</li>
            <li>well leaving it smooth, invigorated, and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>When you are done using it, you just pull it off, dispose of it, and put a clean pad</li>
            <li>This body sponge is just perfect for the dry New England winters.  </li>
            <li>Good product, I guarantee it would remove all pumps and blackheads on your chest and back.</li>
            <li>What can I say, who wouldn&#x27;t like a good back scratch?</li>
            <li>This is great for scrubbing my own back in the shower, and has a hooked handle so the sponge can be hung up to dry.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I am having more and more trouble finding it.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give this back scrub sponge a try and have been very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product because it makes it easy to reach and thoroughly scrub one&#x27;s back, and its mild exfoliating action is better than one can do with a washcloth on other parts of the body.  </li>
            <li>I have used these forever, they are great for &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; and keeping hard to reach spots smooth.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks healthy and younger than my age.</li>
            <li>I love my back scrubber.......</li>
            <li>This is my first one one a handle.</li>
            <li>A university study you can find here [...] has shown that the buf-puf combined with benzoyl peroxide is better than either of the treatments individually.    </li>
            <li>Always ready to go!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has a long handle</li>
            <li>Make sure you let the sponge air dry.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to reach your back.  </li>
            <li>And the back brush wand comes apart easily for travel or storage, and the price is incredibly reasonable.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice little product.</li>
            <li>Amazing results after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>I like the way it gently exfoliates my skin</li>
            <li>The pads really hold up very well.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin feel alive and fresh, I use it as often as I can</li>
            <li>I find these work much better than loofahs, or scrub mitts, or any other exfoliating product.</li>
            <li>This works great for exfoliating prior to self-tanner, gets the hard to reach places - what else can I say?</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t change the world but it helps my day begin a little better.</li>
            <li>They used to be readily available in drug and grocery stores, but are harder to find now.</li>
            <li>I replaced the scrubber part a few times and enjoyed the new look</li>
            <li>Disposable scrub pads, so you can start new when you need to.</li>
            <li>I find I need a new sponge about once a month.</li>
            <li>I was unfamiliar with the Buf-Puf brand until reading some reviews on Amazon while searching for a new sponge.  </li>
            <li>It is much more economical to recycle the handle than to replace an entire back bush and it is less to put in the landfill.</li>
            <li>The reason I give it 4-stars is that the Puf turns a bit hard and yellow/brown when used with benzoyl peroxide, I figure since so many people use it for acne that 3M would have developed a product safe to use with common acne fighting cleansers without reacting.</li>
            <li>It has a similar feel to a loufa sponge but lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li>so much I just bought another one for my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These pads work very well on your back, but you can also use them on your legs and arms.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job of exfoliating and removing the dead skin.</li>
            <li>I now have a &amp;#34;baby bottom&amp;#34; feel to my tush and am soft all over.  </li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Buf-Puf since it arrived on the scene in the early 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>However, I do have silky soft skin.</li>
            <li>It is not the behavior of a true Penny Pincher, I know, and I feel a little less clean for having done so.  </li>
            <li>I generally use the rougher one.</li>
            <li>and so far it appears to be very solid and well constructed.  </li>
            <li>I am always reading how important it is to exfoliate your skin, so I was trying to find a product long enough for me to reach down my</li>
            <li>Very smart idea, although it is not inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;There is a long plastic stick with 2 sharp prongs on it, that gets installed inside the pad.</li>
            <li>Nearly every time I use it, the two handle pieces separate while I am in the middle of scrubbing my back.</li>

            <li> Very smart idea, although it is not inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;There is a long plastic stick with 2 sharp prongs on it, that gets installed inside the pad.</li>
            <li> Nearly every time I use it, the two handle pieces separate while I am in the middle of scrubbing my back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since these handles are no longer being made, they have become the victim of price gouging by the few sources who still have some new, unused old stock.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the long handle for the back</li>
            <li> A lot of scrubbers aren&#x27;t rough enough to actually exfoliate your skin.  </li>
            <li> The handle lasts for a long time before needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I have use this product for years and I will be using it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> but it was more expensive!</li>
            <li> Only one of the other scrubbers or puffs I have tried worked (the two sided sponge sold here on Amazon- Aquasentials Dual Texture Bath Sponge)</li>
            <li> Use this a few times and it will get rid of the sensation that you need to have someone scratch your back during the day.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and find it hard to scrub my back.</li>
            <li> A secondary problem is that the handle is too short.</li>
            <li> One side is a little bit rougher while the other is softer.  </li>
            <li> None the less, I still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The handle could be a little longer, but then again I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2\\</li>
            <li> I just wish the handle was a little bit longer.  </li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize there was a handle ... there was no description available.  I thought the size of the box inticated the size of the Buf-Puf Sponge... boy was I wrong! The handle is flimsy and could potentially break. JUST LOOKS CHEAP...Don&#x27;t guess there are &amp;#34;refills&amp;#34; available for sponge.  $10,00 us a lot to pay for a 5&amp;#34; x 3 1/2&amp;#34; SPONGE and a crappy piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> Good product, I guarantee it would remove all pumps and blackheads on your chest and back. Just use it with any body cleaning products or soaps.</li>
            <li> I used this BuffPuff back scrubber for years now and Amazon is the only place i can buy them now.... It is the best you can buy 5 stars</li>
            <li> been using this guy for 30 years now. it&#x27;s awesome and a great way to clean your whole body. great too if you have skin issues.</li>
            <li> Compact and affordable: hooked handle loops over showerhead and easily comes apart for storage. I take it on all my trips!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 20 years and love it, I was glad to be able to find it on amazon at such a good price since the store I used to buy it from no longer carries this product or the sponge refills. I like the way it gently exfoliates my skin and I don&#x27;t have to use those expensive gritty exfoliants  My family liked it so much I have given them each one.</li>
            <li> This is the best back scrubber I&#x27;ve ever found.  It has a similar feel to a loufa sponge but lasts much longer.  The pad isn&#x27;t held on by adhesive so it doesn&#x27;t fall off after a month.  You can buy replacement pads but I&#x27;ve never had to.  The handle could be a little longer, but then again I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2\\&quot; so I have a longer way to go than some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. They used to be readily available in drug and grocery stores, but are harder to find now. I&#x27;m glad Amazon stocks them. I find these work much better than loofahs, or scrub mitts, or any other exfoliating product. The &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; has a softer side and a rougher side (the blue side). I generally use the rougher one. Their facial sponge is also a very good product. Start with the package that contains the handle, then just buy refills. The handle lasts for a long time before needed to be replaced. Make sure you let the sponge air dry.</li>
            <li> love this product.  it gets rid of the dead skin sells and my skin looks healthy and younger than my age.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little product. It won&#x27;t change the world but it helps my day begin a little better. I have used the facial Buf-Puf for years and it has helped keep my face fresh-looking and blemish-free. Now I have a Buf-Puf for the rest of me! I keep it hanging in my shower and use it every day. When the Buf-Puf sponge eventually must be replaced, I can reuse the handle. It is much more economical to recycle the handle than to replace an entire back bush and it is less to put in the landfill.</li>
            <li> This body sponge is just perfect for the dry New England winters.  I use it with a nice moisturizing body wash and I never have winter flakey skin.</li>
            <li> It is a two-part handle that easily comes apart when in use. A secondary problem is that the handle is too short.</li>
            <li> This is a must in the shower and tub</li>
            <li> This is a great body scrubber! I have oily skin and find it hard to scrub my back. This scrubber does the job. It comes with a plastic handle that you snap together. I like this body scrubber so much I just bought another one for my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li> The Buf-Puf part of this scrubber is excellent; it exfoliates the skin well leaving it smooth, invigorated, and clean feeling. However, the handle that the Buf-Puf is attached to is garbage. The handle arrives in two parts that you snap together. Nearly every time I use it, the two handle pieces separate while I am in the middle of scrubbing my back.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I am having more and more trouble finding it.  It&#x27;s the best body exfoliating sponge I have ever found. It&#x27;s hygienic, it lasts forever, and it works gently but very effectively.  And the back brush wand comes apart easily for travel or storage, and the price is incredibly reasonable.  A wonderful product and an essential bath product for me!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of other (electronic) products on the market, but for a manual brush it is very good.</li>
            <li> I am always reading how important it is to exfoliate your skin, so I was trying to find a product long enough for me to reach down my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had regular back scrubbers, but was told by my dermatologist that they carry a lot of bacteria. The answer? Disposable scrub pads, so you can start new when you need to. Very smart idea, although it is not inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;There is a long plastic stick with 2 sharp prongs on it, that gets installed inside the pad. When you are done using it, you just pull it off, dispose of it, and put a clean pad on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pads work very well on your back, but you can also use them on your legs and arms. It does a fantastic job of exfoliating and removing the dead skin. The pads really hold up very well. The only downside I have seen is I think the brush could have been a but more sturdy and a couple inches longer. None the less, I still recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of back scrubbers and this one is the absolute best.  Because of what it&#x27;s made of it doesn&#x27;t mildew while hanging in the shower.  It always smells fresh and clean and works wonderfully.  I now have a &amp;#34;baby bottom&amp;#34; feel to my tush and am soft all over.  I went into a panic when I couldn&#x27;t buy them from my usual source but thankfully found them here on amazon.  What a relief.</li>
            <li> best body scrubber ever.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Buf-Puf since it arrived on the scene in the early 80&#x27;s.  When I saw the long handle for the back I knew it was for me.  It is helpful in the winter and summer to keep skin smooth and glowing. Not sure if it is just genetics or skin care, but I do have wonderful skin for 50 years old.</li>
            <li> This works great for exfoliating prior to self-tanner, gets the hard to reach places - what else can I say?</li>
            <li> I love my back scrubber.......&lt;br /&gt;You can get replacement puffs. You have a scrubber and a softer side. It has a great reach also</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I love it.  I love the fact that it has a long handle and it&#x27;s so easy to reach your back.  Also, I like the scrubber a lot because it works!  A lot of scrubbers aren&#x27;t rough enough to actually exfoliate your skin.  This is great before putting on self tanner and especially after the self tanner starts to fade and it becomes blotchy, it scrubbed can get it off.  This is the only scrubber that I use.</li>
            <li> I recently waged all out war on my horrible back acne and have been using a buf-puf for over a year. This is my first one one a handle. The handle is perfect. It&#x27;s a good length and has a bit of a curve to it that helps really get some leverage. I combine the puf with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AI565W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_6 which helps reduce the occurrence of my acne and dramatically reduces the appearance of scarring.    A university study you can find here [...] has shown that the buf-puf combined with benzoyl peroxide is better than either of the treatments individually.    The reason I give it 4-stars is that the Puf turns a bit hard and yellow/brown when used with benzoyl peroxide, I figure since so many people use it for acne that 3M would have developed a product safe to use with common acne fighting cleansers without reacting.</li>
            <li> Came promptly and as described.</li>
            <li> The handle itself lasts indefinitely. I find I need a new sponge about once a month. This is great for scrubbing my own back in the shower, and has a hooked handle so the sponge can be hung up to dry. When you use up the sponge that comes in this pack, get [[ASIN:B001EJOPTS Buf-Puf Double-Sided Body Sponge (Pack of 6)]]. Far more effective at cleaning off dirt than a washcloth.</li>
            <li> This is great for getting the conditioner residue cleaned off my back so I don&#x27;t get any ickiness on my back. It&#x27;s also great for reaching that spot that you can never quite reach with your hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this before but it was more expensive! I was extremely happy with the price and I really love this thing. I&#x27;ve also given it as gifts to people.</li>
            <li> Today I am replacing my old model of this that lasted a good 4-5 years.  For the money it can&#x27;t be beat!  I used it to scrub my feet and back.  Did an outstanding job.  I replaced the scrubber part a few times and enjoyed the new look it gave my scrubber.  Hang it on the shower head.  Always ready to go!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product because it makes it easy to reach and thoroughly scrub one&#x27;s back, and its mild exfoliating action is better than one can do with a washcloth on other parts of the body.  It does not replace the washcloth, but is a very good supplement.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel soo good. I love Buf-Pufs. They are the perfect exfoliation tool. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> Amazing results after just a few uses. Makes the skin feel alive and fresh, I use it as often as I can and like the results you get.</li>
            <li> I was unfamiliar with the Buf-Puf brand until reading some reviews on Amazon while searching for a new sponge.  I tried the Buf-Puf face sponge and was impressed.  I decided to give this back scrub sponge a try and have been very satisfied.  The handle is two pieces that clip together and so far it appears to be very solid and well constructed.  It is easy to use and I like that the sponge can be removed and reattached if needed.  Thanks to everyone for writing such detailed reviews on Amazon, I never would have discovered the great Buf-Puf products without you!</li>
            <li> I wish I can find this sponge on the store. I have use this product for years and I will be using it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.  I just wish the handle was a little bit longer.  It&#x27;s nice that you can choose a side.  One side is a little bit rougher while the other is softer.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The company has ceased production on the handles for body scrubbers.  I had hoped this was because they were going to release an improved version because it did have a few flaws.  After waiting for two years though, no replacement has been announced and my existing handle had to be replaced.  I am somewhat addicted to the buf-puf and how well it exfoliates.  I love the way my skin feels after using it.  Only one of the other scrubbers or puffs I have tried worked (the two sided sponge sold here on Amazon- Aquasentials Dual Texture Bath Sponge) but the manufacturer ruined it so I quit buying those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since these handles are no longer being made, they have become the victim of price gouging by the few sources who still have some new, unused old stock.  I hate to admit that my aforementioned addiction compelled me to buy one here. I was desperate... and I did.  It is not the behavior of a true Penny Pincher, I know, and I feel a little less clean for having done so.  However, I do have silky soft skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the handle does not stay on. This product is in two parts and you snap a handle into the base of the puff.  Everytime I tried to use it to scrub my back it came apart at the smallest pressure.  I tried to use the puff without the handle but it was too awkward to hold.  A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love the things but I didn&#x27;t want the handle --since I have all kinds of handles but cannot buy just the sponges...?</li>
            <li> What can I say, who wouldn&#x27;t like a good back scratch? It feels great to exfoliate my back and have a tingly feeling after my shower. Use this a few times and it will get rid of the sensation that you need to have someone scratch your back during the day.</li>
            <li> Great product, sturdy handle, nice scrubber, will order again.</li>
            <li> Great skin exfoliator and back scrubber-like that new pads are available-looked for this in the stores for months and was so happy to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I purchase a year supply for my wife every xmas and she use&#x27;s these every day and loves them and asks for them every year.</li>
            <li> this  is the best back scrub i have ever used. lightweight and easy to use, not to ruff just perfect!</li>
            <li> Love this product, give it for gift often.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for back scrubber.</li>
            <li> I have used these forever, they are great for &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; and keeping hard to reach spots smooth.  My husband has been stealing mine, so I got him one of his own.</li>
