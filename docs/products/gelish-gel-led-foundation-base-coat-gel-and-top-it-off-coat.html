            <li>I love Gelish brand and have paid a lot of money over the years to get my nails painted with it when it dawned on me: I could do this!</li>
            <li>I cured the Gelish with the u-spicy 36 W UV light for the recommended times and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Gel polish is amazing...</li>
            <li>Now I can do my own nails at home and not have to make the trip to the salon.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to find these at such  wonderful price.</li>
            <li>I decided to start doing my own Gelish manicures at home.</li>
            <li>I ordered these two and was THRILLED when they arrived.</li>
            <li>It seals the polish and adds in a nice and glossy finish to the nail&#x27;s surface.</li>
            <li>but so far so good very good delivery</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly and with great protective packaging.</li>
            <li>Love this foundation and top coat!</li>
            <li>They were also almost always out of stock on the more popular colors.</li>
            <li>Best deal I have found this far.</li>
            <li>Went on easily and worked well!</li>
            <li>Very shiny and beautiful.</li>

            <li>Super fast shipping and a great product!</li>
            <li>I have the Harmony led nail lamp (12 watts) and love this foundation and top coat.  </li>
            <li>Apply top coat and use led for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Love this system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad these are sold together.</li>
            <li>The foundation and top coat could use as a nail strengthener.</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>I use them often and love the results.</li>
            <li>but I figured I would be better safe</li>
            <li>My foundation and top it off</li>
            <li>I have used and love this product many times.</li>
            <li>Gelish is all I use now on my fingernails, and the foundation and top coat are a must.  </li>
            <li>After you do that, you will have shiny, chip free nails!  </li>
            <li>The Top</li>
            <li>Make sure you remove all cotton</li>
            <li>* Apply your favorite color of Gelish Soak Off Gel Polish or your favorite brand of UV</li>

            <li>Gelish is definitely the best!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these products.  </li>
            <li>I love the foundation.</li>
            <li>I do my thumb and then re dip the brush and can do the rest of my fingernails without getting more polish.</li>
            <li>These products are salon grade, I believe most salons that do gel manicures use the gelish polish.  </li>
            <li>Gelish Foundation and Top Coat &amp;#34;Set of 2&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better value than the products in the Gelish starter kit.  </li>
            <li>Very simply state ~ Gelish products are the best !  </li>
            <li>* Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails</li>
            <li>* Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone interested and looking for the best out there!</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply Love</li>
            <li>After you cure the UV Top It Off then wipe your nail lightly with an alcohol swab to remove any uncured polish or Top It Off.  </li>
            <li>But the top coat seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>Seems that all that I have tried in this line are nice, rich colors that go on even and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing deal and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>so I can be more precise.</li>
            <li>I love that the set comes with everything except the UV light which I purchased seperate.</li>
            <li>This is 2 full size bottles!</li>
            <li>so we sat down and did some research and found out that Gelish makes the best products that we could find.</li>
            <li>It works fine.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, and how quickly and inexpensively they are available.  </li>
            <li>I find that normal-sized brushes make it easier to apply evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Gelish works well with UV light.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo3MQYCRT2JSPT1]]My wife got into gel nail polishes and using UV light to cure them and she asked me to help her</li>
            <li>* Place your hand into the USpicy UV LED lamp for 10 to 20 seconds for a light color or 20 to 30 seconds for a darker color.</li>
            <li>* Place your hand into the USpicy UV LED lamp for 10 to 20 seconds for a light color or 20 to 30 seconds for a darker color.</li>
            <li>Overall happy about the product, Though I was told you also need a bonding agent  under these products.</li>
            <li>When these came in I was so happy that they were double the size!</li>
            <li>I have a 36 watt UV light.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li>These are great as they have 2xs the product of CND and are about the same cost wise.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and easy to apply the very first time.</li>
            <li>Love the large size, shipped quick and safely.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted and at a better price than I saw anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>clean nail and apply the foundation.  </li>
            <li>* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>It works just fine and the shipping was super quick.</li>
            <li>This product is as expected, there isn&#x27;t a great deal of science involved,</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say more, I really like the Gelish product line.  </li>
            <li>The whole gelish collection is just fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I really like the thickness of the top coat.</li>
            <li>I have tried others that are similar but this was a good price for the product.</li>
            <li>so I have to make sure that I remove excess from the brush really well before I apply.</li>
            <li>You need this if you want to have a good solid nail job, that lasts!!</li>
            <li>The top coat is what really sets the gel in.  </li>
            <li>These are the full sized bottles</li>
            <li>They are full size bottles and not mini which come in the starter kit.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has a better selection of colors, larger bottles and better</li>
            <li>My products arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>i would definitively recommend buying, larger bottles than my local beauty supply carries for a lower price!works great as well!</li>
            <li>is quick.</li>
            <li>I got these to do my Gelish manacures and it works perfect, plus I saved a lot of money because I didn&#x27;t have to buy the whole kit which has bottles half the size of these!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is really shiny!</li>
            <li>After you put the top coat on and cure it, the process is not yet complete!  </li>
            <li>I love this polish, but I don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s too old to stop using.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this 5 times and so far I&#x27;ve been pleased.</li>
            <li>The applicator brush is smaller and more precise too.</li>
            <li>Overall though, it takes about 45 mins to do your own nails</li>
            <li>fun and never pay someone to do your nails</li>
            <li>It shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>I have an led and uv light and never any curing problem if nails are wiped, even if I do a repair on top of the previous cured nail it is still fine.  </li>
            <li>but it comes with these two very large bottles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only recently begun using soak-off gel polish, but so far Gelish is the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>after you dry the top coat it will still feel sticky as if its not dry, but its just the process of gel nail polish, you must apply the gel cleanser after the top coat has went through the uv light to get the sleek/smooth finish.</li>
            <li>If I used a UV light instead of my walgreens LED light it would probably last even longer.</li>
            <li>The polishes last a week or more when applied with care.  </li>
            <li>For the top coat, same thing.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what is used at the nail salons.  </li>
            <li>Great price, last a long time.</li>
            <li>The ones at the local beauty supply house are 9 mL and cost 50% more when they are on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The ones at the local beauty supply house are 9 mL and cost 50% more when they are on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I love that it has a smaller application brush</li>
            <li>However, in Europe this set would cost more than double!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional and I saw this set on here for such a great price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used OPI before, and it definitely comes off better (though it doesn&#x27;t stay on as well as Gelish, so</li>
            <li>They have a very nice formula to them- not too thick and not watery at all.  </li>
            <li>It is dry immediately with a UV dryer, and it&#x27;s easy to remove!</li>
            <li>Not only are they fresh but the bottles are HUGE.</li>
            <li>After reading multiple reviews and after much consideration, my wife decided this was the set she wanted to go with (Gelish Foundation and Top Coat).</li>
            <li>The only thing that didn&#x27;t thrill me, was that the top on the foundation bottle doesn&#x27;t have that satisfying &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; to let you know that the bottle is closed.</li>
            <li>Even if you have thin or brittle nails, this polish will make them look beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Also do NOT forget to use gel cleanser after the top coat is dry or you won&#x27;t get the finish you want.</li>
            <li>Top It Off is one of the final steps to sealing your new Gelish nail polish job</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands, but always come back to Gelish for an impeccable and durable shellac nail polish.</li>
            <li>: shake the basecoat really well before using.</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface (</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface (</li>
            <li>It arrived fast.</li>
            <li>These polishes shipped extremely fast.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get that very often</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from this seller too.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the &amp;#34;ish&amp;#34; means that it really &amp;#34;isn&#x27;t&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It lasts longer, doesn&#x27;t chip as much when it&#x27;s nearing the end of its life cycle, and doesn&#x27;t stain like I&#x27;ve had experiences with w/Shellac.</li>
            <li>These high quality products do not disappoint!</li>
            <li>Only thing is the smell is strong but the is normal for gel polish</li>
            <li>have tried other top coats and this one does not get gooey and clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks as good as professional manicure and last as long.</li>
            <li>* Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>* Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;good quality, easy to use, dry within expected time with any type of uv light.</li>
            <li>It actually lasts too, unlike most regular polishes!  </li>
            <li>Ive used this with the ph bond 1st, then 2nd foundation gel, 3rd two coats of color, 4th top coat, and then wipe with alcohol.</li>
            <li>It was mailed in a bubble envelope and packaged decently.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend these as a gel manicure staple.</li>
            <li>nice big bottles, works with other brands, and lasts about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were not thick and went on well.</li>
            <li>Lasts a couple of weeks with normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li>Oh and make sure you do THIN coats like instructed, also make sure you wipe off any excess that might have gotten on your skin around your finger nail before you put into uv lamp or it will harden on your skin and than cause your polish to later peel off way to soon.</li>
            <li>Once you go Gelish, you&#x27;ll never use normal nail lacquer again.  </li>
            <li>Gelish foundation and top it off, along with a gelish color of your choice, will leave you with a long lasting glossy manicure.</li>
            <li>I agree you still do need patience, as I am a right hander and have to take my time on painting with  my left hand.</li>
            <li>The base and topcoat go on easily, and the topcoat retains a very nice, fresh-looking shine for the life of the manicure.  </li>
            <li>The price is agreeable and the product is brand new.</li>
            <li>If you are new to DIY gel nails the Gelish system is perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  am new to doing</li>
            <li>once again, if it&#x27;s too good to be true - it is! :(</li>
            <li>and like I had them professionally done!  </li>
            <li>On the box they are EXACTLY the same</li>
            <li>After numerous uses I&#x27;m not sure its an authentic product!</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased a Gelish Basix kit, which I love, but I wanted to have backups because the bottles are only .5 oz.</li>
            <li>By my second try I had all but mastered it, and I&#x27;m already scouting all the exciting Gelish colors and planning future nail art.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are full size polishes and very fresh meaning not old and thick.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a defect with the particular bottle that I received, or a defect in all the foundation tops of this brand, but it&#x27;s not such a problem that I felt a need to dock a star over it.</li>
            <li>I can even paint regular polish on top and wear it for a few days then go back to the gel without the polish remover messing up the gel.</li>
            <li>A friend damaged her nails with Sally Hanson&#x27;s and other brands available at Sally&#x27;s, Ulta, drug stores, are thinner and not as long lasting or desirable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I keep my hand in the light for an excessive amount of time and the nails remain sticky all the way to the next morning.  </li>
            <li>ingredients are nearly the same.</li>
            <li>so the brushes are of normal size unlike the tiny bottles with tiny brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have now used this several times and is to date my favorite Gel base and top.</li>
            <li>Because it creates such a hard coat on your nails, they don&#x27;t break as easy</li>
            <li>now I have tries light coats and thicker coats of the base and top coats (as here) as well as the &amp;#34;gelish&amp;#34; color and still it isn&#x27;t anything like real gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a complete novice and bought this little duo to if I really could, indeed, do this.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to get these at such a low price when salons and even supply stores sell them for $12 a bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought the top and base set of polishes for about $25 and they have worked fantastic for at home application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the base, top and various colors with a UV light and my nails always turn out how they did when I was getting them done in the salon.  </li>

            <li> but so far so good very good delivery</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and with great protective packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation and top coat!</li>

            <li> Best deal I have found this far.</li>
            <li> Went on easily and worked well!</li>
            <li> Very shiny and beautiful.</li>

            <li> I have the Harmony led nail lamp (12 watts) and love this foundation and top coat.  </li>
            <li> Apply top coat and use led for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Love this system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad these are sold together.</li>
            <li> The foundation and top coat could use as a nail strengthener.</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> I use them often and love the results.</li>
            <li> but I figured I would be better safe</li>
            <li> My foundation and top it off</li>
            <li> I have used and love this product many times.</li>
            <li> Gelish is all I use now on my fingernails, and the foundation and top coat are a must.  </li>
            <li> After you do that, you will have shiny, chip free nails!  </li>

            <li> Gelish is definitely the best!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these products.  </li>
            <li> I love the foundation.</li>
            <li> I do my thumb and then re dip the brush and can do the rest of my fingernails without getting more polish.</li>
            <li> These products are salon grade, I believe most salons that do gel manicures use the gelish polish.  </li>
            <li> Gelish Foundation and Top Coat &amp;#34;Set of 2&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better value than the products in the Gelish starter kit.  </li>
            <li> Very simply state ~ Gelish products are the best !  </li>
            <li> * Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails</li>
            <li> * Admire your beautiful and stunning new nails</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone interested and looking for the best out there!</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply Love</li>
            <li> After you cure the UV Top It Off then wipe your nail lightly with an alcohol swab to remove any uncured polish or Top It Off.  </li>
            <li> But the top coat seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> Seems that all that I have tried in this line are nice, rich colors that go on even and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> so I can be more precise.</li>
            <li> I love that the set comes with everything except the UV light which I purchased seperate.</li>
            <li> This is 2 full size bottles!</li>
            <li> so we sat down and did some research and found out that Gelish makes the best products that we could find.</li>
            <li> It works fine.  </li>
            <li> Love the product, and how quickly and inexpensively they are available.  </li>
            <li> I find that normal-sized brushes make it easier to apply evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Gelish works well with UV light.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3MQYCRT2JSPT1]]My wife got into gel nail polishes and using UV light to cure them and she asked me to help her</li>
            <li> * Place your hand into the USpicy UV LED lamp for 10 to 20 seconds for a light color or 20 to 30 seconds for a darker color.</li>

            <li> Overall happy about the product, Though I was told you also need a bonding agent  under these products.</li>
            <li> When these came in I was so happy that they were double the size!</li>
            <li> I have a 36 watt UV light.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> These are great as they have 2xs the product of CND and are about the same cost wise.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and easy to apply the very first time.</li>
            <li> Love the large size, shipped quick and safely.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and at a better price than I saw anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> clean nail and apply the foundation.  </li>
            <li> * Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> * Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> It works just fine and the shipping was super quick.</li>
            <li> This product is as expected, there isn&#x27;t a great deal of science involved,</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say more, I really like the Gelish product line.  </li>
            <li> The whole gelish collection is just fantastic!</li>
            <li> but I really like the thickness of the top coat.</li>
            <li> I have tried others that are similar but this was a good price for the product.</li>
            <li> so I have to make sure that I remove excess from the brush really well before I apply.</li>
            <li> You need this if you want to have a good solid nail job, that lasts!!</li>
            <li> The top coat is what really sets the gel in.  </li>
            <li> These are the full sized bottles</li>
            <li> They are full size bottles and not mini which come in the starter kit.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has a better selection of colors, larger bottles and better</li>
            <li> My products arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> i would definitively recommend buying, larger bottles than my local beauty supply carries for a lower price!works great as well!</li>
            <li> is quick.</li>
            <li> I got these to do my Gelish manacures and it works perfect, plus I saved a lot of money because I didn&#x27;t have to buy the whole kit which has bottles half the size of these!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is really shiny!</li>
            <li> After you put the top coat on and cure it, the process is not yet complete!  </li>
            <li> I love this polish, but I don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s too old to stop using.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 5 times and so far I&#x27;ve been pleased.</li>
            <li> The applicator brush is smaller and more precise too.</li>
            <li> Overall though, it takes about 45 mins to do your own nails</li>
            <li> fun and never pay someone to do your nails</li>
            <li> It shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> I have an led and uv light and never any curing problem if nails are wiped, even if I do a repair on top of the previous cured nail it is still fine.  </li>
            <li> but it comes with these two very large bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently begun using soak-off gel polish, but so far Gelish is the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> after you dry the top coat it will still feel sticky as if its not dry, but its just the process of gel nail polish, you must apply the gel cleanser after the top coat has went through the uv light to get the sleek/smooth finish.</li>
            <li> If I used a UV light instead of my walgreens LED light it would probably last even longer.</li>
            <li> The polishes last a week or more when applied with care.  </li>
            <li> For the top coat, same thing.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what is used at the nail salons.  </li>
            <li> Great price, last a long time.</li>
            <li> The ones at the local beauty supply house are 9 mL and cost 50% more when they are on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The ones at the local beauty supply house are 9 mL and cost 50% more when they are on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I love that it has a smaller application brush</li>
            <li> However, in Europe this set would cost more than double!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional and I saw this set on here for such a great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used OPI before, and it definitely comes off better (though it doesn&#x27;t stay on as well as Gelish, so</li>
            <li> They have a very nice formula to them- not too thick and not watery at all.  </li>
            <li> It is dry immediately with a UV dryer, and it&#x27;s easy to remove!</li>
            <li> Not only are they fresh but the bottles are HUGE.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews and after much consideration, my wife decided this was the set she wanted to go with (Gelish Foundation and Top Coat).</li>
            <li> The only thing that didn&#x27;t thrill me, was that the top on the foundation bottle doesn&#x27;t have that satisfying &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; to let you know that the bottle is closed.</li>
            <li> Even if you have thin or brittle nails, this polish will make them look beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Also do NOT forget to use gel cleanser after the top coat is dry or you won&#x27;t get the finish you want.</li>
            <li> Top It Off is one of the final steps to sealing your new Gelish nail polish job</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but always come back to Gelish for an impeccable and durable shellac nail polish.</li>
            <li> : shake the basecoat really well before using.</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface (</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently wipe off the tacky surface (</li>
            <li> It arrived fast.</li>
            <li> These polishes shipped extremely fast.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get that very often</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from this seller too.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the &amp;#34;ish&amp;#34; means that it really &amp;#34;isn&#x27;t&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It lasts longer, doesn&#x27;t chip as much when it&#x27;s nearing the end of its life cycle, and doesn&#x27;t stain like I&#x27;ve had experiences with w/Shellac.</li>
            <li> These high quality products do not disappoint!</li>
            <li> Only thing is the smell is strong but the is normal for gel polish</li>
            <li> have tried other top coats and this one does not get gooey and clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks as good as professional manicure and last as long.</li>
            <li> * Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;good quality, easy to use, dry within expected time with any type of uv light.</li>
            <li> It actually lasts too, unlike most regular polishes!  </li>
            <li> Ive used this with the ph bond 1st, then 2nd foundation gel, 3rd two coats of color, 4th top coat, and then wipe with alcohol.</li>
            <li> It was mailed in a bubble envelope and packaged decently.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend these as a gel manicure staple.</li>
            <li> nice big bottles, works with other brands, and lasts about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were not thick and went on well.</li>
            <li> Lasts a couple of weeks with normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li> Oh and make sure you do THIN coats like instructed, also make sure you wipe off any excess that might have gotten on your skin around your finger nail before you put into uv lamp or it will harden on your skin and than cause your polish to later peel off way to soon.</li>
            <li> Once you go Gelish, you&#x27;ll never use normal nail lacquer again.  </li>
            <li> Gelish foundation and top it off, along with a gelish color of your choice, will leave you with a long lasting glossy manicure.</li>
            <li> I agree you still do need patience, as I am a right hander and have to take my time on painting with  my left hand.</li>
            <li> The base and topcoat go on easily, and the topcoat retains a very nice, fresh-looking shine for the life of the manicure.  </li>
            <li> The price is agreeable and the product is brand new.</li>
            <li> If you are new to DIY gel nails the Gelish system is perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  am new to doing</li>
            <li> once again, if it&#x27;s too good to be true - it is! :(</li>
            <li> and like I had them professionally done!  </li>
            <li> On the box they are EXACTLY the same</li>
            <li> After numerous uses I&#x27;m not sure its an authentic product!</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a Gelish Basix kit, which I love, but I wanted to have backups because the bottles are only .5 oz.</li>
            <li> By my second try I had all but mastered it, and I&#x27;m already scouting all the exciting Gelish colors and planning future nail art.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are full size polishes and very fresh meaning not old and thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a defect with the particular bottle that I received, or a defect in all the foundation tops of this brand, but it&#x27;s not such a problem that I felt a need to dock a star over it.</li>
            <li> I can even paint regular polish on top and wear it for a few days then go back to the gel without the polish remover messing up the gel.</li>
            <li> A friend damaged her nails with Sally Hanson&#x27;s and other brands available at Sally&#x27;s, Ulta, drug stores, are thinner and not as long lasting or desirable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep my hand in the light for an excessive amount of time and the nails remain sticky all the way to the next morning.  </li>
            <li> ingredients are nearly the same.</li>
            <li> so the brushes are of normal size unlike the tiny bottles with tiny brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have now used this several times and is to date my favorite Gel base and top.</li>
            <li> Because it creates such a hard coat on your nails, they don&#x27;t break as easy</li>
            <li> now I have tries light coats and thicker coats of the base and top coats (as here) as well as the &amp;#34;gelish&amp;#34; color and still it isn&#x27;t anything like real gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a complete novice and bought this little duo to if I really could, indeed, do this.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to get these at such a low price when salons and even supply stores sell them for $12 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought the top and base set of polishes for about $25 and they have worked fantastic for at home application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the base, top and various colors with a UV light and my nails always turn out how they did when I was getting them done in the salon.  </li>
            <li> Her complaint is that both the foundation and the top coat is too thick - almost as if it is old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although my personal nail chemistry makes it hard for me to keep on even salon applied solar gel nails on for more than a few days, this product does last me about 5 days with minimal micro chips.  </li>
            <li> Gelish&#x27;s base &amp; topcoat are much easier to apply, lay down nicely (no bubbles), &amp; cure super fast with LED light.  </li>
            <li> I find that I only need to change my polish because it lasts so long my nails grow out and even then I can just repaint the area around the cuticle.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, but a little thick</li>
            <li> I have no professional training.</li>
            <li> Not much to compare it to in it&#x27;s category, as it is the only gel topcoat and foundation</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve kept long nails for months now.</li>
            <li> She looked at the local beauty supply houses and found that the prices they charged for Gelish was high and that the bottles were very small.</li>
            <li> Such a bummer because I HATE only being able to buy the tiny bottles at Sallys Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> * Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> directions say it takes 2 minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed was the brush on one of them seem to be shortened, like cut in half.</li>
            <li> Dry your nails with alcohol first then use only a thin layer of base coat and seal the tip of the nail well with the top coat.</li>
            <li> I received them a little later than i wanted</li>
            <li> when I had my gel nails done professionally my nails were hard and didn&#x27;t split at the ends anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a tough time with other brand names not truly \\&quot;soaking off\\&quot; but rather requiring much scrapping, digging, and buffing to remove said product.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried other brands (Opi, shellac, and TruGel)</li>
            <li> I would recommend to other gel nail users.</li>
            <li> u only can find the small ones</li>
            <li> i recommend it to other and would buy again</li>
            <li> If you properly apply, your manicure can last three weeks or until you are tired of the color!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After asking around it doesn&#x27;t sound like the base coat is always necessary</li>
            <li> Im hard on my hands last about 10-14 days for me.</li>
            <li> It is the base coat that you put onto your nail and cure before you apply your favorite color of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Have tried other gel polishes but now that I&#x27;ve found Gelish, I won&#x27;t use anything else!  </li>
            <li> but on the Amazon product info they vary slightly.</li>
            <li> but this I hope will last at least for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not true at all whatsoever.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a looong way with these polishes.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they&#x27;re incredibly hard to soak off.  </li>
            <li> After a few days it can chip.  </li>
            <li> gel products in the past with much aggrivation and disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I have seen others, less expensive and may try those next purchase.</li>
            <li> This makes it less thick.</li>
            <li> Anyways I have preformed numerous wear tests using this base coat and the ALWAYS peel or chip after a few days, I went and bought a tiny bottle from Sallys and performed wear tests</li>
            <li> I get at least 10 days out of every manicure with no</li>
            <li> The other parts of the set are very unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I was sick of having chipped/peeled mani only after 2 days as I use my hands a lot being a mom and gardener</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply either of them to thick!</li>
            <li> Thin coat and don&#x27;t get it on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference using the base coat</li>
            <li> When applying it put it on in a medium to a thin coat and don&#x27;t forget to do the front edge of your nail as that is where pealing can start.</li>
            <li> If you are a sloppy nail painter I do not recommend any gel system, as it is unforgiving one</li>
            <li> Before applying I buffed/scuffed my nails a little and used the harmony dehydrator under the base coat.</li>
            <li> then sorry.</li>
            <li> Put on a very thin coat and do not get on your skin or your color will lift.</li>
            <li> base coat is thick so don&#x27;t overdue it, I know its tempting</li>
            <li> * Apply Gelish Foundation Gel or gel base coat in a thin coat to the nail and the nail tip edge and cure for 10 to 15 seconds under LED lamp.&lt;br /</li>

            <li> and you won&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because this set is a &#x27;mini&#x27; set...</li>
            <li> but I was a bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It creates a tacky base that helps to bond the polish to your nails and it increases the life of your nail polish job to the 2 week period that you would expect.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t say more, I really like the Gelish product line.  Seems that all that I have tried in this line are nice, rich colors that go on even and smooth.  Lasts a couple of weeks with normal wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I have the Harmony led nail lamp (12 watts) and love this foundation and top coat.  If you properly apply, your manicure can last three weeks or until you are tired of the color!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other top coats and this one does not get gooey and clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my steps with the Harmony Led Lamp:  clean nail and apply the foundation.  Use LED for five seconds.  Apply your color.  30 seconds into the lamp.  Apply a second coat.  30 seconds.  Apply top coat and use led for 30 seconds.  Use the cleaner from Gelish or 90% alcohol to remove the haze from the nail.  And there you have it!!!  Love this system.</li>
            <li> I love this polish, but I don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s too old to stop using.  It works forever!  I get 2-3 weeks without taking it off.</li>
            <li> They are the perfect set for the shellac at home. I received them a little later than i wanted so i had to buy the ones at sally&#x27;s but they came individually wrapped and are the correct size. i tried them once to make sure they were good, and they worked wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great quality product, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> great I love these products!</li>
            <li> Great product, great value! I bought the top and base set of polishes for about $25 and they have worked fantastic for at home application. They are easy to use and easy to apply the very first time. Before applying I buffed/scuffed my nails a little and used the harmony dehydrator under the base coat. My manicure came out great and lasts! I cured the Gelish with the u-spicy 36 W UV light for the recommended times and it worked great. Good buy!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and at a better price than I saw anywhere else.  Now I can do my own nails at home and not have to make the trip to the salon.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply Love it work great..The service was great it look like a had my nails done at that nail place.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find these at such  wonderful price. The whole gelish collection is just fantastic! Lasts the project 2 weeks plus some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Sensationail (TM) gel products in the past with much aggrivation and disappointment.  Gelish&#x27;s base &amp; topcoat are much easier to apply, lay down nicely (no bubbles), &amp; cure super fast with LED light.  These bottles are .5 fl. oz. so the brushes are of normal size unlike the tiny bottles with tiny brushes.  I find that normal-sized brushes make it easier to apply evenly and smoothly.  I&#x27;ve had a tough time with other brand names not truly \\&quot;soaking off\\&quot; but rather requiring much scrapping, digging, and buffing to remove said product.  I haven&#x27;t taken off my color yet so I will have to repost my findings on how this product performs.  So far I give this product 5 stars for ease of application, 2 weeks of no chipping, and still retaining the shiny wet look.</li>
            <li> great combo! I&#x27;m glad these are sold together. The other parts of the set are very unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Best buy, best product by far in the industry.</li>
            <li> I decided to start doing my own Gelish manicures at home. I have no professional training. I went with this brand to start with because of the Gelish repuatation. Very happy with the product and results.</li>
            <li> This is the best brand, period. I&#x27;ve tried all shellac or gel brands of polish and this stands out because it lasts the longest!</li>
            <li> Gelish works well with UV light. The polishes last a week or more when applied with care.  Dry your nails with alcohol first then use only a thin layer of base coat and seal the tip of the nail well with the top coat.</li>
            <li> Bottles much bigger than I thought thy would be. Great product! Love this foundation and top coat! Would order again!</li>
            <li> The foundation and top coat could use as a nail strengthener. The shine of the nails are awesome I just love harmony Gelish the best brand.</li>
            <li> I love this set. The price is agreeable and the product is brand new. I use them often and love the results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. I&#x27;ve been doing gel manicures at home for over two years and I have tried other brands (Opi, shellac, and TruGel) and nothing beats gelish. I get at least 10 days out of every manicure with no chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: shake the basecoat really well before using. This makes it less thick. Put on a very thin coat and do not get on your skin or your color will lift. For the top coat, same thing. Thin coat and don&#x27;t get it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bottles last, too! They&#x27;re 15 ml and I have been using for over a year. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> After asking around it doesn&#x27;t sound like the base coat is always necessary but I figured I would be better safe then sorry. I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference using the base coat but I really like the thickness of the top coat. I have tried others that are similar but this was a good price for the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 5 times and so far I&#x27;ve been pleased. Not much to compare it to in it&#x27;s category, as it is the only gel topcoat and foundation I&#x27;ve used.  I have seen others, less expensive and may try those next purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased a gelish system from Sally&#x27;s two years ago and have been very happy with it. My foundation and top it off we&#x27;re getting &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; and I didn&#x27;t want to spend $30+ at Sally&#x27;s. I ordered these two and was THRILLED when they arrived. Not only are they fresh but the bottles are HUGE. The applicator brush is smaller and more precise too.</li>
            <li> I received the product in great condition. I would recommend to other gel nail users. I have used and love this product many times.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what is used at the nail salons.  My polish stays on for almost 10 days with NO chipping.  If I used a UV light instead of my walgreens LED light it would probably last even longer.</li>
            <li> Gelish is all I use now on my fingernails, and the foundation and top coat are a must.  Gelish polish makes my nails look shiny and like I had them professionally done!  It actually lasts too, unlike most regular polishes!  Even if you have thin or brittle nails, this polish will make them look beautiful.  It is dry immediately with a UV dryer, and it&#x27;s easy to remove!</li>
            <li> Gel polish is amazing...I find that I only need to change my polish because it lasts so long my nails grow out and even then I can just repaint the area around the cuticle. Because it creates such a hard coat on your nails, they don&#x27;t break as easy so I&#x27;ve kept long nails for months now. I&#x27;ve also had no problem taking the polish off like some people describe. After a while you can peel it off without remover even.</li>
            <li> Love the large size, shipped quick and safely.</li>
            <li> Life saver on my nails!!!</li>
            <li> Great price, last a long time. I was surprised to get these at such a low price when salons and even supply stores sell them for $12 a bottle.</li>
            <li> Amy-&lt;br /&gt;  After you put the top coat on and cure it, the process is not yet complete!  You have to rub the nails with alcohol (purell works too) to get the sticky film off.  After you do that, you will have shiny, chip free nails!  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3MQYCRT2JSPT1]]My wife got into gel nail polishes and using UV light to cure them and she asked me to help her so we sat down and did some research and found out that Gelish makes the best products that we could find. She looked at the local beauty supply houses and found that the prices they charged for Gelish was high and that the bottles were very small. They were also almost always out of stock on the more popular colors. Amazon has a better selection of colors, larger bottles and better prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set contains two very important steps in the nail polishing process. The foundation is a good example. It is the base coat that you put onto your nail and cure before you apply your favorite color of nail polish. It creates a tacky base that helps to bond the polish to your nails and it increases the life of your nail polish job to the 2 week period that you would expect. When applying it put it on in a medium to a thin coat and don&#x27;t forget to do the front edge of your nail as that is where pealing can start. You always have to cure the foundation coat in your UV lamp. Curing this foundation coat takes about 10 seconds in a UV LED lamp or 30 seconds in a UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Top It Off is one of the final steps to sealing your new Gelish nail polish job and it adds a lot to the final look and performance. It seals the polish and adds in a nice and glossy finish to the nail&#x27;s surface. This is what helps to make the polish stay on for two weeks. Don&#x27;t forget to paint the front edge of the nail to seal it also. This helps prevent chipping and pealing. After you cure the UV Top It Off then wipe your nail lightly with an alcohol swab to remove any uncured polish or Top It Off.  The Top It Off cures in about 30 seconds in a UV LED lamp or in about 2 minutes in a UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been doing her nails with Gelish for over 2 years and she loves it. She has also done the nails for family and friends and helped them get started. She always recommends that they buy their supplies on Amazon because of the selection, the lower price and the size of the bottles. This bottle is 15 mL. The ones at the local beauty supply house are 9 mL and cost 50% more when they are on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have written multiple reviews on UV nail curing machines and here are the steps and curing times for a UV LED machine for your information. Please note that curing times can vary a lot depending on the type of UV lamp you are using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple instructions to use nail polish gels in a LED curing lamp:&lt;br /&gt;* Thoroughly wash and dry your hands.&lt;br /&gt;* Push back the cuticle and clean the fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;* Shape the nail using a nail file.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently remove the natural nail shine with a nail buffer.&lt;br /&gt;* Clean nails with Nail Surface Cleanse or alcohol using a cotton ball.

            <li> The best u can use to do ur gel manicure its the big bottle in stores u only can find the small ones</li>
            <li> If you are new to DIY gel nails the Gelish system is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are nearly the same. On the box they are EXACTLY the same but on the Amazon product info they vary slightly. So if you run out of one, and are in a pinch, you can just use one of the products. I did so successfully on 2 occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my personal nail chemistry makes it hard for me to keep on even salon applied solar gel nails on for more than a few days, this product does last me about 5 days with minimal micro chips.  Once I do dishes thought they are ruined since I don&#x27;t use any dish gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that I only recommend the Gelish system for people who can paint their nails, with traditional polish, if they can paint neatly.  If you are a sloppy nail painter I do not recommend any gel system, as it is unforgiving one you &#x60;cook&#x27; the polish under the UV lamp.</li>
            <li> I find both to be excellent.  A reviewer said it was sticky all day, its probably because she didn&#x27;t wipe the nail with alcohol after curing the topcoat.  I have an led and uv light and never any curing problem if nails are wiped, even if I do a repair on top of the previous cured nail it is still fine.  I love these products.</li>
            <li> I got these to do my Gelish manacures and it works perfect, plus I saved a lot of money because I didn&#x27;t have to buy the whole kit which has bottles half the size of these!</li>
            <li> The BEST option out there</li>
            <li> Have tried other gel polishes but now that I&#x27;ve found Gelish, I won&#x27;t use anything else!  Stays on with no chipping for 3 weeks or longer... and since I&#x27;m a nail tech &amp; wear it myself, trust me when I tell you that&#x27;s it&#x27;s been put to the test!  Gelish is definitely the best!</li>
            <li> Came speedily.  Great authentic product. I do ky nails regularly. Haven&#x27;t had any problems! Grest deal.</li>
            <li> im still working on this two but so far so good very good delivery i recommend it to other and would buy again</li>
            <li> Product is as pictured. It arrived fast. Also do NOT forget to use gel cleanser after the top coat is dry or you won&#x27;t get the finish you want. after you dry the top coat it will still feel sticky as if its not dry, but its just the process of gel nail polish, you must apply the gel cleanser after the top coat has went through the uv light to get the sleek/smooth finish. great product i love gelish polishes... Oh and make sure you do THIN coats like instructed, also make sure you wipe off any excess that might have gotten on your skin around your finger nail before you put into uv lamp or it will harden on your skin and than cause your polish to later peel off way to soon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these products.  They have a very nice formula to them- not too thick and not watery at all.  And a little goes a looong way with these polishes.  I have been using them with IBD and Gelish polish and both work well with them.  My nails have lasted almost 14 days! I will definitely repurchase these when I run out.</li>
            <li> Went on easily and worked well!</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Ive used this with the ph bond 1st, then 2nd foundation gel, 3rd two coats of color, 4th top coat, and then wipe with alcohol. Great! Turns out everytime. Im hard on my hands last about 10-14 days for me. I also bought uv lamp and cure for 2 min on each layer.</li>
            <li> This is the same product that they use at my nail salon.  Now I can do these at home myself and save a bundle.  Love the product, and how quickly and inexpensively they are available.  Definitely will reorder from here again.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and shine. I have now used this several times and is to date my favorite Gel base and top. Stays shiny for weeks!</li>
            <li> LUV it shine lasts for ever no chipping</li>
            <li> These polishes shipped extremely fast. It was mailed in a bubble envelope and packaged decently. Both were in great condition when I opened it. I love the foundation. It works really good and I love that it has a smaller application brush so I can be more precise. It goes on smooth, but a little thick so I have to make sure that I remove excess from the brush really well before I apply. I do my thumb and then re dip the brush and can do the rest of my fingernails without getting more polish. The top coat is great also. It goes on smooth and is really shiny! These were a great price, and I will be using Gelish gel polish from Amazon from now on. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Looks as good as professional manicure and last as long. So happy I purchased this! Can&#x27;t wait to do daughter&#x27;s nails for her!</li>
            <li> This is 2 full size bottles! Best deal I have found this far. It shipped super fast! It said it would arrive on the 10th and it showed up on the 4th. You don&#x27;t get that very often</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who does their nails themselves.  Great buy for the pair of bottles.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Perfect duo and the prices can&#x27;t be beat!!! I will be repurchasing!! The only thing that didn&#x27;t thrill me, was that the top on the foundation bottle doesn&#x27;t have that satisfying &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; to let you know that the bottle is closed. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a defect with the particular bottle that I received, or a defect in all the foundation tops of this brand, but it&#x27;s not such a problem that I felt a need to dock a star over it. I will be repurchasing once I run out of this.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and a great product!</li>
            <li> You need this if you want to have a good solid nail job, that lasts!! I like the gelish brand.. good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is as expected, there isn&#x27;t a great deal of science involved, either the polish looks and performs as it should or not.  This one does!  A good product and a good seller.</li>
            <li> It is what it says it is. You get a package thats been open and there where at one time 3 items sold as a set but it comes with these two very large bottles. A good buy.</li>
            <li> FINALLY found what you only need to do a gel at home. You actually don&#x27;t need the entire kit they try to sell you. If you&#x27;ve had enough gels at the salon done, you know what you&#x27;re doing, and these 2 are the only friends you need (besides a color) to get your savvy girl budget on. Great price.</li>
            <li> I  am new to doing \\&quot;my\\&quot; gel manicures. With purchasing the materials, it can be come costly. When I saw this item I jumped at the offer. My products arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Once you go Gelish, you&#x27;ll never use normal nail lacquer again.  The top coat is what really sets the gel in.  I&#x27;ve been using the base, top and various colors with a UV light and my nails always turn out how they did when I was getting them done in the salon.  Fast shipping from this seller too.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a set for Christmas. They were the big bottles, not the mini. The only thing I noticed was the brush on one of them seem to be shortened, like cut in half. Timely shipping. Overall happy about the product, Though I was told you also need a bonding agent  under these products.</li>
            <li> Gelish is the best in the gel nail polishes. These are the full sized bottles</li>
            <li> these worked great with the color I bought and the UV lighting. Overall though, it takes about 45 mins to do your own nails</li>
            <li> Longer lasting than Shellac. Definitely superior to all of the non-salon brands. A friend damaged her nails with Sally Hanson&#x27;s and other brands available at Sally&#x27;s, Ulta, drug stores, are thinner and not as long lasting or desirable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newest OPI gels, I believe are comparable to Gelish. I&#x27;ve only had them done once in a salon. Results were good,</li>
            <li> nice big bottles, works with other brands, and lasts about 2 weeks. Very shiny and beautiful. I can even paint regular polish on top and wear it for a few days then go back to the gel without the polish remover messing up the gel. It even helps me grow my nails longer since it supports them.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews and after much consideration, my wife decided this was the set she wanted to go with (Gelish Foundation and Top Coat). Her complaint is that both the foundation and the top coat is too thick - almost as if it is old. She will take her time doing her nails (w/ 36w UV lamp) but this product begins to peel off like a sticker after 36 - 48 hours. NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> These products are salon grade, I believe most salons that do gel manicures use the gelish polish.  These are a must if you want your color to last for multiple weeks.  Don&#x27;t apply either of them to thick!</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a Gelish Basix kit, which I love, but I wanted to have backups because the bottles are only .5 oz. When these came in I was so happy that they were double the size! And I paid the same price as what a tiny bottle would be at beauty supply stores. I will never get these from anywhere but amazon.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical because this set is a &#x27;mini&#x27; set...Folks don&#x27;t be fooled by the small size, there are many manicures that you can get from this small set. I love that the set comes with everything except the UV light which I purchased seperate. Go mini and you won&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> when I had my gel nails done professionally my nails were hard and didn&#x27;t split at the ends anymore. now I have tries light coats and thicker coats of the base and top coats (as here) as well as the &amp;#34;gelish&amp;#34; color and still it isn&#x27;t anything like real gel. I wonder if the &amp;#34;ish&amp;#34; means that it really &amp;#34;isn&#x27;t&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a must product for the Gelish nails and is a great product! I would highly recommend this to anyone interested and looking for the best out there!</li>
            <li> I just did my first Gelish today and am totally happy with the result! I was sick of having chipped/peeled mani only after 2 days as I use my hands a lot being a mom and gardener but this I hope will last at least for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have a 36 watt UV light.  directions say it takes 2 minutes to dry.  Not true at all whatsoever. I keep my hand in the light for an excessive amount of time and the nails remain sticky all the way to the next morning.  Lint sticks to them.  it&#x27;s gross.  wish it worked like it said it would.  once again, if it&#x27;s too good to be true - it is! :(</li>
            <li> i would definitively recommend buying, larger bottles than my local beauty supply carries for a lower price!works great as well!</li>
            <li> I do find the Gelish top &amp; bottom coats to be the best I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried Red Carpet, OPI &amp; Sensationail.</li>
            <li> This is really a very good value for money. That the products are great - I knew upfront. However, in Europe this set would cost more than double!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional and I saw this set on here for such a great price so I figured I would buy it! After numerous uses I&#x27;m not sure its an authentic product! Such a bummer because I HATE only being able to buy the tiny bottles at Sallys Beauty Supply. Anyways I have preformed numerous wear tests using this base coat and the ALWAYS peel or chip after a few days, I went and bought a tiny bottle from Sallys and performed wear tests and they last 3+ weeks so I know its not my application, its the product. But the top coat seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> These are full size polishes and very fresh meaning not old and thick. I was very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> I was exited to try this product but I was a bit disappointed.  After a few days it can chip.  I was hoping to last me 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently begun using soak-off gel polish, but so far Gelish is the best I&#x27;ve used.  The base and topcoat go on easily, and the topcoat retains a very nice, fresh-looking shine for the life of the manicure.  My only complaint is that they&#x27;re incredibly hard to soak off.  I&#x27;ve used OPI before, and it definitely comes off better (though it doesn&#x27;t stay on as well as Gelish, so I guess it&#x27;s a trade-off).  Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> I have the Gelish line of about 5 colors and am quite happy with their products. I use and LED lamp and the curing time is quick. I agree you still do need patience, as I am a right hander and have to take my time on painting with  my left hand. Once I learned I had to use rubbing achohol wipe after the top coat cures, it all turned out very nice. These are great as they have 2xs the product of CND and are about the same cost wise.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> Gelish Foundation and Top Coat &amp;#34;Set of 2&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;good quality, easy to use, dry within expected time with any type of uv light.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and with great protective packaging. This is an amazing deal and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> What is there to say that hasn&#x27;t already been said? Gelish foundation and top it off, along with a gelish color of your choice, will leave you with a long lasting glossy manicure. I am impressed with the quality of Harmomy products and the fantastic color selection too.</li>
            <li> These products worked well.  They set up in a timely fashion with a 36 wt dryer.  They were not thick and went on well. They are full size bottles and not mini which come in the starter kit.  Better value than the products in the Gelish starter kit.  You don&#x27;t need the prep and the remover in the  kits.  The prep is just rubbing alcohol and the remover is just acetone.  I used the rubbing alcohol to wipe the nails after the nails are done also.  It works fine.  My nails just pealed off with an orange stick.  I did not need to soak them off with the  acetone.</li>
            <li> It works just fine and the shipping was super quick. Thank you so much. Only thing is the smell is strong but the is normal for gel polish</li>
            <li> Very simply state ~ Gelish products are the best !  I have tried other brands, but always come back to Gelish for an impeccable and durable shellac nail polish.</li>
            <li> Gelish is my preferred choice for soak-off gel polish.  It lasts longer, doesn&#x27;t chip as much when it&#x27;s nearing the end of its life cycle, and doesn&#x27;t stain like I&#x27;ve had experiences with w/Shellac.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the 2 for a great price.  I like the big bottles. Must buy this when it on sale again</li>
            <li> I love Gelish brand and have paid a lot of money over the years to get my nails painted with it when it dawned on me: I could do this! I&#x27;m a complete novice and bought this little duo to if I really could, indeed, do this. These high quality products do not disappoint! By my second try I had all but mastered it, and I&#x27;m already scouting all the exciting Gelish colors and planning future nail art.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Swipe each nail with isopropyl rubbing alcohol before applying the base coat.&lt;br /&gt;The base coat is thick so don&#x27;t overdue it, I know its tempting but the manicure won&#x27;t last if it can&#x27;t thoroughly cure.&lt;br /&gt;Have fun and never pay someone to do your nails again!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these as a gel manicure staple.</li>
