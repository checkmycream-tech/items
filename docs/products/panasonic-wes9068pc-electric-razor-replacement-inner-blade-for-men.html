            <li>Much better shave.</li>
            <li>many words are required in the summary info....</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad with my purchase.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get any better when it comes to electric razors and replacement blades</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to replace blades (only) every 6 to 9 months or so for a PERFECT shave.  </li>
            <li>Love my Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>

            <li>Am going to have to remember to change more often.</li>
            <li>I know that I have one box ready to use as a replacement, great product.</li>
            <li>Make sure you add this replacement when purchasing a electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Yes, they gave a better shave but not that much better.</li>
            <li>This is great, and so much cheaper than you will get at any store.</li>
            <li>EL PRODUCTO LLEGO OK, TAL Y COMO LO OFRECIERON ESTOY TOTALMENTE SATISFECHO CON EL MISMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>got what was ordered!&lt;br /&gt;clean shaved again :-)</li>
            <li>I Haven&#x27;t tried the repoacment blades yet, but the Panasonic ES8103S Shaver is the best I have ever owned, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Fresh blades make the shaver perform at optimum.</li>
            <li>Love, love the Panasonic razor that we purchased.</li>
            <li>The WES9068PC is OK.</li>
            <li>ES8103S.EASY TO REPLACE, MORE CHEAPER THAN THOSE PHILIPS REPLACEMENG</li>
            <li>Auto delivery ok</li>
            <li>so my shaver gets the most use before I replace it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>I replace blades every 4 months but it might be better every 3 months.</li>
            <li>There should have been a better discription or explanation of what replacement parts would be required for my razor.</li>
            <li>Blades didn&#x27;t seem to work much better than the ones that were already in the razor.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I like my shaver much more now.</li>
            <li>OEM inner blades work perfect in my ES8103 Shaver.</li>
            <li>, however, he is satisfied with the product for the value.</li>
            <li>We will see when I get more time on this shaver.</li>
            <li>A worthwhile practice to follow</li>
            <li>These are just like the original and fit my razor perfectly and were priced reasonably.  </li>
            <li>The shave is smooth and as good as the original blades.</li>

            <li>Feels great since replacing my old blades.</li>
            <li>A great replacement for my old ES8109.</li>
            <li>Panasonic razors are incredible and you must occasionally replace the blades.  </li>
            <li>You can tell they give you a better shave just by the sound of shaving.</li>
            <li>I think the best part of this you can use it wet with foam.</li>

            <li>Fit the razor my husband had and was cheaper than purchasing in a store.  </li>
            <li>They do a great job and usually last me a year or two.</li>
            <li>The 2 stars is for the fact that I can get a faster, closer shave with the multi-blade manual razors available today as compared to these blades in my electric razor.</li>
            <li>Shave is close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Had to go to the Panasonic website to confirm these would fit.</li>
            <li>These fit well and cut well.</li>
            <li>Now we&#x27;re both silky smooth again.</li>
            <li>If only I could find the electric foil head replacement I would be happy.</li>
            <li>Fellas, don&#x27;t be cheap.</li>
            <li>They fit and my razor works like it used to.  </li>
            <li>A great investment to bring life back into your razor.</li>
            <li>Fit my ES8103 shaver as they should.</li>
            <li>I have a light beard and this shaver</li>
            <li>These blades fit my 8103 Panasonic in case anyone is wondering.</li>
            <li>one pass smooth.  </li>
            <li>get a couple months of shaves on a relatively light beard....</li>
            <li>NOW I remember why I liked my Panasonic shaver so much.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shave.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great price and absolutely will buy here again.  </li>
            <li>It got top marks in Consumer Reports, which is how I came to know about it, and the testers were absolutely right.</li>
            <li>(BALD IS BEAUTIFUL) AND TOOK FOREVER WITH LITTLE MORE THAT A STUBBLE..</li>
            <li>Easy, quick, no problems at all.</li>
            <li>They were super easy to install.</li>
            <li>Easy to install and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Nothing close the original one.</li>
            <li>They did NOT snap on like my original blades.</li>
            <li>The blades don&#x27;t seem to cut as well as the original blades</li>
            <li>After the first year I noticed what many here have reported.  </li>
            <li>Either they are just like the ones that came on the shaver originally, or they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Seem to work just like my original blades with no issues.  </li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t searched by part number, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to find the exact parts I needed.</li>
            <li>Ny dad was so excited to find out he could get replacement blades for his shaver.  </li>
            <li>The original blades lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li>The original Panasonic ES-LF51-A</li>
            <li>do not shave as well as the original blade</li>
            <li>it was an original Panasonic part.</li>
            <li>My razor now works like it used to when I first bought it. :)</li>
            <li>Original blade replacement for my wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>I used the original blade in my razor for about two years</li>
            <li>When you have such a good electric razor its important to get the best results and new blades are key to that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these new blades for 2 months now and they&#x27;ve been a great purchase: my Panasonic feels like new again!</li>
            <li>I liked my razor and didn&#x27;t want to buy a new one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably pushing it, and will be replacing these soon, but the point is that these can go for a very long time because they are great quality.</li>
            <li>Great quality &amp; lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>Plus everytime I removed the screened head to clean the shaved stubble</li>
            <li>Get a clean shave every time.  </li>
            <li>I get a clean shave every time and they perform just as advertised.</li>
            <li>I had my Panasonic Razor for over a year now, still love it, but realized I had gone from the 5 minutes to almost the whole drive till I felt my skin was as smooth as I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting any improvement, but the shave is actually much closer, quicker, and more comfortable now.  </li>
            <li>What an incredibly quick, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Just OK did not give as good of a have as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Gives a good clean shave around the chin area but does not do the same thing under the neck on the cheeks.</li>
            <li>Of course the blades are fine and are the right ones.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say exactly how often each person needs to change has blades, but it certainly is worth keeping on top of it.</li>
            <li>After a couple of months, they were about as effective as the two year old OEM blades.</li>
            <li>Overall a good value and work well.</li>
            <li>Restored the performance of my 3 year old Panasonic ES8103 to what I experienced when it was brand new.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for over 50 years, and I had never spent over $100 on a shaver until now, but boy am I glad I did on the Panasonic shaver!  </li>
            <li>GREAT TO HAVE SHARP BLADES AGAIN</li>
            <li>Because the blades work very well at first, and because I  recognize that others very likely get longer good service because they whiskers are more razor friendly, I am giving the blades 4 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Am always amazed at just how much better my shaver works with new blades!  </li>
            <li>My husband has stated several times that he likes the way the razor cuts and leaves him nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Always have been loyal to that brand.</li>
            <li>The service is fast, great, and simple.  </li>
            <li>Well packaged and quick response.</li>
            <li>The blades fit exactly and replace quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipper!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my electric razor replacement inner blade for my Panasonic Electric</li>
            <li>good will by again sharp have a smooth shave ones again</li>
            <li>Shaving time required twice as long to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Good as new with new blades.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving better with the new blades.</li>
            <li>Better than a new razor because it was cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Like a new razor... more I&#x27;m wondering why I didn&#x27;t replace it before.  </li>
            <li>The blades fit into the model I have and it worked just fine, like the new blades they should be.</li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced and shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>, they shipped fast, installed easily, and holy crud</li>
            <li>It truly is amazing how much of a difference new blades make.  </li>
            <li>It truly is amazing how much of a difference new blades make.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not careful, I find myself shaving with 1 1/4 blades instead of 2, not noticing until I take the head off to clean the razor!!  </li>
            <li>They work fine, and I will continue to use them until I replace the whole shaving system anyhow.    </li>
            <li>The first time I opened my shaver to clean out the blades just fell out.  </li>
            <li>Works great especially with his sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Thank you for fast and smooth sell.</li>
            <li>Worked great until a few months ago.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and the replacement heads work great.</li>
            <li>This one is far better, so I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li>I will choose this kind of inner blade again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more blades when ever i feel these are getting old.  </li>
            <li>The blades were correct for my shaver and completely changed the shaving quality for the better.</li>
            <li>Totally worth an annual or semi-annual replacement.</li>
            <li>Better than department store prices, plus arrived early.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite electric razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more blades when ever i feel these are getting old.</li>
            <li>A good idea to replace it every 18 months due to wear/tear and residue buildup from shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I got a couple of really good shaves when they were new, but now despite regular cleaning, I can&#x27;t say that they are any better than the year old blades that I had before.</li>
            <li>but they are the right ones.</li>
            <li>The price is right for the product.  </li>
            <li>If I were to let my beard grow out after 3 or 4 days these blades have have cut right through them with no problem...</li>
            <li>got both right on time</li>
            <li>Easy to install, in my opinion my Panasonic works like new.  </li>
            <li>As long as your screen is in good condition replacing the blades at a much lower cost is sufficient.  </li>
            <li>The replacement cutters are high quality and fit and  work as advertised.</li>
            <li>But as for packing, the blades were in with a very large item</li>
            <li>but the new blades are now just fine.    </li>
            <li>This shaver head shaves smooth and close just as you would expect from a brand new shaver head.</li>
            <li>Replacement blades turned my husband&#x27;s razor from a face mangling razor to a smooth as new razor.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace the old ones and install these..</li>
            <li>Would not buy the actual shaver again though but is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my 3 year old blades which worked fine</li>
            <li>Must have purchase the more you use the old blades, less effective your shave.</li>
            <li>The work just like the original ones did when they were new.</li>
            <li>New blades do make a significant difference</li>
            <li>I replace the original foil and blades at the recommended time and the razor is like new again.</li>
            <li>I love my Panasonic razor for daily shaves of my head.  </li>
            <li>This product was the exact replacement for the ES8109S Panasonic razor that I am using.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic is a way better razor and the razor edges last.</li>
            <li>Just what my husband needed, thanks!</li>
            <li>first painless shave.</li>
            <li>Changing the blades yearly helps to ensure the results are consistent.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering replacement blades on a more regular basis.  </li>
            <li>The blades give a very close shave!</li>
            <li>Exact replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed...exactly what I needed....</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed...</li>
            <li>My first time ordering a replacement.</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend, I think he hadn&#x27;t replaced the original blades for well over a year - so these new ones should be a great purchase that will last a long time!</li>
            <li>the old one took my first shave with the new one, and lo and behold, it was so much better.</li>
            <li>They obviously don&#x27;t have much to them, just make sure that you have the right model</li>
            <li>AMAZING WHAT SHARP BLADES DO FOR YOUR FACE ....</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s always a plus, but, they seem to struggle a bit in some of the more difficult areas of the face that the original seemed to get most times.     </li>
            <li>These were easy to install and have made a terrific difference in quality of shave.  </li>
            <li>Will certainly order again.</li>
            <li>My razor works like new again!!</li>
            <li>The replacement blades are reasonably priced and they do seem to last a good long time.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to not be able to buy them later when they make new models.    </li>
            <li>My wife uses my shaver on her legs, and she noticed right away that we had new blades the day I replaced them.</li>
            <li>my razor is good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, it is pretty clear from the picture, but this only replaces the outer two blades, the inner two have to replaced with the whole foil.  </li>
            <li>I took the large item out and was getting ready to throw the box away when I heard something rattle.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was a little bummed with these blades.    </li>
            <li>Old one is fine as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>Fit the shaver fine and clipped a few whiskers not clipped before</li>
            <li>it sounds simple, but is a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Worth the money after a couple of years with old ones.</li>
            <li>Ready to rock and roll in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>So I bought these replacement blades in the same order since I got free shipping all around  </li>
            <li>Works very well with shaving gel.</li>
            <li>work very well and fast</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the manual lists the parts separately: The inner blade, the foil, and the pair together, with their part numbers.</li>
            <li>The price is very cheap.so</li>
            <li>It takes 30 seconds, tops, to pull the old ones out and snap the fresh ones in.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really know if I needed to replace my blades until after I put them in.  </li>
            <li>Product price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Used my Panasonic until I felt the blades had reached their very end of productivity.</li>
            <li>So with some trepidation, but with the absolute need to replace the blade, I payed and received mine.</li>
            <li>check the quality and it is working very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the really close shave my razor gives me.</li>
            <li>Should have done this much sooner.</li>
            <li>Used one time and worked very well.</li>
            <li>Arc4 Men&#x27;s Electric is much sharper than this one.</li>
            <li>After replacing the blades I didn&#x27;t notice that much difference.  </li>
            <li>I really need it the replacements for my shaver and decided to order them.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>and they wear out fast.</li>
            <li>Unlike the last set of replacement blades which were great, this set which I have used for several shaves since replacing the last set, do not shave as close as the set I have been using for two years!</li>
            <li>Fits well, shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>but now they are reasonable.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>These work very well</li>
            <li>But in fact they had nothing to do with the shaver at all,  The way Amazon presented the items was very deceiving</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>And put my old blades back on after a week because they did a better job of shaving.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this won&#x27;t cause extra wear and more frequent replacement.</li>
            <li>There are some rough edges - the blades do have some difficulty getting to the contours of the face and need multiple runs before I can get a good shave.</li>
            <li>I shave almost everyday to keep an nice appearance for work.</li>
            <li>the item was as expected arrived in a very short time, and the quality was good</li>
            <li>Wet is far more efficient, comfortable, and no mess.</li>
            <li>I never replace these fast enough, feels good to get sharp replacements in the razor.  </li>
            <li>The blades are not very sharp and lose their edge quickly on my beard.  </li>
            <li>The blades are not very sharp and lose their edge quickly on my beard.  </li>
            <li>Still better than what I had, but not as sharp as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>and i think they might actually be sharper then the original heads on my razor..</li>
            <li>Big, clean difference</li>
            <li>I only use shaving cream to clean my blades which is monthly</li>
            <li>Braun 3/4/5 series is a combo, and you simply cannot get access to the blades to clean them,</li>
            <li>Good so far for the past month.</li>
            <li>Read many reviews saying that the second time around, Panasonic does not give you the original product but rather one that performs less.</li>
            <li>For fine and soft facial hair it seems cut onto skin sometimes and cause irritation and bleed...</li>
            <li>They cut like new again!</li>
            <li>Shaved like new!</li>
            <li>Just what was needed to tune up my Razor, shaves like new again!</li>
            <li>Preformed like a new razor !</li>
            <li>No need for a new shaver now!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a brand new razor!</li>
            <li>Makes the razor work like new!</li>
            <li>these replacement blades are all i really need to keep my razor performing like new.</li>
            <li>I razor gave me the signal to replace the blades, I bought the blades, and it&#x27;s like I have a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t clear that I could use these blades on my shaver (ES-LA63) but referencing an external source confirmed them.  </li>
            <li>It does a decent job and you get value for the price.</li>
            <li>for a decent price too</li>
            <li>The main improvement was reduced time when shaving.  </li>
            <li>they have lasted for several months and while degrading are still adequate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately, it is possible to buy just the blades since the combination of inner blades and outer foil costs considerably more.  </li>
            <li>It does a decent job providing you put on some type of pre-electric shaving lotion</li>
            <li>These replacement heads cut as well as the manufacturers original blades, but the question is for how long?</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended razor and replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Ladies razors are terrible, so I buy men&#x27;s for a quick close shave,  works great on ladies sensitive skin, very close shave, and I love that they work well in the shower.</li>
            <li>I shave my whole head like lots of other Guys and these last me a whole year or more</li>
            <li>Now it shaves like new even without new foil!</li>
            <li>Works great new, but does not stay sharp long enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1) I can dry shave&lt;br /&gt;2) I can clean up my sideburns&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Panasonic blades last but fresh blades are a must even with Panasonic.</li>
            <li>The old blades were worn and while you can see the difference after a shave if you look closely, it&#x27;s more obvious by mid afternoon.  </li>
            <li>Out of the box, the difference between dull and new blades was amazing.</li>
            <li>Just bought for spare and other one is still working fine.</li>
            <li>but they do pop right back on.</li>
            <li>I am grateful that Panasonic offers this alternative so that I can continue to be  reasonably clean shaven without completely breaking the bank every time I replace the inner blades.  </li>
            <li>Although these new inner blades snapped right into my shaver, I&#x27;m not noticing either a closer shave or reduced shaving time compared to the 3 year-old blades they replaced.</li>
            <li>I kept the same outside foil as it looks fine to me - and they&#x27;ve worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>If you have fine facial hair buy razor or foil replacement pack intended for the Japanese market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is cheap than other shop.</li>
            <li>The originals still are new.</li>
            <li>Although they still did their job, it was time for a new pair of blades.</li>
            <li>I tried the new blades I got.</li>
            <li>They make my razor perform like new</li>
            <li>Push the new blades on.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re new blades.  </li>
            <li>I purchased new blades as well as a new foil for my razor and changed out both</li>
            <li>I used/tried all new Norelcos.</li>
            <li>so I can tell the difference with this new set.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying a new one although if you buy the foil and blades from Panasonic you might as well buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Placed in the new one which fits.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like my shaver is new again.</li>
            <li>works well but not like new</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Shaver works like new.  </li>
            <li>It was brand new as mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li>My razor is just like new.</li>
            <li>I was worried they would not restore the razor to new</li>
            <li>Makes my Panasonic shave like brand new</li>
            <li>Razor is working like it&#x27;s brand new,</li>
            <li>I installed it, and my shaver works like new now</li>
            <li>Replacing the blades in the razor made it a new one.  </li>
            <li>It saves me from having to always buy a new electric shaver.</li>
            <li>In combo with changing the outer foil, it makes the shaver brand new.</li>
            <li>Once a year you need new blades.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten what a difference a new razor blade would make.</li>
            <li>Just replacing the blades didn&#x27;t give me the close shave that you get when you buy the razor new.</li>
            <li>You will think you have a brand new razor in your hands.</li>
            <li>My shaver works like new again.  </li>
            <li>when I shaved with the new blades my face felt like a baby&#x27;s but.  </li>
            <li>Now its like new.</li>
            <li>I almost feel like throwing my razor away and just buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>For the cost of the Panasonic blades and foil one can buy a completely new Panasonic shaver at Frys Electronics.</li>
            <li>When I put on these new blades and replacement head , it was like I had a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li>But once I put in these new bladed</li>
            <li>It makes my shaver work like it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>I was overdue for new blades and now my razor feels like a new one.</li>
            <li>These new blades work.  </li>
            <li>New blades and</li>
            <li>Now I need a new foil.</li>
            <li>Makes your razor work like new</li>
            <li>It, and my face, feel brand new again.</li>
            <li>this razor is new again...</li>
            <li>no complaints and will order it again when i need new razor heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the razor was when new.  </li>
            <li>saved the cost of a new razor</li>
            <li>For hard facial hair it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>If your foil has gotten dull, instead of buying a new one, it&#x27;s easy and cheap to just change the inner blades.</li>
            <li>The shaver works better than expected even though it hasn&#x27;t had enough time to get used to my face.</li>
            <li>I bought the razor without the washing system to replace my very old linear Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve switched back while I ponder how to find higher quality blades or buy a new shaver all together.</li>
            <li>not as sharp as the original</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because it was the first time I saw an opportunity to buy the inner blade without the foil.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t be using an old foil with new blades.</li>
            <li>my 2 year old razor new again.</li>
            <li>I changed old to new and worked well</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is the foil or the blades, but my old worn out blades and foil did much better</li>
            <li>At first, the new blades didn&#x27;t move as smoothly - but perhaps the old blades were just sliding over the stubble (which is probable as I usually had to go over them several times) -</li>
            <li>Continues to work without problems after it has become dull, but takes longer because of more passes needed.</li>
            <li>Quick replacemt, although they can be sharp so be cautious.  </li>
            <li>Pull the old blades off.  </li>
            <li>Old ones were &amp;#34;starting to pull&amp;#34; so I ordered these.</li>
            <li>Took out the old part and tossed it.  </li>
            <li>I just thought it was getting old and needed replacing.</li>
            <li>I replaced my 1 and 1/2 year old blades and noticed a difference immediately.  </li>
            <li>Did not realize how changing the blades would completely improve it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as the blades themselves, they get 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>My razor is three years old and I shouldn&#x27;t have replaced the blades sooner.</li>
            <li>Improve the shave over the old worn blades.  </li>
            <li>I can clearly feel the difference in sharpness vs. my old one.  </li>
            <li>This lasts me nearly 2years.  </li>
            <li>Have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Never seems to wear completely out.</li>
            <li>As a caveman, electric razors have given me the ability to go unnoticed among the civilized.</li>
            <li>Basically like mowing grass on 3-day old stubble -</li>
            <li>Replacing the inner blades does not make much difference in the shave quality.</li>
            <li>No issues so far with the quality of shave from the replacement blades.</li>
            <li>These blades were simple to replace and really make a difference in my electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Old blades were &amp;#34;i</li>
            <li>: replace at fairly frequent intervals.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse facial hair and need to shave every day, rarely letting my beard grow over the weekends.  </li>
            <li>razor works good but not best shave possible.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I have had my Panasonic shaver now going on 2 years, and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet, thats because of the superior workmanship they put into the development and manufacturing of their products.</li>
            <li>Blades are sharp again, cuts fine for me, and I don&#x27;t have the girly facial hair.</li>
            <li>Now I see I should have replaced the old ones long ago, the difference in the shave with the new blades is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Put in new inner blades and the razor is like new.  </li>
            <li>Finally the new life for my old ES 8807!</li>
            <li>This replacement blade has brought my Panasonic shaver back to like new again!</li>
            <li>I also used the OEM blades to shave my very fine head hair almost daily for a couple of years before they got a bit dull.</li>
            <li>and so glad to find the replacement blades, so much less expensive than most places....</li>
            <li>As this one is exactly the same as existing one I am expecting same results</li>
            <li>I am not sure because there are two more inner blades in between these and are part of the foil.  </li>
            <li>Today, with 3-4 month old blades, I often run the razor down to 10% charge shaving for over 30 minutes (when I have the time) and still feel significant stubble in the areas I mention above.</li>
            <li>I previously order same item and it fit.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, there really doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of an alternative if you have a Panasonic razor (which are generally fantastic)</li>
            <li>simply pop off the foil, and can clean with a dry brush - simple !</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for all who have gone too long on the old blades</li>
            <li>My shaver is auto clean, not sure how the curly ones get inside, so check your face before heading out.&lt;br /&gt;Fast, sharp, and worth it in general.  </li>
            <li>new blade made a big diffence</li>
            <li>Will buy a new razor next time</li>
            <li>Still requires multiple passes even when new.  </li>
            <li>The inner blade needs to break-in period to allow the out blade to seat in like when you get it new.</li>
            <li>With the new blades I did not have to over the same spot again and again.  </li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll probably just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>While it takes some time to get used to shaving with an electric shaver at the beginning, I achieve a better result with less irritation, no cuts, and minimal ingrown hairs compared to shaving with a regular razor.</li>
            <li>but they do work at least as good as my old dull blades;</li>
            <li>Replacement blades keep this saver at the top of its game.</li>
            <li>They work OK, not great.  </li>
            <li>These blades are sharp, easy to change and not as expensive as the replacements for several other popular razors.</li>
            <li>These new blades only last between 3 and 4 months when I have to replace them.</li>
            <li>i should probably have replaced the foil at the same time, but got my shaver back to new again.</li>
            <li>;-{}, i DIDN&#x27;T REALIZES THE ORIGINAL BLADES WERE GETTING DULL</li>
            <li>I used my original blades for about 14 months when I decided they were getting dull and should be replaced.  </li>
            <li>I could not find a replacement blade for my one year old Panasonic so I attempted to find a match based on visual only.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, these blades will pop off much easier than the originals, so more care is needed when cleaning out the cutting heads.  </li>
            <li>How many stars should you give inner blades that Panasonic says should be replaced every 2 years, but which must be replaced every few months or there is little point in using the razor?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;l watch for when the shaver goes on mark down and hope I can buy another one complete for the price of new blades and a foil</li>
            <li>The price on these replacement blades has really come down.</li>
            <li>The old ones pop off, the new ones pop on, no screws or clips to mess with.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>These do a fine job making my razor run like new, but they&#x27;re quite expensive.</li>
            <li>However, despite what some have claimed, I&#x27;ve found that they are not as sharp as new blades.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I replaced my blades at 3.5 months, but a face-only shaver should be able to get a year or more out of a set of blades.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am sure that you are going to like it.</li>

            <li> I Haven&#x27;t tried the repoacment blades yet, but the Panasonic ES8103S Shaver is the best I have ever owned, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Fresh blades make the shaver perform at optimum.</li>
            <li> Love, love the Panasonic razor that we purchased.</li>
            <li> The WES9068PC is OK.</li>

            <li> Auto delivery ok</li>
            <li> so my shaver gets the most use before I replace it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> I replace blades every 4 months but it might be better every 3 months.</li>
            <li> There should have been a better discription or explanation of what replacement parts would be required for my razor.</li>
            <li> Blades didn&#x27;t seem to work much better than the ones that were already in the razor.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I like my shaver much more now.</li>

            <li> Panasonic razors are incredible and you must occasionally replace the blades.  </li>
            <li> You can tell they give you a better shave just by the sound of shaving.</li>
            <li> I think the best part of this you can use it wet with foam.</li>

            <li> These work fine.</li>
            <li> Worked on mine and the shipping/packaging was fine.</li>
            <li> Blades took 10 seconds to install and they worked in the razor fine.  </li>
            <li> Be careful to read and get EXACTLY the blade recommended or you may find they don&#x27;t fit perfectly - there are so many versions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I replaced my older blades with these.</li>
            <li> HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Got my blades in two days and they fit perfit.</li>
            <li> Fit the razor my husband had and was cheaper than purchasing in a store.  </li>
            <li> They do a great job and usually last me a year or two.</li>
            <li> The 2 stars is for the fact that I can get a faster, closer shave with the multi-blade manual razors available today as compared to these blades in my electric razor.</li>
            <li> Shave is close and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Had to go to the Panasonic website to confirm these would fit.</li>
            <li> These fit well and cut well.</li>
            <li> Now we&#x27;re both silky smooth again.</li>
            <li> If only I could find the electric foil head replacement I would be happy.</li>
            <li> Fellas, don&#x27;t be cheap.</li>
            <li> They fit and my razor works like it used to.  </li>
            <li> A great investment to bring life back into your razor.</li>
            <li> Fit my ES8103 shaver as they should.</li>
            <li> I have a light beard and this shaver</li>
            <li> These blades fit my 8103 Panasonic in case anyone is wondering.</li>
            <li> one pass smooth.  </li>
            <li> get a couple months of shaves on a relatively light beard....</li>
            <li> NOW I remember why I liked my Panasonic shaver so much.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great price and absolutely will buy here again.  </li>
            <li> It got top marks in Consumer Reports, which is how I came to know about it, and the testers were absolutely right.</li>
            <li> (BALD IS BEAUTIFUL) AND TOOK FOREVER WITH LITTLE MORE THAT A STUBBLE..</li>
            <li> Easy, quick, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> They were super easy to install.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Nothing close the original one.</li>
            <li> They did NOT snap on like my original blades.</li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t seem to cut as well as the original blades</li>
            <li> After the first year I noticed what many here have reported.  </li>
            <li> Either they are just like the ones that came on the shaver originally, or they aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Seem to work just like my original blades with no issues.  </li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t searched by part number, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to find the exact parts I needed.</li>
            <li> Ny dad was so excited to find out he could get replacement blades for his shaver.  </li>
            <li> The original blades lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li> The original Panasonic ES-LF51-A</li>
            <li> do not shave as well as the original blade</li>
            <li> it was an original Panasonic part.</li>
            <li> My razor now works like it used to when I first bought it. :)</li>
            <li> Original blade replacement for my wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> I used the original blade in my razor for about two years</li>
            <li> When you have such a good electric razor its important to get the best results and new blades are key to that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these new blades for 2 months now and they&#x27;ve been a great purchase: my Panasonic feels like new again!</li>
            <li> I liked my razor and didn&#x27;t want to buy a new one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably pushing it, and will be replacing these soon, but the point is that these can go for a very long time because they are great quality.</li>
            <li> Great quality &amp; lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Plus everytime I removed the screened head to clean the shaved stubble</li>
            <li> Get a clean shave every time.  </li>
            <li> I get a clean shave every time and they perform just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had my Panasonic Razor for over a year now, still love it, but realized I had gone from the 5 minutes to almost the whole drive till I felt my skin was as smooth as I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting any improvement, but the shave is actually much closer, quicker, and more comfortable now.  </li>
            <li> What an incredibly quick, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Just OK did not give as good of a have as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Gives a good clean shave around the chin area but does not do the same thing under the neck on the cheeks.</li>
            <li> Of course the blades are fine and are the right ones.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say exactly how often each person needs to change has blades, but it certainly is worth keeping on top of it.</li>
            <li> After a couple of months, they were about as effective as the two year old OEM blades.</li>
            <li> Overall a good value and work well.</li>
            <li> Restored the performance of my 3 year old Panasonic ES8103 to what I experienced when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for over 50 years, and I had never spent over $100 on a shaver until now, but boy am I glad I did on the Panasonic shaver!  </li>
            <li> GREAT TO HAVE SHARP BLADES AGAIN</li>
            <li> Because the blades work very well at first, and because I  recognize that others very likely get longer good service because they whiskers are more razor friendly, I am giving the blades 4 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Am always amazed at just how much better my shaver works with new blades!  </li>
            <li> My husband has stated several times that he likes the way the razor cuts and leaves him nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Always have been loyal to that brand.</li>
            <li> The service is fast, great, and simple.  </li>
            <li> Well packaged and quick response.</li>
            <li> The blades fit exactly and replace quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipper!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my electric razor replacement inner blade for my Panasonic Electric</li>
            <li> good will by again sharp have a smooth shave ones again</li>
            <li> Shaving time required twice as long to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Good as new with new blades.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving better with the new blades.</li>
            <li> Better than a new razor because it was cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Like a new razor... more I&#x27;m wondering why I didn&#x27;t replace it before.  </li>
            <li> The blades fit into the model I have and it worked just fine, like the new blades they should be.</li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced and shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li> , they shipped fast, installed easily, and holy crud</li>
            <li> It truly is amazing how much of a difference new blades make.  </li>
            <li> It truly is amazing how much of a difference new blades make.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not careful, I find myself shaving with 1 1/4 blades instead of 2, not noticing until I take the head off to clean the razor!!  </li>
            <li> They work fine, and I will continue to use them until I replace the whole shaving system anyhow.    </li>
            <li> The first time I opened my shaver to clean out the blades just fell out.  </li>
            <li> Works great especially with his sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Thank you for fast and smooth sell.</li>
            <li> Worked great until a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and the replacement heads work great.</li>
            <li> This one is far better, so I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> I will choose this kind of inner blade again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more blades when ever i feel these are getting old.  </li>
            <li> The blades were correct for my shaver and completely changed the shaving quality for the better.</li>
            <li> Totally worth an annual or semi-annual replacement.</li>
            <li> Better than department store prices, plus arrived early.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more blades when ever i feel these are getting old.</li>
            <li> A good idea to replace it every 18 months due to wear/tear and residue buildup from shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I got a couple of really good shaves when they were new, but now despite regular cleaning, I can&#x27;t say that they are any better than the year old blades that I had before.</li>
            <li> but they are the right ones.</li>
            <li> The price is right for the product.  </li>
            <li> If I were to let my beard grow out after 3 or 4 days these blades have have cut right through them with no problem...</li>
            <li> got both right on time</li>
            <li> Easy to install, in my opinion my Panasonic works like new.  </li>
            <li> As long as your screen is in good condition replacing the blades at a much lower cost is sufficient.  </li>
            <li> The replacement cutters are high quality and fit and  work as advertised.</li>
            <li> But as for packing, the blades were in with a very large item</li>
            <li> but the new blades are now just fine.    </li>
            <li> This shaver head shaves smooth and close just as you would expect from a brand new shaver head.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades turned my husband&#x27;s razor from a face mangling razor to a smooth as new razor.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace the old ones and install these..</li>
            <li> Would not buy the actual shaver again though but is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my 3 year old blades which worked fine</li>
            <li> Must have purchase the more you use the old blades, less effective your shave.</li>
            <li> The work just like the original ones did when they were new.</li>
            <li> New blades do make a significant difference</li>
            <li> I replace the original foil and blades at the recommended time and the razor is like new again.</li>
            <li> I love my Panasonic razor for daily shaves of my head.  </li>
            <li> This product was the exact replacement for the ES8109S Panasonic razor that I am using.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic is a way better razor and the razor edges last.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband needed, thanks!</li>
            <li> first painless shave.</li>
            <li> Changing the blades yearly helps to ensure the results are consistent.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering replacement blades on a more regular basis.  </li>
            <li> The blades give a very close shave!</li>
            <li> Exact replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed...exactly what I needed....</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed...</li>
            <li> My first time ordering a replacement.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend, I think he hadn&#x27;t replaced the original blades for well over a year - so these new ones should be a great purchase that will last a long time!</li>
            <li> the old one took my first shave with the new one, and lo and behold, it was so much better.</li>
            <li> They obviously don&#x27;t have much to them, just make sure that you have the right model</li>
            <li> AMAZING WHAT SHARP BLADES DO FOR YOUR FACE ....</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s always a plus, but, they seem to struggle a bit in some of the more difficult areas of the face that the original seemed to get most times.     </li>
            <li> These were easy to install and have made a terrific difference in quality of shave.  </li>
            <li> Will certainly order again.</li>
            <li> My razor works like new again!!</li>
            <li> The replacement blades are reasonably priced and they do seem to last a good long time.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to not be able to buy them later when they make new models.    </li>
            <li> My wife uses my shaver on her legs, and she noticed right away that we had new blades the day I replaced them.</li>
            <li> my razor is good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, it is pretty clear from the picture, but this only replaces the outer two blades, the inner two have to replaced with the whole foil.  </li>
            <li> I took the large item out and was getting ready to throw the box away when I heard something rattle.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was a little bummed with these blades.    </li>
            <li> Old one is fine as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Fit the shaver fine and clipped a few whiskers not clipped before</li>
            <li> it sounds simple, but is a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Worth the money after a couple of years with old ones.</li>
            <li> Ready to rock and roll in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> So I bought these replacement blades in the same order since I got free shipping all around  </li>
            <li> Works very well with shaving gel.</li>
            <li> work very well and fast</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the manual lists the parts separately: The inner blade, the foil, and the pair together, with their part numbers.</li>
            <li> The price is very cheap.so</li>
            <li> It takes 30 seconds, tops, to pull the old ones out and snap the fresh ones in.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really know if I needed to replace my blades until after I put them in.  </li>
            <li> Product price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Used my Panasonic until I felt the blades had reached their very end of productivity.</li>
            <li> So with some trepidation, but with the absolute need to replace the blade, I payed and received mine.</li>
            <li> check the quality and it is working very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the really close shave my razor gives me.</li>
            <li> Should have done this much sooner.</li>
            <li> Used one time and worked very well.</li>
            <li> Arc4 Men&#x27;s Electric is much sharper than this one.</li>
            <li> After replacing the blades I didn&#x27;t notice that much difference.  </li>
            <li> I really need it the replacements for my shaver and decided to order them.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> and they wear out fast.</li>
            <li> Unlike the last set of replacement blades which were great, this set which I have used for several shaves since replacing the last set, do not shave as close as the set I have been using for two years!</li>
            <li> Fits well, shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> but now they are reasonable.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> These work very well</li>
            <li> But in fact they had nothing to do with the shaver at all,  The way Amazon presented the items was very deceiving</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> And put my old blades back on after a week because they did a better job of shaving.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this won&#x27;t cause extra wear and more frequent replacement.</li>
            <li> There are some rough edges - the blades do have some difficulty getting to the contours of the face and need multiple runs before I can get a good shave.</li>
            <li> I shave almost everyday to keep an nice appearance for work.</li>
            <li> the item was as expected arrived in a very short time, and the quality was good</li>
            <li> Wet is far more efficient, comfortable, and no mess.</li>
            <li> I never replace these fast enough, feels good to get sharp replacements in the razor.  </li>
            <li> The blades are not very sharp and lose their edge quickly on my beard.  </li>
            <li> The blades are not very sharp and lose their edge quickly on my beard.  </li>
            <li> Still better than what I had, but not as sharp as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> and i think they might actually be sharper then the original heads on my razor..</li>
            <li> Big, clean difference</li>
            <li> I only use shaving cream to clean my blades which is monthly</li>
            <li> Braun 3/4/5 series is a combo, and you simply cannot get access to the blades to clean them,</li>
            <li> Good so far for the past month.</li>
            <li> Read many reviews saying that the second time around, Panasonic does not give you the original product but rather one that performs less.</li>
            <li> For fine and soft facial hair it seems cut onto skin sometimes and cause irritation and bleed...</li>
            <li> They cut like new again!</li>
            <li> Shaved like new!</li>
            <li> Just what was needed to tune up my Razor, shaves like new again!</li>
            <li> Preformed like a new razor !</li>
            <li> No need for a new shaver now!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a brand new razor!</li>
            <li> Makes the razor work like new!</li>
            <li> these replacement blades are all i really need to keep my razor performing like new.</li>
            <li> I razor gave me the signal to replace the blades, I bought the blades, and it&#x27;s like I have a whole new razor.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t clear that I could use these blades on my shaver (ES-LA63) but referencing an external source confirmed them.  </li>
            <li> It does a decent job and you get value for the price.</li>
            <li> for a decent price too</li>
            <li> The main improvement was reduced time when shaving.  </li>
            <li> they have lasted for several months and while degrading are still adequate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately, it is possible to buy just the blades since the combination of inner blades and outer foil costs considerably more.  </li>
            <li> It does a decent job providing you put on some type of pre-electric shaving lotion</li>
            <li> These replacement heads cut as well as the manufacturers original blades, but the question is for how long?</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended razor and replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Ladies razors are terrible, so I buy men&#x27;s for a quick close shave,  works great on ladies sensitive skin, very close shave, and I love that they work well in the shower.</li>
            <li> I shave my whole head like lots of other Guys and these last me a whole year or more</li>
            <li> Now it shaves like new even without new foil!</li>
            <li> Works great new, but does not stay sharp long enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) I can dry shave&lt;br /&gt;2) I can clean up my sideburns&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Panasonic blades last but fresh blades are a must even with Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The old blades were worn and while you can see the difference after a shave if you look closely, it&#x27;s more obvious by mid afternoon.  </li>
            <li> Out of the box, the difference between dull and new blades was amazing.</li>
            <li> Just bought for spare and other one is still working fine.</li>
            <li> but they do pop right back on.</li>
            <li> I am grateful that Panasonic offers this alternative so that I can continue to be  reasonably clean shaven without completely breaking the bank every time I replace the inner blades.  </li>
            <li> Although these new inner blades snapped right into my shaver, I&#x27;m not noticing either a closer shave or reduced shaving time compared to the 3 year-old blades they replaced.</li>
            <li> I kept the same outside foil as it looks fine to me - and they&#x27;ve worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> If you have fine facial hair buy razor or foil replacement pack intended for the Japanese market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is cheap than other shop.</li>
            <li> The originals still are new.</li>
            <li> Although they still did their job, it was time for a new pair of blades.</li>
            <li> I tried the new blades I got.</li>
            <li> They make my razor perform like new</li>
            <li> Push the new blades on.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re new blades.  </li>
            <li> I purchased new blades as well as a new foil for my razor and changed out both</li>
            <li> I used/tried all new Norelcos.</li>
            <li> so I can tell the difference with this new set.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying a new one although if you buy the foil and blades from Panasonic you might as well buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Placed in the new one which fits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like my shaver is new again.</li>
            <li> works well but not like new</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Shaver works like new.  </li>
            <li> It was brand new as mentioned in the description.</li>
            <li> My razor is just like new.</li>
            <li> I was worried they would not restore the razor to new</li>
            <li> Makes my Panasonic shave like brand new</li>
            <li> Razor is working like it&#x27;s brand new,</li>
            <li> I installed it, and my shaver works like new now</li>
            <li> Replacing the blades in the razor made it a new one.  </li>
            <li> It saves me from having to always buy a new electric shaver.</li>
            <li> In combo with changing the outer foil, it makes the shaver brand new.</li>
            <li> Once a year you need new blades.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten what a difference a new razor blade would make.</li>
            <li> Just replacing the blades didn&#x27;t give me the close shave that you get when you buy the razor new.</li>
            <li> You will think you have a brand new razor in your hands.</li>
            <li> My shaver works like new again.  </li>
            <li> when I shaved with the new blades my face felt like a baby&#x27;s but.  </li>
            <li> Now its like new.</li>
            <li> I almost feel like throwing my razor away and just buying a new one.  </li>
            <li> For the cost of the Panasonic blades and foil one can buy a completely new Panasonic shaver at Frys Electronics.</li>
            <li> When I put on these new blades and replacement head , it was like I had a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> But once I put in these new bladed</li>
            <li> It makes my shaver work like it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> I was overdue for new blades and now my razor feels like a new one.</li>
            <li> These new blades work.  </li>
            <li> New blades and</li>
            <li> Now I need a new foil.</li>
            <li> Makes your razor work like new</li>
            <li> It, and my face, feel brand new again.</li>
            <li> this razor is new again...</li>
            <li> no complaints and will order it again when i need new razor heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the razor was when new.  </li>
            <li> saved the cost of a new razor</li>
            <li> For hard facial hair it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> If your foil has gotten dull, instead of buying a new one, it&#x27;s easy and cheap to just change the inner blades.</li>
            <li> The shaver works better than expected even though it hasn&#x27;t had enough time to get used to my face.</li>
            <li> I bought the razor without the washing system to replace my very old linear Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve switched back while I ponder how to find higher quality blades or buy a new shaver all together.</li>
            <li> not as sharp as the original</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because it was the first time I saw an opportunity to buy the inner blade without the foil.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t be using an old foil with new blades.</li>
            <li> my 2 year old razor new again.</li>
            <li> I changed old to new and worked well</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the foil or the blades, but my old worn out blades and foil did much better</li>
            <li> At first, the new blades didn&#x27;t move as smoothly - but perhaps the old blades were just sliding over the stubble (which is probable as I usually had to go over them several times) -</li>
            <li> Continues to work without problems after it has become dull, but takes longer because of more passes needed.</li>
            <li> Quick replacemt, although they can be sharp so be cautious.  </li>
            <li> Pull the old blades off.  </li>
            <li> Old ones were &amp;#34;starting to pull&amp;#34; so I ordered these.</li>
            <li> Took out the old part and tossed it.  </li>
            <li> I just thought it was getting old and needed replacing.</li>
            <li> I replaced my 1 and 1/2 year old blades and noticed a difference immediately.  </li>
            <li> Did not realize how changing the blades would completely improve it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as the blades themselves, they get 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> My razor is three years old and I shouldn&#x27;t have replaced the blades sooner.</li>
            <li> Improve the shave over the old worn blades.  </li>
            <li> I can clearly feel the difference in sharpness vs. my old one.  </li>
            <li> This lasts me nearly 2years.  </li>
            <li> Have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Never seems to wear completely out.</li>
            <li> As a caveman, electric razors have given me the ability to go unnoticed among the civilized.</li>
            <li> Basically like mowing grass on 3-day old stubble -</li>
            <li> Replacing the inner blades does not make much difference in the shave quality.</li>
            <li> No issues so far with the quality of shave from the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> These blades were simple to replace and really make a difference in my electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Old blades were &amp;#34;i</li>
            <li> : replace at fairly frequent intervals.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse facial hair and need to shave every day, rarely letting my beard grow over the weekends.  </li>
            <li> razor works good but not best shave possible.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I have had my Panasonic shaver now going on 2 years, and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet, thats because of the superior workmanship they put into the development and manufacturing of their products.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp again, cuts fine for me, and I don&#x27;t have the girly facial hair.</li>
            <li> Now I see I should have replaced the old ones long ago, the difference in the shave with the new blades is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Put in new inner blades and the razor is like new.  </li>
            <li> Finally the new life for my old ES 8807!</li>
            <li> This replacement blade has brought my Panasonic shaver back to like new again!</li>
            <li> I also used the OEM blades to shave my very fine head hair almost daily for a couple of years before they got a bit dull.</li>
            <li> and so glad to find the replacement blades, so much less expensive than most places....</li>
            <li> As this one is exactly the same as existing one I am expecting same results</li>
            <li> I am not sure because there are two more inner blades in between these and are part of the foil.  </li>
            <li> Today, with 3-4 month old blades, I often run the razor down to 10% charge shaving for over 30 minutes (when I have the time) and still feel significant stubble in the areas I mention above.</li>
            <li> I previously order same item and it fit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there really doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of an alternative if you have a Panasonic razor (which are generally fantastic)</li>
            <li> simply pop off the foil, and can clean with a dry brush - simple !</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for all who have gone too long on the old blades</li>
            <li> My shaver is auto clean, not sure how the curly ones get inside, so check your face before heading out.&lt;br /&gt;Fast, sharp, and worth it in general.  </li>
            <li> new blade made a big diffence</li>
            <li> Will buy a new razor next time</li>
            <li> Still requires multiple passes even when new.  </li>
            <li> The inner blade needs to break-in period to allow the out blade to seat in like when you get it new.</li>
            <li> With the new blades I did not have to over the same spot again and again.  </li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll probably just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> While it takes some time to get used to shaving with an electric shaver at the beginning, I achieve a better result with less irritation, no cuts, and minimal ingrown hairs compared to shaving with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> but they do work at least as good as my old dull blades;</li>
            <li> Replacement blades keep this saver at the top of its game.</li>
            <li> They work OK, not great.  </li>
            <li> These blades are sharp, easy to change and not as expensive as the replacements for several other popular razors.</li>
            <li> These new blades only last between 3 and 4 months when I have to replace them.</li>
            <li> i should probably have replaced the foil at the same time, but got my shaver back to new again.</li>
            <li> ;-{}, i DIDN&#x27;T REALIZES THE ORIGINAL BLADES WERE GETTING DULL</li>
            <li> I used my original blades for about 14 months when I decided they were getting dull and should be replaced.  </li>
            <li> I could not find a replacement blade for my one year old Panasonic so I attempted to find a match based on visual only.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, these blades will pop off much easier than the originals, so more care is needed when cleaning out the cutting heads.  </li>
            <li> How many stars should you give inner blades that Panasonic says should be replaced every 2 years, but which must be replaced every few months or there is little point in using the razor?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;l watch for when the shaver goes on mark down and hope I can buy another one complete for the price of new blades and a foil</li>
            <li> The price on these replacement blades has really come down.</li>
            <li> The old ones pop off, the new ones pop on, no screws or clips to mess with.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> These do a fine job making my razor run like new, but they&#x27;re quite expensive.</li>
            <li> However, despite what some have claimed, I&#x27;ve found that they are not as sharp as new blades.  </li>
            <li> I went ahead and purchased this when I had to get a new screen which developed a small hole.</li>
            <li> A few days later I received the blades and put them on my Panasonic shaver and my shaver is back to being just like new!  </li>
            <li> These are no where near as sharp as the orginal ones.</li>
            <li> and they are now much worse than the original shaver blades</li>
            <li> New blades cut your shaving time in half...</li>
            <li> By the time I replace them they are pretty dull.  </li>
            <li> The complete set once a year, more or less, is less expensive than the complete set every 4 months or so.</li>
            <li> not sure I needed to worry about it since I wasn&#x27;t using a straight razor,</li>
            <li> This shaver will last as long as it can get replacement parts and the motor works.</li>
            <li> I waited too long to do this...after replacing with these inner blades</li>
            <li> i live in Brazil and sent to me on few business day</li>
            <li> they last a very long time</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I noticed the fit was wrong and the blades were curved.  </li>
            <li> I increasingly need to use the trimmer blade on the razor for the trouble spots and it has become completely worn out.  </li>
            <li> , I think I waited too long (1year).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using this razor as long as I can find these blades or tragedy strikes.</li>
            <li> take long to arrive</li>
            <li> Should have ordered the replacement blades a LONG time ago.</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is that it is loud both the shaver and the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> I shave my entire head/face each day, it takes between 8 and 10 minutes to do it depending on how sharp the blades are.</li>
            <li> This replacement blade feel sharp but doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.</li>
            <li> to cut Panasonic some slack, I have the same problem with other razors and blades.  </li>
            <li> Never irritates my husdand&#x27;s skin, holds a charge weel, can use dry or in the shower, etc.</li>
            <li> FOR A LIMITED TIME.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Could be the issue was more the gray hairs that were being shaved daily for a sick husband.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the blades in my electric shaver brought it back to life, faster shaving and less noise, I would do this every 6 months now</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last that long, and they&#x27;re not cheap.</li>
            <li> I always use these wet in the shower with shaving cream, since it is wet dry, why do it dry.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed because I really did not notice a big difference between the new blades and the old ones they replaced.</li>
            <li> So I broke the piggy bank and ordered this Men&#x27;s Shaver Replacement Inner Blade, for what I thought at the time was a little steep.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about trying to change these blades; however, they were simple to replace.  </li>
            <li> The originals lasted a very long time and remained sharp.</li>
            <li> As an 80 year old man it was hard to find out this conclusive information.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades seemed less sharp and the time it took me to get a \\&quot;stubble-free\\&quot; shave (especially the neck area under the chin and jaw and the cheeks) was taking longer and longer.  </li>
            <li> Not much you can say about these.</li>
            <li> Shave as expected</li>
            <li> However, these seemed to have lost their sharpness after only a few shaves.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no much to say.</li>
            <li> I am not very hairy</li>
            <li> it was what i expected</li>
            <li> well worth the money for the expensive Panasonic shaver</li>
            <li> I have been a blade razor shaver, and am still partial to that..had to switch when I went to using blood thinners. ???</li>
            <li> /&gt;That was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating arrows showed up on my shaver and even after rotating I didn&#x27;t notice much improvement in the quality of the shave - not that it was poor.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that these would not fit my ES-LA63, since there was no mention of this anywhere (even on the manufacturer&#x27;s site), but they looked the same as mine, and I decided to try them.</li>
            <li> and I am really upset with your false advertising</li>
            <li> The old, original blades lasted just shy of two years before they were tired and worn out.</li>
            <li> Hope these last at least as long.</li>
            <li> Have no way of knowing if they are going to last a few months less for that</li>
            <li> I usually keep the same foil until it develops a hole.  </li>
            <li> Sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I wanted only the cleaner but was not able to buy the cleaner without the blades.</li>
            <li> My razor is now as sharp as it was when I got it.</li>
            <li> When you order it&#x27;s only a few days until delivery!</li>
            <li> My experience with these replacement blades is that after about a week of use, shaving once per day, they are no longer particularly sharp.  </li>
            <li> Needed to use electric razor due to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Happier with the panasonic razor over the Brauns we had been using.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as they used t be</li>
            <li> I replace about once a year due to the hardness of my stubble.</li>
            <li> Changing blades definitely breathes life back into a tired electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I was wondering about this myself as my beard was getting a little on the rough side.  </li>
            <li> Replace your blades at least once a year, makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> It was defiantly a mistake to replace them because these replacement blades work worse than my 3 year old ones.  </li>
            <li> And it cuts down the time it takes to shave.</li>
            <li> Once you break down and spend the money for these blades you&#x27;ll regret not doing it sooner.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a black residue on my husband&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> They still shaved but it was getting to be half shaves.</li>
            <li> Cuts shaving time in half with sharper blades  ans screen.</li>
            <li> Just like the picture shows, the blades have a slight curve to them.  </li>
            <li> And I have a heavy dark beard.</li>
            <li> Why mess around.  </li>
            <li> They go on a little post.</li>
            <li> Wish they lasted a little longer</li>
            <li> AND SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE THAN ORDERING DIRECT FROM PANASONIC.</li>
            <li> Obviously Panasonic did not have tough beards like mine in mind when they recommended replacing the blades every 2 years.  </li>
            <li> Item did not fit, money was refunded.</li>
            <li> His old blades were giving him an uncomfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Just waste of money.</li>
            <li> waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The shaver works well, unfortunately the blades have to be changed every 3 months which gets expensive, and I always properly clean the blades and foil.</li>
            <li> Previous blades had been in there for at least 1.5 years.</li>
            <li> We are talking thick black wire-like hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered these because my braun was getting a little dull..</li>
            <li> Very little razor burn and no blood unless I overdo it&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> No more shaver&#x27;s bumps with this razor.</li>
            <li> I think if they include a small item like this in with another item, they should bag it or box it</li>
            <li> So I have a 20 minute drive to work, usually about 5 minutes in I am done shaving.  </li>
            <li> In the past, they were a combination.</li>
            <li> Razor blades are such a needlessly expensive purchase and repurchase.</li>
            <li> Not sure why....</li>
            <li> After my razor went dull</li>
            <li> I was worried they would be hard to install but no problem at all, snap snap.</li>
            <li> After using them for about two months the sharpness went dull.</li>
            <li> Seem to start getting dull after about 6 months but still perform well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Panasonic shaver for at least 2-3 years and have not replaced the blades or the foil.  </li>
            <li> and this is the second time buying as he goes through blades like crazy.</li>
            <li> These onec to be replaced at least once in 12 months</li>
            <li> The blades need to be replaced at least yearly</li>
            <li> after that the razor&#x27;s performance slowly</li>
            <li> I mean if you stick to it , it will shave like a razor.</li>
            <li> They are impossible to find locally</li>
            <li> And that was very less expensive than our shop in Canada.</li>
            <li> I do have a tough beard, but I am not Magilla Gorilla.</li>
            <li> Not completely happy</li>
            <li> Not good for the consumer!</li>
            <li> I do know I&#x27;m not going to waste the money and buy another set just to see if I got a bad set.</li>
            <li> I do replace them though, nevertheless at random times after approximately a year.  </li>
            <li> There is no real good or bad for these, either they work</li>
            <li> Was unable to get replacement blades and my sister said to try Amazon, it was there and just what I needed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s difficult to tell if that&#x27;s the fault of the razors or the foil.</li>
            <li> I purchased an expensive Panasonic electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed by the quality of these blades.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find them in a store</li>
            <li> These blades have not yet failed me...</li>
            <li> but that part seems way too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> It does annoy me that they are so expensive when you have to replace them.</li>
            <li> That might come off as expensive but for me it&#x27;s affordable and convenient:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you follow the cleaning instructions or the blade will become useless.</li>
            <li> Renews the cutting ability of a Panasonic Shaver without the cost of buying a cutter and foil combination.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with Panasonic!</li>
            <li> it from the packaging since it is the wrong one!</li>
            <li> I recommend putting a reminder in your calendar to order these on a periodic basis so you don&#x27;t wait until they are doing a bad job cutting before thinking about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the life expectancy is supposed to be, but if you had to replace them every week it would get very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I may have got a bad set.</li>
            <li> I have been using panasonic shaving razor for two years and it nevet disappointed me.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s razor quit cutting, so I ordered these for him just in case they were what he needed, and they are!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Bad marketing!</li>
            <li> These blades are of terrible quality.</li>
            <li> Need these as replacements once a year and the price is outrageous.</li>
            <li> but does a terrible shaving job.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Much more affordable through Amazon.  Works with my husband&#x27;s Panasonic &amp;#34;Darth Vador&amp;#34; razor.  I appreciate that we can order through Subscribe and Save to save money and for the convenience factor.</li>
            <li> Got my blades in two days and they fit perfit. Was unable to get replacement blades and my sister said to try Amazon, it was there and just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Good as new with new blades. Worth the money after a couple of years with old ones. Did not get the blade cover. Old one is fine as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Was a welcome change to having a great shave again. Highly recommend for all who have gone too long on the old blades</li>
            <li> Fit the razor my husband had and was cheaper than purchasing in a store.  Loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been said that these blades are like Japanese swords and are made in the same way.  Hence, I almost believe that they last forever.  I do replace them though, nevertheless at random times after approximately a year.  I usually keep the same foil until it develops a hole.  Perhaps this isn&#x27;t the best practice but it&#x27;s been working for me thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with these blades!!</li>
            <li> It has to do with the panasonic wet/dry electric razor, therefore I could not give it a good review. The razor is junk.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this blade for his electric shaver. He loves it. It gives him a clean shave and makes him happy when I can order it on Amazon and not have to go out to find one.</li>
            <li> Easy, quick, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to use the blades yet but they are the right ones. Very fast shipper! Will do business again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Panasonic shaver for at least 2-3 years and have not replaced the blades or the foil.  The display started blinking a notification and I looked it up in the manual and it meant that it was time to change the blades.  So I looked up the replacement part number for the blades and ordered it on Amazon.  A few days later I received the blades and put them on my Panasonic shaver and my shaver is back to being just like new!  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Just received it, so far working perfectly. Still a great razor.</li>
            <li> These are great, it&#x27;s amazing what the difference is when you replace the blades.  I&#x27;d like to replace them more often if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive to do so.</li>
            <li> Great  replaement OEM blades!</li>
            <li> I have not used the replacement blades. The originals still are new.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Nothing close the original one.</li>
            <li> Works at a great price point.</li>
            <li> GOOD VALUE, WORKS LIKE ORIGINAL.</li>
            <li> The old, original blades lasted just shy of two years before they were tired and worn out. Although they still did their job, it was time for a new pair of blades. They cut like new again!</li>
            <li> Feels great since replacing my old blades.</li>
            <li> Gives a good clean shave around the chin area but does not do the same thing under the neck on the cheeks.</li>
            <li> Nice razor. My husband has stated several times that he likes the way the razor cuts and leaves him nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried the new blades I got. And put my old blades back on after a week because they did a better job of shaving. Plus everytime I removed the screened head to clean the shaved stubble the blades fell off. They did NOT snap on like my original blades. I may have got a bad set. I don&#x27;t know. I do know I&#x27;m not going to waste the money and buy another set just to see if I got a bad set.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have ever had. So I keep on replacing the blades.</li>
            <li> They make my razor perform like new</li>
            <li> Pull the old blades off.  Push the new blades on.  Ready to rock and roll in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Bought this as part of my fathers xmas gift. He seems to love it as he keeps asking for more replacements</li>
            <li> I love my Panasonic razor for daily shaves of my head.  These replacement heads cut as well as the manufacturers original blades, but the question is for how long? Good so far for the past month. As others have mentioned, these blades will pop off much easier than the originals, so more care is needed when cleaning out the cutting heads.  I have cut back from daily cleanings since I don&#x27;t want to pick the blades out of the sink every day. Hopefully this won&#x27;t cause extra wear and more frequent replacement.</li>
            <li> These blades fit and work perfectly, like the originals that came with my shaver.  However, I notice that they don&#x27;t shave quite as close as the originals.  Of course, I did not opt to replace the shaver foil as well, so this fact may be affecting the blades&#x27; performance.  They work fine, and I will continue to use them until I replace the whole shaving system anyhow.    I miss my Braun shaver (teary eyes)</li>
            <li> Good price &amp; razor feels like new again.</li>
            <li> new blade made a big diffence</li>
            <li> The shaver works better than expected even though it hasn&#x27;t had enough time to get used to my face. Also, the cleaning unit is excellent and does more than enough. My only minor complaint is that it is loud both the shaver and the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd set of these blades I have purchased.  They do a great job and usually last me a year or two.</li>
            <li> Changing blades definitely breathes life back into a tired electric razor.  These blades are sharp, easy to change and not as expensive as the replacements for several other popular razors.</li>
            <li> I have tried electric shavers several times over the years but always ended up going back to a blade because the blade gave a closer, cleaner shave; not anymore. This, after giving your beard time to adjust to it, gives a superb shave.</li>
            <li> What can be said? They&#x27;re new blades.  The work just like the original ones did when they were new.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have beard anymore!</li>
            <li> Now it shaves like new even without new foil! Next year I&#x27;m changing foil.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was a little bummed with these blades.    I purchased new blades as well as a new foil for my razor and changed out both so I wouldn&#x27;t be using an old foil with new blades. The blades don&#x27;t seem to cut as well as the original blades but it&#x27;s difficult to tell if that&#x27;s the fault of the razors or the foil. Either way though, I don&#x27;t feel the same closeness as the originals.     They haven&#x27;t nicked or cut me (not that the originals have more than once or twice) so that&#x27;s always a plus, but, they seem to struggle a bit in some of the more difficult areas of the face that the original seemed to get most times.     Unfortunately, there really doesn&#x27;t seem to be much of an alternative if you have a Panasonic razor (which are generally fantastic) so looks like you just have to bite the bullet.</li>
            <li> For the cost these should last longer. I use twice a week and these only last 6 months before they start pinching and need replacing.</li>
            <li> These I bought for my dad and his shaving machine, and he was very pleased. They obviously don&#x27;t have much to them, just make sure that you have the right model and that&#x27;s all! They work perfect.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend, I think he hadn&#x27;t replaced the original blades for well over a year - so these new ones should be a great purchase that will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I like these replacement blades a lot.  I found it very easy to replace the blades on my fancy schmancy electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Item did not fit, money was refunded. I previously order same item and it fit.</li>
            <li> Restored the performance of my 3 year old Panasonic ES8103 to what I experienced when it was brand new. I am very pleased. A prudent investment.</li>
            <li> Yes, these are good blades.</li>
            <li> I have had my Arc IV ES8249 razor [[ASIN:B0021AG0Z6 Panasonic ES8249S Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Silver]] for about 3 years.  I have coarse facial hair and need to shave every day, rarely letting my beard grow over the weekends.  After the first year I noticed what many here have reported.  The replacement blades seemed less sharp and the time it took me to get a \\&quot;stubble-free\\&quot; shave (especially the neck area under the chin and jaw and the cheeks) was taking longer and longer.  I replace the head once per year and I used to replace blades every 6 months. These new blades only last between 3 and 4 months when I have to replace them. Shaving time increases to over 30 minutes over that time.  Today, with 3-4 month old blades, I often run the razor down to 10% charge shaving for over 30 minutes (when I have the time) and still feel significant stubble in the areas I mention above. I am also having an issue when snapping the shaving head on over the blades.  Sometimes one of the blades stick at an angle if even pressure is not applied when you snap on the head. If I&#x27;m not careful, I find myself shaving with 1 1/4 blades instead of 2, not noticing until I take the head off to clean the razor!!  I increasingly need to use the trimmer blade on the razor for the trouble spots and it has become completely worn out.  The bottom line, the shave is very comfortable and sharpness is good to fair with these blades when shaving for 3-4 months. The 2 stars is for the fact that I can get a faster, closer shave with the multi-blade manual razors available today as compared to these blades in my electric razor.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades arrived on time and are the proper size for the razor.</li>
            <li> Finally the new life for my old ES 8807!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the OEM blades in my Panasonic electric razor. The fall out when you open the covering that houses the razors but they do pop right back on.</li>
            <li> worked out just fine!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Good to have on hand when the shaver needs replaced.  The price is right for the product.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought the razor without the washing system to replace my very old linear Panasonic.  I love this one. My wife says it&#x27;s as close as a blade shave for me. No pulled hairs.  So I bought these replacement blades in the same order since I got free shipping all around  and I didn&#x27;t want to not be able to buy them later when they make new models.    Best electric razor and blades you can get, imo.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Sharp blades. Great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased an expensive Panasonic electric razor. Always have been loyal to that brand. The shaver works well, unfortunately the blades have to be changed every 3 months which gets expensive, and I always properly clean the blades and foil. I do have a tough beard, but I am not Magilla Gorilla.I rate this product OK, don&#x27;t believe there is an alternative.</li>
            <li> Panasonic WES9068PC Inner Blade Replacement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price....  Cheaper than E-Bay.  What is there to complain about?&lt;br /&gt;Made my 2 year old razor new again.</li>
            <li> Fit was easy. Shaved like new!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these replacements several times. They fit perfectly, cut the hair, and are cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;Replacing these are cheaper than buying a bunch of disposable razors. I recommend putting a reminder in your calendar to order these on a periodic basis so you don&#x27;t wait until they are doing a bad job cutting before thinking about it.</li>
            <li> Considering replacing my shaver, a friend suggested just replacing the blades. To my surprise it works as good or better than when it was new.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, in my opinion my Panasonic works like new.  Shave is close and comfortable.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice price for Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> These blades were just what my husband needed.  His old blades were giving him an uncomfortable shave.  He will now be getting blade replacement every 6 months on Subscribe and Save.  He&#x27;s very pleased with this Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these new blades for 2 months now and they&#x27;ve been a great purchase: my Panasonic feels like new again! I&#x27;d gone close to 2 years before replacing the blades - I kept the same outside foil as it looks fine to me - and they&#x27;ve worked like a charm. At first, the new blades didn&#x27;t move as smoothly - but perhaps the old blades were just sliding over the stubble (which is probable as I usually had to go over them several times) - but the new blades are now just fine.    Be careful to read and get EXACTLY the blade recommended or you may find they don&#x27;t fit perfectly - there are so many versions.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement and easy to install.</li>
            <li> Not much you can say about these. Either they are just like the ones that came on the shaver originally, or they aren&#x27;t. These were.</li>
            <li> Got these as extras for my husband. Was a great Christmas gift</li>
            <li> I used/tried all new Norelcos. This one is far better, so I&#x27;ll keep it. Works very well with shaving gel.</li>
            <li> This product was the exact replacement for the ES8109S Panasonic razor that I am using.  I was very pleased to find it.  It was reasonably priced and shipped very quickly.  Mark me as a satisfied customer.  Darrell Fitzwater</li>
            <li> Excellent close fast shaves with this replacement blade on my Panasonic shaver. This replacement blade has brought my Panasonic shaver back to like new again!</li>
            <li> Old ones were &amp;#34;starting to pull&amp;#34; so I ordered these. Easy to install, improved shave by 30%.Glad I did replace them.</li>
            <li> Great replacement blades and would repurchase when I need them again. The shave is smooth and as good as the original blades.</li>
            <li> As advertised !! very very happy....save me a lot of time shopping around at brick and mortar store...saved me a lot of time !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YAY</li>
            <li> AMAZING WHAT SHARP BLADES DO FOR YOUR FACE .... ;-{}, i DIDN&#x27;T REALIZES THE ORIGINAL BLADES WERE GETTING DULL UNTIL I  WENT TO DO MY HEAD (BALD IS BEAUTIFUL) AND TOOK FOREVER WITH LITTLE MORE THAT A STUBBLE.. NOW ZIP, ZIP....</li>
            <li> Had the same blades for 3 years so I can tell the difference with this new set. Shave as expected</li>
            <li> This product works fine on my razor.  Cheaper than buying a new one although if you buy the foil and blades from Panasonic you might as well buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Took out the old part and tossed it.  Placed in the new one which fits. My face is shaved! KOOL!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like my shaver is new again. I just thought it was getting old and needed replacing. Nope, just some maintenance.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Seem to work just like my original blades with no issues.  They were super easy to install.</li>
            <li> Very good product easy to change it work very well and fast shipping could not ask for anything better&lt;br /&gt;hilly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;Agee</li>
            <li> I shave my entire head/face each day, it takes between 8 and 10 minutes to do it depending on how sharp the blades are. I replaced my blades at 3.5 months, but a face-only shaver should be able to get a year or more out of a set of blades. Good blades for a great shaver!</li>
            <li> I love my items and they came very quickly. My shopping experience at Amazon is great. I will continue to shop at Amazon. Thank you very, very , much for the extremely fast service and for sending my items in great condition.</li>
            <li> Had my Panasonic shaver for 3 years and shaving was not as close as before. After replacing the blade, the shave is still the same. Just waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just what was needed to tune up my Razor, shaves like new again!</li>
            <li> probably need to buy as a set.  works well but not like new</li>
            <li> not as sharp as the original</li>
            <li> Very easy to replace and works great.  The Panasonic Shaver works like new.  Get a clean shave every time.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine and it works really good with my razor. It fit perfect with my shaver. And that was very less expensive than our shop in Canada.</li>
            <li> I like this razor.  I never get as close a shave as with a blade, but this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve found.  I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my husbands electric Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> Not really sharper than old one.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;Buy regular razor instead&lt;br /&gt;Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;br /&gt;Xxxxx&lt;br /&gt;Xxxxx&lt;br /&gt;Xxxxx&lt;br /&gt;Xxxccc&lt;br /&gt;Xxxxxx</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed by the quality of these blades.  I got a couple of really good shaves when they were new, but now despite regular cleaning, I can&#x27;t say that they are any better than the year old blades that I had before.</li>
            <li> I wanted only the cleaner but was not able to buy the cleaner without the blades. Not good for the consumer! Bad marketing!</li>
            <li> The originals lasted a very long time and remained sharp. However, these seemed to have lost their sharpness after only a few shaves. Even the Razor is showing a symbol that indicates a blade change is needed. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I am not the only one who has had this problem.</li>
            <li> Replacing the blades in my electric shaver brought it back to life, faster shaving and less noise, I would do this every 6 months now, I think I waited too long (1year).</li>
            <li> Thank you for fast and smooth sell. I got them in 48 hours as promissed by seller. It was brand new as mentioned in the description. Thank you.</li>
            <li> razor works good but not best shave possible.&lt;br /&gt;For price it is good deal. Still use gel and disposable in addition</li>
            <li> The only \\&quot;issue\\&quot; I had is that the package listed the model numbers of electric razors these replace.  However, it didn&#x27;t show my razor...even though these work for it.  Had to go to the Panasonic website to confirm these would fit.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, item as described</li>
            <li> Got this product with the shaver. Everything is good to go. Try it! I am sure that you are going to like it. The shave is incredible.</li>
            <li> Great price, works great</li>
            <li> A great replacement for my old ES8109. I&#x27;ll keep using this razor as long as I can find these blades or tragedy strikes.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t neede to use yet but I love my razor it is awesome</li>
            <li> This shaver head shaves smooth and close just as you would expect from a brand new shaver head. Also has a great price.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do.  I get a clean shave every time and they perform just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is a way better razor and the razor edges last.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the manual lists the parts separately: The inner blade, the foil, and the pair together, with their part numbers. If I hadn&#x27;t searched by part number, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to find the exact parts I needed. It&#x27;s a while since I placed this order, but I don&#x27;t remember Amazon listing them along with the shaver. That would have made ti easier to find, than searching for a manual. The one I found was the French one, can&#x27;t remember where the English one is.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and great performance. My razor is just like new. Some say to replace foil as well but I do not see that as necessary.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving better with the new blades.</li>
            <li> Good product. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t seem to perform as well if you don&#x27;t also replace the foil.  Better to get both, I think</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money.  I shave my whole head like lots of other Guys and these last me a whole year or more and I shave daily.</li>
            <li> After my razor went dull I tried to order the part from Panasonic but they wouldn&#x27;t sell it to me so I came to the best place to look for it. AMAZON! My razor is now as sharp as it was when I got it.</li>
            <li> I was worried they would be hard to install but no problem at all, snap snap. I was worried they would not restore the razor to new but it did. A great buy.</li>
            <li> After getting the indication on my shaver; replaced the blades.  The newer blades did improve the quality of shave and continue to perform well after several months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got these on auto ship and that works out well; I do notice the difference.  Aside from that, they are for an Cordless. Lasts longer than THE MACH 18 BLADE WEED EATER, manual.  If you get a good oil and keep these clean you can stretch it for some time between refills.  My shaver is auto clean, not sure how the curly ones get inside, so check your face before heading out.&lt;br /&gt;Fast, sharp, and worth it in general.  You may have to get sideways under each side of your chin.  Unless you&#x27;re a Wolverine fan.</li>
            <li> these replacement blades are all i really need to keep my razor performing like new. they last a very long time but i do replace them appx. every six months anyway.</li>
            <li> I love it.I will choose this kind of inner blade again.The price is very cheap.so good!I love it 2 !</li>
            <li> This is a replacement blade for the Panasonic ES-LA63 shaver.  Panasonic recommends that you replace the blades every two years and the foil every year.  I prefer to replace both every year...</li>
            <li> The blades are really easy to swap out. It takes 30 seconds, tops, to pull the old ones out and snap the fresh ones in.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my electric razor replacement inner blade for my Panasonic Electric Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for all your help.</li>
            <li> The perfect replacement to my worn down shaver. You can change them in a flash and feel the immediate difference when you shave.</li>
            <li> Just OK did not give as good of a have as I expected.  Will buy a new razor next time</li>
            <li> The replacement cutters are high quality and fit and  work as advertised. Easy install. Great value and good delivery service. Makes my Panasonic shave like brand new</li>
            <li> Leaves a black residue on my husband&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Works perfect, no issues.  Basically replaces the same blade i had before.  Remember to replace every 6 months or so.  You get a better and quicker shave.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband needed, thanks!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really know if I needed to replace my blades until after I put them in.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  Much better shave.</li>
            <li> My razor works like new again!!</li>
            <li> These blades are of terrible quality. After using them for about two months the sharpness went dull. They are totally blunt now. I&#x27;m never buying again</li>
            <li> Today I replaced with a inner blade for seven years shaver.I am so happy.Product price is reasonable.I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Razor is working like it&#x27;s brand new,</li>
            <li> Used my Panasonic until I felt the blades had reached their very end of productivity. They still shaved but it was getting to be half shaves. So I broke the piggy bank and ordered this Men&#x27;s Shaver Replacement Inner Blade, for what I thought at the time was a little steep. Read many reviews saying that the second time around, Panasonic does not give you the original product but rather one that performs less. I know how easy accusations fly, how greedy some conglomerates can be, including banking. So with some trepidation, but with the absolute need to replace the blade, I payed and received mine. As soon as I replaced the old one took my first shave with the new one, and lo and behold, it was so much better. Have no way of knowing if they are going to last a few months less for that is in the future. For now, the purchase paid very nicely, for once again this great  Panasonic Shaver (top of their line) is performing at its best, and wasn&#x27;t&#x27; that the intended goal? 4.5 Stars!</li>
            <li> Replace your blades at least once a year, makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> The blades fit into the model I have and it worked just fine, like the new blades they should be.</li>
            <li> Better than a new razor because it was cheaper.  I liked my razor and didn&#x27;t want to buy a new one so a new set of blades were perfect.  I was unable to find them in a store</li>
            <li> Works fine in my razor. Highly recommended.  Good Price and functionality.&lt;br /&gt;Too many words are required in the summary info....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the same Panasonic razor for over 2 years and have never replaced the blades.  Well today they arrived, and today was a good day!  It truly is amazing how much of a difference new blades make.  It was remarkable how easy it was to replace the blades too.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more blades when ever i feel these are getting old.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> The service is fast, great, and simple.  Its great not having to think about replacements and were to get them.</li>
            <li> Prior to finding this product I had to purchase the blades and the screen.  It wasn&#x27;t clear that I could use these blades on my shaver (ES-LA63) but referencing an external source confirmed them.  As long as your screen is in good condition replacing the blades at a much lower cost is sufficient.  These fit well and cut well.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job and you get value for the price. There are some rough edges - the blades do have some difficulty getting to the contours of the face and need multiple runs before I can get a good shave.</li>
            <li> The blades are not very sharp and lose their edge quickly on my beard.  Its a mfg. problem I guess.  The shaver is good and has lasted a while.&lt;br /&gt;  Harold Becker</li>
            <li> I changed this blades in my shaver and they works grate. I installed it, and my shaver works like new now</li>
            <li> No more shaver&#x27;s bumps with this razor.</li>
            <li> i should probably have replaced the foil at the same time, but got my shaver back to new again. for a decent price too</li>
            <li> Purchased before. Great. As described. No problems..</li>
            <li> I needed these,what a difference.</li>
            <li> Renews the cutting ability of a Panasonic Shaver without the cost of buying a cutter and foil combination.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased these replacement blades for my Panasonic shaver, and they are great! My wife uses my shaver on her legs, and she noticed right away that we had new blades the day I replaced them. Now we&#x27;re both silky smooth again.</li>
            <li> Great deal over in store prices!  I replaced my 1 and 1/2 year old blades and noticed a difference immediately.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Replacing the blades in the razor made it a new one.  Did not realize how changing the blades would completely improve it.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the blades themselves, they get 5 stars.  But as for packing, the blades were in with a very large item and I had forgotten I ordered them.  I took the large item out and was getting ready to throw the box away when I heard something rattle. It was the blade. I think if they include a small item like this in with another item, they should bag it or box it so we won&#x27;t miss it.  Packing gets one star, although it&#x27;s my responsibility to check the box.</li>
            <li> yet to try them only bought the with purchase of shaver. will advise when I try it out and will then email you</li>
            <li> it is good !&lt;br /&gt;I check the quality and it is working very well.&lt;br /&gt;it is cheap than other shop.</li>
            <li> I shave almost everyday to keep an nice appearance for work. If I were to let my beard grow out after 3 or 4 days these blades have have cut right through them with no problem...These blades have not yet failed me...I&#x27;m glad with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These are great.  If only I could find the electric foil head replacement I would be happy. It saves me from having to always buy a new electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Panasonic the name says it all it doesn&#x27;t get any better when it comes to electric razors and replacement blades</li>
            <li> I change the blades in my electric razor only once a year as I don&#x27;t shave every day. I like the razor and these blades do the trick.</li>
            <li> Works. Shaves my head</li>
            <li> Just what we were looking for</li>
            <li> Although these new inner blades snapped right into my shaver, I&#x27;m not noticing either a closer shave or reduced shaving time compared to the 3 year-old blades they replaced.</li>
            <li> Panasonic razors are incredible and you must occasionally replace the blades.  Panasonic blades last but fresh blades are a must even with Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for making these replacement parts so easy to buy. Since replacing the heads in his shaver, he&#x27;s no longer calling his electric shaver the &amp;#34;rip and tear system&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Nice to know I can find this easily because I couldn&#x27;t find them at the stores.  After a year of use, it was finally time to replace the blades.</li>
            <li> Ny dad was so excited to find out he could get replacement blades for his shaver.  He loves his shaver and is very happy again!!</li>
            <li> These do a fine job making my razor run like new, but they&#x27;re quite expensive.</li>
            <li> great, you can feel the difference</li>
            <li> This replacement part works as it should and Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> These work fine. My husband&#x27;s facial hair is like wire and this is the second time buying as he goes through blades like crazy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I needed to change the blades in my electric razor.  I razor gave me the signal to replace the blades, I bought the blades, and it&#x27;s like I have a whole new razor.  It has a very nice feel and the blades are easy to replace.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel or see any difference in my shave since I replaced the inner blades in my shaver.  Previous blades had been in there for at least 1.5 years.</li>
            <li> In combo with changing the outer foil, it makes the shaver brand new. It results In a nice clean and smooth shave</li>
            <li> Great service and value,  saved a bunch of money,  and works great,  will purchase more of these when needed</li>
            <li> It fits the electric shaver and I purchased them as &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; when the time comes for him to change the blade.</li>
            <li> first painless shave.</li>
            <li> It fits what else is there to say…oh, it showed-up in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Cuts shaving time in half with sharper blades  ans screen.</li>
            <li> Great product. Worked as expected</li>
            <li> The blades are not very sharp and lose their edge quickly on my beard.  Its a mfg. problem I guess.  The shaver is good and has lasted a while.&lt;br /&gt;  Harold Becker</li>
            <li> Great price and shipping.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping.  Product as described, works well.</li>
            <li> Need these as replacements once a year and the price is outrageous.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the outer foil and my razor no longer gives a close shave.  Not sure if it is the foil or the blades, but my old worn out blades and foil did much better</li>
            <li> Fellas, don&#x27;t be cheap. Once a year you need new blades. It will feel great, and leave you well groomed.</li>
            <li> Great - That&#x27;s all I can say.  work well and will purchase again when needed.  5- stars on this item.</li>
            <li> I have been using panasonic shaving razor for two years and it nevet disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten what a difference a new razor blade would make. Once again I started getting the really close shave my razor gives me. And it cuts down the time it takes to shave. I would suggest replacing this around every 4-5 months. I now get it on Amazon Subscription and save 15%.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no much to say. Just a replacement for my razor. BTW, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Improved my shave by almost 100%. Should have done this much sooner.</li>
            <li> I have had my Panasonic shaver now going on 2 years, and it hasn&#x27;t failed me yet, thats because of the superior workmanship they put into the development and manufacturing of their products. I have had a lot of experience with the panasonic products and they have all always served me well.  These are the inner blades for my shaver that I am now replacing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to replace blades (only) every 6 to 9 months or so for a PERFECT shave.  Love my Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I received these twice a year.  Seems to keep my razor working well.</li>
            <li> These blades are great. Now I see I should have replaced the old ones long ago, the difference in the shave with the new blades is very noticeable. The new blades give a clean, smooth shave, making this purchase one I&#x27;m happy to have made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Panasonic razor for about 3 years and replace the blades annually and the foil every 18 months. While it takes some time to get used to shaving with an electric shaver at the beginning, I achieve a better result with less irritation, no cuts, and minimal ingrown hairs compared to shaving with a regular razor. Changing the blades yearly helps to ensure the results are consistent. They&#x27;re a breeze to replace - literally takes 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> These blades will get your Panasonic razor back in like-new condition, however I suggest you always replace the foil and blades at the same time. Amazon sells a combo pack that includes both the blades and the foil. I&#x27;ve found that to get the best performance you should go ahead and replace the foil as well. Just replacing the blades didn&#x27;t give me the close shave that you get when you buy the razor new.</li>
            <li> The blades were correct for my shaver and completely changed the shaving quality for the better. I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Same comments as submitted for the Foil . Preformed like a new razor !</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my 3 year old blades which worked fine but I thought they needed to be changed.  It was defiantly a mistake to replace them because these replacement blades work worse than my 3 year old ones.  Easy to install and arrived quickly but does a terrible shaving job.</li>
            <li> Razors as described. You cannot go wrong with Panasonic! Very happy! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Replacement blades keep this saver at the top of its game.</li>
            <li> You will think you have a brand new razor in your hands.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and reasonably priced.  I need to replace these every six months.</li>
            <li> I have just purchased the 4th order of Panasonic replacement blades to go with gifts of wet/dry razors to my daughters.  They all love the razors and appreciate the cleaning apparatus and replacement blades.  Great value for a great price.  When you order it&#x27;s only a few days until delivery!</li>
            <li> Perfect, my Vortex is brand new again.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacements back in 2012 and it&#x27;s now 2015 and they are still going! - And I have a heavy dark beard. I&#x27;m probably pushing it, and will be replacing these soon, but the point is that these can go for a very long time because they are great quality.</li>
            <li> There is no real good or bad for these, either they work or they don&#x27;t for your electric shaver. Worked on mine and the shipping/packaging was fine.</li>
            <li> Just like the picture shows, the blades have a slight curve to them.  This curve wasn&#x27;t noticed when I ordered these.  My ES8078 uses straight/level blades.  The first time I opened my shaver to clean out the blades just fell out.  That&#x27;s when I noticed the fit was wrong and the blades were curved.  Not completely happy but they do work at least as good as my old dull blades; which I had already thrown away (lesson learned).</li>
            <li> Cuts my beard.  My shaver works like new again.  I also replaced the foil at the same time.  No need for a new shaver now!</li>
            <li> good price and when I shaved with the new blades my face felt like a baby&#x27;s but.  Good blades! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> They fit and my razor works like it used to.  The original blades lasted about a year.  Hope these last at least as long.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about trying to change these blades; however, they were simple to replace.  Best price I&#x27;ve found on these blades.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I just replaced the blades in my razor in about 5 minutes. The old ones pop off, the new ones pop on, no screws or clips to mess with. They go on a little post. No problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s like a brand new razor!</li>
            <li> Used one time and worked very well.</li>
            <li> good will by again sharp have a smooth shave ones again</li>
            <li> Price for blades is acceptable however I was going to buy the foil as well but that part seems way too expensive for what it is. I&#x27;l watch for when the shaver goes on mark down and hope I can buy another one complete for the price of new blades and a foil</li>
            <li> Simple snap in blade replacement. made shaving a refreshed experience. When you have such a good electric razor its important to get the best results and new blades are key to that.</li>
            <li> Ordered these because my braun was getting a little dull.. Now its like new. Pefect replacement, shipped on time. Easy to replace the old ones and install these..</li>
            <li> They work as per the original ones still very happy with product</li>
            <li> Once you break down and spend the money for these blades you&#x27;ll regret not doing it sooner.  New blades cut your shaving time in half...it did for me.  My razor is three years old and I shouldn&#x27;t have replaced the blades sooner.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s razor quit cutting, so I ordered these for him just in case they were what he needed, and they are!</li>
            <li> Am always amazed at just how much better my shaver works with new blades!  Am going to have to remember to change more often.</li>
            <li> I know that I have one box ready to use as a replacement, great product. Make sure you add this replacement when purchasing a electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Works as good as the razor did when new!  Very happy with the price and performance as these usually last me about three years.  I am not very hairy but these never pull or hurt my skin and I always get a razor close shave.</li>
            <li> The receiver really liked the gift &amp; worked great for a good shave &amp; shaves good after putting it on.</li>
            <li> They work OK, not great.  Still requires multiple passes even when new.  They don&#x27;t last that long, and they&#x27;re not cheap. They could be designed to last longer, but then they wouldn&#x27;t need to be replaced so often.</li>
            <li> This replacement blade feel sharp but doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.The original Panasonic ES-LF51-A Arc4 Men&#x27;s Electric is much sharper than this one.Need to change every 6 months instead of yearly.</li>
            <li> My shaver told me to replace the heads.  I was wondering about this myself as my beard was getting a little on the rough side.  After replacing the blades I didn&#x27;t notice that much difference.  Yes, they gave a better shave but not that much better.</li>
            <li> The company sent me a cutter which was NOT the one for my shaver which is an ES8109.  I have not even&lt;br /&gt;removed it from the packaging since it is the wrong one!</li>
            <li> I really need it the replacements for my shaver and decided to order them. This are great and what i was looking for</li>
            <li> Yes I needed this item also  got both right on time</li>
            <li> work well after 6 months I changed old to new and worked well</li>
            <li> buen producto,  el repuesto que necesitaba para mi maquina de afeitar</li>
            <li> Does the job replacing the one of the inner blades when I lost it on vacation. The inner blade needs to break-in period to allow the out blade to seat in like when you get it new.</li>
            <li> Great quality &amp; lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Good quality product, delivered on time as described.</li>
            <li> This is great, and so much cheaper than you will get at any store. Fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> So I have a 20 minute drive to work, usually about 5 minutes in I am done shaving.  I had my Panasonic Razor for over a year now, still love it, but realized I had gone from the 5 minutes to almost the whole drive till I felt my skin was as smooth as I wanted.  Finally I ordered these, they shipped fast, installed easily, and holy crud my razor is good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, it is pretty clear from the picture, but this only replaces the outer two blades, the inner two have to replaced with the whole foil.  Not an issue to me, maybe next year.  But just replacing these does the trick.</li>
            <li> Good service...nice shave.</li>
            <li> A great investment to bring life back into your razor. I went TWO years without replacing the inner blades. What a difference!</li>
            <li> Always replace your blades. Big, clean difference</li>
            <li> We received the blades promptly and they were the correct ones. Blades work great!</li>
            <li> Replacement blades turned my husband&#x27;s razor from a face mangling razor to a smooth as new razor. If your foil has gotten dull, instead of buying a new one, it&#x27;s easy and cheap to just change the inner blades.</li>
            <li> I figured that I would replace the blades in my shaver, only because it has been about a year.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting any improvement, but the shave is actually much closer, quicker, and more comfortable now.  Totally worth an annual or semi-annual replacement.</li>
            <li> The Panasonice ES80109S is a great electric razor. Never irritates my husdand&#x27;s skin, holds a charge weel, can use dry or in the shower, etc. Best praise I cangive it is that I don&#x27;t get scratched kissing the guy! The replacement blades are reasonably priced and they do seem to last a good long time. Highly recommended razor and replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Of course the blades are fine and are the right ones. It does annoy me that they are so expensive when you have to replace them. I almost feel like throwing my razor away and just buying a new one.  Maybe that&#x27;s their plan?  hehe</li>
            <li> it was what i expected</li>
            <li> EL PRODUCTO LLEGO OK, TAL Y COMO LO OFRECIERON ESTOY TOTALMENTE SATISFECHO CON EL MISMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMIENDO AL VENDEDOR ES BASTANTE RESPONSABLE</li>
            <li> Fantastic replacement blades, this is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had and so glad to find the replacement blades, so much less expensive than most places....</li>
            <li> I will be ordering replacement blades on a more regular basis.  Improve the shave over the old worn blades.  The main improvement was reduced time when shaving.  With the new blades I did not have to over the same spot again and again.  I did not replace the foil, but I might do that the next time to see if that also helps.</li>
            <li> got what was ordered!&lt;br /&gt;clean shaved again :-) well worth the money for the expensive Panasonic shaver&lt;br /&gt;didnt take long to arrive</li>
            <li> Fit my ES8103 shaver as they should. I can clearly feel the difference in sharpness vs. my old one.  You can tell they give you a better shave just by the sound of shaving.</li>
            <li> This lasts me nearly 2years.  So 8243A + a replacement is good for 4years.  Have sensitive skin so Panny shavers with the foil and blade made in japan are perfect.</li>
            <li> Made for Panasonic 8243 electric razor. I buy the head and blades together. Works great new, but does not stay sharp long enough. Needs replaced again after a month. I use for shaving my head and beard. Continues to work without problems after it has become dull, but takes longer because of more passes needed. Never seems to wear completely out. Costs around $50 for head and blades.</li>
            <li> Worked great. Only problem I had was the fact I also had to purchase the comb, separately.  In the past, they were a combination.</li>
            <li> I Haven&#x27;t tried the repoacment blades yet, but the Panasonic ES8103S Shaver is the best I have ever owned, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades work great. Fresh blades make the shaver perform at optimum. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Purchase along with the razor just so you have it on hand.  Love, love the Panasonic razor that we purchased.</li>
            <li> The WES9068PC is OK. Doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave.  Would not buy the actual shaver again though but is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good and cheaper thx.</li>
            <li> Initially worked well, but blades wear too quickly-four weeks.  I have a light beard and this shaver just does not shave close enough.  Razor blades are such a needlessly expensive purchase and repurchase.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHTTHIS WITH ES8103S.EASY TO REPLACE, MORE CHEAPER THAN THOSE PHILIPS REPLACEMENG ,SO I THOSED THIS MODLE,VERY NICE I LIKE IT</li>
            <li> I could not find a replacement blade for my one year old Panasonic so I attempted to find a match based on visual only. Big mistake! Panasonic makes blades for their shavers with tiny differences. Just enough so there is no standard year-to-year. For the cost of the Panasonic blades and foil one can buy a completely new Panasonic shaver at Frys Electronics.</li>
            <li> i recommend. great shaver. easy to replace. good price. i live in Brazil and sent to me on few business day</li>
            <li> If you are going to replace the outer foil, you need to replace the blades as well.</li>
            <li> This is the second or third time I order the same replacements.  They have never been as good as the original blades.&lt;br /&gt;They do not shave as well as the original blade and they wear out fast.</li>
            <li> I have been a blade razor shaver, and am still partial to that..had to switch when I went to using blood thinners. ??? not sure I needed to worry about it since I wasn&#x27;t using a straight razor, but my wife was insistent. Anyway, I have been using the electric for about 3 years, and find that these blades last about 6 months, and cut well during that time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for three years. Worked great until a few months ago. I had to go over and over spots to get a good shave. When I put on these new blades and replacement head , it was like I had a brand new shaver.</li>
            <li> the item was as expected arrived in a very short time, and the quality was good it was an original Panasonic part.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great price and absolutely will buy here again.  Thank you</li>
            <li> As a caveman, electric razors have given me the ability to go unnoticed among the civilized. Ive been using panasonic electric razors for about 4 years now. These blades last about 5 to 6 months with daily use. That might come off as expensive but for me it&#x27;s affordable and convenient:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I can dry shave&lt;br /&gt;2) I can clean up my sideburns&lt;br /&gt;3) Very little razor burn and no blood unless I overdo it&lt;br /&gt;4) I only use shaving cream to clean my blades which is monthly</li>
            <li> Ok.  What can you say about a razor part.  Auto delivery ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for just over 3 years now and I had used the same blades the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating arrows showed up on my shaver and even after rotating I didn&#x27;t notice much improvement in the quality of the shave - not that it was poor.  But once I put in these new bladed I realized the difference was night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say exactly how often each person needs to change has blades, but it certainly is worth keeping on top of it.</li>
            <li> Unlike the last set of replacement blades which were great, this set which I have used for several shaves since replacing the last set, do not shave as close as the set I have been using for two years! Very disappointing. I would like to exchange these for a new set since I know how good this product can be.</li>
            <li> Perfect! My razor now works like it used to when I first bought it. :)</li>
            <li> Should have ordered the replacement blades a LONG time ago. What an incredibly quick, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I replace the blades every year so my shaver gets the most use before I replace it. This shaver will last as long as it can get replacement parts and the motor works.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised.  I never replace these fast enough, feels good to get sharp replacements in the razor.  Fits well, shipped fast.  Can&#x27;t ask for much more than that.</li>
            <li> Great Blades------thats all I needed!  If you own this shaver all you need is to replace the blades and you will continue to get a great shave</li>
            <li> the blades were easy to install and immediately improved shave quality. they have lasted for several months and while degrading are still adequate. good price to make shaving like new again</li>
            <li> Original blade replacement for my wet/dry shaver.  A good idea to replace it every 18 months due to wear/tear and residue buildup from shaving cream.  Best price that I have found.</li>
            <li> Like a new razor... more I&#x27;m wondering why I didn&#x27;t replace it before.  I think it&#x27;s because it was the first time I saw an opportunity to buy the inner blade without the foil.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp again, cuts fine for me, and I don&#x27;t have the girly facial hair. We are talking thick black wire-like hair. Way cheaper than the manufacturer site. I always use these wet in the shower with shaving cream, since it is wet dry, why do it dry. Wet is far more efficient, comfortable, and no mess.</li>
            <li> The blades are packaged to not allow damage while shipping.  The blades fit perfectly and are very easy to change.  The blades are made of quality materials and last almost a year before replacing.  The blades give a very close shave!</li>
            <li> Not a big improvement.  I am a little disappointed because I really did not notice a big difference between the new blades and the old ones they replaced.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. It makes my shaver work like it&#x27;s new. I would buy it again. Ed W.</li>
            <li> I was overdue for new blades and now my razor feels like a new one. HUGE difference. These blades fit my 8103 Panasonic in case anyone is wondering.</li>
            <li> These are no where near as sharp as the orginal ones. The shaver was great at first but what good is spending $60+ and only having the shaver for 6 months. Don&#x27;t buy these or the shaver!</li>
            <li> The price on these replacement blades has really come down. They were way over priced but now they are reasonable.</li>
            <li> I added to my purchase Panasonic replacement blades, to retain a close and comfort shave. Must have purchase the more you use the old blades, less effective your shave.</li>
            <li> Makes the razor work like new! What more can I say. I replace blades every 4 months but it might be better every 3 months.</li>
            <li> finally can get a close shave again.  bought this last year and it lasted 1 1/2 years. pretty good. ordered it again this year. will order again next year when it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> These new blades work.  The old blades were worn and while you can see the difference after a shave if you look closely, it&#x27;s more obvious by mid afternoon.  New blades and you&#x27;re good for another three hours.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this shaver. Will continue to order from you when need to. Thanks. Mary</li>
            <li> I chose the lowest rating, because I bought an inner blade and did not need one. There should have been a better discription or explanation of what replacement parts would be required for my razor. As an 80 year old man it was hard to find out this conclusive information.</li>
            <li> Used it once since I received it and it works great.  I knew when I purchased it re Panasonic that it would be excellent.  Keep up the work.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I used my original blades for about 14 months when I decided they were getting dull and should be replaced.  I ordered this product, and it arrived well protected in Panasonic packaging.  Blades took 10 seconds to install and they worked in the razor fine.  However, despite what some have claimed, I&#x27;ve found that they are not as sharp as new blades.  Even though they were \\&quot;new\\&quot; as in never been used, they felt as sharp/dull as blades that had been used for 6 months.  Still better than what I had, but not as sharp as I&#x27;d hoped.  Next time I&#x27;ll probably just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> My experience with these replacement blades is that after about a week of use, shaving once per day, they are no longer particularly sharp.  I don&#x27;t know what the life expectancy is supposed to be, but if you had to replace them every week it would get very expensive.  I never use them in the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; mode so I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference or not.</li>
            <li> great price and value, love it. it makes shaving very easy in the shower. Now I need a new foil.</li>
            <li> I was worried that these would not fit my ES-LA63, since there was no mention of this anywhere (even on the manufacturer&#x27;s site), but they looked the same as mine, and I decided to try them. They fit perfectly, and do the job I need them to do.</li>
            <li> I purchased the replacement blades along with the replacement Fold.  Both have performed perfectly.  Very happy with both and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The blades fit exactly and replace quickly.  Its easy to swap them out.  They work great and great price.  They are great</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for over 50 years, and I had never spent over $100 on a shaver until now, but boy am I glad I did on the Panasonic shaver!  It got top marks in Consumer Reports, which is how I came to know about it, and the testers were absolutely right.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think that I would have to replace the blades in les than a year..</li>
            <li> Replace these about every year, and what a difference it makes for the shave.  Basically like mowing grass on 3-day old stubble - one pass smooth.  After a year, they will still cut close, but takes a lot of passes.  Great shave.  Best razor ever too.</li>
            <li> For hard facial hair it&#x27;s good. For fine and soft facial hair it seems cut onto skin sometimes and cause irritation and bleed... If you have fine facial hair buy razor or foil replacement pack intended for the Japanese market.</li>
            <li> It performs as well as any electric razor  I have owned.</li>
            <li> I was using a quality brand when it finally gave up. I got this Shaver and haven&#x27;t regretted it since I received it.</li>
            <li> Ladies razors are terrible, so I buy men&#x27;s for a quick close shave,  works great on ladies sensitive skin, very close shave, and I love that they work well in the shower.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Electric razor for my son for Christmas.  He really liked it!  It came when they said it would.</li>
            <li> Replacing the inner blades does not make much difference in the shave quality. The foils need to be replaced as well for optimal shave.</li>
            <li> Blades didn&#x27;t seem to work much better than the ones that were already in the razor. Liked the razor. Could be the issue was more the gray hairs that were being shaved daily for a sick husband.  Needed to use electric razor due to cancer.&lt;br /&gt;Happier with the panasonic razor over the Brauns we had been using.</li>
            <li> These work very well and i think they might actually be sharper then the original heads on my razor..if that is possible?</li>
            <li> My husband loves them.  I don&#x27;t use them, but, he doesn&#x27;t look like a hobo at 4:00 pm.  I like that.</li>
            <li> Better than department store prices, plus arrived early.  No issues so far with the quality of shave from the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement blades. Easy swap. Cuts well.... FOR A LIMITED TIME.&lt;br /&gt;I get a couple months of shaves on a relatively light beard.... Wish they lasted a little longer</li>
            <li> Works as good as the original! Possibly better!</li>
            <li> Makes your razor work like new</li>
            <li> NOW I remember why I liked my Panasonic shaver so much. It, and my face, feel brand new again. Shaving is noticeably smoother, quieter, and faster than before. If it were a bit cheaper, this would be a five star review. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I waited too long to do this...after replacing with these inner blades this razor is new again...what a nice clean shave.  Easy install...great price...fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Neighborhood Chevy dealer wanted $81.00 this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality of this replacement part.  I received it as scheduled.  I&#x27;m getting close shaves and no issues.</li>
            <li> Shaver is like new now, easy fit...the best.</li>
            <li> GREAT  PRICE&amp;#62;&amp;#62;GREAT DEAL&amp;#62;&amp;#62;GREAT SHIPMENT&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;HAPPY CAMPER</li>
            <li> Well packaged and quick response. Good Product.  Fantastic shave.  The best I&#x27;ve ever owned.Thanks!</li>
            <li> On time.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great product, very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as they used t be</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite electric razor. I use it everyday and the replacement heads work great. I change mine out about once a year.</li>
            <li> These are just like the original and fit my razor perfectly and were priced reasonably.  They are impossible to find locally</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed...exactly what I needed....Exactly what I needed...(just filling out the number of words needed to submit this review)</li>
            <li> Excellent blade replacement product that provides close and comfortable shaving.</li>
            <li> Panasonic have a winner wit separate blades from foil.  it sounds simple, but is a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;You simply pop off the foil, and can clean with a dry brush - simple ! wow.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 3/4/5 series is a combo, and you simply cannot get access to the blades to clean them,</li>
            <li> Great product! works perfect with my razor. no complaints and will order it again when i need new razor heads.</li>
            <li> I tend to purchase brand name replacement parts because you know they are going to work.  Why mess around.  These are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Standard replacement blades for an electric Panasonic.  As described and works well..&lt;br /&gt;Price was the best I found.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Title says it all. Quick replacemt, although they can be sharp so be cautious.  Will probably need the toil next time.</li>
            <li> This item and the shaving solution were items listed on the page of the Pansonic shaver that I purchased, indicating that they were parts for the shaver that people had purchased for the Pansonic shaver.  But in fact they had nothing to do with the shaver at all,  The way Amazon presented the items was very deceiving and I am really upset with your false advertising</li>
            <li> Great service... and perfect fit:-)</li>
            <li> Just bought for spare and other one is still working fine. As this one is exactly the same as existing one I am expecting same results</li>
            <li> I replaced the blades on my razor with these and there was a definite improvement&lt;br /&gt;in the closeness of the shave, but it never quite got back to where&lt;br /&gt;the razor was when new.  Not sure why....</li>
            <li> The blades are an excellent product and purchase. My first time ordering a replacement. New blades do make a significant difference</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use these yet.  I ordered to replace the existing blades when needed.  Looks like they will be very easy to replace.</li>
            <li> These onec to be replaced at least once in 12 months</li>
            <li> I have owned the Panasonic ES8243A Arc4 razor since 2011. I replace the original foil and blades at the recommended time and the razor is like new again. The razor itself is a great product and I am just as happy with the replacement foil and blades. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> GREAT TO HAVE SHARP BLADES AGAIN AND SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE THAN ORDERING DIRECT FROM PANASONIC. WILL ORDER AGAIN SOON.</li>
            <li> excellent replacement blade, fit perfectly and super easy to change out with the old one.  Will definitely buy again next year!</li>
            <li> I replace the foil and inner blade after one year. Very happy with this. I like my shaver much more now.</li>
            <li> These blades were simple to replace and really make a difference in my electric shaver.  I&#x27;m very glad I replaced my older blades with these.</li>
            <li> It is the best shaver I have ever used. I mean if you stick to it , it will shave like a razor. I think the best part of this you can use it wet with foam. I will never  go back to hand razor.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and purchased this when I had to get a new screen which developed a small hole. This replacement blade set was superior to the one that came with the shaver new.</li>
            <li> Old blades were &amp;#34;i dont know how old&amp;#34;. The new blades work great saved the cost of a new razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the same Panasonic razor for over 2 years and have never replaced the blades. Well today they arrived, and today was a good day! It truly is amazing how much of a difference new blades make. It was remarkable how easy it was to replace the blades too. I&#x27;ll be ordering more blades when ever i feel these are getting old. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Watch out for the reviews that used these once and then reviewed. I also used the OEM blades to shave my very fine head hair almost daily for a couple of years before they got a bit dull. I&#x27;ve replace the foil before but never the blades so I gave these a try. Out of the box, the difference between dull and new blades was amazing. After a couple of months, they were about as effective as the two year old OEM blades. Another month and they are now much worse than the original shaver blades and I&#x27;ve switched back while I ponder how to find higher quality blades or buy a new shaver all together.</li>
            <li> All I can say is this is the OE replacement blade for my Panasonic razor and they work great. The blades need to be replaced at least yearly and you&#x27;ll really notice a difference. They are extremely simple to replace and I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
            <li> excellent!! it fit and cuts great</li>
            <li> Fit the shaver fine and clipped a few whiskers not clipped before</li>
            <li> OEM inner blades work perfect in my ES8103 Shaver. I replace about once a year due to the hardness of my stubble. Seem to start getting dull after about 6 months but still perform well. By the time I replace them they are pretty dull.  Overall a good value and work well.</li>
            <li> This brought life back to my razor again. I went about two years with the same blades. I popped these in and immediately started the subscribe and save. If you enjoy your Panasonic and don&#x27;t want to drop another 100 on a new razor these are a great alternative.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, exactly the item I needed!</li>
            <li> My husband likes this electric razor.  He would like a closer shave than he gets from this razor, however, he is satisfied with the product for the value.</li>
            <li> this works but next time I will get both parts .</li>
            <li> How many stars should you give inner blades that Panasonic says should be replaced every 2 years, but which must be replaced every few months or there is little point in using the razor?  The best shave I get is the first time I shave with the new blades, after that the razor&#x27;s performance slowly worsens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But to cut Panasonic some slack, I have the same problem with other razors and blades.  Obviously Panasonic did not have tough beards like mine in mind when they recommended replacing the blades every 2 years.  Because the blades work very well at first, and because I  recognize that others very likely get longer good service because they whiskers are more razor friendly, I am giving the blades 4 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, it is possible to buy just the blades since the combination of inner blades and outer foil costs considerably more.  I am grateful that Panasonic offers this alternative so that I can continue to be  reasonably clean shaven without completely breaking the bank every time I replace the inner blades.  The complete set once a year, more or less, is less expensive than the complete set every 4 months or so.</li>
            <li> I have been using my LA93 for six months.  Shaving time required twice as long to get a good shave.  Put in new inner blades and the razor is like new.  I have read in several articles that the foil only need to be replace every two years.  I am not sure because there are two more inner blades in between these and are part of the foil.  We will see when I get more time on this shaver.</li>
            <li> I used the original blade in my razor for about two years so I noticed the difference, when I replaced it.  A worthwhile practice to follow: replace at fairly frequent intervals.  I use it to shave my head and my face.  It does a good job on both.</li>
            <li> Not that I know anything about the product, but my fella loved it!  Works great especially with his sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Excellent product delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Panasonic mens replacement shaver has a Good price for this product and it shipped fast. I like it. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Original replacement at good price. I will order again when the time comes for another replacement. It is made by Panasonic.</li>
            <li> My husband seems to like it. Takes some getting used to though.</li>
            <li> Husband had shaver for two years, and it was beyond time to replace inner blades.  These were easy to install and have made a terrific difference in quality of shave.  Will certainly order again.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job providing you put on some type of pre-electric shaving lotion first.&lt;br /&gt;The original blade and foil did a better job for some reason.  And, you do have to make&lt;br /&gt;sure you follow the cleaning instructions or the blade will become useless.</li>
