            <li>Great price for a classic perfume.  </li>
            <li>My mother has worn this for as long as I can remember and this is the best deal for it.</li>

            <li>so I was happy to get a new bottle.</li>
            <li>It is no longer available at most retail stores</li>
            <li>It does not have an overwhelming scent, au contraire (to the contrary), it has a very mild and smooth scent.  </li>
            <li>Is it that strong?..</li>
            <li>My husband is the one that chose it for me as he does not like strong perfume.</li>
            <li>This is a STRONG fragrance</li>
            <li>Its strong so you don&#x27;t need to load it</li>
            <li>Really strong overpowering smell, I gave this away.</li>
            <li>It was a good buy &amp; high quality.  </li>
            <li>Very good product I used to wear Ciara long time ago</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet and sexy</li>
            <li>Love the clean light smell.</li>
            <li>Love, Love this sent, very fast shipping</li>
            <li>The arrival was quick and I love Ciara</li>
            <li>THE GREAT highly recommend, safe and fast delivery</li>
            <li>but do not hold strong scent as original.</li>
            <li>I read great reviews about it, but the only person I think would like it is an elderly woman.</li>
            <li>light floral scent for all ages of women</li>
            <li>I enjoy this fragrance</li>
            <li>Ciara is a beautiful scent that&#x27;s been around a long time.  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume, received fast and such a great price</li>
            <li>but I love it so much!</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite perfume...and not expensive.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised, because I honestly thought it would be a cheap knockoff.  </li>
            <li>My favorite and only kind I can wear.  </li>
            <li>.......smells just great on her and lasts a real long time......</li>
            <li>This is an old favorite of mine from the 90&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>rich with resinous, sweet, smoky incense notes.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to see this on Amazon at such a good price and the item is the exact same as what I had been buying at the store.</li>
            <li>Good product and low cost.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my friend; it&#x27;s the only fragrance she wears and she loved it.</li>
            <li>love real Ciara cologne .....</li>
            <li>I bought 2 and will be buying more real soon</li>
            <li>Another of my favorite fragrances in a very affordable version.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume, the price is much cheaper than the stores, shipping was quick and packaged well to prevent damage, i  tested the spray bottles on both bottles that i purchased and they work well.</li>
            <li>Perfect, just as I wanted and cheaper than FragranceNet.com where I usually get it!  </li>
            <li>Great item and would recommend to other customers.</li>
            <li>but I know how great it smells on me and other people.</li>
            <li>Subtle is best with any and all colognes/perfumes.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quick.  </li>
            <li>it quickly and no problems.</li>
            <li>This is another frangance that disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>Again I love this and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Very Pretty Cologne-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been wearing this cologne for a long time, no plans to ever change, simply the best.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>This is exactly as it should be!</li>
            <li>Ciara is a delicious Old-Skool Oriental-a hyper (yes, perfumes can be that complex!)</li>
            <li>Is this a cheap knockoff or the real thing?</li>
            <li>but I have been very pleased with the fragrance along with how long the fragrance lasts.  </li>
            <li>Have worn this fragrance for years and continue to always get compliments on its&#x27; nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;Light enough for work, and also for evening.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money, it lasts forever, one spray lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>This was one of the first perfumes I ever fell in love with, so much so that I named my first born daughter after it.</li>
            <li>worth buying again.</li>
            <li>I happened to find this cologne in a department store last year and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all about finding just the right perfume that mixes well with your body chemistry.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;it was the right price too.</li>
            <li>True, it is very vanillic and spicy too, with a  hint of woodsiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received these super fast, I ordered four</li>
            <li>Buying it online at a very reasonable price is a bonus.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>I have loved this since i was a little girl..</li>
            <li>great price for a hard to find item.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews on the various strength perfumes, I decided to get the 200 strength, because someone mentioned it has the most vanilla.</li>
            <li>I have not worn it in a while, but when I tried it out it was exactly as I remembered.</li>
            <li>Absolutely 100% as advertised!  </li>
            <li>I have use it for over 20 years and still the same, I get so many compliments when I use this.</li>
            <li>Have baught the same ciara at store for much more.</li>
            <li>This is one of the moderately priced perfumes that I love.  </li>
            <li>However, it does not last more than 30 minutes on me.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Because its usually 80%.I finally found it at a wonderful price.</li>
            <li>Been using this since I was about 16 and still love it 35 years later.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li>I still love its deep earthy, musky smell.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved the scent of Ciara and usually get the 80%, use just a little as it&#x27;s very strong!</li>
            <li>Love my perfume, very femenine and scence last.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and have used Ciara for a long time.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Strange, I don&#x27;t like many Revlon products.  </li>
            <li>Good price for an everyday cologne spray!  </li>
            <li>So I have bought many other perfumes trying too find a scent I loved half as much.</li>
            <li>They smell amazing and the scent lasts a full day at least..</li>
            <li>Next time, I will go with a lower percentage, but considering how strong it is that may take a while...</li>
            <li>I used to buy it at a local store, but buying at Amazon was easy and much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is one of the best perfumes ever, but unfortunately it does not last on me at all!&lt;br /&gt;Still, well worth it for the moments of fast lived heady glory.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t understand why others say this doesn&#x27;t smell like Ciara.</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t spray much on.</li>
            <li>Compared to some others, it is quite reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Flashback to my junior high days!</li>
            <li>It just really works with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>The last time, I spritzed a light touch on my arms.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery also.</li>
            <li>Very please with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon and people like this</li>
            <li>Thanks for the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>I was very disapointed with this product.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really really like this cologne.</li>
            <li>I wonder if this is the \\&quot;real stuff\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.i saved a lot of money!</li>
            <li>5 stars for fast receipt of product and 5 stars for the quality of product.........</li>
            <li>you really want it to give.</li>
            <li>The price for this size was very affordable.  </li>
            <li>Nice long lasting, gentle fragrance, get lots of compliments!</li>
            <li>/&gt;everyday use, doesn&#x27;t stay real noticable for a long day or special occasion!</li>
            <li>Very strong when first sprayed last long...</li>
            <li>real classy!</li>
            <li>and I still have a full bottle left.  </li>
            <li>She normally buys it at another store and pays 3 times as much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an older woman perfume</li>
            <li>Next to Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s White Diamonds and Vera Wang&#x27;s Princess, I love Revlon&#x27;s Ciara.</li>
            <li>Ladies I have been wearing Ciara for many many years, so I was skeptical when I saw the price on here.</li>
            <li>A classic fragrance that will always stay with you, and get compliments as well.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for older women.</li>
            <li>Just as I remembered in high school.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this perfume.......</li>
            <li>Was surprised to find it much cheaper too.  </li>
            <li>is it that old or not the real thing?</li>
            <li>I expected it to be on the stronger side for a drugstore fragrance based on reviews, and I bought it because I enjoy scents with staying power.</li>
            <li>Going to keep it and order a new one.</li>
            <li>I feel like the perfume is a cheap imitation.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I love this fragrance and the price was a whole lot less than the local stores.</li>
            <li>Either the formula has been ruined or this is a very old bottle.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have used this Cologne for years and have paid much more for it in the past.  </li>
            <li>I even ordered 2 more bottles for what I usually pay for one bottle in the department store.  </li>
            <li>This was my favorite years ago, so when I saw the unbelievable price , I had to order it.  </li>
            <li>Instead of the cult favorite I was expecting, this just strikes me as ordinary $10 drugstore perfume.</li>
            <li>The 100 strength differs from the 80 strength in being a bit less sweet and ambery, and a little more smoky and woodsy.</li>
            <li>A little strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, it is one of the very few that my wife would wear.</li>
            <li>I actually got what I expected, can&#x27;t believe I got such a great item for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Hard to find in stores, so was pleased when I found this online.</li>
            <li>Love this product ,although sometimes hard to find ,especialy the 100% .</li>
            <li>It really irks me when people advertise things they don&#x27;t sell in order to sell you a lesser quality product.</li>
            <li>One of my old time favorites.</li>
            <li>In fact, I never spray it directly on me.</li>
            <li>Thanks, I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
            <li>I have to say, ya&#x27;ll made my 87 yr old Mom&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>, I surprised her with it....</li>
            <li>It is not a scent that I think young women of today would like.</li>
            <li>BUT MY HUSBAND COULD ONLY SMELL IT WHEN WE WERE REALLY CLOSE.  </li>
            <li>Prefer something more subtle.  </li>
            <li>This is a high end fragrance for a low end cost.</li>
            <li>My wife like it so much and she is being using it for long time.</li>
            <li>i have used Ciara for many years.it became hard to find it in our local area and the price seemed to jump up.finding it on line at this price was</li>
            <li>It is rather strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>have to be very careful to use only a little amount, because it&#x27;s very strong.....</li>
            <li>Took a little time to get to us but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Which may wind up being fine, because I am not sure I like this enough to want the scent to linger.</li>
            <li>It was a large bottle and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It was delivered very quickly..even a day sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>nice for casual stopping and after a shower</li>
            <li>Does not do the same thing in everyone apparently.</li>
            <li>Of all the expensive fragrances I have now and have purchased this Ciara is unforgettable in quality with a small price tag.</li>
            <li>I generally pay almost $30 for the same size bottle, and lesser strength.  </li>

            <li> It has been her favorite fragrance for many years.  </li>
            <li> Still my favorite perfume after all these years....</li>
            <li> I love ciara.</li>
            <li> This costs so much more in retail stores</li>
            <li> I am glad I checked it out on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife and I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Ciara has been around for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a scent that everyone would like, but if you do, you will love it.</li>
            <li> love the scent.</li>
            <li> and they love it too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent, along with 2 others, for years and have received many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite</li>
            <li> Always satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the perfume and the Price.</li>
            <li> they both love it....</li>
            <li> I love it when she wears this.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Used it for years and get more compliments and everyone thinks it is pricey.</li>
            <li> I have not used this fragrance in many years and I am glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Has a very warm rounded scent and you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li> I ordered several bottles and am very glad I did because of the great savings.  </li>
            <li> Great price for a classic perfume.  </li>
            <li> My mother has worn this for as long as I can remember and this is the best deal for it.</li>
            <li> i was so pleased that I could fine this product for he from my favorite site.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in plenty of time and she was happy to have a new bottle of Ciara.  </li>
            <li> so I was happy to get a new bottle.</li>
            <li> It is no longer available at most retail stores</li>
            <li> It does not have an overwhelming scent, au contraire (to the contrary), it has a very mild and smooth scent.  </li>
            <li> Is it that strong?..</li>
            <li> My husband is the one that chose it for me as he does not like strong perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a STRONG fragrance</li>
            <li> Its strong so you don&#x27;t need to load it</li>
            <li> Really strong overpowering smell, I gave this away.</li>
            <li> It was a good buy &amp; high quality.  </li>
            <li> Very good product I used to wear Ciara long time ago</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sweet and sexy</li>
            <li> Love the clean light smell.</li>
            <li> Love, Love this sent, very fast shipping</li>
            <li> The arrival was quick and I love Ciara</li>
            <li> THE GREAT highly recommend, safe and fast delivery</li>
            <li> but do not hold strong scent as original.</li>
            <li> I read great reviews about it, but the only person I think would like it is an elderly woman.</li>
            <li> light floral scent for all ages of women</li>
            <li> I enjoy this fragrance</li>
            <li> Ciara is a beautiful scent that&#x27;s been around a long time.  </li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, received fast and such a great price</li>
            <li> but I love it so much!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite perfume...and not expensive.</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, because I honestly thought it would be a cheap knockoff.  </li>
            <li> My favorite and only kind I can wear.  </li>
            <li> .......smells just great on her and lasts a real long time......</li>
            <li> This is an old favorite of mine from the 90&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> rich with resinous, sweet, smoky incense notes.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to see this on Amazon at such a good price and the item is the exact same as what I had been buying at the store.</li>
            <li> Good product and low cost.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my friend; it&#x27;s the only fragrance she wears and she loved it.</li>
            <li> love real Ciara cologne .....</li>
            <li> I bought 2 and will be buying more real soon</li>
            <li> Another of my favorite fragrances in a very affordable version.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, the price is much cheaper than the stores, shipping was quick and packaged well to prevent damage, i  tested the spray bottles on both bottles that i purchased and they work well.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just as I wanted and cheaper than FragranceNet.com where I usually get it!  </li>
            <li> Great item and would recommend to other customers.</li>
            <li> but I know how great it smells on me and other people.</li>
            <li> Subtle is best with any and all colognes/perfumes.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quick.  </li>
            <li> it quickly and no problems.</li>
            <li> This is another frangance that disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> Again I love this and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very Pretty Cologne-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been wearing this cologne for a long time, no plans to ever change, simply the best.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly as it should be!</li>
            <li> Ciara is a delicious Old-Skool Oriental-a hyper (yes, perfumes can be that complex!)</li>
            <li> Is this a cheap knockoff or the real thing?</li>
            <li> but I have been very pleased with the fragrance along with how long the fragrance lasts.  </li>
            <li> Have worn this fragrance for years and continue to always get compliments on its&#x27; nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;Light enough for work, and also for evening.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money, it lasts forever, one spray lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> This was one of the first perfumes I ever fell in love with, so much so that I named my first born daughter after it.</li>
            <li> worth buying again.</li>
            <li> I happened to find this cologne in a department store last year and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about finding just the right perfume that mixes well with your body chemistry.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;it was the right price too.</li>
            <li> True, it is very vanillic and spicy too, with a  hint of woodsiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received these super fast, I ordered four</li>
            <li> Buying it online at a very reasonable price is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I have loved this since i was a little girl..</li>
            <li> great price for a hard to find item.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on the various strength perfumes, I decided to get the 200 strength, because someone mentioned it has the most vanilla.</li>
            <li> I have not worn it in a while, but when I tried it out it was exactly as I remembered.</li>
            <li> Absolutely 100% as advertised!  </li>
            <li> I have use it for over 20 years and still the same, I get so many compliments when I use this.</li>
            <li> Have baught the same ciara at store for much more.</li>
            <li> This is one of the moderately priced perfumes that I love.  </li>
            <li> However, it does not last more than 30 minutes on me.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Because its usually 80%.I finally found it at a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> Been using this since I was about 16 and still love it 35 years later.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li> I still love its deep earthy, musky smell.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved the scent of Ciara and usually get the 80%, use just a little as it&#x27;s very strong!</li>
            <li> Love my perfume, very femenine and scence last.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and have used Ciara for a long time.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Strange, I don&#x27;t like many Revlon products.  </li>
            <li> Good price for an everyday cologne spray!  </li>
            <li> So I have bought many other perfumes trying too find a scent I loved half as much.</li>
            <li> They smell amazing and the scent lasts a full day at least..</li>
            <li> Next time, I will go with a lower percentage, but considering how strong it is that may take a while...</li>
            <li> I used to buy it at a local store, but buying at Amazon was easy and much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is one of the best perfumes ever, but unfortunately it does not last on me at all!&lt;br /&gt;Still, well worth it for the moments of fast lived heady glory.</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t understand why others say this doesn&#x27;t smell like Ciara.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t spray much on.</li>
            <li> Compared to some others, it is quite reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Flashback to my junior high days!</li>
            <li> It just really works with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> The last time, I spritzed a light touch on my arms.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery also.</li>
            <li> Very please with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon and people like this</li>
            <li> Thanks for the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I was very disapointed with this product.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I really really like this cologne.</li>
            <li> I wonder if this is the \\&quot;real stuff\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.i saved a lot of money!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for fast receipt of product and 5 stars for the quality of product.........</li>
            <li> you really want it to give.</li>
            <li> The price for this size was very affordable.  </li>
            <li> Nice long lasting, gentle fragrance, get lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> /&gt;everyday use, doesn&#x27;t stay real noticable for a long day or special occasion!</li>
            <li> Very strong when first sprayed last long...</li>
            <li> real classy!</li>
            <li> and I still have a full bottle left.  </li>
            <li> She normally buys it at another store and pays 3 times as much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an older woman perfume</li>
            <li> Next to Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s White Diamonds and Vera Wang&#x27;s Princess, I love Revlon&#x27;s Ciara.</li>
            <li> Ladies I have been wearing Ciara for many many years, so I was skeptical when I saw the price on here.</li>
            <li> A classic fragrance that will always stay with you, and get compliments as well.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for older women.</li>
            <li> Just as I remembered in high school.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this perfume.......</li>
            <li> Was surprised to find it much cheaper too.  </li>
            <li> is it that old or not the real thing?</li>
            <li> I expected it to be on the stronger side for a drugstore fragrance based on reviews, and I bought it because I enjoy scents with staying power.</li>
            <li> Going to keep it and order a new one.</li>
            <li> I feel like the perfume is a cheap imitation.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I love this fragrance and the price was a whole lot less than the local stores.</li>
            <li> Either the formula has been ruined or this is a very old bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have used this Cologne for years and have paid much more for it in the past.  </li>
            <li> I even ordered 2 more bottles for what I usually pay for one bottle in the department store.  </li>
            <li> This was my favorite years ago, so when I saw the unbelievable price , I had to order it.  </li>
            <li> Instead of the cult favorite I was expecting, this just strikes me as ordinary $10 drugstore perfume.</li>
            <li> The 100 strength differs from the 80 strength in being a bit less sweet and ambery, and a little more smoky and woodsy.</li>
            <li> A little strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, it is one of the very few that my wife would wear.</li>
            <li> I actually got what I expected, can&#x27;t believe I got such a great item for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, so was pleased when I found this online.</li>
            <li> Love this product ,although sometimes hard to find ,especialy the 100% .</li>
            <li> It really irks me when people advertise things they don&#x27;t sell in order to sell you a lesser quality product.</li>
            <li> One of my old time favorites.</li>
            <li> In fact, I never spray it directly on me.</li>
            <li> Thanks, I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
            <li> I have to say, ya&#x27;ll made my 87 yr old Mom&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li> , I surprised her with it....</li>
            <li> It is not a scent that I think young women of today would like.</li>
            <li> BUT MY HUSBAND COULD ONLY SMELL IT WHEN WE WERE REALLY CLOSE.  </li>
            <li> Prefer something more subtle.  </li>
            <li> This is a high end fragrance for a low end cost.</li>
            <li> My wife like it so much and she is being using it for long time.</li>
            <li> i have used Ciara for many years.it became hard to find it in our local area and the price seemed to jump up.finding it on line at this price was</li>
            <li> It is rather strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have to be very careful to use only a little amount, because it&#x27;s very strong.....</li>
            <li> Took a little time to get to us but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Which may wind up being fine, because I am not sure I like this enough to want the scent to linger.</li>
            <li> It was a large bottle and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It was delivered very quickly..even a day sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> nice for casual stopping and after a shower</li>
            <li> Does not do the same thing in everyone apparently.</li>
            <li> Of all the expensive fragrances I have now and have purchased this Ciara is unforgettable in quality with a small price tag.</li>
            <li> I generally pay almost $30 for the same size bottle, and lesser strength.  </li>
            <li> A little sprits goes a long way as too much is overpowering and does not give the aura</li>
            <li> It smelt old, Not fresh like it use to.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for quite a long time and is one of the only perfumes that she can use.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Long lasting even though you yourself can no longer smell it - you&#x27;ve just adapted to it</li>
            <li> Anything less seems to die out early in the day.</li>
            <li> It is way too strong and almost stinky, stale smelling...</li>
            <li> This scent lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Had not purchased this fragrance for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can spray this cologne and it stays on for a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a very long time, and get lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical in buying this on line, but it came just as it would from buying it in the store, the fragrance was pure!!!</li>
            <li> This certainly is NOT Ciara.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this from other reviews</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve heeded the other reviewers; it can&#x27;t be returned for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and south cheaper than in store!</li>
            <li> The bottle of Ciara I received is nothing like other bottles of Ciara I have purchased.</li>
            <li> This smelled like rubbing alcohol and is obviously way past the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> afford.&lt;br /&gt;Perferred over the other, has smell you won&#x27;t foget.</li>
            <li> something he&#x27;s never said about any other scent, Not even the ones he bought for me.</li>
            <li> Other perfumes give me a headache</li>
            <li> I would like to send me to my email as contact you when shopping for other items,&lt;br /&gt;Josmary Gonzalez Padilla.</li>
            <li> I bought this blind based on positive reviews here and elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Not real strong in fragrance which is what I like.  </li>
            <li> this is a product i have a hard time find locally, so was suprised when i found it here.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buy it from a store where you can return it if it&#x27;s turned sour.</li>
            <li> ALL PERFUMES ARE GETTING WATERD DOWN</li>
            <li> Just like you buy from the fancy store, but at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Also, the price I paid for this spray is about half of what it sells for in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I got this for like $8 a bottle and $2 shipping-bought 2 bottles for less that $20.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the negative reviewers actually know what Ciara smells like....</li>
            <li> TOTALLY WATERD DOWN NOW!!!!  </li>
            <li> When it has a few minutes to mingle with your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few that I always get a compliment on when wearing it.  </li>
            <li> Is not really a light scent.</li>
            <li> I did not find it any different from my previous Ciara perfume which was ore expensive.</li>
            <li> Women also comment on it, but they usually ask for the name of the perfume.  </li>
            <li> I waited anxiously for the cologne to arrive.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy this for my wife at Christmas time.</li>
            <li> I usually get the 100 or 200 strength.  </li>
            <li> but people around you can pick up its allure as you walk past.</li>
            <li> It smelled so strong and awful that it gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> Ciara is hard to beat for the price.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it can be hard to find in stores, so buying online is easier.</li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> Cheap quality and smells horrible.</li>
            <li> No more over priced department store for me!</li>
            <li> like an old lady&#x27;s perfume that has gone bad!  </li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> SO BAD THAT ITS NOT WORTH SPENDING YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> We detect fake Ciara.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not a fragrance for the shy.</li>
            <li> and my hubby went crazy.</li>
            <li> Well I have no printer and getting to a post office is very difficult for me.</li>
            <li> Easier just to keep the stuff and write it off as a bad mistake.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thus product smells terrible! I read great reviews about it, but the only person I think would like it is an elderly woman. My parents and I were all around when I received it and we all agreed it smelled like a nursing home.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this and it is her favorite.  Gets a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I love the cologne. Wish they would bring back the lotion that was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent and as described and got to me on time.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li> This was a great Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my mom and I was so happy to be able to order online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ciara for years as my signature fragrance. I&lt;br /&gt;do switch now and again, to insure that I won&#x27;t grow&lt;br /&gt;tired of it.</li>
            <li> I been using ciara for many years. Love the clean light smell. Best in world</li>
            <li> I have always loved the scent of Ciara and usually get the 80%, use just a little as it&#x27;s very strong!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Seller and price were both great.</li>
            <li> Love this and really a great buy.  Hard to find in stores, so was pleased when I found this online.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites.  Hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ciara perfume for years and do not wish to ever change it.  It does not have an overwhelming scent, au contraire (to the contrary), it has a very mild and smooth scent.  I have been amazed by men, that I have never met, identifying my perfume by just passing by me.  They actually say \\&quot;Ciara?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;My reaction is always:  How did you know?  Is it that strong?.. and the answer is always the same:  Oh! no.. I love it, that is why I recognize it.  Women also comment on it, but they usually ask for the name of the perfume.  My husband is the one that chose it for me as he does not like strong perfume.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Love it!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with my product.  I can only wear the strongest strength, which I ordered. However, I do not feel it is the strongest, like advertised because after maybe 15 minutes the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel good, others notice this perfume and want to know what you are wearing, even the guys.  Thanks. Marion</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this from other reviews but I have been very pleased with the fragrance along with how long the fragrance lasts.  It was packaged well and received before anticipated. I will order again.</li>
            <li> great perfume very durable! I use it every day when I go out in the morning to work and when I come back my clothes has still the smell in it!.</li>
            <li> I have used this Cologne for years and have paid much more for it in the past.  I was so happy to see this on Amazon at such a good price and the item is the exact same as what I had been buying at the store.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on the various strength perfumes, I decided to get the 200 strength, because someone mentioned it has the most vanilla. True, it is very vanillic and spicy too, with a  hint of woodsiness.&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the best perfumes ever, but unfortunately it does not last on me at all!&lt;br /&gt;Still, well worth it for the moments of fast lived heady glory.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just as I wanted and cheaper than FragranceNet.com where I usually get it!  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love it when my wife wears Ciara. Brings back a lot of memories. This is about a third the cost of anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t understand why others say this doesn&#x27;t smell like Ciara. I believe it&#x27;s the real thing. I&#x27;m not sure the negative reviewers actually know what Ciara smells like....</li>
            <li> Good product and low cost.</li>
            <li> I love Ciara and what a great price</li>
            <li> Cologne recieved was 80% not 100%as advertised. I bought 5 bottles simply because I cannot get out and shop and since I use it on a daily basis, I would not have to look for it online for a while. Recieved the 80% and contacted seller to ask for the 100% I had paid for. I was then informed that they don&#x27;t sell the 100%. They then sent me an e-mail label to return the product. Well I have no printer and getting to a post office is very difficult for me. Hence I shop on-line. Easier just to keep the stuff and write it off as a bad mistake. It really irks me when people advertise things they don&#x27;t sell in order to sell you a lesser quality product. I think I will stick to E-bay from here on out.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product that I&#x27;ve used many times.</li>
            <li> Good price but do not hold strong scent as original.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister and she said \\&quot;that&#x27;s what I wanted.\\&quot;  She was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Have worn this fragrance for years and continue to always get compliments on its&#x27; nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;Light enough for work, and also for evening.</li>
            <li> Perfect product.  Smells so good.  Di have not received this pkg. I cannot find a way to contact you.  on&#x27;t hesitate...</li>
            <li> I have soooooo many people ask me, &amp;#34;is that Ciara you are wearing?&amp;#34; I love this perfume!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my moms fav. She is happy I got it. She loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Went to buy in store but could not locate local.</li>
            <li> Love it, great deal all around!</li>
            <li> I got my product and I love it. This has been a favorite of mine for years. I was a little skeptical in buying this on line, but it came just as it would from buying it in the store, the fragrance was pure!!! I will purchase this again</li>
            <li> I love this! This is an old favorite of mine from the 90&#x27;s! So happy to see it available thru Amazon!!</li>
            <li> My favorite at a very good price</li>
            <li> Bought this for my friend; it&#x27;s the only fragrance she wears and she loved it.</li>
            <li> One of my old time favorites. Always liked the 100% more than the 80%. Good deal, too.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY WATERD DOWN NOW!!!!  ALL PERFUMES ARE GETTING WATERD DOWN SO BAD THAT ITS NOT WORTH SPENDING YOUR MONEY ANY LONGER ON IT.  I WILL NEVER BUY PERFUME AGAIN.  ITS ALL REALLY REALLY BAD AND NOT JUST ONE BRAND EITHER!!!!</li>
            <li> It smelt old, Not fresh like it use to.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume... It&#x27;s an older woman perfume but I like.. Very strong when first sprayed last long... Love the name</li>
            <li> This cologne is just the best and if it works for you it can become your &#x27;signature&#x27;.  It has for me!!  If you have not tried it, I recommend that you do.  It is just awesome!! I used to buy it at a local store, but buying at Amazon was easy and much cheaper.  I just love Amazon too!!</li>
            <li> Love this scent, have worn it for40years!</li>
            <li> I have LOVED this fragrance for years. I have not worn it in a while, but when I tried it out it was exactly as I remembered. It was a large bottle and will last a long time. The price is great! This is a STRONG fragrance and I don&#x27;t spray much on. In fact, I never spray it directly on me. I kind of spray it up in the air and walk into it..I get a lot of compliments on this perfume. Next time, I will go with a lower percentage, but considering how strong it is that may take a while...</li>
            <li> Love my perfume, very femenine and scence last.</li>
            <li> happy to  have  this  produc</li>
            <li> Great item and would recommend to other customers. Price was perfect and very pleased with my purchase. Will definately order this item again.</li>
            <li> My wife has been wearing this fragrance for 2 decades. The bottle we got from Amazon doesn&#x27;t even come close to smelling like the one she is accustomed to. We detect fake Ciara. The downside is, we cannot return it either as Amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns on perfumes. Don&#x27;t take the risk, buy from a physical store. This certainly is NOT Ciara. It stinks!</li>
            <li> My mother has worn this for as long as I can remember and this is the best deal for it.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve loved Ciara.  Its fragrance lasts without being overpowering.  Compared to some others, it is quite reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this all the time when I younger.  Glad I found it at a bargain on Amazon.  It still smells great!</li>
            <li> Next to Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s White Diamonds and Vera Wang&#x27;s Princess, I love Revlon&#x27;s Ciara.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I wore it when I was younger</li>
            <li> Ladies I have been wearing Ciara for many many years, so I was skeptical when I saw the price on here. Is this a cheap knockoff or the real thing? Well let me tell you, this is definitely the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;.  I was pleasantly surprised, because I honestly thought it would be a cheap knockoff.  No more over priced department store for me! I even ordered 2 more bottles for what I usually pay for one bottle in the department store.  I am a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> This is a high end fragrance for a low end cost. Of all the expensive fragrances I have now and have purchased this Ciara is unforgettable in quality with a small price tag. It lasts on your clothes even after you wash them. Outstanding fragrance.</li>
            <li> Flashback to my junior high days!</li>
            <li> My number one fragrance!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume at the perfect price. I was amazed at the speed of the company and I know I will always buy my perfumes from Amazon. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is my long-time favorite perfume.  It&#x27;s not inexpensive, but getting it through Amazon is UNBEATABLE in price.  Ciara&#x27;s Ciara... the quality of it isn&#x27;t going to change from vendor to vendor.  It&#x27;s a nice scent, and either you like it or you don&#x27;t, or it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; on you or it doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a very long time, and get lots of compliments.  I wear it even if I&#x27;m home alone!  I&#x27;ll never buy it anywhere else, though, that&#x27;s for sure... this price is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Ciara for many years and it never fails to get compliments and comments about what I am wearing and how wonderful it smells.  It just really works with my body chemistry.  Does not do the same thing in everyone apparently.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Ciara all the time.  I waited anxiously for the cologne to arrive.  Either the formula has been ruined or this is a very old bottle.  It smells terrible.  I tried it three different times.  The last time, I spritzed a light touch on my arms.  It smelled so strong and awful that it gave me a headache.  I washed it off when I got home.  I wish I would&#x27;ve heeded the other reviewers; it can&#x27;t be returned for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.  Buy it from a store where you can return it if it&#x27;s turned sour.</li>
            <li> Was wooed by the great reviews, but it basically smells cheap!</li>
            <li> enjoyed using this again after 30 years&lt;br /&gt;very nice for casual stopping and after a shower</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE AND PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely 100% as advertised!  Product was as if it were off the shelf and arrived well packaged and as promised.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My favorite love.love.love.</li>
            <li> My Mom has worn this scent for years and requested it for her Birthday.  It arrived in plenty of time and she was happy to have a new bottle of Ciara.  Ciara is hard to beat for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells great-- good cologne for every day wear--I always get compliments when I wear it&lt;br /&gt;Good light floral scent for all ages of women</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for years.  I get compliments every time I wear it.  Just sorry they don&#x27;t make the 200 strength, but this is better than the 80 strength.</li>
            <li> I love it! When it has a few minutes to mingle with your skin. It gives a spicy powdery romantic scent. Ive recieved many compliments!</li>
            <li> I feel like the perfume is a cheap imitation.  I don&#x27;t think it smells as good as wbat I had</li>
            <li> I liked this about 30 years ago and thought I would try it again!  It is way too strong and almost stinky, stale smelling...like an old lady&#x27;s perfume that has gone bad!  I&#x27;m giving it to a thrift store and maybe someone else will like it!</li>
            <li> This was my favorite years ago, so when I saw the unbelievable price , I had to order it.  It arrived on time and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The scent is great and longlasting.</li>
            <li> i wore this fragrance years ago and just happened to see it on Amazon and I&#x27;m so glad I did because I still like the fragrance and loved the price.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and south cheaper than in store!</li>
            <li> Never used I think my wife will love it, its color and name are hot and seductive with great expectation&#x27;m opening it recommend the French brand guarantees its lasividade.</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance I wear so I was happy to get a new bottle. The price was much better than I can get it for in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is my wifes favorite perfume...she gets compliments on the scent a lot of the time.....&lt;br /&gt;A great value----</li>
            <li> Have been wearing this cologne for a long time, no plans to ever change, simply the best. Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> best price on perfume around. I get what I love and save money</li>
            <li> THE GREAT highly recommend, safe and fast delivery</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this fragrance and the price was a whole lot less than the local stores. Plus, I have to take care of my Princess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over one year now and I still have a full bottle left.  This product is worth the money, it lasts forever, one spray lasts all day.  Love it, love ti!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy w/my purchase.  It&#x27;s nice having a place to shop where I can get what I want.  Thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great value and smells wonderful as expected.  Fast delivery also.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Ciara cologne for years.  This was just the best price I had run across.  My husband tells me it makes me smell like candy.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume.  It&#x27;s one of the few that I always get a compliment on when wearing it.  I was so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wish they made 200percent</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, its my favorite!</li>
            <li> Still love this fragrance after so many years!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my wife. It&#x27;s brand name and a really good buy. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very Pretty Cologne-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my &amp;#34;Favorite&amp;#34; Cologne.  I have worn this Cologne for years and I have just very happy that they have not discontinued it.  Very please with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;F.E. Manuel</li>
            <li> Just as I remembered in high school.  This scent lasts a long time.  Shipping was really fast.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I received these super fast, I ordered four They smell amazing and the scent lasts a full day at least..</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and have used Ciara for a long time. I did not find it any different from my previous Ciara perfume which was ore expensive. Maybe my sense of smell has altered but I find this perfume so lovely and at a great price too. I have received lots of compliments on my Ciara perfume</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, received fast and such a great price</li>
            <li> This is my favorite spray.</li>
            <li> I love it I should have ordered more</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying this item from another online seller at the best possible price but I was wrong. You blew them away! Thanks, I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
            <li> It was a thank you gift for my niece. She just loves it.</li>
            <li> Been using this cologne for years and still love it.</li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite perfume!  I load it on so I go through a lot!  Its strong so you don&#x27;t need to load it but I love it so much!</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorites for years.  Not real strong in fragrance which is what I like.  thanks</li>
            <li> This smells like straight up baby powder and dead lavender.</li>
            <li> Best buy ever.  I generally pay almost $30 for the same size bottle, and lesser strength.  Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Have worn this fragrance for years and still love it.</li>
            <li> The bottle of Ciara I received is nothing like other bottles of Ciara I have purchased. This smelled like rubbing alcohol and is obviously way past the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;I love real Ciara cologne ..... but this is not it.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite perfume...and not expensive.</li>
            <li> Nice long lasting, gentle fragrance, get lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  I was hoping it was as I remember the smell being and I was not disappointed.  It is so nice to know I can order it online and be totally satisfied.  It was delivered very quickly..even a day sooner than expected.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> Just love this cologne. I have use it for over 20 years and still the same, I get so many compliments when I use this.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume.  Excellent condition.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, the price is much cheaper than the stores, shipping was quick and packaged well to prevent damage, i  tested the spray bottles on both bottles that i purchased and they work well. I would purchase again from  this vendor.</li>
            <li> Love, Love this sent, very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Love the smell very good</li>
            <li> A classic fragrance that will always stay with you, and get compliments as well.</li>
            <li> Have baught the same ciara at store for much more. Same bottle same smell. This seller is just getting it to you at a lower cost. Thanks to Amazon and people like this the big corporations just did not get there share.. LOL</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for over 35 years and will until I did. This is exactly as it should be! The price was fantastic! I bought 2 and will be buying more real soon</li>
            <li> Outstanding for quality and value.</li>
            <li> Have been wearing this for years and get many compliments from people.</li>
            <li> Great price for a classic perfume.  Just like you buy from the fancy store, but at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about finding just the right perfume that mixes well with your body chemistry.....Ciara 100% by Revlon does that excellently!</li>
            <li> My wife like it so much and she is being using it for long time. This is the preferred one between some others</li>
            <li> Great price for my favorite perfume.</li>

            <li> I like this scent. good for evening wear.</li>
            <li> Good as always, like the price</li>

            <li> Had not purchased this fragrance for a long time. I still love it. It is rather strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this is a perfume i have used for along time glad i found it here because its cheaper and i will be ordering it again love this stuff</li>

            <li> Smells good repeat buyer</li>

            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!! The smell is heavenly and i get a lot of compliments when i wear it. I have finally found a fragrance that suits me.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. Going to keep it and order a new one.</li>
            <li> This is what I wanted ----- at a good price -- and timely delivery --I am happy I thought to search Amazon for it</li>
            <li> This was one of the first perfumes I ever fell in love with, so much so that I named my first born daughter after it. I couldn&#x27;t find it for years. So I have bought many other perfumes trying too find a scent I loved half as much. I found Ahmad ordered this and my hubby went crazy. Instantly commented how intoxicating it was. something he&#x27;s never said about any other scent, Not even the ones he bought for me. Thanks for the speedy delivery. Great Quality merchandise.I actually got what I expected, can&#x27;t believe I got such a great item for such a low price. I will definitely buy from you again.</li>
            <li> My wife was elated when I gave her a bottle of this perfume at Christmas time.  It has been her favorite fragrance for many years.  It is no longer available at most retail stores so I was happy to find it here on Amazon.com.  In fact I bought two bottles so I can surprise her again on her birthday which is coming up soon.  Seems to be the same fragrance I used to buy at the retail store.  Was surprised to find it much cheaper too.  Thankyou Amazon!</li>
            <li> Still my favorite perfume after all these years....great price for a hard to find item.</li>
            <li> Ciara is a delicious Old-Skool Oriental-a hyper (yes, perfumes can be that complex!) rich with resinous, sweet, smoky incense notes. it&#x27;s one of the best things to come out of the &#x27;70s. Raspberry, opoponax, myrrh... A lot going on here, and it&#x27;s not a fragrance for the shy. Similar to Nag Champa incense. The 100 strength differs from the 80 strength in being a bit less sweet and ambery, and a little more smoky and woodsy. Regal, spicy and warm, and smells like it should cost $299 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this for my wife at Christmas time. This year she received several bottles of Ciara for about the same price for what I was used to paying. Happy! Happy! Happy!</li>
            <li> I love ciara. i have used it for years. I put it on and i cannot smell it again, but i get so many people saying how good it smells on me. I was very disapointed with this product. it does not smell. is it that old or not the real thing? i know that i only paid the shipping because i had a gift card but i thought that i would get people saying how good it smelled, but i have gotten no one to say anything about my cologne. please email me and let me know the answer. thanks lindaadams_60@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> My favorite and only kind I can wear.  Other perfumes give me a headache</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the speed in which i received this product.  I thought it was the 80 strength but it was actually the 100.</li>
            <li> 100% Ciara-such a great value. This costs so much more in retail stores I am glad I checked it out on Amazon. It was a Christmas present and it was a big hit.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for quite a long time and is one of the only perfumes that she can use.</li>
            <li> good prices, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Only Cologne I am not allergic to</li>
            <li> Have used Ciara for years.  This is a good buy.</li>
            <li> My wife and I absolutely love this stuff. Stays with you and the bottle is good size. Took a little time to get to us but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother. She is 68. She loves this scent and has been wearing it for over 40 years. I recommend it for older women. It is not a scent that I think young women of today would like.</li>
            <li> This is one of the moderately priced perfumes that I love.  Sometimes it can be hard to find in stores, so buying online is easier.</li>
            <li> I happened to find this cologne in a department store last year and liked it very much.  I was very surprised to find it on Amazon.  I ordered several bottles and am very glad I did because of the great savings.  I really really like this cologne.</li>
            <li> this is a product i have a hard time find locally, so was suprised when i found it here.&lt;br /&gt;it was the right price too.</li>
            <li> I HAVE WORN THIS SCENT IN IT&#x27;S COLONE FORM, FOR FOR YEARS AND CONSIDER IT MY SIGNITURE SCENT.  MY FRIENDS WOULD COMMENT ON IT BUT MY HUSBAND COULD ONLY SMELL IT WHEN WE WERE REALLY CLOSE.  THIS STRENGTH BRINGS HIM CLOSE!</li>
            <li> Ciara is my signature cologne.  I used to wear the splash which seemed to be stronger than this spray cologne.  Can&#x27;t find the splash anywhere. Also, the price I paid for this spray is about half of what it sells for in the stores.  I wonder if this is the \\&quot;real stuff\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> The arrival was quick and I love Ciara it was great! And the packaging was great. I&#x27;m happy love it</li>
            <li> Great service, love the scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent Value. Speedy Delivery. Excellent Packing. Wife loved it.</li>
            <li> Great purchase! Thank you!</li>
            <li> given as a gift, a fragrance I&#x27;ve always liked</li>
            <li> My mim&#x27;s favorite scent!</li>
            <li> Great cologne, I always receive complements when wearing.  It is long lasting but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I bought this blind based on positive reviews here and elsewhere. I expected it to be on the stronger side for a drugstore fragrance based on reviews, and I bought it because I enjoy scents with staying power. Couldn&#x27;t wait to try it when it arrived yesterday. However, it does not last more than 30 minutes on me. Which may wind up being fine, because I am not sure I like this enough to want the scent to linger. Instead of the cult favorite I was expecting, this just strikes me as ordinary $10 drugstore perfume.</li>
            <li> Ciara has been around for many years. I&#x27;m glad !&lt;br /&gt;You smell great is a wonderful compliment.</li>
            <li> i have used Ciara for many years.it became hard to find it in our local area and the price seemed to jump up.finding it on line at this price was a wonder.i will return to purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Ciara is the best perfume with staying power to boot. I would suggest this product for anyone of any age.  It has smelled good on everyone that I know that owns a bottle. I will continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom for a Christmas present. I got this for like $8 a bottle and $2 shipping-bought 2 bottles for less that $20. My Mom had me open them up and sprayed it on herself. She was delighted to get her favorite cologne--100% strength Ciara by Revlon. This is the real stuff. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Ciara for over 20 years and this was a great value for my money. worth buying again.</li>
            <li> Ciara is a beautiful scent that&#x27;s been around a long time.  Kind of a heavier scent that lasts all day.  I personally would recommend it for evening use.  Has a very warm rounded scent and you don&#x27;t need much.  It&#x27;s not a scent that everyone would like, but if you do, you will love it.</li>
            <li> A little strong for my taste. Prefer something more subtle.  Defintely not what I remember from years ago.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite cologne, arrived as stated and in perfect condition</li>
            <li> love the scent. always have and always will. it&#x27;s sweet and sexy all rolled up into one bottle. thanks. buy it now.</li>
            <li> even men notice it and some even know the name and they love it too. I have been buying it for years and will continue to</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent, along with 2 others, for years and have received many compliments on it.  It comes in different strengths.  I usually get the 100 or 200 strength.  Anything less seems to die out early in the day.</li>
            <li> Order this cologne as a gift for one of my sisters and she is very happy with it.  Will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Just as ordered and a great price</li>
            <li> Best pricing ever!  Thank you!  My favorite, now I give as a gift.  Timely delivery. Always satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good price for an everyday cologne spray!  It&#x27;s nice and fragrant and I would recommend it for&lt;br /&gt;everyday use, doesn&#x27;t stay real noticable for a long day or special occasion!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for my wife who loves it&#x27;s scent. Price is great to.</li>
            <li> Love this product ,although sometimes hard to find ,especialy the 100% . Because its usually 80%.I finally found it at a wonderful price.Thanx.</li>
            <li> Ciara has been one of my favorites for years. Buying it online at a very reasonable price is a bonus. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It arrived quick.  It was a good buy &amp; high quality.  I would recommend this product to any of my friend.</li>
            <li> Actually a friend of mine has a preference for this fragrance. So was a gift for her. She has been wearing this for years and it always smells so good on her. Is not really a light scent.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume and a great price .received it quickly and no problems. Would highly recommend it.i saved a lot of money!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much! I love the perfume and the Price. It came right on time!!!!</li>
            <li> Best smelling perfume ever for me.......got some for my wife and another girl....they both love it....my wife now will only wear this.......smells just great on her and lasts a real long time......have to be very careful to use only a little amount, because it&#x27;s very strong.....I highly recommend this perfume.......real classy!</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO GRACIAS AMAZON</li>
            <li> Love this product and this was a great price</li>
            <li> 5 stars for fast receipt of product and 5 stars for the quality of product.........this is what my wife wears the most and has a very attractive scent to it........I love it when she wears this.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells amazing. Came in a timely manner. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Been using this since I was about 16 and still love it 35 years later. Yes it&#x27;s been around that long.&lt;br /&gt; I know it&#x27;s not expensive but I know how great it smells on me and other people.</li>
            <li> Used it for years and get more compliments and everyone thinks it is pricey.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, it is one of the very few that my wife would wear. I lost my wife last year but still have some of this cologne left so I spray it every so often just as a reminder of my wife. Again I love this and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite forever!  Hard to find</li>
            <li> This is another frangance that disappears quickly.  I will order another bottle, maybe in a larger size.  I have not used this fragrance in many years and I am glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Scent has changed over the years - or my nose with age!  I still love its deep earthy, musky smell.  A little sprits goes a long way as too much is overpowering and does not give the aura you really want it to give. Subtle is best with any and all colognes/perfumes.  Long lasting even though you yourself can no longer smell it - you&#x27;ve just adapted to it but people around you can pick up its allure as you walk past.</li>
            <li> Strange, I don&#x27;t like many Revlon products.  This one just works for me.  I am allergic to most.</li>
            <li> Really strong overpowering smell, I gave this away.</li>
            <li> A gift for my secretary, she this scent.</li>
            <li> thank you very much&#x27;m very happy with my purchase I am getting right now, everything perfect. I would like to send me to my email as contact you when shopping for other items,&lt;br /&gt;Josmary Gonzalez Padilla. venezuela&lt;br /&gt;jgp350@hotmail.com</li>

            <li> I have loved this since i was a little girl..</li>
            <li> I gave this as gift to one of my best friends.  She normally buys it at another store and pays 3 times as much.  i was so pleased that I could fine this product for he from my favorite site.  Great aroma!</li>
            <li> Another of my favorite fragrances in a very affordable version.  The price for this size was very affordable.  I will refer friends and famly to buy similar products from the Amazon site.  Shipping and delivery were excellent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent. I ordered the 100 % and thats what I got. I would recommend this product and seller to my friends and family.</li>
