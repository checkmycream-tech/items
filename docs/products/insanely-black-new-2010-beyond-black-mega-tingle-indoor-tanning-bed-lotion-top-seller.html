            <li>Once I showered, my skin felt better and I noticed more color.  </li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Will not be using again, but may be okay for tingle fanatics.</li>
            <li>Yes I&#x27;m sure this has help tan my legs.</li>

            <li>Really give you great color..</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this</li>
            <li>I tan about three times a week, and I love the tingle factor on this product.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this</li>
            <li>It no doubt creates color, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rub it in evenly...</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It is the best tanning lotion I have ever used - I instantly see results.  </li>
            <li>The lotion does have a tingle effect which was ok</li>
            <li>but I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>I personally am happy with this product and knew that this had a high tingle level.</li>
            <li>This is a really good lotion if u like hot with tingle</li>
            <li>So excited about this tanning lotion!  </li>
            <li>This tanning lotion is good and it work decent</li>
            <li>Such an amazing lotion, smells good and the tingle makes it so worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>This is a good product &amp; makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>I sucked up the feeling an used it about 3 more times after my first usage</li>
            <li>Came quickly and works fine</li>
            <li>My legs turned bright red &amp; started to swell.  </li>
            <li>It should be called &amp;#34;Insanely Burn&amp;#34; I looked and felt like I was on fire all day even after a cool shower.</li>
            <li>I put the lotion on before driving to the salon because i wanted to make sure to wash my hands really well.  </li>
            <li>The bronzers in it get you tan quick and don&#x27;t leave any streaks unless you just don&#x27;t pay attention.</li>
            <li>Having used this product for indoor tanning, I found that my skin took on an orange hue which everyone was quick to notice and point out.  </li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t want a hot lotion don&#x27;t buy this product, but if you want a high quality, hot lotion, with a great smell and bronzer, purchase this product, you really can&#x27;t beat the price for the size bottle</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this lotion.</li>
            <li>The reviews say this is a very hot tingle but in my case it was not.</li>
            <li>The tingle is very hot, so if you don&#x27;t like tingle, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li>When I finished tanning in a 10 minute bed, my skin was bright red and very, very irritated.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Insanely black and thought I was going to get a great tanning bed lotion.</li>
            <li>this lotion is HOT!</li>
            <li>Also, with normal bronzers, I watch the color wash right off in the shower, but these seem to stick more</li>
            <li>It is great for a hot, dark tan.</li>
            <li>Not the very best smell after tanning, loaded with bronzes, extra sizzley compared to a lot of other tingles.</li>
            <li>Again it does get super hot in the level 3 Bed.</li>
            <li>Although this does give that orange color, I have noticed most of the orange is gone after showering the next morning and leaves more of a normal tan color.</li>
            <li>leaves a tingling feeling and some redness for about an hour, but then, bronzes you right up.</li>
            <li>I WOULD NEVER DO THIS IN MY RIGHT STATE OF MIND!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i ordered this in a pinch due to the price and for that, its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to someone who wants a great tan and can stand a little sting....</li>
            <li>Nice deep tan with an intense tingle.  </li>
            <li>it was funny</li>
            <li>I learned that the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>and it was hot to touch</li>
            <li>If you are willing to sacrifice this irritation, this is for you.  </li>
            <li>This tingle is amazingly hot for beginners, but I&#x27;ve been using a tingle for some time</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>first time I ever used this king .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too hot.  </li>
            <li>Pretty funny.</li>
            <li>application the first thing I noticed was the horibble smell.</li>
            <li>AT FIRST.</li>
            <li>I will watch for a higher bronzer in this brand.</li>
            <li>It look&#x27;s natural with a hint of redish tint which I don&#x27;t mind because it makes it look more natural.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that this stuff would work, OMG it is so hot, and does really work.</li>
            <li>I only use  this tingle for the bottom of my legs because the rest of my body tans very quick.</li>
            <li>My night was pure hell.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>but it really burned her.</li>
            <li>If you want to intense your tan this product really helps.</li>
            <li>They will also turn your hands very orange.</li>
            <li>However, upon applying it, my skin was very itchy and irritated.  </li>
            <li>This product works VERY well.  </li>
            <li>It made me to much tingle...</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>and I really like the scent and tingle.</li>
            <li>And the smell really does smell like blackberry citrus.  </li>
            <li>For advanced tanners only.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast too.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin orange and very splotche</li>
            <li>but i really like it an plan on buying another bottle</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product at all if you have sensitive skin because you will get a rash!!!</li>
            <li>Odd since my skin was so hot, but it feels like you have a fever, for the lack of better words.  </li>
            <li>I do like the instant color that this lotion gives and the tingle was very hot for the first two sessions when I used it.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY suggest you buy it,</li>
            <li>The after smell is bad it does smell like Medicine but worth the tan, Shipping was FAST 3 days and came in great  conditions.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend it, however, if you like tinglers because this gets INSANELY hot but gives you INSANELY dark results:)  </li>
            <li>Less than 2 mins later I&#x27;ve swollen up with a bright red rash</li>
            <li>I was looking for a different lotion and really like this!  </li>
            <li>the plus side, the stuff smells great and the next day, my legs were a much prettier color and despite it being a weird experience...</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skinl</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know that there was such a smell, but it really smells like it.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is one of the ones I use frequently.</li>
            <li>Has a strong tiingle to it and is definitely one to use for those that want a dark tan.</li>
            <li>I am a blonde hair green eyed veryyy fair skinned girl, and this gave me a little bit of an orange tint.</li>
            <li>If you like the extreme tingle this stuff is Hot.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for people who are not very dark yet.</li>
            <li>This one almost brought a tear to my eye because it feels like your being eaten alive by a million fire ants and leaves you extremely RED!</li>
            <li>only gets you dark fast</li>
            <li>The promises of a deep dark tan seemed promising since I already have a mocha complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>Maybe if you mix it with your regular tanning lotion it would be less intense.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s just too hot.  </li>
            <li> Pretty funny.</li>
            <li> application the first thing I noticed was the horibble smell.</li>
            <li> AT FIRST.</li>
            <li> I will watch for a higher bronzer in this brand.</li>
            <li> It look&#x27;s natural with a hint of redish tint which I don&#x27;t mind because it makes it look more natural.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this stuff would work, OMG it is so hot, and does really work.</li>
            <li> I only use  this tingle for the bottom of my legs because the rest of my body tans very quick.</li>
            <li> My night was pure hell.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> but it really burned her.</li>
            <li> If you want to intense your tan this product really helps.</li>
            <li> They will also turn your hands very orange.</li>
            <li> However, upon applying it, my skin was very itchy and irritated.  </li>
            <li> This product works VERY well.  </li>
            <li> It made me to much tingle...</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> and I really like the scent and tingle.</li>
            <li> And the smell really does smell like blackberry citrus.  </li>
            <li> For advanced tanners only.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast too.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin orange and very splotche</li>
            <li> but i really like it an plan on buying another bottle</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product at all if you have sensitive skin because you will get a rash!!!</li>
            <li> Odd since my skin was so hot, but it feels like you have a fever, for the lack of better words.  </li>
            <li> I do like the instant color that this lotion gives and the tingle was very hot for the first two sessions when I used it.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY suggest you buy it,</li>
            <li> The after smell is bad it does smell like Medicine but worth the tan, Shipping was FAST 3 days and came in great  conditions.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend it, however, if you like tinglers because this gets INSANELY hot but gives you INSANELY dark results:)  </li>
            <li> Less than 2 mins later I&#x27;ve swollen up with a bright red rash</li>
            <li> I was looking for a different lotion and really like this!  </li>
            <li> the plus side, the stuff smells great and the next day, my legs were a much prettier color and despite it being a weird experience...</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skinl</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know that there was such a smell, but it really smells like it.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is one of the ones I use frequently.</li>
            <li> Has a strong tiingle to it and is definitely one to use for those that want a dark tan.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde hair green eyed veryyy fair skinned girl, and this gave me a little bit of an orange tint.</li>
            <li> If you like the extreme tingle this stuff is Hot.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for people who are not very dark yet.</li>
            <li> This one almost brought a tear to my eye because it feels like your being eaten alive by a million fire ants and leaves you extremely RED!</li>
            <li> only gets you dark fast</li>
            <li> The promises of a deep dark tan seemed promising since I already have a mocha complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> Maybe if you mix it with your regular tanning lotion it would be less intense.  </li>
            <li> The tingle is not bad it was only bad the first 2 times I used it</li>
            <li> it tingle a lot and give you a burning sensation all day long.</li>
            <li> It brought out my tan and lasted a long while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 6 other lotions and they all seem to work about the same.</li>
            <li> I layed in the tanning bed last year and never got dark at all.</li>
            <li> Recommended for people with dark tans only!</li>
            <li> Although it did make me dark instantly the itiching after was unbearable!  </li>
            <li> I got this the other day and used it for the first time, it smells pretty bad like medicine.</li>
            <li> it does make u red for little bit after</li>
            <li> What I did was go tanning for a few sessions with a regular lotion</li>
            <li> I always take wet ones and get it off my hands before I get in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> you dont stay dark long and you will start turning orange also.</li>
            <li> Not much to say</li>
            <li> and after I had a nice base tan I switched to this tingler.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Insanely Black because no matter what I was doing...my legs would never seem to get dark.  </li>
            <li> A little went a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it every other time I tan.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t ever be buying this lotion again, and if you do buy it and want to avoid the orange trying, alternating with this lotion and another one every other day.</li>
            <li> I tried other products but they did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This product was  hot and not for the faint of heart</li>
            <li> It felt good while lying there, and then the bed turned off and I was cold again...and remained cold for the next few hours.</li>
            <li> , I know I have got a little darker but not much.</li>
            <li> You get REALLY dark.  </li>
            <li> I am reasonably dark; I tried a test spot on my arm and had to wash it off within 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> but it was dark tan...</li>
            <li> not worth the money unless u wanna turn orange.</li>
            <li> On top of that not working this crap made me look orange not tan.</li>
            <li> My lotion seemed as if it was watered down.</li>
            <li> bad fast enough!  </li>
            <li> and I noticed each time it hurted less and less and now after about 10 usages</li>
            <li> so I bought Beyond Black Lotion</li>
            <li> Typically I use John Abate products</li>
            <li> Everyone knows of that lotion that makes your skin darker and when you shower you wash it off, well with insanely black</li>
            <li> I like to switch between this and paint it black.</li>
            <li> Insanely Black tanning lotion did bring me immediate color.  </li>
            <li> This product is for serious tanners only.</li>
            <li> I was sort of disappointed in this one because I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> and ive been tanning a few times a week for a few years now.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something not as harsh</li>
            <li> I got a few shades darker in just a couple visits.</li>
            <li> SO I just wasted my money on this brand.</li>
            <li> I wear ivory foundation if that gives you any clue as to how pale I am.</li>
            <li> I have never been tan just pale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m editing my last review when I only gave it 3 starts because the painful after session after my 1st use...</li>
            <li> At least I don&#x27;t see the bronzers going down the drain!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tingle lotions in the past, and they seem to help...</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;d used tingle lotions in the past, I figured, well...</li>
            <li> I am very pale skined.</li>
            <li> Because I was having a hard time tanning the bottom of my legs.</li>
            <li> you only wash half the color off :(</li>
            <li> I was feeling faint, so I went outside in the freezing cold &amp; layed down on the cement.</li>
            <li> and they say it burns really bad (even my six year old son) not good!</li>
            <li> and it has broken my Plateau...</li>
            <li> it will make the burn worse.</li>
            <li> I have used about 8 expensive tanning lotions in my 3 years of tanning</li>
            <li> the worst thing about the lotion is everyone I touch after I&#x27;ve tanned, it makes there skin where I touched red</li>
            <li> It does work ill give it that im already darker</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the after effects that are not for the faint of heart.  </li>
            <li> Weird sensation for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I am not getting the results I expected, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> makes you look dirty.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not to bad</li>
            <li> (PS) don&#x27;t apply on face because it does hurt way bad</li>
            <li> i felt like i was on fire, my skin burnt so bad</li>
            <li> and I decided to see how bad the tingling was</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> how bad could this one be?</li>
            <li> so thats a plus just stinks and burns the crap out of you!</li>
            <li> Absolutly HATE this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this crap!!!!</li>
            <li> Insane!!</li>
            <li> my arms palms and ankles looked awful!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was delivered in a timely manner. Was very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m editing my last review when I only gave it 3 starts because the painful after session after my 1st use... But now I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because it does give you a greattttttt tan! I have used about 8 expensive tanning lotions in my 3 years of tanning but this one was my 1st Tingle and ohhh boy it SIZZLES. This one almost brought a tear to my eye because it feels like your being eaten alive by a million fire ants and leaves you extremely RED! I sucked up the feeling an used it about 3 more times after my first usage and I noticed each time it hurted less and less and now after about 10 usages I still feel the tingle but it&#x27;s not to bad and it has broken my Plateau... Again it does get super hot in the level 3 Bed. Tingle-effect lasts about 2 hours but goes away and tan starts coming thru and looks great! It look&#x27;s natural with a hint of redish tint which I don&#x27;t mind because it makes it look more natural. BTW I&#x27;m 19&amp;Hispanic male and this lotions tans me well! The after smell is bad it does smell like Medicine but worth the tan, Shipping was FAST 3 days and came in great  conditions. Would recommend to someone who wants a great tan and can stand a little sting.... (PS) don&#x27;t apply on face because it does hurt way bad</li>
            <li> Burns but it is so awesome! I would suggest using this if you have experience with tinglers. What I did was go tanning for a few sessions with a regular lotion and after I had a nice base tan I switched to this tingler. Do not put it on your face. Also, don&#x27;t leave it out on your dresser because someone may use it accidently thinking it&#x27;s regular lotion - someone like my mother. haha it was funny but it really burned her. Also you will get red and puffy after applying but it goes away.</li>
            <li> i did not like this product when you use it it tingle a lot and give you a burning sensation all day long. never buy this product</li>
            <li> If you want to intense your tan this product really helps. I use it every other time I tan. If you like the extreme tingle this stuff is Hot. I would recommend it to anyone that tans..Love it</li>
            <li> Im a teenager and I love to tan so I bought Beyond Black Lotion and they sent me this kind but they gave me my money back. I was out of lotion so I decided to keep it. Before I used this I layed 1 time for 8 minutes. I am very pale skined. I wear ivory foundation if that gives you any clue as to how pale I am. But anyway I went and layed again with this lotion for 10 minutes. The tingle is not bad it was only bad the first 2 times I used it cause I have never used a tingle lotion before. I layed in the tanning bed last year and never got dark at all. I decided that I would start laying in January this year to be kinda tan by April. So I have layed 6 times (1 for 8, 1 for 10, 1 for 12, 2 for 15 and 2 for 18 minutes) and I am darker than I ever was last year. I thought I would never tan but I did. I am so happy with my color. I have never been tan just pale. When you go to put this lotion on make sure you have no streaks because they will show. I learned that the first time I used it. You should also make sure you get it off of your hands immediately. I always take wet ones and get it off my hands before I get in the tanning bed. They will also turn your hands very orange. Overall I am very pleased with this lotion. It made me tan finally and it was affordable.</li>
            <li> Typically I use John Abate products but i ordered this in a pinch due to the price and for that, its a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this stuff would work, OMG it is so hot, and does really work. I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this.</li>
            <li> Love it by day 2 I looked like I was on a tropical island! !!!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is good and it work decent, I know I have got a little darker but not much. After I put it on it starts to burn my skin before I get into my tanning bed, when I get into the tanning bed I get releif. But I do sweat with it a lot. Everyone knows of that lotion that makes your skin darker and when you shower you wash it off, well with insanely black you only wash half the color off :( the worst thing about the lotion is everyone I touch after I&#x27;ve tanned, it makes there skin where I touched red and they say it burns really bad (even my six year old son) not good!</li>
            <li> Such an amazing lotion, smells good and the tingle makes it so worth every penny. It brought out my tan and lasted a long while. A little went a long way.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product. After only 3 or 4 uses with this for some reason the tingle was not there at all. On top of that not working this crap made me look orange not tan. Don&#x27;t buy this crap!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands of bronzers and tinglers for many years. This has the best of both. I love the \\&quot;just came out of the sun\\&quot; feeling it gives. Recommended for people with dark tans only!</li>
            <li> I got this the other day and used it for the first time, it smells pretty bad like medicine. I want something that smells good cuz you smell like a tanning bed when u get out so that doesnt help. Also after tanning 15mins i felt like i was on fire, my skin burnt so bad and it was hot to touch, never had that happen before and ive been tanning a few times a week for a few years now. It does work ill give it that im already darker then i was jus with one 15min session so thats a plus just stinks and burns the crap out of you!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a different lotion and really like this!  This brand is one of my favorites and getting it on this site makes them affordable, will continue to purchase my tanning products here!!!</li>
            <li> I am a blonde hair green eyed veryyy fair skinned girl, and this gave me a little bit of an orange tint. I do like the instant color that this lotion gives and the tingle was very hot for the first two sessions when I used it. I like to switch between this and paint it black. Although this does give that orange color, I have noticed most of the orange is gone after showering the next morning and leaves more of a normal tan color. I probably won&#x27;t ever be buying this lotion again, and if you do buy it and want to avoid the orange trying, alternating with this lotion and another one every other day.</li>
            <li> I just received the tanning lotion today and I decided to see how bad the tingling was so I tested it on my arm and leg.  Less than 2 mins later I&#x27;ve swollen up with a bright red rash and I&#x27;m itching and burning in those two spots... I do not recommend this product at all if you have sensitive skin because you will get a rash!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion n tge price was great</li>
            <li> The seller was great the product did not tingle it burned for hours longer than the label said it would accelerate and even transferred to my boyfriends skin. It should be called &amp;#34;Insanely Burn&amp;#34; I looked and felt like I was on fire all day even after a cool shower. If you use this product do not rub your skin at all it will make the burn worse.</li>
            <li> Insanely Black tanning lotion did bring me immediate color.  However, upon applying it, my skin was very itchy and irritated.  When I finished tanning in a 10 minute bed, my skin was bright red and very, very irritated.  Once I showered, my skin felt better and I noticed more color.  If you are willing to sacrifice this irritation, this is for you.  If you don&#x27;t like irritation, stay away!</li>
            <li> This product works VERY well.  You get REALLY dark.  I would only recommend it, however, if you like tinglers because this gets INSANELY hot but gives you INSANELY dark results:)  Happy with product, however it was too intense for me.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tanning products I have used. It will definately reduce your visits to the tanning bed! I love it. And the $ compared to the salons.......it&#x60;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> This product is for serious tanners only. I am reasonably dark; I tried a test spot on my arm and had to wash it off within 4 minutes. It left a welt on my hand for over four hours. Will not be using again, but may be okay for tingle fanatics. If you&#x27;re looking for something not as harsh I also tried the Ed Hardy Obnoxious and it was awesome! I was three shades darker in one session and it smells soooo good!!</li>
            <li> This product was suppose to be a tingle tanning lotion. It does not have a bit of tingle. I did better with no lotion at all!!! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The reviews say this is a very hot tingle but in my case it was not. I bought this tingle 1 week ago. Because I was having a hard time tanning the bottom of my legs. I  was using a mega bed every 24 hours for 20 min for 1 week. I tried other products but they did nothing for me. I only use  this tingle for the bottom of my legs because the rest of my body tans very quick. Yes I&#x27;m sure this has help tan my legs.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works fine</li>
            <li> Tingle is awesome but you def need to rub it in great or you have orange streaks.</li>
            <li> it was ok and I don&#x27;t like the smell but it was dark tan... It made me to much tingle...</li>
            <li> Absolutly HATE this product.  Although it did make me dark instantly the itiching after was unbearable!  I wish I had read the reviews prior to using this.  It also made my throat feel as if it was swelling up a bit... I would not recommend anyone to use this.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Really give you great color..</li>
            <li> I personally am happy with this product and knew that this had a high tingle level. So if you don&#x27;t want a hot lotion don&#x27;t buy this product, but if you want a high quality, hot lotion, with a great smell and bronzer, purchase this product, you really can&#x27;t beat the price for the size bottle you are receiving. The place I tan at had the same bottle but wanted almost 40 bucks for the same lotion! Insane!!</li>
            <li> It burns and irritates my skin.  As soon as my tanning session is over I have to shower and take it off.  Makes my skin all red and itchy too, even on my feet and hands!  I would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skinl</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than I thought it would be and it arrived fully packaged in good and un-used condition. It smells amazing and is very lightweight. This was the hottest tingle lotion I have used, it works okay. I&#x27;ve tried about 6 other lotions and they all seem to work about the same. I was sort of disappointed in this one because I had such high hopes. Perhaps I have reached my tanning limits? I will continue to use it, it was a good deal and I really like the scent and tingle. I would recommend it for people who are not very dark yet.</li>
            <li> So excited about this tanning lotion!  This tingle is amazingly hot for beginners, but I&#x27;ve been using a tingle for some time so it&#x27;s not too bad.  The tingle will be transferred from your hands to others until you wash them, wiping them off doesn&#x27;t do the trick.  The bronzers in it get you tan quick and don&#x27;t leave any streaks unless you just don&#x27;t pay attention. Also, with normal bronzers, I watch the color wash right off in the shower, but these seem to stick more I guess.  At least I don&#x27;t see the bronzers going down the drain!  And the smell really does smell like blackberry citrus.  Didn&#x27;t know that there was such a smell, but it really smells like it.  The after smell still smells like burnt skin, but that has never been a decider for me. This lotion has definitely helped me surpass my tanning peak! I will definitely be buying this one again!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this but I absolutely love it!! I may never purchase a different lotion. Fantastic&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Seen a difference after one tan! Idef recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Only buy if you can handle tingle lotion. I can handle tingle but I have to mix this with another lotion or it makes my stomach hurt</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It is great for a hot, dark tan. The tingle is very hot, so if you don&#x27;t like tingle, don&#x27;t buy this product. I got a few shades darker in just a couple visits. Would definitely buy again! It was a great price and shipped very fast from amazon.com! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This bottle packs the punch when it comes to a bronzed tan. I HIGHLY suggest you buy it, great price, great product. I tan about three times a week, and I love the tingle factor on this product. For advanced tanners only. Buy yours today, you&#x27;ll be happy with your tan!!!</li>
            <li> only gets you dark fast you dont stay dark long and you will start turning orange also. makes you look dirty. my arms palms and ankles looked awful!!!! not worth the money unless u wanna turn orange.</li>
            <li> first time I ever used this king . the tanning lotion was great, loved the tingle . I will be ordering more of this</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Insanely Black because no matter what I was doing...my legs would never seem to get dark.  I&#x27;ve used tingle lotions in the past, and they seem to help...IF you can handle the heat. Since I&#x27;d used tingle lotions in the past, I figured, well...how bad could this one be? Lord have mercy...this lotion is HOT! It no doubt creates color, that&#x27;s for sure. Albeit a tomoto color, but color nonetheless. :)  It&#x27;s fast too.  Witin 5 minutes of application, you are red!  The heat is bearable and the tingle...no biggie.  It&#x27;s the after effects that are not for the faint of heart.  I put the lotion on before driving to the salon because i wanted to make sure to wash my hands really well.  By the time i got there ten minutes later, i was freezing! Odd since my skin was so hot, but it feels like you have a fever, for the lack of better words.  I couldn&#x27;t get in the tanning bad fast enough!  It felt good while lying there, and then the bed turned off and I was cold again...and remained cold for the next few hours. Weird sensation for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the stuff smells great and the next day, my legs were a much prettier color and despite it being a weird experience...i&#x27;ll continue to use it (on my legs only) until I reach my ultimate color.  I can&#x27;t imagine putting this stuff on my core though.  It&#x27;s just too hot.  Maybe if you mix it with your regular tanning lotion it would be less intense.  I think i&#x27;m going to try that next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like it!  I&#x27;d buy it again for sure. Make sure to rub it in evenly...it does leave a line a red line of demarcation wherever you stop.  Pretty funny. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> leaves a tingling feeling and some redness for about an hour, but then, bronzes you right up. I got many compliments on my tan!!</li>
            <li> Not the very best smell after tanning, loaded with bronzes, extra sizzley compared to a lot of other tingles.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of this product.  It is the best tanning lotion I have ever used - I instantly see results.  Please continue selling this product!</li>
            <li> This is a good product &amp; makes my skin soft but I have decided I like tingling lotion the best</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided I would try it..... LOVE it! I saw results after using it the FIRST time!!!! BTW... it is hot!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product. The promises of a deep dark tan seemed promising since I already have a mocha complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Upon application the first thing I noticed was the horibble smell. It smells like sweaty gym socks. The lotion does have a tingle effect which was ok AT FIRST. Once I got home my legs felt like thousands of bees were stinging me &amp; then THE ITCHING happens, I could not sit still. My legs turned bright red &amp; started to swell.  I was feeling faint, so I went outside in the freezing cold &amp; layed down on the cement. I WOULD NEVER DO THIS IN MY RIGHT STATE OF MIND!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came inside &amp; took a shower, scrubbing my legs (I applied the lotion all over my body but for some reason my legs experienced the problem). After getting out of the shower, I was still itchy! I had to take a bath &amp; took 5 BENADRYL...knocked me out! I woke up this morning &amp; the itch is gone but my legs still feel swollen &amp; sore.&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT ADVISE ANYONE TO USE THIS LOTION. My night was pure hell.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product. It made my skin orange and very splotche it was like it stained my skin.</li>
            <li> When it says MEGA TINGLE, it is NO JOKE! within 5 minutes of applying you can feel the tingle. It does help you tan very fast, and smells AMAZING! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is a really good lotion if u like hot with tingle it does make u red for little bit after but i really like it an plan on buying another bottle</li>
            <li> I ordered Insanely black and thought I was going to get a great tanning bed lotion. But what I got was a lotion that turned my skin orangish looking after only using once. SO I just wasted my money on this brand.</li>
            <li> My lotion seemed as if it was watered down. And I am not getting the results I expected, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great Lotion!!!  Nice deep tan with an intense tingle.  Just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> Not much to say but I love this lotion. I will be getting this again. I will watch for a higher bronzer in this brand.</li>
            <li> Having used this product for indoor tanning, I found that my skin took on an orange hue which everyone was quick to notice and point out.  Smells wonderful, but burns the skin if used outdoors, and dyes the skin ORANGE!</li>
            <li> This lotion is one of the ones I use frequently. Has a strong tiingle to it and is definitely one to use for those that want a dark tan. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> This product was  hot and not for the faint of heart but if you can stand the heat GREAT product</li>
