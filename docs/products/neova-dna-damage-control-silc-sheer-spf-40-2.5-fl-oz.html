            <li>this works great, so far so good.  </li>

            <li>This sunblock is the best on the market, it works great and makes my skin even toned, soft looking and clear.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t silky any more.</li>
            <li>was in love whith</li>

            <li>So glad I found it here.</li>
            <li>Works better and safer than a sunblock.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely gilda</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but this one is ok</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t found one I like better.</li>
            <li>Most of all, it will stay on all day and protect your skin from the UV rays.</li>
            <li>This product is OK, but it&#x27;s heavier and not as silky.  </li>
            <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>I got to this product since one of the top reviewers for a phony diet publication</li>
            <li>I got to this product since one of the top reviewers for a phony diet publication</li>
            <li>Discovered the product many years ago at the Dermatologist office - was known as Thai Silc then.  </li>
            <li>You will love it...</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>This product is okay</li>
            <li>I like the Lira sunscreen much better.</li>
            <li>I have moved to buy the cheaper Shisido SPF and clinque SPF instead as it fits more in my budget.</li>
            <li>ANOTHER OUTSTANDING PRODUCT THAT I HAVE USED FOR 14 YEARS.  </li>
            <li>Next best thing to the original to silc no longer offered.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years , I am 81 yrs old, people compliment me all the time on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li>received a good product in fast time, thank you.</li>
            <li>When I had a question about delivery, her response was very quick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for me because I live in Arizona where the sun shines every day</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product It is a sunscreen plus adds a little color.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Goes  on silky smooth and hydrates a bit as well.  </li>
            <li>It goes on silky smooth...</li>
            <li>a moisturizer,  a tinted ,light foundation, and a skin damage repair product, all wrapped up in one.  </li>
            <li>I think it feels great on and looks natural  and is worth the price</li>
            <li>But I liked the old version (from years ago) better.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is still a great product but the old formula was smoother, more moisturizing, and cheaper while still providing excellent protection.</li>
            <li>Originally called ti silc.</li>
            <li>I still have a bottle of the original Ti-Silc</li>
            <li>Hoping this product would be comparable to the original, I purchased this alternative.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it to me and it has never disappointed me.  </li>
            <li>I could be a Rep for this product, I love it so much!</li>
            <li>Have to say I prefer the original 60 spf.  </li>
            <li>A light, slightly tinted sunscreen that spreads beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this daily as it protects my fair skin while giving me a &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; glow.</li>
            <li>great product and will recommend other people to use them too.</li>
            <li>This was the best facial daily wear tinted sunscreen until they changed the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a cheap orangy tint that does not have as much as a luminescent glow effect as the original.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not cure but is soothing and protects from the very hot South Texas sun.  </li>
            <li>I love this new formula.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nutritous face cream and can easily go under makeup,</li>
            <li>Very light (not heavy) on the skin.</li>
            <li>I liked the last one I bought with the oil in it.  </li>
            <li>It is the one sun screen that does not make my face break out and my fair skin never even gets pink when i am wearing this screen.  </li>
            <li>In 2014, I purchased this product again because the sunscreen itself is excellent, BUT the dispenser is now actually WORSE.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase directly from Dermotologist, but now have better priced resource.</li>
            <li>I like the old formula better.</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer right before I apply make up - as suggested as my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t wipe right off either- stays on all daylong.</li>
            <li>and it gives me just the right coverage I want.</li>
            <li>Loved the old tinted sunscreen and was very sad when they took it off the market, this one is not as good but still better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li>Right on the front it says &amp;#34;photo finish&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s exactly what you get.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they had to go and mess with a good thing.</li>
            <li>Very light and sheer.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the tinted product since it first came out.</li>
            <li>Besides providing protection against the Texas sun, this product gives a little bit of makeup-like skin coverage that makes me feel pretty; better yet, it leaves a true matte finish!  </li>
            <li>which exactly ingredient?&lt;br /&gt;Check FDA about zinc usage-</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember whether one had a choice of colors, if so, I did pick the one most likely for my complexion.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Neova as a Dermatology/Aesthetic nurse.</li>
            <li>I use this sunscreen on my face first thing every morning.  </li>
            <li>I  actually called the Manufacturer to try to buy more</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen and the tint is just right for me.</li>
            <li>This is so very frustrating because the sunscreen itself is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light &amp; you can barely tell it&#x27;s on your face.</li>
            <li>VERY PLEASED AND USED IT EVERYDAY OF THE YEAR</li>
            <li>It has a light silc sheer and can easy wear under any daily</li>
            <li>Very, very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>It leaves a streaky filmy finish much unlike the advertised Silky product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of years now and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>and I find it work very well for me.</li>
            <li>This fomula requires me to use a mosterizer and then it does not go  on very well over it.</li>
            <li>Blocks sun very well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone that wants to protect their skin from premature aging .</li>
            <li>Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li>I really like her prompt service.</li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel, tint, and results with this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to have found it and that I wasn&#x27;t dissuaded from buying it by other reviews.</li>
            <li>and that is how I discovered this new version!</li>
            <li>I too preferred the older version of this as other reviewers have said but even the new version is better than anything else out there.  </li>
            <li>I like the older version of the product because it was oily.</li>
            <li>I have been using Ti-Silc now called Neova Control Silc (same product, slightly different name)  for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>The old formula was silky and dewey!!</li>
            <li>It is very creamy but not heavy.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this product for a few years now, really love this product, being that it has a tint to</li>
            <li>It was not as heavy more moisturizing..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a far better product that others I&#x27;ve tried and serves as a great base.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>So disappointing,I won&#x27;t be buying this new version again.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m new to this product</li>
            <li>and I live in Florida.</li>
            <li>NO MATTER WHERE I LIVE.</li>
            <li>they recently change legal percentage, I guess this product have too much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why companies don&#x27;t just add new products while keeping the old ones!  </li>
            <li>ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We get less product for more than double the price with new formula.</li>
            <li>The original neova sunscreen had much bigger packaging and costed much less which they have discontinued and came out with this &amp;#34;rip off&amp;#34; product that still works but costs much more for  much less product.</li>
            <li>I am fair complexion with freckles and because of its light color it is my makeup base.</li>
            <li>It is much too light and thick, so it gives me a mask like look.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I used this old product which was smoothy and creamy.</li>
            <li>My 86 yr old mom lives in CA, and loves to take walks around her retirement community.  </li>
            <li>There is no comparison with the old Ti-Silc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that others like the old ingredients</li>
            <li>The old formula felt like it was a mosterizer.</li>
            <li>Not heavy - even for South Florida - works link a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve cut the size and nearly doubled the price.</li>
            <li>Effectively, it is nearly a 100% increase in price.  </li>
            <li>Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li>Most people do not realize that I am in my late 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Took an early morning walk with my daughter in Phoenix and she let me use her Neova.</li>
            <li>It is just a cheap imitation of the former product.</li>
            <li>This is the only sunblock that goes on so well that I am willing to put it on daily.  </li>
            <li>about 2/3 full, I am using only a little by mixing it with the drier new one.</li>
            <li>It provides sheer coverage, not too heavy and not too light.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert southwest and need a higher SPF for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I like the new packaging, but the old one was twice as big for the same price.</li>
            <li>I was shocked at the difference, and can&#x27;t imagine why they took such a good formula and ruined it!</li>
            <li>Bring back the old formula.  </li>
            <li>Please bring back the old verison.</li>
            <li>BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA1111</li>
            <li>Since she&#x27;s been using the Neova DNA Damage Control Silc Sheer SPF 40, she hasn&#x27;t had to have any more precancerous lesions removed...and she never gets even a little pink!  </li>
            <li>product does not have as much sun block, and dry outs my skin, and is only 2 oz.</li>
            <li>She wears it daily, (rain or shine), and also reapplies if she&#x27;s exposed for more than an 11/2 hours at a time...which should be common practice for everyone!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used the original Neova Ti Silc formula with the light tint and silky feel, you&#x27;ll be disappointed in this new inferior product.</li>
            <li>The new formula is horrible,very dry and shows every pore and wrinkle.</li>
            <li>It can turn a little &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; without applying moisturizer first.</li>
            <li>Much preferred the previous formula</li>
            <li>Sometimes you get a tiny bit when you plunge down, and sometimes you get way too much.</li>
            <li>Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li>Super thick sunscreen with sheer coverage.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product goes on very nice with just a hint of color used this for almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;Protects really well from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

            <li> Good light coverage.</li>
            <li> Love love love this item!  </li>
            <li> this works great, so far so good.  </li>
            <li> The discontinued product was so much silkier and went on my skin beautifully.  </li>
            <li> This is the best sun screen I have ever used, not greasy, with a little powder, you can look good.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is the best on the market, it works great and makes my skin even toned, soft looking and clear.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t silky any more.</li>
            <li> was in love whith</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a year and still love it.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with product before and had used it for 14 years, thinking of changing now.</li>
            <li> Better sunscreen than most.</li>
            <li> This provides better protection.</li>
            <li> I am pleased because It does not leave my face oily and I will be getting more when I run out.</li>

            <li> I will re-order this product for sure.</li>
            <li> I had rosacea outbreaks for more than (5) years never realizing that they were triggered by sun exposure.</li>
            <li> and I have not seen any Rosacea for more than (2) years.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it here.</li>
            <li> Works better and safer than a sunblock.  </li>
            <li> Sincerely gilda</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but this one is ok</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t found one I like better.</li>
            <li> Most of all, it will stay on all day and protect your skin from the UV rays.</li>
            <li> This product is OK, but it&#x27;s heavier and not as silky.  </li>
            <li> ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> I got to this product since one of the top reviewers for a phony diet publication</li>
            <li> I got to this product since one of the top reviewers for a phony diet publication</li>
            <li> Discovered the product many years ago at the Dermatologist office - was known as Thai Silc then.  </li>
            <li> You will love it...</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> This product is okay</li>
            <li> I like the Lira sunscreen much better.</li>
            <li> I have moved to buy the cheaper Shisido SPF and clinque SPF instead as it fits more in my budget.</li>
            <li> ANOTHER OUTSTANDING PRODUCT THAT I HAVE USED FOR 14 YEARS.  </li>
            <li> Next best thing to the original to silc no longer offered.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years , I am 81 yrs old, people compliment me all the time on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li> received a good product in fast time, thank you.</li>
            <li> When I had a question about delivery, her response was very quick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for me because I live in Arizona where the sun shines every day</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product It is a sunscreen plus adds a little color.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Goes  on silky smooth and hydrates a bit as well.  </li>
            <li> It goes on silky smooth...</li>
            <li> a moisturizer,  a tinted ,light foundation, and a skin damage repair product, all wrapped up in one.  </li>
            <li> I think it feels great on and looks natural  and is worth the price</li>
            <li> But I liked the old version (from years ago) better.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is still a great product but the old formula was smoother, more moisturizing, and cheaper while still providing excellent protection.</li>
            <li> Originally called ti silc.</li>
            <li> I still have a bottle of the original Ti-Silc</li>
            <li> Hoping this product would be comparable to the original, I purchased this alternative.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it to me and it has never disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> I could be a Rep for this product, I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Have to say I prefer the original 60 spf.  </li>
            <li> A light, slightly tinted sunscreen that spreads beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this daily as it protects my fair skin while giving me a &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; glow.</li>
            <li> great product and will recommend other people to use them too.</li>
            <li> This was the best facial daily wear tinted sunscreen until they changed the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a cheap orangy tint that does not have as much as a luminescent glow effect as the original.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not cure but is soothing and protects from the very hot South Texas sun.  </li>
            <li> I love this new formula.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nutritous face cream and can easily go under makeup,</li>
            <li> Very light (not heavy) on the skin.</li>
            <li> I liked the last one I bought with the oil in it.  </li>
            <li> It is the one sun screen that does not make my face break out and my fair skin never even gets pink when i am wearing this screen.  </li>
            <li> In 2014, I purchased this product again because the sunscreen itself is excellent, BUT the dispenser is now actually WORSE.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase directly from Dermotologist, but now have better priced resource.</li>
            <li> I like the old formula better.</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer right before I apply make up - as suggested as my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t wipe right off either- stays on all daylong.</li>
            <li> and it gives me just the right coverage I want.</li>
            <li> Loved the old tinted sunscreen and was very sad when they took it off the market, this one is not as good but still better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> Right on the front it says &amp;#34;photo finish&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s exactly what you get.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they had to go and mess with a good thing.</li>
            <li> Very light and sheer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the tinted product since it first came out.</li>
            <li> Besides providing protection against the Texas sun, this product gives a little bit of makeup-like skin coverage that makes me feel pretty; better yet, it leaves a true matte finish!  </li>
            <li> which exactly ingredient?&lt;br /&gt;Check FDA about zinc usage-</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember whether one had a choice of colors, if so, I did pick the one most likely for my complexion.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Neova as a Dermatology/Aesthetic nurse.</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen on my face first thing every morning.  </li>
            <li> I  actually called the Manufacturer to try to buy more</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen and the tint is just right for me.</li>
            <li> This is so very frustrating because the sunscreen itself is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light &amp; you can barely tell it&#x27;s on your face.</li>
            <li> VERY PLEASED AND USED IT EVERYDAY OF THE YEAR</li>
            <li> It has a light silc sheer and can easy wear under any daily</li>
            <li> Very, very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> It leaves a streaky filmy finish much unlike the advertised Silky product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> and I find it work very well for me.</li>
            <li> This fomula requires me to use a mosterizer and then it does not go  on very well over it.</li>
            <li> Blocks sun very well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone that wants to protect their skin from premature aging .</li>
            <li> Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li> I really like her prompt service.</li>
            <li> really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel, tint, and results with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to have found it and that I wasn&#x27;t dissuaded from buying it by other reviews.</li>
            <li> and that is how I discovered this new version!</li>
            <li> I too preferred the older version of this as other reviewers have said but even the new version is better than anything else out there.  </li>
            <li> I like the older version of the product because it was oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ti-Silc now called Neova Control Silc (same product, slightly different name)  for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> The old formula was silky and dewey!!</li>
            <li> It is very creamy but not heavy.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few years now, really love this product, being that it has a tint to</li>
            <li> It was not as heavy more moisturizing..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a far better product that others I&#x27;ve tried and serves as a great base.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one I can&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing,I won&#x27;t be buying this new version again.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m new to this product</li>
            <li> and I live in Florida.</li>
            <li> NO MATTER WHERE I LIVE.</li>
            <li> they recently change legal percentage, I guess this product have too much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why companies don&#x27;t just add new products while keeping the old ones!  </li>
            <li> ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We get less product for more than double the price with new formula.</li>
            <li> The original neova sunscreen had much bigger packaging and costed much less which they have discontinued and came out with this &amp;#34;rip off&amp;#34; product that still works but costs much more for  much less product.</li>
            <li> I am fair complexion with freckles and because of its light color it is my makeup base.</li>
            <li> It is much too light and thick, so it gives me a mask like look.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I used this old product which was smoothy and creamy.</li>
            <li> My 86 yr old mom lives in CA, and loves to take walks around her retirement community.  </li>
            <li> There is no comparison with the old Ti-Silc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that others like the old ingredients</li>
            <li> The old formula felt like it was a mosterizer.</li>
            <li> Not heavy - even for South Florida - works link a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve cut the size and nearly doubled the price.</li>
            <li> Effectively, it is nearly a 100% increase in price.  </li>
            <li> Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li> Most people do not realize that I am in my late 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Took an early morning walk with my daughter in Phoenix and she let me use her Neova.</li>
            <li> It is just a cheap imitation of the former product.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunblock that goes on so well that I am willing to put it on daily.  </li>
            <li> about 2/3 full, I am using only a little by mixing it with the drier new one.</li>
            <li> It provides sheer coverage, not too heavy and not too light.  </li>
            <li> I live in the desert southwest and need a higher SPF for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I like the new packaging, but the old one was twice as big for the same price.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the difference, and can&#x27;t imagine why they took such a good formula and ruined it!</li>
            <li> Bring back the old formula.  </li>
            <li> Please bring back the old verison.</li>
            <li> BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA1111</li>
            <li> Since she&#x27;s been using the Neova DNA Damage Control Silc Sheer SPF 40, she hasn&#x27;t had to have any more precancerous lesions removed...and she never gets even a little pink!  </li>
            <li> product does not have as much sun block, and dry outs my skin, and is only 2 oz.</li>
            <li> She wears it daily, (rain or shine), and also reapplies if she&#x27;s exposed for more than an 11/2 hours at a time...which should be common practice for everyone!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used the original Neova Ti Silc formula with the light tint and silky feel, you&#x27;ll be disappointed in this new inferior product.</li>
            <li> The new formula is horrible,very dry and shows every pore and wrinkle.</li>
            <li> It can turn a little &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; without applying moisturizer first.</li>
            <li> Much preferred the previous formula</li>
            <li> Sometimes you get a tiny bit when you plunge down, and sometimes you get way too much.</li>
            <li> Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li> Super thick sunscreen with sheer coverage.</li>
            <li> This arrived, quickly, the exact same bottle, and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and heavy, and more difficult to smooth on, esp.</li>
            <li> Please bring the old formula with the price go down.</li>
            <li> The only think you have to watch out for is it does have a little tint on it and can get on your clothes, if not careful.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, too!</li>
            <li> The newer product make my skin look dry.</li>
            <li> It does not work well with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin appears so dry as if I had applied powder.</li>
            <li> I am 77 and have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the only sun screen I have found that stays on through active play in water.  </li>
            <li> This new one is a little dark on me, but it will be used.  </li>
            <li> It is approximately half the size and over double the cost.</li>
            <li> was using this when it was called Ti-silc(same product, different packaging, and half the price).</li>
            <li> It left my face moist and, with it being slightly tinted, sometimes I didn&#x27;t use any foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have very very dry skin and have been using this product forever.</li>
            <li> What a HUGE disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have spent alot of money getting my skin tone even</li>
            <li> I was surprised and sorry to see that it now costs me the same for the 2.5 oz bottle as I paid for the 4 oz bottle last time I bought it..  </li>
            <li> Would not start the morning without it and would certainly not go out the door withour the SPF protection on my face.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the old one!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested Neova&#x27;s Silc Sheer SPF 40 for daily sunscreen use, after I&#x27;d complained about the greasy appearance of every sunscreen I&#x27;d previously tried.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> How I know due to the suntan  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they have changed the packaging &amp; there is at least a month&#x27;s worth of product left in the container when you can no longer pump it out.  </li>
            <li> Will explore other sites</li>
            <li> Purchased both the Control Active and Silc.</li>
            <li> I use it now , however it&#x27;s not worth the money  </li>
            <li> The color is just too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I love the texture, color, consistency, and protection of this sunscreen, but I find the dispenser to be annoying.</li>
            <li> The price went up , ounce went down.</li>
            <li> It has a slight tint and one doesn&#x27;t need a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had used the previous product for years and got compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
            <li> No odor, not greasy, and gives your skin a slight tint.  </li>
            <li> When I saw it on Amazon for half the price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  </li>
            <li> I agree that the previous formulation was a little bit nicer, but this still works quite well.</li>
            <li> Usually that means thick, nonabsorbent pasty white lotions.</li>
            <li> Because of her age, and past sun worshipping, she now has to be very careful about sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> Filmy, heavy feeling; after 2 hours I want to remove that and never see that</li>
            <li> I wear it year round to protect my skin.  </li>
            <li> So sad that the old Ti-Silc sun lotion/moisturizer is discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> really like it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just very expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> found commonly in makeup.</li>
            <li> It has a hideous orange tint and the coverage sucks.</li>
            <li> star\\&quot; but in reality, I&#x27;d give it a negative rating if I could.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use neova every day and have done so for at least five years.  </li>
            <li> The old formula kept my face looking luminous and I didn&#x27;t have to use a base.  </li>
            <li> At least with the previous bad dispenser, when the pump worked poorly, you could unscrew the cap to get some product out.</li>
            <li> Non irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> Just not happy with results.</li>
            <li> This product--which is the \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; for Ti-Silc, is quite frankly a rip-off.</li>
            <li> While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer.</li>
            <li> This mix is worse than a roof tar.</li>
            <li> , also unable  to get all of the product out of the container since they change the packaging.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product from a dermatologist office and very expensive</li>
            <li> They reduced or eliminated  the zinc oxide and doubled the price too bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that bad</li>
            <li> So disappointed, but I will use it until I can find another silky sunscreen with tint.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> and I use this every day as a base to my Jane Iredale make-up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait u won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product is the worst tinted moisturizer I have ever tried.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was the best facial daily wear tinted sunscreen until they changed the ingredients. They reduced or eliminated  the zinc oxide and doubled the price too bad. I use it now , however it&#x27;s not worth the money  and doubt I will buy it next time</li>
            <li> This sunblock is the best on the market, it works great and makes my skin even toned, soft looking and clear.  Protects from the strongest sun.  I noticed the difference in my skin after about 2 months and now I have been using it for about 7 months and it really works.</li>
            <li> I have been using the tinted product since it first came out. The texture of this sunblock is so creamy/silky and does not leave a shine. It also evens out skin tones.  I live in Florida and I use this every day as a base to my Jane Iredale make-up.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested Neova&#x27;s Silc Sheer SPF 40 for daily sunscreen use, after I&#x27;d complained about the greasy appearance of every sunscreen I&#x27;d previously tried.  Wow.  Besides providing protection against the Texas sun, this product gives a little bit of makeup-like skin coverage that makes me feel pretty; better yet, it leaves a true matte finish!  Very, very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for years!  It&#x27;s one I can&#x27;t live without.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> Not at all like the pump bottle formula.  Bring back the old formula.  This appears to be tinted zinc.  It leaves a streaky filmy finish much unlike the advertised Silky product.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of RetinA. The prescription, not the drugstore stuff. As such, I wear a sunscreen on my face and neck religiously. And this is the best ever. It has a slight tint and one doesn&#x27;t need a moisturizer. And it&#x27;s a 45 SPF! Hello! This would protect you in Brazil! Yay!</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best SPF there is on the market.  I liked the last one I bought with the oil in it.  This one is water resistant.  Do not like it as well.  The product is great.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy but not heavy.  I use it every day as a moisturizer and my face doesn&#x27;t break out.  I can be out in the sun without a hat and not get any sunburn.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> In this \\&quot;new\\&quot; version of sunscreen company put a lot of zinc (I guess, for reduce a cost). They tinted it for compensation of white zinc color. It isn&#x27;t silky any more. Filmy, heavy feeling; after 2 hours I want to remove that and never see that again.&lt;br /&gt;I was in love whith Ti Silc 60+ tint years and years. All my clients, too. Now we are in panic.&lt;br /&gt;Price is doubled.&lt;br /&gt;DNA repair? which exactly ingredient?&lt;br /&gt;Check FDA about zinc usage- they recently change legal percentage, I guess this product have too much</li>
            <li> I used this old product which was smoothy and creamy. I like the older version of the product because it was oily. The newer product make my skin look dry. The price went up , ounce went down. Please bring the old formula with the price go down.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs well. Non irritating to my skin. I live in the desert southwest and need a higher SPF for everyday use. Usually that means thick, nonabsorbent pasty white lotions. Not this one. It absorbs well and does not burn my face. I have been using it for over a year and still love it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very very dry skin and have been using this product forever. Would not start the morning without it and would certainly not go out the door withour the SPF protection on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is great as a sun screen.</li>
            <li> Just is not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day for sun screen. It&#x27;s light &amp; you can barely tell it&#x27;s on your face. Great product.</li>
            <li> My 86 yr old mom lives in CA, and loves to take walks around her retirement community.  Because of her age, and past sun worshipping, she now has to be very careful about sun exposure.  Since she&#x27;s been using the Neova DNA Damage Control Silc Sheer SPF 40, she hasn&#x27;t had to have any more precancerous lesions removed...and she never gets even a little pink!  She wears it daily, (rain or shine), and also reapplies if she&#x27;s exposed for more than an 11/2 hours at a time...which should be common practice for everyone!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 15 years. Originally called ti silc. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I am fair complexion with freckles and because of its light color it is my makeup base. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> A great sunscreen. The added tint makes it so you don&#x27;t have white all over your face. It works great under a tinted moisture also.&lt;br /&gt;ML</li>
            <li> It is the one sun screen that does not make my face break out and my fair skin never even gets pink when i am wearing this screen.  I use it as a moisturizer right before I apply make up - as suggested as my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product</li>
            <li> There is no comparison with the old Ti-Silc. It does not work well with dry skin. I was so pleased with product before and had used it for 14 years, thinking of changing now. Just not happy with results., also unable  to get all of the product out of the container since they change the packaging.</li>
            <li> Better sunscreen than most. I&#x27;ve used a lot of brands. This provides better protection. How I know due to the suntan  I don&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> Great product goes on very nice with just a hint of color used this for almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;Protects really well from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Also very good price.</li>
            <li> I am pleased because It does not leave my face oily and I will be getting more when I run out.</li>
            <li> great product and will recommend other people to use them too. satisfied with the item&lt;br /&gt;love it in daily usage&lt;br /&gt;NEOVA DAMAGE CONTROL SILC SHEER SPF 40</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now and really like it.  It provides sheer coverage, not too heavy and not too light.  It also has great sun coverage that is great for the summer months.  I wear it year round to protect my skin.  Doesn&#x27;t wipe right off either- stays on all daylong.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so light but has nice coverage and not too greasy. My skin feels great a protected when I wear this. Love it!</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing, has good coverage (to take the place of foundation), and is a very effective sunscreen.  I use this for regular daytime wear, even if out for a run before meetings, etc.  I have been using this product for some time, and think it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few years now, really love this product, being that it has a tint to I don&#x27;t have to wear foundation.</li>
            <li> LOVE this sunscreen. It&#x27;s light, non-greasy, and glides on great over my moisturizer. I started using it after my skin care specialist recommended it. I use it daily now and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have that sunscreen odor many others do. This is a great company that makes quality products.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully moisturizing, tinted sunscreen that I have been using for years.  Unfortunately they have changed the packaging &amp; there is at least a month&#x27;s worth of product left in the container when you can no longer pump it out.  This was probably done by design so you will order another tube, but I simply cut the end off the tube &amp; scoop out what I need for another 4 to 6 weeks!</li>
            <li> It is the best sun block I ever bought! It is not grease and moisturizes and protect skin! I will re-order this product for sure.</li>
            <li> this sunscreen/makeup was reformulated a couple of years ago to delete some of the possible&lt;br /&gt;carcinogens found commonly in makeup. I think it feels great on and looks natural  and is worth the price</li>
            <li> Purchased both the Control Active and Silc. Prefer the Silc.  For the price, it should be 5 - 6 oz.</li>
            <li> The new formula is horrible,very dry and shows every pore and wrinkle.The old formula was silky and dewey!! Please bring back the old verison.We get less product for more than double the price with new formula.So disappointing,I won&#x27;t be buying this new version again.Now using Elta MD tinted sunscreen and Nia.</li>
            <li> I had rosacea outbreaks for more than (5) years never realizing that they were triggered by sun exposure. An EENT Doctor friend of mine recommended this product and I have seen amazing results. I use it once daily and I have not seen any Rosacea for more than (2) years. The SPF 40 eliminates sun exposure and the DNA Damage control improved the look of my skin. Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen and the tint is just right for me. I&#x27;ve read that others like the old ingredients but I&#x27;m new to this product and I find it work very well for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only sun screen I have found that stays on through active play in water.  It will not wash off.</li>
            <li> The old formula felt like it was a mosterizer. This fomula requires me to use a mosterizer and then it does not go  on very well over it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why companies don&#x27;t just add new products while keeping the old ones!  This new one is a little dark on me, but it will be used.  So sad that the old Ti-Silc sun lotion/moisturizer is discontinued.  I still have a bottle of the original Ti-Silc about 2/3 full, I am using only a little by mixing it with the drier new one.</li>
            <li> Super thick sunscreen with sheer coverage. Blends well, protects skin from harmful sun exposure. Will purchase again from Amazon.com. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen!!  Works well and will not burn your eyes!!  Not heavy - even for South Florida - works link a tinted moisturizer.  I have used this for years and get lots of compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great face sunscreen with tinted bb cream!</li>
            <li> I too preferred the older version of this as other reviewers have said but even the new version is better than anything else out there.  It gives great coverage, covers up any read and leaves a lovely finish.</li>
            <li> This is the sunblock that my dermatologist recommended. However she sells it at almost double the price. So glad I found it here. Protects my face because I&#x27;m prone to hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember whether one had a choice of colors, if so, I did pick the one most likely for my complexion. It is much too light and thick, so it gives me a mask like look. Back to buying in a store where I can see the color before I buy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my face, exclusively, for 17 years. It began as Ti Silc and it has been a wonderful combination of protection and cover-up. Blessings to its creator.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this sunscreen product.  Best I&#x27;ve ever used and woks well under makeup.  Blocks sun very well.</li>
            <li> I liked the product that this one replaced.</li>
            <li> A light, slightly tinted sunscreen that spreads beautifully.  I love it!</li>
            <li> good for my skin.....it protects against the sun and at the same time makes my skin healthier.  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Love love love this item!  Next best thing to the original to silc no longer offered.  Delivered quickly. Great value. Tried to reorder from same site 1 week later and price had soared.  Too bad.  Will explore other sites</li>
            <li> The sunblock is great, but the product I received from this distributor had an expiration date of 2009!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from dermatologists before. This arrived, quickly, the exact same bottle, and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Tinted moisturizer-what&#x27;s not to love?! It&#x27;s great! Goes on easily and feels great! Lasts a long time, too!</li>
            <li> I like the new packaging, but the old one was twice as big for the same price. Do they think we won&#x27;t notice? I will continue to use this daily as it protects my fair skin while giving me a &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; glow.</li>
            <li> But I liked the old version (from years ago) better. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is still a great product but the old formula was smoother, more moisturizing, and cheaper while still providing excellent protection. I don&#x27;t understand why they had to go and mess with a good thing.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is tinted and it&#x27;s very sheer so you get a bit of makeup without having to do make up.  It&#x27;s good for me because I live in Arizona where the sun shines every day so I get the protection I need.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunblock that goes on so well that I am willing to put it on daily.  It has a perfect amount of color to it, and feels wonderful on my skin.  I like the Neova brand, and the price is really good.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this works great, so far so good.  Works better and safer than a sunblock.  Was recomended by a skin doctor and he is good</li>
            <li> I wanted to say that the Neova DNA damage control sunscreen is a great product ! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and it is a product I can trust . I have spent alot of money getting my skin tone even and this product brings me the confidencs of going outdoors with supreme protection. I would recommend this product to everyone that wants to protect their skin from premature aging . Don&#x27;t wait u won&#x27;t be disappointed ! Sincerely gilda</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Appreciate the new(est) packaging.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the old one!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it as a foundation and sunscreen.  It&#x27;s lightly tinted and works well on my fair skin,  It was recommended by my dermatologist years ago.</li>
            <li> Good product that I have used before</li>
            <li> Much preferred the previous formula but this one is ok</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen I have ever used. I was first introduced to Neova as a Dermatology/Aesthetic nurse.</li>
            <li> I like the color tone when I apply to my face.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I have ever used.  I love it adn will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> What a HUGE disappointment. I had used the previous product for years and got compliments on my skin all the time. It had great coverage, sun protection and made my skin look dewy. This &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product is the worst tinted moisturizer I have ever tried. It is approximately half the size and over double the cost. It has a hideous orange tint and the coverage sucks. This company has taken a great product and ruined it. Buyer beware - Don&#x27;t Buy it.</li>
            <li> I have been a Neova TiSilc user for years. Hoping this product would be comparable to the original, I purchased this alternative. What a disappointment. It is so drying on my skin. It has a cheap orangy tint that does not have as much as a luminescent glow effect as the original. My skin appears so dry as if I had applied powder. Not a fan. Won&#x27;t purchase again. Neova messed up on this one big time!</li>
            <li> Sheer, non greasy.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the texture, color, consistency, and protection of this sunscreen, but I find the dispenser to be annoying. Sometimes you get a tiny bit when you plunge down, and sometimes you get way too much. Wish they&#x27;d go back to the bottle it used to come in. In 2014, I purchased this product again because the sunscreen itself is excellent, BUT the dispenser is now actually WORSE. At least with the previous bad dispenser, when the pump worked poorly, you could unscrew the cap to get some product out. Now, when the pump doesn&#x27;t work, you&#x27;re done, unless you cut the tube open. This is so very frustrating because the sunscreen itself is wonderful. I&#x27;m going to try to contact the manufacturer and hope others do too.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I use this sunscreen on my face first thing every morning.  I apply it after my moisturizer and it lasts all day.  I also use it as an all over sunscreen when I go to the beach.  The product is not greasy and leaves no film.  It is the best sunscreen I have found.</li>
            <li> I had to give this review \\&quot;one star\\&quot; but in reality, I&#x27;d give it a negative rating if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Neova Ti-Silc for over 15 years. This product--which is the \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; for Ti-Silc, is quite frankly a rip-off. They&#x27;ve cut the size and nearly doubled the price. I could have accepted that, if they hadn&#x27;t downgraded the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I need to apply this stuff with a putty knife. It is just a cheap imitation of the former product. Save your money and keep looking.</li>
            <li> Works great. I have been using this product for over a year now and I really love it. I use it before I apply my concealer</li>
            <li> I have been using Ti-Silc now called Neova Control Silc (same product, slightly different name)  for years and love it.  I was surprised and sorry to see that it now costs me the same for the 2.5 oz bottle as I paid for the 4 oz bottle last time I bought it..  Effectively, it is nearly a 100% increase in price.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I agree that the previous formulation was a little bit nicer, but this still works quite well. I&#x27;m pleased to have found it and that I wasn&#x27;t dissuaded from buying it by other reviews. It&#x27;s still a far better product that others I&#x27;ve tried and serves as a great base.</li>
            <li> this is the best tinted moisturizer. texture is perfect</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used the original Neova Ti Silc formula with the light tint and silky feel, you&#x27;ll be disappointed in this new inferior product. It&#x27;s thick and heavy, and more difficult to smooth on, esp. with it&#x27;s darker color. I was shocked at the difference, and can&#x27;t imagine why they took such a good formula and ruined it! I tried to use it by blending with another product that&#x27;s white and creamier-that helped, but finally just stopped using it. The color is just too dark for me.</li>
            <li> was using this when it was called Ti-silc(same product, different packaging, and half the price). But I haven&#x27;t found one I like better.Apply it in the morning under makeup and it lasts all day , even when I&#x27;m at the beach all day. Great protection.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen! It&#x27;s lightweight and it doesn&#x27;t have any of the chemical smell that many others have! It has taken me YEARS to find the perfect one :)</li>
            <li> The old formula kept my face looking luminous and I didn&#x27;t have to use a base.  It evened out the skin color.  Why in the world would they do away with a successful product?  If they had to raise the price somewhat or change the spf I would have used another sun screen under it.  Please bring it back!</li>
            <li> received a good product in fast time, thank you.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my foundation for a sheerer look, or use it alone when I&#x27;m vacationing in the sun.</li>
            <li> This is the only facial sun screen that I use.  I like because it has good protection and is not greasy</li>
            <li> I love this new formula.  You don&#x27;t get that shiny face.  Right on the front it says &amp;#34;photo finish&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s exactly what you get.  Best I have ever use.  Would give it ten stars if possible.</li>
            <li> THis works perfectly with my complexion.  I used to purchase directly from Dermotologist, but now have better priced resource. through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use a powder foundation so it&#x27;s not that bad but it you were trying to put a creme or liquid on over it...good luck</li>
            <li> Great Product. I&#x27;ve have never burnt my face using this and I live in Florida.</li>
            <li> This is a very nutritous face cream and can easily go under makeup, eventhough it has some substance.  The only think you have to watch out for is it does have a little tint on it and can get on your clothes, if not careful.</li>
            <li> I use neova every day and have done so for at least five years.  It is great for your skin and it protects skin from the sun</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now.  My dermatologist recommended it to me and it has never disappointed me.  No odor, not greasy, and gives your skin a slight tint.  Most of all, it will stay on all day and protect your skin from the UV rays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product from a dermatologist office and very expensive but I like the protection.  When I saw it on Amazon for half the price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  It has a light silc sheer and can easy wear under any daily make up and gives great protection.  I will order this product again.  Amazing price.</li>
            <li> This product was called Ti-Silc when I began using it,  It was recommended by my dermotologist for help with my rocea .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not cure but is soothing and protects from the very hot South Texas sun.  I would not be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Couvillion</li>
            <li> Right when I thought I had the perfect sunscreen they pulled the plug on it.  The discontinued product was so much silkier and went on my skin beautifully.  This product is OK, but it&#x27;s heavier and not as silky.  So disappointed, but I will use it until I can find another silky sunscreen with tint.</li>
            <li> Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Octinoxate 3.0%, Titanium Dioxide 3.0%, Zinc Oxide 9.0%.&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Alumina, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Dimethicone/PEG-10/15 Crosspolymer, Ergothioneine, HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Iron Oxides, Lauryl PEG-9 Polymethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Lecithin, Methicone, Micrococcus Lysate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Phenoxyethanol, Plankton Extract, Purified Water, Silica, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a brand that on their Website it is claimed &amp;#34;&amp;#34;A micronized physical sunscreen, with the cosmetic benefit of a skin-perfecting sheer tint for the face&amp;#34;&amp;#34;... Dumping all those chemicals along with some ZO does not make it a physical sunscreen. This mix is worse than a roof tar. I got to this product since one of the top reviewers for a phony diet publication has written a five star review on this mix. It is amazing to see what some producers get to charge for damaging chemicals in the name of marketing.n a roof tar.

            <li> I have been using Neova products since 2006.  Most people do not realize that I am in my late 60&#x27;s.  This product underwent some changes in the last year.  I do not care for the packaging as you can not tell when to reorder until you almost run out.  But I can say that Elle provides great service.  When I had a question about delivery, her response was very quick.  I did not wait two or three days. I really like her prompt service. I will continue to order through Elle.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!  I am 77 and have dry skin.  I use it instead of make-up and it gives me just the right coverage I want. Plus it provides the UV protection is need.  Discovered the product many years ago at the Dermatologist office - was known as Thai Silc then.  I  actually called the Manufacturer to try to buy more and that is how I discovered this new version! Goes  on silky smooth and hydrates a bit as well.  I could be a Rep for this product, I love it so much!</li>
            <li> You will love it...great sunscreen protection...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years , I am 81 yrs old, people compliment me all the time on how great my skin looks. Need I say more?</li>
            <li> This is the best sun screen I have ever used, not greasy, with a little powder, you can look good. I am not&lt;br /&gt;happy about the smaller size 2oz now instead of 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Excllent coverage, it evens out the skin tone and protects it as well.  High quality.</li>
            <li> Nothing I have found compares with the former Neova Ti-Silc spf 45.  It left my face moist and, with it being slightly tinted, sometimes I didn&#x27;t use any foundation.  I used Ti-Silc for several years and never was without it.  Who&#x27;s brainstorm was it to discontinue Ti-Silc, a wonderful product, and try to replace it with this product?  This DNA Damage Control doesn&#x27;t even compare with Ti-Silc!</li>
            <li> Very light (not heavy) on the skin.</li>
            <li> A friend wanted it and she&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product It is a sunscreen plus adds a little color. Took an early morning walk with my daughter in Phoenix and she let me use her Neova. It goes on silky smooth...really like it.</li>
            <li> This product is okay and I&#x27;ve used it for years based on the recommendation of my dermatologist.  I like the Lira sunscreen much better.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel, tint, and results with this product.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was because I wanted the product without parabens which we know are harmful to us.</li>
            <li> Loved the old tinted sunscreen and was very sad when they took it off the market, this one is not as good but still better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> You need to use a good moisturizer before applying it. It can turn a little &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; without applying moisturizer first.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and I have been using it for years, then she stopped carrying it. So I was delighted to find it again. Love it! It takes the place of make-up.</li>
            <li> Good light coverage. Dewey skin. Great protection from the sun. Have used it for years on advice of dermatologist. Best there is.</li>
            <li> The original neova sunscreen had much bigger packaging and costed much less which they have discontinued and came out with this &amp;#34;rip off&amp;#34; product that still works but costs much more for  much less product. I have moved to buy the cheaper Shisido SPF and clinque SPF instead as it fits more in my budget. But if cost is not an issue for you, then you should try this out.</li>
            <li> Preferred Neova Ti-Silc GT SPF 60, but has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;This product does not have as much sun block, and dry outs my skin, and is only 2 oz.</li>
            <li> I have been using this line for years and really like it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just very expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Great for sun protection every day..a moisturizer,  a tinted ,light foundation, and a skin damage repair product, all wrapped up in one.  Very light and sheer.  Its all I need to put on, and go.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the discontinued 60 spf</li>
            <li> Have to say I prefer the original 60 spf.  This one seems to be lighter in color and not as creamy.</li>
            <li> ANOTHER OUTSTANDING PRODUCT THAT I HAVE USED FOR 14 YEARS.  VERY PLEASED AND USED IT EVERYDAY OF THE YEAR NO MATTER WHERE I LIVE.</li>
            <li> I like the old formula better. Please bring it back. It was not as heavy more moisturizing..Left a glow on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA1111</li>
