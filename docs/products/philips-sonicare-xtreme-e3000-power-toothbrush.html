    <ol>
            <li>I consider this the best toothbrush in Philips&#x27; line-up because its obsolesence has been negated by the use of AA batteries.  </li>
            <li>The automatic 2 minute timer is an awesome feature.</li>
            <li>I have used practically all kinds of electric toothbrush over the years and this is the best one that I have come across.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare is the best thing that ever happened to oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>THIS is the incredibly MORONIC part)</li>
            <li>The ideal brush for extended travel.</li>
            <li>this is the ideal road-warrior toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Phillips service was incredible.</li>
            <li>Somebody on the Sonicare/Philips industrial design team thought it was a good ideal to design into this \\&quot;sealing\\</li>
            <li>He has braces as well, and it works great.</li>
            <li>they work great.</li>
            <li>My hygenist says my teeth look great, change the batteries 3-4 times a year, no biggie.  </li>
            <li>Good product, great price.</li>
            <li>This unit uses replaceable AA batteries, and being quite fond of rechargeables, this for me is a good match.</li>
            <li>It blows my mind that someone got paid a goodly amount of money to make this happen.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is a good quality sonicare, but without the rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good for the environment and my budget.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly sure that 1.5 Volts won&#x27;t ZAP!</li>
            <li>It was really impressive when I first heard about the use of ulrtasonic vibrations for cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been impressed with the Xtreme&#x27;s power, which seems to remain consistent over the life of the battery charge.  </li>
            <li>AND the customer service person I spoke with was extremely nice and helpful.</li>
            <li>I am still kind of getting use to it, as a product of habit</li>
            <li>For the two weeks or so that it worked, the Sonicare Xtreme e3000 did a nice job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>However, I also own a Sonicare model with the dedicated/integral battery</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Sonicare&#x27;s awesome customer service sent me a new 1 and all was well until now.  </li>
            <li>GREAT ECONOMICAL TOOTH BRUSH</li>
            <li>The cheap metal contacts droop in a week and then do not make good contact with the batteries</li>
            <li>I liked the concept of not being stuck with a rechargeable unit which has batteries that cannot be replaced - unfortunatley this unit will need to be replaced many times over the rechargeable units (which have more power in the brush strokes than this unit).  </li>
            <li>(they aren&#x27;t cheap! ...</li>
            <li>Crest battery toothbrushes that have found a better way of sealing off the batteries.</li>
            <li>My kids have braces and love the sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>do love the Sonicare Xtreme e3000 and let me tell you why.</li>
            <li>is the guarantee of better checkups, 2-year warranty, and a refund if at all unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>My husband is very much enjoying this brush.</li>
            <li>I found that it works as well as the rechargeable version, and have been extremely pleased with it,  </li>
            <li>Yes it was powerful and good toothbrush for about a week.  </li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t believe how many people complain about battery compartment water damage).</li>
            <li>That was quite impressive for a simple brush you use 2 minutes in the AM and PM.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>They love them and are brushing their teeth more often and better now.</li>
            <li>We returned and bought the rechargeable ones and love it.</li>
            <li>This powered brushing does a much better job on my teeth than I could do manually.</li>
            <li>This one will go with me on trips because it still does a better job than I can manually.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this toothbrush for the eight months it worked.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll also be able to take advantage of longer run times as longer-lived rechargeables come on the market</li>
            <li>, I tend to spend more time using the thing than even the 2.5 minutes, and with replaceable rechargeable NiMH batteries, no need for a battery status indicator array.    </li>
            <li>You can find it at most any automotive parts store (Advance Auto, Autozone, etc.)</li>
            <li>And as NiMH batteries seem to get better after some use, perhaps that will improve as well.      </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it was the most gentle toothbrush I ever had.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to get Sonicare quality and benefits of for very little money and in an attractive package.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to contribute too much to the good ol&#x27; landfill.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy and effortless.</li>
            <li>It is lighweight, easy to travel with, and there is a cap so you don&#x27;t have to wonder what has touched your brush.</li>
            <li>well over 2 weeks now and still going strong.</li>
            <li>and I know from owning both that the battery operated is not as strong a brusher.</li>
            <li>This is a nice toothbrush for a first timer like myself.</li>
            <li>both work fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine with alcaline or nimh batteries.</li>
            <li>This product was introduced quickly after the airline scare banning many carryon items.  </li>
            <li>too - brushing can&#x27;t get the ever important crevices so matter what the tool.</li>
            <li>AA batteries are available everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise though it is a fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The Xtreme is great because it is cheaper than the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Sonicare toothbrush, the brush is a bit smaller (good for smaller mouths, or people with braces), and the fact that it takes batteries, rather than requiring a charger, makes it more portable.  </li>
            <li>But so far so good.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier than the standard toothbrush, and leaves your teeth feeling great!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the sound and the excessive spraying it did.</li>
            <li>I feel pretty confident though with the 2 year warranty, which I will try to take advantage of if need be.</li>
            <li>I got the orange one and my boyfriend has the blue one, so they look real cute on our bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>However, already familiar with the Sonicare experience, I found each and every one of these bells and whistles superfluous.  </li>
            <li>It works wonders, my teeth have never felt so clean</li>
            <li>We have a Sonicare and got this \\&quot;Xtreme\\&quot; for my 14 year old son to encourage more teeth-brushing (and not having to use ours!).</li>
            <li>other great things available but not yet needed</li>
            <li>are TRUE btw</li>
            <li>Overall, I thought this was a good brush for the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read where others have experienced some reliability problems, primarily due to corrosion of the battery contacts.  </li>
            <li>at first I thought it was the cheap batteries that came with it.</li>
            <li>In my mind, an electric toothbrush can more effectively clean those teeth that barely fit in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li>Except for this one major issue, it&#x27;s pretty nifty and nicely priced (</li>
            <li>My 12 year old was ready for a move from a basic toothbrush and while this may not be as great as model as the Elite series, she loves it and is a really good transition model from basic brush to Sonicare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The colors are fun; maybe it will help your kid with teeth brushing.</li>
            <li>It might be worth it if Sonicare added just a touch of knurling or surface roughness to the two grip areas.    </li>
            <li>great toothbrush, batteries last long and unlike built-in rechargable ones are easy to replace.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t hurt, right?</li>
            <li>This will keep the handle, and thus the battery contacts, nice and dry.  </li>
            <li>Also know that with the right precautions, this can be a good little enamel scrubber.</li>
            <li>YES, REALLY!</li>
            <li>I can state that the unit I received seems to be pretty well sealed against water getting into the battery compartment.</li>
            <li>The first time this happened</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t worked since the first week.   </li>
            <li>I wanted to especially mention the batteries because this works a lot better than having to replace worn Sonicare batteries.</li>
            <li>Yipee, I&#x27;m the \\&quot;first to review this product\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Assuming one doesn&#x27;t need those additional features found on the higher priced models.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They quickly sent out a new one with no hassles.</li>
            <li>However, I really don&#x27;t care about the color, I just picked the first one that appeared on the search screen.</li>
            <li>This model is just as powerful as the other Sonicares, btw, but at a MUCH better price.  </li>
            <li>Battery runs out and slew of new fresh replacements are installed, yet toothbrush no longer works.  </li>
            <li>It comes apart so it is easy to store, and it uses regular AAA batteries.</li>
            <li>, there is certain downfalls.</li>
            <li>I feel certain that it has helped me keep the dental doctor away, and maybe even the internist since there&#x27;s that correlation between dental health and heart health.     </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased, and happy I didn&#x27;t toss away more money on one of the fancier models that I know is doomed to fail due to the nonreplaceable NiCad battery.  </li>
            <li>Strong brush power comes from the two double A batteries, although it is very noisy.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if they liked them before purchasing the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>I just bought the Sonicare Xtreme e3000 for my younger daughter, who wears braces, and I am seeing a HUGE difference in the way that her teeth look after brushing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for reading, and be warned.</li>
            <li>The check arrived in reasonable time.</li>
            <li>, hopefully the people from Sonicare read these reviews and will fix it, it really shouldn&#x27;t be the costumer&#x27;s responsibility.</li>
            <li>Also, batteries last only a few weeks at best.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you can travel with it and not take up too much space.  </li>
            <li>(plus, you don&#x27;t have to plug it in; much easier to take on trips).</li>
            <li>I think most of those folks complaining are probably just standing them up while wet.  </li>
            <li>but this one using replacable batteries is so convenient and light especially for traveling.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, you&#x27;ve got to get used to the high frequency vibration and keep the brush in your mouth, otherwise your mirror will stay splattered with fine droplets of toothpaste, kinda like mine.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing a little more thrilling, matches her bathroom decor, and I feel she&#x27;s getting her teeth cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>It definitely leaves you with that clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Not by the buckets full, but enough noticeable traces to make one wonder.     </li>
            <li>but with older batteries tends to cut out every now and then.      </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist, or even a highly paid toothbrush designer ...     </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>That being said, I absolutely CANNOT believe some of the MAJOR design flaws that are absolutely MORONIC and baffling. 1)</li>
            <li>My solution so far has been to use some very sticky tape over this area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten more than 3 out of any of mine, and by then they&#x27;re as limp and soggy as overcooked spaghetti.  </li>
            <li>Like the thin neck, and it has good power.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It costs less, does the exact same job as the more expensive Sonicare models, and the best part: The Xtreme runs on 2 regular AA batteries, avoiding the one problem you&#x27;ll see mentioned in many user comments of all the other Sonicares, that of short battery life</li>
            <li>I tried all kinds of new fresh batteries, swabbed and cleaned the inner battery case, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to make sure to keep it dry though to avoid any future battery problems.</li>
            <li>I installed new batteries, no luck.  </li>
            <li>Would send it in for a new one but...</li>
            <li>Not so with this new Xtreme.    </li>
            <li>I just have Amazon send a pair every 6 months, and pop on a new one at the equinoxes and solstices.    </li>
            <li>I routinely give it a quick rinse and towel it dry and have never found moisture in the battery compartment.    </li>
            <li>Seems fairly decent so far...</li>
            <li>All in all, clearly a FIVE-STAR product!</li>
            <li>Using AA Energizer batteries would even last me over a month of use (performs exactly like those running on integrated reachargeable batteries).  </li>
            <li>Replacing the brush head every only 6 months makes it pretty affordable.</li>
            <li>AS many other reviews stated, the unit is not built to last.  </li>
            <li>I totally agree with the first review.  </li>
            <li>I noticed one of the notches that hold the bottom on tight is broken, leaving a gap which I am almost sure will cause more problems.</li>
            <li>The brush head is sleek enough to get all the hard to reach spaces and keep my whole mouth healthy.</li>
            <li>During that period, I would have to revert to my old manual toothbrush and it wouldn&#x27;t be a surprise to find my gums bleeding.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I rate this brush as \\&quot;really good!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>With the obvious defect that effects some brushes more than others being my only complaint, Iwould have to say this toothbrush is definately worth the money.</li>
            <li>teeth seem much whiter now, probably as white as when I do the whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>I would not waste my money.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it&#x27;s much cheaper than its counterparts and does the same job according to the myriad of reviews I read before purchasing it.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need the soft start</li>
            <li>Plus, even if it dies an early death, I still think the math favors the Xtreme.  </li>
            <li>First, unscrew the handle from the brush head before rinsing off the latter, and store the handle independently, like in a drawer beside your sink.  </li>
            <li>penny-pinchers and recyclers can eke out a few more cents worth of every battery, but you&#x27;ll probably break down and buy rechargable batteries before long.</li>
            <li>It makes the otherwise fairly spiffy design a tad less pretty, but I&#x27;d rather have that than rusty and leaky (and useless) rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li>No need for a Ford or GM major recall type scandal.</li>
            <li>It was - of all things - an Xmas present for my 10 yr old daughter, and she loves it.</li>
            <li>The Amazon price was considerably cheaper than buyinng it locally.</li>
            <li>The battery cantacts are consructed of such soft metal that the pressure of the battery itself will stretch the contacts so they no longer make a connection to the batteries.  </li>
            <li>I had a 3 or 4 year old Sonicare Elite that finally died.  </li>
            <li>It seems to suck tons of power, so only use fresh batteries, but I use rechargeables now to keep costs down.</li>
            <li>What I suggest is that we all rather politely let Sonicare/Philips know of what we all now know, and ask them to design a new cap, and quietly send them out to all current owners.</li>
            <li>Batteries only last a couple of weeks and the unit lets you know you need new ones by simply shutting itself off after just a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li>As a former owner of a Sonicare 7500 Elite, I can tell you definitively that this unit is LESS powerful, but in and of itself, plenty sufficient to keep your pearly whites plenty pearly white.</li>
            <li>The interior black ring is made of some slick \\&quot;plastic-y\\&quot; material instead of a better sealing \\&quot;rubber-y\\&quot; material.</li>
            <li>Seems to run only on brand new Duracells or Evereadys, NOT high quality rechargeable batteries.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll also be able to take advantage of longer run times as longer-lived rechargeables come on the market</li>
            <li> , I tend to spend more time using the thing than even the 2.5 minutes, and with replaceable rechargeable NiMH batteries, no need for a battery status indicator array.    </li>
            <li> You can find it at most any automotive parts store (Advance Auto, Autozone, etc.)</li>
            <li> And as NiMH batteries seem to get better after some use, perhaps that will improve as well.      </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it was the most gentle toothbrush I ever had.  </li>
            <li> This is a great way to get Sonicare quality and benefits of for very little money and in an attractive package.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to contribute too much to the good ol&#x27; landfill.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy and effortless.</li>
            <li> It is lighweight, easy to travel with, and there is a cap so you don&#x27;t have to wonder what has touched your brush.</li>
            <li> well over 2 weeks now and still going strong.</li>
            <li> and I know from owning both that the battery operated is not as strong a brusher.</li>
            <li> This is a nice toothbrush for a first timer like myself.</li>
            <li> both work fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine with alcaline or nimh batteries.</li>
            <li> This product was introduced quickly after the airline scare banning many carryon items.  </li>
            <li> too - brushing can&#x27;t get the ever important crevices so matter what the tool.</li>
            <li> AA batteries are available everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise though it is a fantastic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Xtreme is great because it is cheaper than the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Sonicare toothbrush, the brush is a bit smaller (good for smaller mouths, or people with braces), and the fact that it takes batteries, rather than requiring a charger, makes it more portable.  </li>
            <li> But so far so good.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier than the standard toothbrush, and leaves your teeth feeling great!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the sound and the excessive spraying it did.</li>
            <li> I feel pretty confident though with the 2 year warranty, which I will try to take advantage of if need be.</li>
            <li> I got the orange one and my boyfriend has the blue one, so they look real cute on our bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> However, already familiar with the Sonicare experience, I found each and every one of these bells and whistles superfluous.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders, my teeth have never felt so clean</li>
            <li> We have a Sonicare and got this \\&quot;Xtreme\\&quot; for my 14 year old son to encourage more teeth-brushing (and not having to use ours!).</li>
            <li> other great things available but not yet needed</li>
            <li> are TRUE btw</li>
            <li> Overall, I thought this was a good brush for the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read where others have experienced some reliability problems, primarily due to corrosion of the battery contacts.  </li>
            <li> at first I thought it was the cheap batteries that came with it.</li>
            <li> In my mind, an electric toothbrush can more effectively clean those teeth that barely fit in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Except for this one major issue, it&#x27;s pretty nifty and nicely priced (</li>
            <li> My 12 year old was ready for a move from a basic toothbrush and while this may not be as great as model as the Elite series, she loves it and is a really good transition model from basic brush to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The colors are fun; maybe it will help your kid with teeth brushing.</li>
            <li> It might be worth it if Sonicare added just a touch of knurling or surface roughness to the two grip areas.    </li>
            <li> great toothbrush, batteries last long and unlike built-in rechargable ones are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t hurt, right?</li>
            <li> This will keep the handle, and thus the battery contacts, nice and dry.  </li>
            <li> Also know that with the right precautions, this can be a good little enamel scrubber.</li>
            <li> YES, REALLY!</li>
            <li> I can state that the unit I received seems to be pretty well sealed against water getting into the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> The first time this happened</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t worked since the first week.   </li>
            <li> I wanted to especially mention the batteries because this works a lot better than having to replace worn Sonicare batteries.</li>
            <li> Yipee, I&#x27;m the \\&quot;first to review this product\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Assuming one doesn&#x27;t need those additional features found on the higher priced models.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They quickly sent out a new one with no hassles.</li>
            <li> However, I really don&#x27;t care about the color, I just picked the first one that appeared on the search screen.</li>
            <li> This model is just as powerful as the other Sonicares, btw, but at a MUCH better price.  </li>
            <li> Battery runs out and slew of new fresh replacements are installed, yet toothbrush no longer works.  </li>
            <li> It comes apart so it is easy to store, and it uses regular AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> , there is certain downfalls.</li>
            <li> I feel certain that it has helped me keep the dental doctor away, and maybe even the internist since there&#x27;s that correlation between dental health and heart health.     </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased, and happy I didn&#x27;t toss away more money on one of the fancier models that I know is doomed to fail due to the nonreplaceable NiCad battery.  </li>
            <li> Strong brush power comes from the two double A batteries, although it is very noisy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if they liked them before purchasing the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> I just bought the Sonicare Xtreme e3000 for my younger daughter, who wears braces, and I am seeing a HUGE difference in the way that her teeth look after brushing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for reading, and be warned.</li>
            <li> The check arrived in reasonable time.</li>
            <li> , hopefully the people from Sonicare read these reviews and will fix it, it really shouldn&#x27;t be the costumer&#x27;s responsibility.</li>
            <li> Also, batteries last only a few weeks at best.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can travel with it and not take up too much space.  </li>
            <li> (plus, you don&#x27;t have to plug it in; much easier to take on trips).</li>
            <li> I think most of those folks complaining are probably just standing them up while wet.  </li>
            <li> but this one using replacable batteries is so convenient and light especially for traveling.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, you&#x27;ve got to get used to the high frequency vibration and keep the brush in your mouth, otherwise your mirror will stay splattered with fine droplets of toothpaste, kinda like mine.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing a little more thrilling, matches her bathroom decor, and I feel she&#x27;s getting her teeth cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> It definitely leaves you with that clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> Not by the buckets full, but enough noticeable traces to make one wonder.     </li>
            <li> but with older batteries tends to cut out every now and then.      </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist, or even a highly paid toothbrush designer ...     </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> That being said, I absolutely CANNOT believe some of the MAJOR design flaws that are absolutely MORONIC and baffling. 1)</li>
            <li> My solution so far has been to use some very sticky tape over this area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten more than 3 out of any of mine, and by then they&#x27;re as limp and soggy as overcooked spaghetti.  </li>
            <li> Like the thin neck, and it has good power.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It costs less, does the exact same job as the more expensive Sonicare models, and the best part: The Xtreme runs on 2 regular AA batteries, avoiding the one problem you&#x27;ll see mentioned in many user comments of all the other Sonicares, that of short battery life</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of new fresh batteries, swabbed and cleaned the inner battery case, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to make sure to keep it dry though to avoid any future battery problems.</li>
            <li> I installed new batteries, no luck.  </li>
            <li> Would send it in for a new one but...</li>
            <li> Not so with this new Xtreme.    </li>
            <li> I just have Amazon send a pair every 6 months, and pop on a new one at the equinoxes and solstices.    </li>
            <li> I routinely give it a quick rinse and towel it dry and have never found moisture in the battery compartment.    </li>
            <li> Seems fairly decent so far...</li>
            <li> All in all, clearly a FIVE-STAR product!</li>
            <li> Using AA Energizer batteries would even last me over a month of use (performs exactly like those running on integrated reachargeable batteries).  </li>
            <li> Replacing the brush head every only 6 months makes it pretty affordable.</li>
            <li> AS many other reviews stated, the unit is not built to last.  </li>
            <li> I totally agree with the first review.  </li>
            <li> I noticed one of the notches that hold the bottom on tight is broken, leaving a gap which I am almost sure will cause more problems.</li>
            <li> The brush head is sleek enough to get all the hard to reach spaces and keep my whole mouth healthy.</li>
            <li> During that period, I would have to revert to my old manual toothbrush and it wouldn&#x27;t be a surprise to find my gums bleeding.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I rate this brush as \\&quot;really good!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> With the obvious defect that effects some brushes more than others being my only complaint, Iwould have to say this toothbrush is definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> teeth seem much whiter now, probably as white as when I do the whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> I would not waste my money.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s much cheaper than its counterparts and does the same job according to the myriad of reviews I read before purchasing it.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need the soft start</li>
            <li> Plus, even if it dies an early death, I still think the math favors the Xtreme.  </li>
            <li> First, unscrew the handle from the brush head before rinsing off the latter, and store the handle independently, like in a drawer beside your sink.  </li>
            <li> penny-pinchers and recyclers can eke out a few more cents worth of every battery, but you&#x27;ll probably break down and buy rechargable batteries before long.</li>
            <li> It makes the otherwise fairly spiffy design a tad less pretty, but I&#x27;d rather have that than rusty and leaky (and useless) rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li> No need for a Ford or GM major recall type scandal.</li>
            <li> It was - of all things - an Xmas present for my 10 yr old daughter, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> The Amazon price was considerably cheaper than buyinng it locally.</li>
            <li> The battery cantacts are consructed of such soft metal that the pressure of the battery itself will stretch the contacts so they no longer make a connection to the batteries.  </li>
            <li> I had a 3 or 4 year old Sonicare Elite that finally died.  </li>
            <li> It seems to suck tons of power, so only use fresh batteries, but I use rechargeables now to keep costs down.</li>
            <li> What I suggest is that we all rather politely let Sonicare/Philips know of what we all now know, and ask them to design a new cap, and quietly send them out to all current owners.</li>
            <li> Batteries only last a couple of weeks and the unit lets you know you need new ones by simply shutting itself off after just a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li> As a former owner of a Sonicare 7500 Elite, I can tell you definitively that this unit is LESS powerful, but in and of itself, plenty sufficient to keep your pearly whites plenty pearly white.</li>
            <li> The interior black ring is made of some slick \\&quot;plastic-y\\&quot; material instead of a better sealing \\&quot;rubber-y\\&quot; material.</li>
            <li> Seems to run only on brand new Duracells or Evereadys, NOT high quality rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> The Xtreme doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the features the Elite had, such as a battery power indicator array, a \\&quot;soft start\\&quot; feature where the unit&#x27;s power is dialed down for the first few uses so a newcomer can get accustomed to the appliance, a 30 second \\&quot;quadpacer\\&quot; to help one judge how long to brush the four zones as defined by Sonicare (upper &amp; lower sets of teeth, front and back of each set), or the ability to add an extra 30 seconds to the recommended total brush time.      </li>
            <li> It did feel a little more awkward at first, but I&#x27;m now used to it.  </li>
            <li> The Elite&#x27;s NiCad battery was almost toast and would barely hold a charge through a single session.  </li>
            <li> One positive note: Even though it was briefly past the warranty period, Philips offered a return for refund, which I took.</li>
            <li> I just lie it flat on its back</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;No beeps every 30secs, no battery life indicator, and no soft start (a slower speed that&#x27;s programmed in for its initial 12 uses).  </li>
            <li> and yes, I did notice that the brushing action does diminish over time as the battery runs down.  </li>
            <li> So I really don&#x27;t have a complaint, but those of you who are picky about color be advised, Amazon does occasionally make mistakes.</li>
            <li> long after they will no longer power this toothbrush, so</li>
            <li> I thought the unit might be defective, since I expected it to just run down and get really slow, but fresh batteries brought it immediately back to life.</li>
            <li> I just wish I&#x27;d gone ahead and ordered the replacement brushes at the same time, but some of the other reviews gave me pause.</li>
            <li> Just routine care... rinse and wipe dry after use.  </li>
            <li> everytime you use it (presumably every single day).     </li>
            <li> Looking for a toothbrush capable of cleaning my very hard to reach wisdom teeth (which aren&#x27;t all the way out yet), I stumbled upon this toothbrush on sale at Amazon.</li>
            <li> While I liked the Elite, it irritated me that relatively expensive product seemed designed to fail as NiCads don&#x27;t last all that long.  </li>
            <li> You can store it horizontally (no charging stand to deal with), and it even has a little no-roll ridge on the back of the handle.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this sonicare is that it doesn&#x27;t have the beeps that tell you when to brush a different area.</li>
            <li> I guess my only complaint would be that I ordered the orange model and received the blue.</li>
            <li> Curious.</li>
            <li> us into a coma,</li>
            <li> No real time or money lost, except for the drive to the post office.  </li>
            <li> The other major complaint I&#x27;ve seen concerns the switch.  </li>
            <li> For one, it&#x27;s noisy compared with other power brushes i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t run anymore except for one other time, then i turned it off to rinse and it wouldn&#x27;t start again.</li>
            <li> I had thought that it was abrasive due to the ultrasonic vibrations.  </li>
            <li> The batter cap has a rubber o-ring seal and there are no holes in the cap, nor any at the other end where the brush attaches.</li>
            <li> But all of the other reviews that say this product won&#x27;t work are correct.</li>
            <li> The other day, I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on at all.  </li>
            <li> and I could even get it to stall if I pushed hard enough.  </li>
            <li> When I rinse the bristles I angle the toothbrush down so all the water runs off it into the sink</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the battery run all the way down since you&#x27;ll be compromising your dental health at that point.    </li>
            <li> In fact, run the other way!</li>
            <li> Just get it done and send us that piece that will cost Sonicare/Philips less than 50 cents to make and ship.    </li>
            <li> All the reviews of this brush published here previous to this</li>
            <li> I also went through 2 of these like a previous reviewer...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Xtreme machine for about a month and a half.  </li>
            <li> I have never owned an electric brush, so it has taken me a little while to get used to it because of all the vibrations.  </li>
            <li> after I&#x27;ve shaken the water off and towel dried the head a little bit.  </li>
            <li> My older Elite, well, you could tell when it was time for a recharge without having to look at that silly power indicator, for it would slow down</li>
            <li> It sat unused for a few weeks before I decided to pitch the damn thing in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it wet, except for the bristles, so I haven&#x27;t got any water or corrosion inside the battery compartment like others have complained about.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to floss everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The battery cap at the bottom of the unit does not seal very tightly.</li>
            <li> It was a bit weird though because I changed them with my tv remote batteries and the remote and the toothbrush</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;m a fan of the timer.</li>
            <li> Since then, I would find it hard not to have Philips&#x27; Sonicare toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> It is all hard plastic whereas the Elite had some rubberized areas to improve grip.  </li>
            <li> I bought this despite seeing all the negative reviews regarding water leaking into the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> Now, what does this mean to me and you.</li>
            <li> Then again, MORONS in high places seems rather commonplace these days (ha ha).</li>
            <li> but I think we all know that batteries and water&#x3D; NOT GOOD ... or</li>
            <li> Every one of them has been trouble, and all the trouble is in the base.</li>
            <li> Totally useless and maddening.</li>
            <li> WTF...</li>
            <li> (fix: open base, extend contacts) and the base O-ring always fails and in no time the contacts corrode.</li>
            <li> It began cutting out on me,</li>
            <li> Wiggling my thumb or finger around on the rubber button cover, while also depressing it, seems to solve the problem.  </li>
            <li> WTF!      </li>
            <li> even &#x3D; RATHER BAD.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t edit the stars for the review (can I?).</li>
            <li> Bad connection inside or shorting out?</li>
            <li> switch went bad within a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Totally worthless purchase.</li>
            <li> It is annoying but not a deal breaker for me.    </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> I just had to replace the batteries, after 2 months, which isn&#x27;t awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As a former owner of a Sonicare 7500 Elite, I can tell you definitively that this unit is LESS powerful, but in and of itself, plenty sufficient to keep your pearly whites plenty pearly white. It actually (on the surface) has some advantages: My 7500 died after about 3 years. It seemed that it could no longer hold a charge. This unit uses replaceable AA batteries, and being quite fond of rechargeables, this for me is a good match. (Another reviewer mentioned she had problems with 1.2V rechargeables vs. 1.5V standard batteries. I have had no such problems with my 1.2V&#x27;s. Been running on the same set (same charge) well over 2 weeks now and still going strong. Curious. Hmm...).     That being said, I absolutely CANNOT believe some of the MAJOR design flaws that are absolutely MORONIC and baffling. 1) The battery cap at the bottom of the unit does not seal very tightly. The interior black ring is made of some slick \\&quot;plastic-y\\&quot; material instead of a better sealing \\&quot;rubber-y\\&quot; material. 2)(And THIS is the incredibly MORONIC part) At the bottom of this orange battery sealing cap, there are 2 HOLES! YES, REALLY! Somebody on the Sonicare/Philips industrial design team thought it was a good ideal to design into this \\&quot;sealing\\&quot; cap TWO holes so that water can get into the battery chamber when you rinse the foam off of your electric toothbrush everytime you use it (presumably every single day).     Does water actually leak into this battery chamber? I took my batteries out and tested it. Yes indeed water gets in here. Now, it blows my mind that this can pass the designers, the execs, the production line and everyone in between and after, and reach you and me, the consumers. It blows my mind that someone got paid a goodly amount of money to make this happen. Then again, MORONS in high places seems rather commonplace these days (ha ha). Now, what does this mean to me and you. I&#x27;m fairly sure that 1.5 Volts won&#x27;t ZAP! us into a coma, but I think we all know that batteries and water&#x3D; NOT GOOD ... or even &#x3D; RATHER BAD. It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist, or even a highly paid toothbrush designer ...     My solution so far has been to use some very sticky tape over this area. It makes the otherwise fairly spiffy design a tad less pretty, but I&#x27;d rather have that than rusty and leaky (and useless) rechargeable batteries (they aren&#x27;t cheap! ... and after all, the point is \\&quot;re-use-ability\\&quot; and \\&quot;re-new-ability\\&quot;, is it not?). Even with this precaution, I check this chamber now and then, and water still gets in (and toothpaste foam, too). Not by the buckets full, but enough noticeable traces to make one wonder.     Now, I know it&#x27;s not a matter of prohibitive cost, because I have used [...]-pola Crest battery toothbrushes that have found a better way of sealing off the batteries. What I suggest is that we all rather politely let Sonicare/Philips know of what we all now know, and ask them to design a new cap, and quietly send them out to all current owners. No need for a Ford or GM major recall type scandal. Just get it done and send us that piece that will cost Sonicare/Philips less than 50 cents to make and ship.    Thanks for reading, and be warned. Also know that with the right precautions, this can be a good little enamel scrubber. Except for this one major issue, it&#x27;s pretty nifty and nicely priced (about 1/3 of the 7500 Elite).     Cheers!     URGENT UPDATE: FORGET THIS PRODUCT!!! In fact, run the other way! My unit died just very shortly after this review. The water leak problem proved unavoidable and did eventually short out the circuitry. Totally useless and maddening. Horrible. Too bad I can&#x27;t edit the stars for the review (can I?). It would be a resounding ZERO stars. One positive note: Even though it was briefly past the warranty period, Philips offered a return for refund, which I took. The check arrived in reasonable time. AND the customer service person I spoke with was extremely nice and helpful.</li>
            <li> Totally worthless purchase. For one, it&#x27;s noisy compared with other power brushes i&#x27;ve had. It began cutting out on me, at first I thought it was the cheap batteries that came with it. Then I replaced them and it continued to cut out. Bad connection inside or shorting out? I kept taking it apart to look at, changed batteries again and still nothing. It wouldn&#x27;t run anymore except for one other time, then i turned it off to rinse and it wouldn&#x27;t start again. It sat unused for a few weeks before I decided to pitch the damn thing in the garbage. I never did bother finding the paper work to return it. Isolated case of a lemon? Who knows. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the sound and the excessive spraying it did.</li>
            <li> It was really impressive when I first heard about the use of ulrtasonic vibrations for cleaning teeth.  I had thought that it was abrasive due to the ultrasonic vibrations.  Surprisingly, it was the most gentle toothbrush I ever had.  I had orignally bought the integrated rechargeable battery version of this toothbrush (charge would last for 2 weeks - that is being used twice a day).  When that rechargeable version would go low on battery, I would have to charge it for 1.5 days.  During that period, I would have to revert to my old manual toothbrush and it wouldn&#x27;t be a surprise to find my gums bleeding.  Since then, I would find it hard not to have Philips&#x27; Sonicare toothbrush.    Then came Philips Sonicare Xtreme that ran on 2xAA batteries.  I consider this the best toothbrush in Philips&#x27; line-up because its obsolesence has been negated by the use of AA batteries.  Using AA Energizer batteries would even last me over a month of use (performs exactly like those running on integrated reachargeable batteries).  The only wish I had is that Philips should have included the \\&quot;beep\\&quot; notification every 30 seconds on this toothbrush.  Overall, I rate this brush as \\&quot;really good!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My kids have braces and love the sonicare toothbrushes. This toothbrush is a good quality sonicare, but without the rechargeable batteries. It uses 2 AA batteries instead. The batteries last well over a month. My only complaint about this sonicare is that it doesn&#x27;t have the beeps that tell you when to brush a different area. It only has the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush since Christmas and I absolutely love it. Being my first electric toothbrush, it was a bit uncomfortable feeling at first. I am still kind of getting use to it, as a product of habit I often use my manual toothbrush.  &lt;br /&gt;I do love the Sonicare Xtreme e3000 and let me tell you why. Looking for a toothbrush capable of cleaning my very hard to reach wisdom teeth (which aren&#x27;t all the way out yet), I stumbled upon this toothbrush on sale at Amazon. Of course my initial attraction was the color (orange!&amp;white) In my mind, an electric toothbrush can more effectively clean those teeth that barely fit in the back of my mouth. The brush head is sleek enough to get all the hard to reach spaces and keep my whole mouth healthy. It works wonders, my teeth have never felt so clean and it&#x27;s so easy and effortless. The automatic 2 minute timer is an awesome feature. It is lighweight, easy to travel with, and there is a cap so you don&#x27;t have to wonder what has touched your brush. &lt;br /&gt;The other great things available but not yet needed is the guarantee of better checkups, 2-year warranty, and a refund if at all unsatisfied. Replacing the brush head every only 6 months makes it pretty affordable. &lt;br /&gt;With anything though, there is certain downfalls. I just had to replace the batteries, after 2 months, which isn&#x27;t awful. It was a bit weird though because I changed them with my tv remote batteries and the remote and the toothbrush both work fine. So there is definately a product default there somewhere, hopefully the people from Sonicare read these reviews and will fix it, it really shouldn&#x27;t be the costumer&#x27;s responsibility. I noticed one of the notches that hold the bottom on tight is broken, leaving a gap which I am almost sure will cause more problems. I feel pretty confident though with the 2 year warranty, which I will try to take advantage of if need be. With the obvious defect that effects some brushes more than others being my only complaint, Iwould have to say this toothbrush is definately worth the money. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My husband is very much enjoying this brush. I have noticed almost immediately that his teeth got whiter and shinier. The only thing is, you&#x27;ve got to get used to the high frequency vibration and keep the brush in your mouth, otherwise your mirror will stay splattered with fine droplets of toothpaste, kinda like mine.</li>
            <li> WTF...I&#x27;m on the road to Sonicare e3000 NUMBER 3 now.  The 1st 1 refused to work after the battery ran out.  I tried all kinds of new fresh batteries, swabbed and cleaned the inner battery case, etc.  NOTHING worked.      Sonicare&#x27;s awesome customer service sent me a new 1 and all was well until now.  Battery runs out and slew of new fresh replacements are installed, yet toothbrush no longer works.  NO SHT!  WTF!      I&#x27;m no electronics dummy.  I know my stuff, but this gets the cake.      All the reviews of this brush published here previous to this are TRUE btw: the Sonicare brush is a gr8 tool for cleaning teeth...WHEN IT IS WORKING.    UPDATE!  This Sonicare toothbrush is now operational.  Has been for months since I initially wrote this review. I don&#x27;t get it.  Works well but with older batteries tends to cut out every now and then.      The thing is when you press the On button you have this lingering doubt that it will not turn on.  But so far so good.  Seems to run only on brand new Duracells or Evereadys, NOT high quality rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use exclusively for travel.  I found that it works as well as the rechargeable version, and have been extremely pleased with it,  It comes apart so it is easy to store, and it uses regular AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to get Sonicare quality and benefits of for very little money and in an attractive package. It was - of all things - an Xmas present for my 10 yr old daughter, and she loves it. It makes brushing a little more thrilling, matches her bathroom decor, and I feel she&#x27;s getting her teeth cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.    Good product, great price. Go for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Xtreme e3000 for about 3 months now and have no complaints. The Amazon price was considerably cheaper than buyinng it locally. I just wish I&#x27;d gone ahead and ordered the replacement brushes at the same time, but some of the other reviews gave me pause. I can state that the unit I received seems to be pretty well sealed against water getting into the battery compartment. The batter cap has a rubber o-ring seal and there are no holes in the cap, nor any at the other end where the brush attaches. Maybe earlier models are prone to water damage, but mine has not been a problem. I routinely give it a quick rinse and towel it dry and have never found moisture in the battery compartment.    Batteries only last a couple of weeks and the unit lets you know you need new ones by simply shutting itself off after just a couple of seconds. The first time this happened I thought the unit might be defective, since I expected it to just run down and get really slow, but fresh batteries brought it immediately back to life. AA alkaline batteries can still be used in low-draw appliances, such as wall clocks, calculators, TV remotes, etc. long after they will no longer power this toothbrush, so penny-pinchers and recyclers can eke out a few more cents worth of every battery, but you&#x27;ll probably break down and buy rechargable batteries before long. I did.    I guess my only complaint would be that I ordered the orange model and received the blue. However, I really don&#x27;t care about the color, I just picked the first one that appeared on the search screen. So I really don&#x27;t have a complaint, but those of you who are picky about color be advised, Amazon does occasionally make mistakes.</li>
            <li> GREAT ECONOMICAL TOOTH BRUSH THE BATTERIES MUST BE REPLACED AFTER ABOUT 2 HOURS OF USAGE THOUGH</li>
            <li> Every one of them has been trouble, and all the trouble is in the base. The cheap metal contacts droop in a week and then do not make good contact with the batteries (fix: open base, extend contacts) and the base O-ring always fails and in no time the contacts corrode. Also, batteries last only a few weeks at best. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> It stopped working after 12 days.  Sent it back to Amazon for a refund.  No real time or money lost, except for the drive to the post office.  But all of the other reviews that say this product won&#x27;t work are correct.</li>
            <li> AS many other reviews stated, the unit is not built to last.  The snap on plastic bottom in the battery compartment will break even with the utmost care.  Water and humidity will get in and zap out the circuitry - as well as shorting out the batteries. The battery cantacts are consructed of such soft metal that the pressure of the battery itself will stretch the contacts so they no longer make a connection to the batteries.  My unit lasted a bit longer than some I&#x27;ve read here - 3 months.  I liked the concept of not being stuck with a rechargeable unit which has batteries that cannot be replaced - unfortunatley this unit will need to be replaced many times over the rechargeable units (which have more power in the brush strokes than this unit).  From all these reviews it is obvious that this is a defectivly designed unit, and should be recalled, discontinued, or perfected.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  Yes it was powerful and good toothbrush for about a week.  But it isn&#x27;t waterproof so it stopped working.  I can&#x27;t believe they make toothbrushes such as this and not make them waterproof.  It hasn&#x27;t worked since the first week.   Don&#x27;t buy this item.  Listen to the reviews.  It will not work for longer than a month!  It&#x27;s junk!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice toothbrush for a first timer like myself. Strong brush power comes from the two double A batteries, although it is very noisy. It seems to suck tons of power, so only use fresh batteries, but I use rechargeables now to keep costs down. I don&#x27;t get it wet, except for the bristles, so I haven&#x27;t got any water or corrosion inside the battery compartment like others have complained about. When I rinse the bristles I angle the toothbrush down so all the water runs off it into the sink (I can&#x27;t believe how many people complain about battery compartment water damage). I&#x27;ve used it for about 6 months now with no problem. I used a coupon to buy ($20) it so if it breaks I won&#x27;t be too concerned. I&#x27;m going to make sure to keep it dry though to avoid any future battery problems. Seems fairly decent so far...</li>
            <li> My 12 year old was ready for a move from a basic toothbrush and while this may not be as great as model as the Elite series, she loves it and is a really good transition model from basic brush to Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Overall, I thought this was a good brush for the price.  I have never owned an electric brush, so it has taken me a little while to get used to it because of all the vibrations.  It definitely leaves you with that clean feeling.  I got the orange one and my boyfriend has the blue one, so they look real cute on our bathroom sink.  I like the fact that you can travel with it and not take up too much space.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our teeth seem much whiter now, probably as white as when I do the whitening strips.  That was quite impressive for a simple brush you use 2 minutes in the AM and PM.  I highly recommend it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Only draw back: the battery lasts for about 1-2 months, so get some rechargeables.</li>
            <li> I totally agree with the first review.  We have a Sonicare and got this \\&quot;Xtreme\\&quot; for my 14 year old son to encourage more teeth-brushing (and not having to use ours!). He has braces as well, and it works great. I wanted to especially mention the batteries because this works a lot better than having to replace worn Sonicare batteries. (plus, you don&#x27;t have to plug it in; much easier to take on trips). This model is just as powerful as the other Sonicares, btw, but at a MUCH better price.  &lt;br /&gt;The colors are fun; maybe it will help your kid with teeth brushing. Can&#x27;t hurt, right?</li>
            <li> I bought this despite seeing all the negative reviews regarding water leaking into the battery compartment.  That was over 3 months ago and I&#x27;ve been using it daily, even bringing it with me during my trips.  I think most of those folks complaining are probably just standing them up while wet.  I just lie it flat on its back (horizonal) after I&#x27;ve shaken the water off and towel dried the head a little bit.  I&#x27;ve had to replace the batteries after 2 months and yes, I did notice that the brushing action does diminish over time as the battery runs down.  Don&#x27;t let the battery run all the way down since you&#x27;ll be compromising your dental health at that point.    My teeth does feel cleaner and my dentist confirms this as well.  Don&#x27;t forget to floss since this is not a replacement for that.</li>
            <li> I use my PHilips Sonicare 3 times daily and I love it.  It is much easier than the standard toothbrush, and leaves your teeth feeling great!</li>
            <li> I have used practically all kinds of electric toothbrush over the years and this is the best one that I have come across.  I have rechargeable Soniccare toothbrush also but this one using replacable batteries is so convenient and light especially for traveling.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my grandson who is 11.  He went through a lot of batteries trying to get this to work, but the batteries continually wore out.  I returned it to sonicare for their 90 day guarantee.  I would not waste my money.</li>
            <li> I am a Sonicare owner and bought these for my children as a gift. I wanted to see if they liked them before purchasing the more expensive models. They love them and are brushing their teeth more often and better now. The next purchase will be a rechargeable one.</li>
            <li> For the two weeks or so that it worked, the Sonicare Xtreme e3000 did a nice job cleaning my teeth. Then it stopped working. The problem seemed to be in the on/off switch.  I sent it back to the company, which refunded my purchase price a couple of months later.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s much cheaper than its counterparts and does the same job according to the myriad of reviews I read before purchasing it.    I power it with recyclable batteries so it&#x27;s good for the environment and my budget. I feel certain that it has helped me keep the dental doctor away, and maybe even the internist since there&#x27;s that correlation between dental health and heart health.     Don&#x27;t forget to floss everyday too - brushing can&#x27;t get the ever important crevices so matter what the tool.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush broke within 3 weeks.  We returned and bought the rechargeable ones and love it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This product was introduced quickly after the airline scare banning many carryon items.  I wonder if it was only a coincidence that Sonicare finally has a toothbrush that uses regular batteries.  This powered brushing does a much better job on my teeth than I could do manually. However, I also own a Sonicare model with the dedicated/integral battery and I know from owning both that the battery operated is not as strong a brusher. After the batteries died, I switched back to the rechargeable sonicare.  This one will go with me on trips because it still does a better job than I can manually.</li>
            <li> The ideal brush for extended travel. No hassles with power incompatibility issues in Asia or Europe. No additional charger to carry. AA batteries are available everywhere.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Have used regularly for four months and no problems with leakage. Just routine care... rinse and wipe dry after use.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Forget teens and braces this is the ideal road-warrior toothbrush. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this toothbrush for the eight months it worked.  The other day, I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on at all.  I installed new batteries, no luck.  Cleaned out all the ins and outs, still no luck.  I&#x27;m a bit heart-broken.</li>
            <li> I also went through 2 of these like a previous reviewer...they work great. But after its second set of batteries it dies...so for 2 of these toothbrushes I got almost 2 months of use total.     Would send it in for a new one but...I feel that it would likely break again and I don&#x27;t want to contribute too much to the good ol&#x27; landfill. Otherwise though it is a fantastic toothbrush. Not sure I&#x27;m a fan of the timer.</li>
            <li> Yipee, I&#x27;m the \\&quot;first to review this product\\&quot;. I&#x27;m doing so to save you time and eyestrain. Put yourself out of web-reading Hell, and just buy this Sonicare Xtreme model now.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It costs less, does the exact same job as the more expensive Sonicare models, and the best part: The Xtreme runs on 2 regular AA batteries, avoiding the one problem you&#x27;ll see mentioned in many user comments of all the other Sonicares, that of short battery life w/no way to replace the rapidly dying built-in ones.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sonicare told me this model runs at the same speed etc, and does the job every bit as well as their higher-end ones, but lacks the following non-essential features: &lt;br /&gt;No beeps every 30secs, no battery life indicator, and no soft start (a slower speed that&#x27;s programmed in for its initial 12 uses).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This model uses the E-series of replacement brush heads, same as the high-end models.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was told by Sonicare to expect 80-100 uses per set of alkalines.  &lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to keep buying batteries, get yourself a set of 4 AA rechargeable batteries and charger, and you&#x27;ll be set for years. You&#x27;ll also be able to take advantage of longer run times as longer-lived rechargeables come on the market (this happens about every year). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have one, and see no negatives to its design at all. -And a bonus- You can store it horizontally (no charging stand to deal with), and it even has a little no-roll ridge on the back of the handle. Nice.</li>
            <li> great toothbrush, batteries last long and unlike built-in rechargable ones are easy to replace. Works fine with alcaline or nimh batteries.</li>
            <li> switch went bad within a couple of months. Phillips service was incredible. &lt;br /&gt;They quickly sent out a new one with no hassles. I would recommend the rechargable that beeps every 30 seconds for daily use.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is the best thing that ever happened to oral hygiene.  I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for several years, and I always get compliments from the dental hygienist on the condition of my teeth.  I just bought the Sonicare Xtreme e3000 for my younger daughter, who wears braces, and I am seeing a HUGE difference in the way that her teeth look after brushing.  The Xtreme is great because it is cheaper than the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Sonicare toothbrush, the brush is a bit smaller (good for smaller mouths, or people with braces), and the fact that it takes batteries, rather than requiring a charger, makes it more portable.  All in all, clearly a FIVE-STAR product!</li>
            <li> I had a 3 or 4 year old Sonicare Elite that finally died.  The Elite&#x27;s NiCad battery was almost toast and would barely hold a charge through a single session.  But what did it in was the rubber cover on the switch ripped, water got in and fried the electronics.    While I liked the Elite, it irritated me that relatively expensive product seemed designed to fail as NiCads don&#x27;t last all that long.  So I though I&#x27;d try this, cheaper version with user replaceable batteries.    The Xtreme doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the features the Elite had, such as a battery power indicator array, a \\&quot;soft start\\&quot; feature where the unit&#x27;s power is dialed down for the first few uses so a newcomer can get accustomed to the appliance, a 30 second \\&quot;quadpacer\\&quot; to help one judge how long to brush the four zones as defined by Sonicare (upper &amp; lower sets of teeth, front and back of each set), or the ability to add an extra 30 seconds to the recommended total brush time.      However, already familiar with the Sonicare experience, I found each and every one of these bells and whistles superfluous.  Don&#x27;t need the soft start, I tend to spend more time using the thing than even the 2.5 minutes, and with replaceable rechargeable NiMH batteries, no need for a battery status indicator array.    The casing on the Xtreme is a bit fatter as well, to accommodate two AA batteries.  It is all hard plastic whereas the Elite had some rubberized areas to improve grip.  It did feel a little more awkward at first, but I&#x27;m now used to it.  It might be worth it if Sonicare added just a touch of knurling or surface roughness to the two grip areas.    I&#x27;ve read where others have experienced some reliability problems, primarily due to corrosion of the battery contacts.  Two simple precautions:  First, unscrew the handle from the brush head before rinsing off the latter, and store the handle independently, like in a drawer beside your sink.  This will keep the handle, and thus the battery contacts, nice and dry.  Second,if you&#x27;re still concerned about it, apply a touch of dielectric grease to the contacts.  This is the stuff mechanics squirt into spark plug wire boots so they don&#x27;t stick and make removal easier when the time comes to change spark plugs.  You can find it at most any automotive parts store (Advance Auto, Autozone, etc.) or maybe even Wally World, though I haven&#x27;t checked there.    The other major complaint I&#x27;ve seen concerns the switch.  My unit is also a bit persnickety as well.  Sometimes you can hear the switch click but it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;make\\&quot;.  Wiggling my thumb or finger around on the rubber button cover, while also depressing it, seems to solve the problem.  It is annoying but not a deal breaker for me.    I&#x27;ve also been impressed with the Xtreme&#x27;s power, which seems to remain consistent over the life of the battery charge.  My older Elite, well, you could tell when it was time for a recharge without having to look at that silly power indicator, for it would slow down and I could even get it to stall if I pushed hard enough.  Not so with this new Xtreme.    I seem to get about 2 weeks out of a set of Duracell 2300 mAH batteries, using the appliance twice a day, about 3 or 4 minutes each.  And as NiMH batteries seem to get better after some use, perhaps that will improve as well.      Sonicare claims the brush head should be replaced at 6 month intervals.  Hah!  I&#x27;ve never gotten more than 3 out of any of mine, and by then they&#x27;re as limp and soggy as overcooked spaghetti.  I just have Amazon send a pair every 6 months, and pop on a new one at the equinoxes and solstices.    I&#x27;ve had this Xtreme machine for about a month and a half.  So far, I&#x27;m pleased, and happy I didn&#x27;t toss away more money on one of the fancier models that I know is doomed to fail due to the nonreplaceable NiCad battery.  Plus, even if it dies an early death, I still think the math favors the Xtreme.  Assuming one doesn&#x27;t need those additional features found on the higher priced models.</li>
            <li> Like the thin neck, and it has good power.  My hygenist says my teeth look great, change the batteries 3-4 times a year, no biggie.  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
