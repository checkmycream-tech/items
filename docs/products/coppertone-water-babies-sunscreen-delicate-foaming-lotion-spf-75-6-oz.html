            <li>The best thing is that&#x27;s pretty quickly to use it and</li>
            <li>Many times we put it on upstairs before putting shirts on to avoid the blowing away in the wind, or getting it on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love it, and have never burned through it.</li>

            <li>so it is great for applying on small squirmy children.  </li>
            <li>I applied this to my one year old daughter and it is NOT tear free.</li>
            <li>so I thought that the foaming quality might help get her interested</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural redhead with translucent skin, and I have no intention of seeing if my children will tan left to their own devices, so we do the &amp;#34;clear</li>

            <li>When my then four year old came up and begged for sunscreen I about fainted--but it&#x27;s fun to put on.</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;re really diligent about sun protection.</li>
            <li>I used many other spray on products.  </li>
            <li>I tried this sunscreen when on vacation for ten days in Southern California, and I am happy to report that I did not get a single sunburn while wearing it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that sunblock over this one.</li>
            <li>, every company it seems, makes high spf sunscreen for faces exclusively.</li>

            <li>I rather feel a little greasy when I freshly apply it than get burned.</li>
            <li>It ruined my husband&#x27;s brand new white shirt with horrid yellow stains that I couldn&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li>And then I was scared to death to put any other sunscreen on his face that day, which makes for a very paranoid mommy at a waterpark trying to keep a hat on the child at all times.....</li>
            <li>It completely ruined our trip to the splash pad because by time we got there, she only played for 15 minutes and then was ready for a nap because of all the crying she did.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the mess, staining, and short-lived protection made it a very subpar product I would never recommend.</li>

            <li> It is at least $3 less a bottle at Walmart and if your family buys sunscreen as often as ours does, this makes a huge difference over the course of one summer.</li>

            <li> letting it dry some).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little messy to put on (I recommend doing it with limited clothing on initially, then</li>
            <li> foam is harder to apply to small areas such as the face of a child</li>
            <li> With the foam, a little goes a long way and no one in our family has ever gotten a sunburn while using this product.  </li>
            <li> My daughter broke out in a rash from it, which has never happened before with other brands.</li>
            <li> but so does every other sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> To address the other reviewer&#x27;s issue of burning eyes, I use a stick sunscreen applicator on my daughter&#x27;s face and would definitely recommend that for small children.</li>
            <li> My poor daughter got her first sunburn because this product failed to live up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> Less mess than lotions (for me anyway- seems other reviewers had a problem with a mess?)</li>
            <li> I always got slightly burned.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product but it can be difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> so you would think it would be less mess, but we all had trouble not getting it all over our clothes.</li>
            <li> can be messy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I am missing spots and it seems to absorb quicker than lotion does.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I found out the hard way that it barely lasts an hour before needing reapplication.</li>
            <li> I also did not use it on my face, so I&#x27;m not sure about whether or not it will irritate eyes.</li>
            <li> Easiest to apply to small children.</li>
            <li> we used to get this sunscreen foam in the stores, but all I see lately is either lotion or sprays.  </li>
            <li> It goes on thick, and my kids never got burnt or looked like they were lathered up with crisco.</li>
            <li> This is not good sunscreen for kids, or adults applying it.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty awful, too.</li>
            <li> Transport costs are too expensive, and too slow.</li>
            <li> so I take sun care very seriously, and in 5 years of using this product I&#x27;ve never had a problem with sunburn even after 3+ hours in the mid-summer sun.  </li>
            <li> and she cried for at least 30 minutes because they were burning so bad.</li>
            <li> I am NOT happy with this product and do not plan on ever buying Coppertone anything from now on!</li>
            <li> Compared to typical lotion in a plastic squeeze container, this foaming product is very annoying.  </li>
            <li> Worst idea for sunscreen ever.</li>
            <li> Since my youngest is in the terrible two&#x27;s</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Like the sunscreen in that I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my son getting burned while we have depended on it, HOWEVER, this time after we \\&quot;lotioned\\&quot; him up, my son rubbed his eyes and they instantly puffed up and he cried for a good 45 minutes until I could get somewhere to wash the lotion off with gentle soap and water. And then I was scared to death to put any other sunscreen on his face that day, which makes for a very paranoid mommy at a waterpark trying to keep a hat on the child at all times.....stick with tear free, moms and dads.</li>
            <li> I have an infant and a 3 year old.  This is handy for using on both of them and makes it pretty easy to apply to squirmy kids.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this for my 1-year-old for our beach vacation. After using it once, I will never use it again. It contains alcohol and is, therefore, NOT \\&quot;tear free.\\&quot; It does not claim to be, but somehow I missed this important point when purchasing it. He&#x27;s a baby; he rubs his eyes. And he did so right after we lathered him up. We washed his eyes out the best we could, but he still proceeded to scream/cry in pain for the next 30+ minutes. The next day I used [[ASIN:B002Y26RXG Banana Boat Kids Tear Free UltraMist SPF 50 Twin Pack Twin Pack - 2 Bottles w/6oz each, 12-Ounce Bottle]] which is \\&quot;Tear Free.\\&quot; Even after he rubbed his eyes, we had no problems whatsoever with the Banana Boat sunblock. The spf was also good for his fair skin. I highly recommend that sunblock over this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good product. Transport costs are too expensive, and too slow. Hope to be able to choose a good courier.</li>
            <li> Compared to typical lotion in a plastic squeeze container, this foaming product is very annoying.  This review is against foaming sunscreen lotion in general.&lt;br /&gt;-the foam is harder to apply to small areas such as the face of a child&lt;br /&gt;-it cannot be applied in the wind, it will blow away before you get a chance to rub&lt;br /&gt;-the container has a removable lid. Yet another thing to loose!&lt;br /&gt;-its harder to tell how much is left in the can</li>
            <li> This is not good sunscreen for kids, or adults applying it. It is really greasy, and therefore quite messy. It is a foam so you would think it would be less mess, but we all had trouble not getting it all over our clothes. My daughter broke out in a rash from it, which has never happened before with other brands. I would stick with banana boat. I like their baby spf100. It goes on thick, and my kids never got burnt or looked like they were lathered up with crisco.</li>
            <li> I ONLY gave this one star because that is the lowest you can give! I applied this to my one year old daughter and it is NOT tear free. Her eyes were so red and swollen and she cried for at least 30 minutes because they were burning so bad. I have never seen her eyes swell up like they did. It completely ruined our trip to the splash pad because by time we got there, she only played for 15 minutes and then was ready for a nap because of all the crying she did. I am NOT happy with this product and do not plan on ever buying Coppertone anything from now on!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a gimmick, but one that works. When my then four year old came up and begged for sunscreen I about fainted--but it&#x27;s fun to put on. Yes, you should avoid the eyes. Yes, it stains--but so does every other sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m a natural redhead with translucent skin, and I have no intention of seeing if my children will tan left to their own devices, so we do the &amp;#34;clear coat&amp;#34; before leaving the house every day. Many times we put it on upstairs before putting shirts on to avoid the blowing away in the wind, or getting it on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a sunscreen hater, then it&#x27;s at least worth a try. We love it, and have never burned through it.</li>
            <li> we used to get this sunscreen foam in the stores, but all I see lately is either lotion or sprays.  I don&#x27;t feel comfortable spraying my children and the lotion can be messy to apply.  The foam is awesome and the kids find it fun, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still can&#x27;t find it in any stores so I am glad to be able to get it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I loved spray sunscreen, but with all the news about the harm inhaling propellants can cause, I looked for an alternative and this is genius. My kids love the novelty of spray that foams up, so they let me put it on. It spreads on easily and is gentle enough that my eczema-prone babe can wear it without mishap. And PS This product is for bodies. Coppertone, Neutrogena, California Baby, every company it seems, makes high spf sunscreen for faces exclusively. To those parents who tried this unsuccessfully on faces, try a stick. It will not run into eyes or mouths.</li>
            <li> Worst idea for sunscreen ever. It&#x27;s hard to gauge how much to press out because its like hair mousse..it foofs up in your hand, and of its windy, it blows away! Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s greasy and sticky. The smell is pretty awful, too.</li>
            <li> I am a young Caucasian female who has struggled with sunburn her whole life. I tried this sunscreen when on vacation for ten days in Southern California, and I am happy to report that I did not get a single sunburn while wearing it. There&#x27;s no doubt that this stuff works. The only drawbacks are that it does stay a bit greasy and it&#x27;s a little messy to put on (I recommend doing it with limited clothing on initially, then letting it dry some). I also did not use it on my face, so I&#x27;m not sure about whether or not it will irritate eyes. I can&#x27;t speak for using it in water, either. But if you&#x27;re looking for a surefire way to prevent sunburn, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does what it claims to do.  Nowhere on the bottle is written it is tear free.  My family has very fair skin.  We used it a water park for 4 hours in bright sun.  No one got sun burned.  I used many other spray on products.  I always got slightly burned.  I rather feel a little greasy when I freshly apply it than get burned.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that is easy for our older kids to rub in themselves.  With the foam, a little goes a long way and no one in our family has ever gotten a sunburn while using this product.  It is not tear free but does not claim to be.  If you are looking for a low-maintenance product that kids can help apply themselves then this is the product for you.  My only advice would be to get it from Walmart (and I always prefer Amazon over Walmart) because of the substantial difference in the price.  It is at least $3 less a bottle at Walmart and if your family buys sunscreen as often as ours does, this makes a huge difference over the course of one summer.</li>
            <li> I picked this product up because of the high SPF. Skin cancer runs in my family so we&#x27;re really diligent about sun protection. Since my youngest is in the terrible two&#x27;s she&#x27;s not a fan of sitting still long enough to get lotioned up so I thought that the foaming quality might help get her interested and fortunately it did! She was happy to help me rub the foam all over but it ended up EVERYWHERE. The foam would fall off our hands onto the floor, towel, carseat, our clothes. It ruined my husband&#x27;s brand new white shirt with horrid yellow stains that I couldn&#x27;t get out. To make matters worse, I found out the hard way that it barely lasts an hour before needing reapplication. My poor daughter got her first sunburn because this product failed to live up to it&#x27;s claims. In addition to all of that it&#x27;s stingy and I found it was getting in all of our mouths from washing away with sweat, the nastiest stuff that will not go away once you taste it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely not be buying this one again. The only positive about it was that the gimmicky nature helped me get my little girl to hold still long enough to get it on her. Otherwise the mess, staining, and short-lived protection made it a very subpar product I would never recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen. Easiest to apply to small children. No risk of inhaling harmful fumes like spray sunscreen. Less mess than lotions (for me anyway- seems other reviewers had a problem with a mess?)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product but it can be difficult to find in stores.  It is easier to apply than lotion and provides better coverage than a spray so it is great for applying on small squirmy children.  I don&#x27;t feel like I am missing spots and it seems to absorb quicker than lotion does.  My daughter is red-headed and very fair skinned so I take sun care very seriously, and in 5 years of using this product I&#x27;ve never had a problem with sunburn even after 3+ hours in the mid-summer sun.  My daughter also says it feels good on her skin.  To address the other reviewer&#x27;s issue of burning eyes, I use a stick sunscreen applicator on my daughter&#x27;s face and would definitely recommend that for small children.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  good and useful  The best thing is that&#x27;s pretty quickly to use it and the decoration is good thx</li>
