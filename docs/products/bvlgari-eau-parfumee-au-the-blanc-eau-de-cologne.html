            <li>Love love love it.  </li>
            <li>However, it is lovely, and could be worn day or night.</li>
            <li>However, I caveat that I&#x27;m a wrist dabber and realized that I&#x27;m probably speeding up the dispersion process with my wrists resting on the laptop most of the day.</li>
            <li>I love perfume, but it gives me a headache and makes me wheeze.  </li>

            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to purchase some for myself.</li>
            <li>Smells very fresh and nice.</li>
            <li>So I use it for room spray &#x3D; really pricey room spray, but pleasant.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it smells so clean &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance, it is so light but not to sweet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty accurate description of this perfume.</li>
            <li>Not such a great smelling product.</li>
            <li>I doubt it was genuine because I don&#x27;t think a company like Bulgari would adhere labels to a perfume that would smear.</li>
            <li>No too sweet or too strong.</li>
            <li>I visited a spa in Las Vegas that used this product and fell in love with the clean crisp scent.  </li>
            <li>Just for the one wearing it and that someone special who gets close.</li>
            <li>and it is so fresh and clean and light</li>
            <li>She smells sweet-</li>
            <li>My absolutely, all time favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>perfect, not too much or too little impact.  </li>
            <li>just a clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>The smell is classy and long-lasting, but not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Bulgari&#x27;s White Tea Cologne is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance but the last bottle I ordered, the spay nozzle was busted.</li>
            <li>SO SO many scents over the years and the last two years I have been wearing this</li>
            <li>I order this all the time because the stores don&#x27;t sell it and if they do they are much higher than Amazon, so I get it all the time from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not over-powering, it is light and natural.</li>
            <li>it not the same product as sold in the better department stores?  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, would suggest layering as the lotion has a slightly different fragrance..</li>
            <li>It was exactly what the ad stated it was.</li>
            <li>The first squirt promises more than it ultimately delivers.</li>
            <li>Birthday gift much appreciated!</li>
            <li>sure you carry the bottle with you if you want the scent to last.</li>
            <li>It was delivered on time, well packaged and exactly as described in the ad.  </li>
            <li>Usually they just admire it for its nice clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>Really nice fragrance at first that dies down to a common//lackluster scent.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend purchasing this perfume!</li>
            <li>but it wears off really fast - - make</li>
            <li>Originally, I was hunting for something similar to the Westin &amp;#34;White Tea&amp;#34; scent, but the search continues--this is definitely nowhere near as crisp as the Westin home fragrance products.</li>
            <li>I half expected the 1oz bottle for the price which was still a good deal.  </li>
            <li>The classic Bvlgari top notes are meant to seize your attention, but the fragrance quickly simmers down to the white tea/musky mid notes</li>
            <li>And it came just as the seller said new and un opened</li>
            <li>In the box, brand new, and sealed.</li>
            <li>Such a fresh and natural scent.  </li>
            <li>I have  tested this at other places such as Macy&#x27;s and strong as it should have been  </li>
            <li>when it arrived, glued with a piece of adhesive tape, the perfume smelled like old: opened perfume expires faster.</li>
            <li>Got twice as much as in the local stores, for about 2/3 of the price.</li>
            <li>sensitive noses give favorable reviews.</li>
            <li>--it may be why some people think it&#x27;s not long lasting.</li>

            <li> Bulgari&#x27;s White Tea Cologne is my favorite scent. No too sweet or too strong. I give 5 stars to Bulgari&#x27;s Au The Blanc Eau de Cologne because i used to buy it in department stores. This vendor saved me quite a bit of money. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance but the last bottle I ordered, the spay nozzle was busted. 😡</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I have had SO SO SO many scents over the years and the last two years I have been wearing this and it is so fresh and clean and light but it doesn&#x27;t wear off.... I think I will wear it for the rest of my life! Really.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Get so many compliments on it.....been wearing it for about 3 years now.</li>
            <li> when others ask what fragrance I am wearing... I know I smell good.  Bulgari is a wonderful find for me.  I will be using it for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all I order this all the time because the stores don&#x27;t sell it and if they do they are much higher than Amazon, so I get it all the time from Amazon. Whenever I wear this cologne everybody ask me what is that your are wearing.  Just love it sincerely Kay Trammell  And it came just as the seller said new and un opened</li>
            <li> Love love love it.  Always have always will.  Reminds me of Cannes</li>
            <li> Notes: Artemisia Leaves, Ambrette, White Pepper, White Tea, Musk, Woody Amber.&lt;br /&gt;Style: Reassuring. Enveloping. Soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty accurate description of this perfume. It&#x27;s a softer, understated yet distinctively Bvlgari fragrance. I purchased a small sample elsewhere (to avoid buyer&#x27;s remorse) but I would definitely buy a larger bottle once I&#x27;m through with said sample. Originally, I was hunting for something similar to the Westin &amp;#34;White Tea&amp;#34; scent, but the search continues--this is definitely nowhere near as crisp as the Westin home fragrance products. However, it is lovely, and could be worn day or night.The classic Bvlgari top notes are meant to seize your attention, but the fragrance quickly simmers down to the white tea/musky mid notes--it may be why some people think it&#x27;s not long lasting. However, I caveat that I&#x27;m a wrist dabber and realized that I&#x27;m probably speeding up the dispersion process with my wrists resting on the laptop most of the day. So TBD on the staying power until the weekend (if I remember to update.....).</li>
            <li> Great light fragrance.  Smells very fresh and nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice I love the scent but my husband loooves to smell it on me.</li>
            <li> I love perfume, but it gives me a headache and makes me wheeze.  Not this scent, it is the only one that I can wear.  Not over-powering, it is light and natural.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my daughter- law- one of her favorite fragrances / for her 37th birthday. She smells sweet- yum</li>
            <li> I usually LOVE this scent.  This time I notice a slight difference; but, cannot put my &amp;#34;nose&amp;#34; to it.&lt;br /&gt;Is it not the same product as sold in the better department stores?  Price is terrific savings, however.</li>
            <li> Excelent gift to my daugther. The perfurm has a great smell and she liked so much this Christmas gift..Thank you too because I received it on time for the party.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, would suggest layering as the lotion has a slightly different fragrance.. I prefer the lotion...</li>
            <li> Best Value ever.  I half expected the 1oz bottle for the price which was still a good deal.  This was the larger 2.5oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Besides the wrapping plastic was already opened when it arrived, glued with a piece of adhesive tape, the perfume smelled like old: opened perfume expires faster. Terrible!</li>
            <li> This soft,unassuming scent, is perfect for any occasion. My absolutely, all time favorite. One I always go back and purchase!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what the ad stated it was. In the box, brand new, and sealed. It also arrived quickly and the price was amazing! I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> love it.  just a clean fresh scent.  perfect, not too much or too little impact.  keep trying other scents but nothing is better at any price.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lighthearted flowery fragrances for spring and summer. A delight to wear.</li>
            <li> The first squirt promises more than it ultimately delivers. Really nice fragrance at first that dies down to a common//lackluster scent. So I use it for room spray &#x3D; really pricey room spray, but pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love this Parfumee!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!!! It Smells so yummy.  One of my faves!!  I get compliments all the time when wearing this.</li>
            <li> Mellow fragrance, not over powering.  Just for the one wearing it and that someone special who gets close.</li>
            <li> Item as described and expected.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  It seems like a great value.  Got twice as much as in the local stores, for about 2/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Gave it to a very good friend as a gift. Smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Great price, prompt delivery, authenti product.  Thans!</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this fragrence. Usually they just admire it for its nice clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Even sensitive noses give favorable reviews.</li>
            <li> Not such a great smelling product. I tried this and after trying it on in a store I&lt;br /&gt;liked it but after wearing it was disappointed</li>
            <li> Not really sure how to rate this.  My wife loves this fragrance and I like it too for her.  So that is all I can say.</li>
            <li> Another one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Birthday gift much appreciated!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. Such a fresh and natural scent.  Feel in love with this at Ritz Carlton hotels and had to buy it!</li>
            <li> I visited a spa in Las Vegas that used this product and fell in love with the clean crisp scent.  I was extremely satisfied with the price and the service!</li>
            <li> Love it and love the price.  I&#x27;ve been looking for this scent everywhere and was delighted to finally be able to find it on line.</li>
            <li> Good product. But i think it&#x27;s a fake. The smell does not last close to the last one i had.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Bulgari perfume as a gift. The perfume had leaked all over the place in transit and smeared the label on it. Obviously, I couldn&#x27;t give it as a gift and I called the company four times and also emailed but received no response. I doubt it was genuine because I don&#x27;t think a company like Bulgari would adhere labels to a perfume that would smear. Therefore I believe it was a knock-off. Since it was a gift, I have no idea how it was supposed to smell. I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this scent when I stayed at the Ritz. The smell is classy and long-lasting, but not too overwhelming. Received tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance, it is so light but not to sweet.  Just a couple of sprays last all day long.  Highly recommend purchasing this perfume!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell good to me. Smelt alcohol-like</li>
            <li> This smells amazing but it wears off really fast - - make sure you carry the bottle with you if you want the scent to last.</li>
            <li> Wife recieved this for christmas and loves this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very poorly.. The aroma was weak and does not last .. Was this an out of date product .. I would have returned it but threw all packaging away .. May have to stop ordering from amazon for products such as this .. I have  tested this at other places such as Macy&#x27;s and strong as it should have been  I don&#x27;t like returning things so I jus figured I lost 48.00 as of this time. Poor business practice on perfumes</li>
            <li> I love this designer. I can&#x27;t say anymore. Everything they make smells great. Timely delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it sucks this is the only place I can purchase  it . I get so many compliments on this perfume</li>
            <li> Nice soft fragrance. Great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Very good experience!</li>
            <li> Bvlgari is my-favorite cologne. I love all of  the scents.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this purchase.  It was delivered on time, well packaged and exactly as described in the ad.  The smell is excellent and makes my wife reminisce of being on a tropical beach.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it smells so clean &amp; refreshing. After using the shampoo &amp; lotion at a Ritz Carlton, I was hooked...this is my signature fragrance now.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find but my new signature fragrance.  Keep it in stock, please.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I had never smelled the scent before. I am in love. I will be sure to purchase some for myself.</li>
