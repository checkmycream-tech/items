            <li>I never thought I would ever write a review for a lotion, but this stuff is good.</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>We have used this lotion for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Sneaky, greedy capitalists ruined an authentically good product.</li>
            <li>try a bottle out and see for yourself honestly love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love the 70% aloe vera lotion - my skin does too!  </li>
            <li>Nice lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>and I love the scent of Aloe.</li>
            <li>For more years than I can count I have used Jason Aloe Vera lotion.  </li>
            <li>The biggest bonus is that it is paraben free!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have been in love with it for years.</li>
            <li>When I aply it, it feels like my skin is drinking refreshing water.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>The scent was not our favorite but the feel of the lotion made up for it.</li>
            <li>My family loves this because it&#x27;s a nice weight of lotion and absorbs quickly leaving your skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>Yet, more importantly, it truly does moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li>Has a strong aroma, but I like it.</li>
            <li>had really liked my first bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>I first got it as a gift, but had to order more when it ran out because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>I use this for many years, just love it and is so natural.</li>
            <li>It smells clean.  </li>
            <li>This may work fine as a moisturizer for those who live in warmer, more humid areas.</li>
            <li>After I try something else, I always return to this old favorite.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the aloe, but whatever it is, it is keeping my skin soft, smooth and non-itchy.</li>
            <li>This body lotion is mainly from aloe vera plant and some other good stuff for that added moisture.</li>
            <li>The price, texture, thickness, scent and result are better than any other brand I have tried, and I can easily add oils or other ingredients to it to fit my special needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even managed to use it on my face for certain applications.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks Jason&#x27;s and Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, everyday hand lotion too.</li>
            <li>Natural products of this quality are hard to find good reasonable price.</li>
            <li>No hard fragrance.</li>
            <li>This stuff is much thicker than the cheap lotion I have tried in the past, but it lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without aloe vera.</li>
            <li>I live in Chicago and this moisturizer does not stand up during the winter months.</li>
            <li>My husband is very sensitive to frangrances and he loves this product.</li>
            <li>It is  a fairly heavy lotion but still pumps easily .  </li>
            <li>Full body rub down after a shower for a week and you will notice the difference in how soft you skin becomes!</li>
            <li>After about three days my hand stay soft.</li>
            <li>We like how natural it is.</li>
            <li>- I used it on face and body, and never broke out, and it had a pleasant, but faint, clean odor that would almost disappear after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Price is ok but not really sure that the product is actually what it says it is.  </li>
            <li>Only lotion I can use on my sensitive skin face without breaking out.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or too light and it isn&#x27;t greasy or wet feeling.</li>

            <li> I have used Jason aloe Vera lotion for a few years, but it seems this particular bottle has a different fragrance that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad that now I have to find a replacement because the big company that acquired Jason has changed the formula (most likely to increase profits).  </li>
            <li> I have no issue with the vendor I purchased from (Swanson - they shipped super fast) but the lotion has a ridiculously unpleasant odor now.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll finish it rather than return it but likely will not order again due to the scent.  </li>
            <li> I keep this by the kitchen sink since my hands get dry when I do the dishes.</li>
            <li> I use this after showering on wet legs and arms.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not certain</li>
            <li> I wish it had a less medicinal smell or no scent at all.  </li>
            <li> still like the lotion but will be searching for something new unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few yrs and 1) it always came taped and sealed and 2)</li>
            <li> ...can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if they changed their formula or if it&#x27;s just a bad batch, but it&#x27;s pretty disgusting - like when a child&#x27;s diaper is dirty and the diaper oder is trying to cover the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My shins don&#x27;t itch like crazy anymore either.</li>
            <li> and now it even smells bad.  </li>

            <li> I never thought I would ever write a review for a lotion, but this stuff is good. I&#x27;m a middle aged guy with some drying skin. This stuff is much thicker than the cheap lotion I have tried in the past, but it lasts much longer. My shins don&#x27;t itch like crazy anymore either.</li>
            <li> Good deal. Fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have used Jason aloe Vera lotion for a few years, but it seems this particular bottle has a different fragrance that I don&#x27;t care for. Did they change the ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;I still like the lotion but will be searching for something new unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I had just finished a bottle of this lotion that I had gotten at my local Whole Foods last winter, and not sure why, but could not find it anywhere local now. So, ordered here - I have no issue with the vendor I purchased from (Swanson - they shipped super fast) but the lotion has a ridiculously unpleasant odor now. I&#x27;m wondering if they changed their formula or if it&#x27;s just a bad batch, but it&#x27;s pretty disgusting - like when a child&#x27;s diaper is dirty and the diaper oder is trying to cover the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I had really liked my first bottle - I used it on face and body, and never broke out, and it had a pleasant, but faint, clean odor that would almost disappear after a few minutes. However, now that is not the case.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without aloe vera. I put it on every part of my body.  Jason Cosmetics is a brand I know and trust. This body lotion is mainly from aloe vera plant and some other good stuff for that added moisture. Great product and value...can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I use this after showering on wet legs and arms. Maybe it&#x27;s the aloe, but whatever it is, it is keeping my skin soft, smooth and non-itchy.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best, I keep one in the kitchen and on my nightstand.  The tube size is perfect to take in the suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this for many years, just love it and is so natural. I can only recommend this product .</li>
            <li> We have used this lotion for years and loved it.  I&#x27;m so mad that now I have to find a replacement because the big company that acquired Jason has changed the formula (most likely to increase profits).  It doesn&#x27;t work as well and now it even smells bad.  I will never buy it again. Sneaky, greedy capitalists ruined an authentically good product.</li>
            <li> Price is ok but not really sure that the product is actually what it says it is.  I&#x27;ve used this for a few yrs and 1) it always came taped and sealed and 2) the smell is totally different.  So I&#x27;m not certain it&#x27;s what it says it is.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on really smooth. It&#x27;s very light and I love the scent of Aloe. Natural products of this quality are hard to find good reasonable price. Thanks Jason&#x27;s and Amazon.</li>
            <li> Well-balanced formula with quality ingredients and a pleasant smell. I&#x27;ve even managed to use it on my face for certain applications. It&#x27;s not a finishing lotion for your face though as it will eventually clog your pores. But it says a lot when it can go just about anywhere.</li>
            <li> For more years than I can count I have used Jason Aloe Vera lotion.  After I try something else, I always return to this old favorite.  The price, texture, thickness, scent and result are better than any other brand I have tried, and I can easily add oils or other ingredients to it to fit my special needs.</li>
            <li> My family loves this because it&#x27;s a nice weight of lotion and absorbs quickly leaving your skin feeling hydrated. It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or too light and it isn&#x27;t greasy or wet feeling. It&#x27;s a nice, everyday hand lotion too. My husband is very sensitive to frangrances and he loves this product. The biggest bonus is that it is paraben free!</li>

            <li> Very nice lotion.  I use this lotion every day on my arms and legs and have great respect for this lotion.</li>

            <li> I love this lotion. I have been in love with it for years. When I aply it, it feels like my skin is drinking refreshing water.</li>
            <li> This may work fine as a moisturizer for those who live in warmer, more humid areas. I live in Chicago and this moisturizer does not stand up during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Great hand and body lotion. Smoothing and creamy. No hard fragrance. After about three days my hand stay soft.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  It smells clean.  Yet, more importantly, it truly does moisturize your skin.  I will definitely keep purchasing this product.  I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> Full body rub down after a shower for a week and you will notice the difference in how soft you skin becomes! try a bottle out and see for yourself honestly love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Nice lotion. We like how natural it is. The scent was not our favorite but the feel of the lotion made up for it.</li>
            <li> It is  a fairly heavy lotion but still pumps easily .  I wish it had a less medicinal smell or no scent at all.  I can&#x27;t use it when I am having an asthma flare, and  rinse my hands after I&#x27;ve applied it because of the scent.  I&#x27;ll finish it rather than return it but likely will not order again due to the scent.  (Aloe itself has no scent.)</li>
            <li> Love the 70% aloe vera lotion - my skin does too!  I use nothing else but Jason&#x27;s for face and body!</li>
