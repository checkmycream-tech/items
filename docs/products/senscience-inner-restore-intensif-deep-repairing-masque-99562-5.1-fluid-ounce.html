            <li>Never got this kind of result from Kerastase, which is much more expensive.</li>
            <li>It was delivered on time and the product is highly recommended by hair stylists.</li>
            <li>I usually do with my finger and it was very easy.</li>
            <li>I live near the beach and have short curly hair, this treatment helps a LOT!!</li>
            <li>I bought the first time and have not used often, but from what little I applied, my hair is softer now.</li>

            <li> My hair is really silky!</li>
            <li> The product itself is very good but The vendor cheated me with this product. Their offer made you belive you were purchasing the 16 onz size instead they send me the 5 onz (with a price appropriate for the bigger size). I felt cheated out of my money and when I complain the said that they never offer the size I though I&#x27;ve purchased. I know the salon price of the product and I ended up paying way more with this vendor.</li>
