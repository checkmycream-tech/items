            <li>Always my favorite for after care!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t petroleum based, which I love, and YAY!</li>
            <li>Tattoo goo is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and works really well for healing tattoos.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and makes my tattoos look nice</li>
            <li>This size is nice to carry in your pocket or purse.  </li>
            <li>there, she&#x27;s awesome, so far (knock, knock), looks good.</li>
            <li>took the sting away nicely.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>Helped my tattoo heal nicely.</li>
            <li>Used it on both of my tattoos and healed up nicely.</li>
            <li>So it was really my own fault.  </li>
            <li>It really brings out the colors...bottom line I Love It !!!</li>
            <li>Most ink artist have their own opinions.</li>
            <li>This product is great and worth buying.</li>
            <li>So if you want pretty, healthy tattoos, this is the good stuff!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve put it on about 3 times today, and each time I applied it, it left my skin feeling nice (no nasty sticky feeling on clothing), and best of all, it makes the color on your tattoos come out strong and bright.</li>
            <li>The area of application makes the skin vibrate in a positive manner like a pet that has been moistured with a healthy blend of nutrients, it smells like health and the good kind.</li>
            <li>My tattoos healed beautifully and still look very vivid after 2 years, as the &#x27;goo&#x27; kept the colors from peeling/fading/bleeding off...</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I like I better than a&amp;d.</li>
            <li>I just got this stuff today, I love it.</li>
            <li>Just looked and realized I could&#x27;ve ordered a can with 2.5 times this amount on Amazon for $2 more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>:) everyone enjoy!</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Tattoo goo is a good product, ingredients are mostly all natural stuff, it has sooo many good reviews and alot of tattoo artist&#x27;s recommend it.</li>
            <li>and it got a bit better, before the retouch.</li>
            <li>its better than any over the counter thing like a&amp;d.</li>
            <li>you have to put your nose to the container to be able to smell it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more Tattoo Goo.</li>
            <li>but my latest tattoo was fully healed before It was delivered</li>
            <li>I have friends and family who love Tattoo Goo products.  </li>
            <li>Shines up your tattoos so beautifully That they look brand new.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like cologne, in fact I think it smells sweet - kind of like beeswax.     </li>
            <li>Great product so far.</li>
            <li>I noticed it absorbes nicely and also soothes my fresh tattoo -</li>
            <li>It works as amazingly there as it did my tattoos, and the lavender and rosemary makes for a nice natural perfume too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word</li>
            <li>but it isnt strong at all.</li>
            <li>You can also after a shower and washing gently with warm water</li>
            <li>this works wonders on my tattoo sleeve its awesome and smells nice as well wishing they only sold a bigger one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like 1.50 worth.</li>
            <li>Works great, I wish I could get a bigger can of this stuff!</li>
            <li>and I cannot complain, and looks good so far like I said.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen them look so vibrant and nice.</li>
            <li>Then take a hot or as hot as you can handle compress and apply to the tattoo, continue for 20-25 min re-applying warm compress.</li>
            <li>and so is Aquaphor, there are other great tricks for tattoos right from the start to help you eliminate all scabbing/peeling or most of it period.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent product, but the size is super small.</li>
            <li>Then wash the tattoo with warm water and something gentle (Aveeno childrens soap etc..natural and no alcohol or too many dyes), dont over work it when washing, then let air dry mostly.</li>
            <li>Keeps my colors vibrant :)</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and moisturizes like no other lotion or salve.</li>
            <li>Overall amazing product</li>
            <li>, I hear in the beginning regular vitamin e capsules and their oil is also as effective in the healing process, you can switch and use it at night per say.</li>
            <li>i love how it natural, and the scent of it is a lavender oil smell</li>
            <li>Other than that its a good product</li>
            <li>bought it in daytona with my first tattoo</li>
            <li>I have better results with this than my friends using a variety of different products.</li>
            <li>I got my first tattoo</li>
            <li>Hopefully this helps everyone, use the hot compress method, it works...</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more..</li>
            <li>I was given Tattoo Goo after I got my first tattoo.</li>
            <li>Amazon also has great prices on the goo, the local tattoo shop wants $12.00 for the same amount.</li>
            <li>Also the more time you can give your tattoo to heal naturally, I mean by not having clothing or any layers rub on it as its healing is better, if, and only if you have the ability to be at home walk aroung with it exposed at all times while healing the better.</li>
            <li>it was overall straight and ok</li>
            <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t that hot at the time.</li>
            <li>I got my first tattoo and religiously used this the first few weeks to keep it moisturized, great product, will order agin</li>
            <li>Some say, goo is like thick like Vaseline, but it stays on it feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>I use it for all of my tattoos and it really speeds the healing process.</li>
            <li>It really makes the colors pop on  </li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>i can keep repeating myself but some people with too much stuff in their ears wont hear me,</li>
            <li>I apply with a finger or 2, and rub it in to my skin gently, thats it.</li>
            <li>and it really aids in the healing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Tattoo Goo.</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was doing so much Christmas shopping, I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size listed.  </li>
            <li>I see more tattoo&#x27;s in the near future.</li>
            <li>It works well for me and is the first ointment I ask for after getting a new tattoo.</li>
            <li>I as many others have used A&amp;D, Aguaphor and other ointments</li>
            <li>+ -, some do it for a week +), its still an open wound and needs to be kept clean and needs moisture from the healing ointment (to help heal).</li>
            <li>an brand new!</li>
            <li>The itching that sets in about a week after a new tattoo always drives my NUTS, but this time, I bought Tattoo Goo from Amazon, and it is an anti-itching miracle!</li>
            <li>use it now and again on my tattoos and it keeps them look vibrant</li>
            <li>It has kept the colors vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I used natural oils and A&amp;D and nothing could soothe that wicked itching all over my large tat.</li>
            <li>and i know the colors on my new ones will stay looking new  for years to come!</li>
            <li>Moisturizing without being overly thick, it also has a nice scent-maybe</li>
            <li>Also use the same gentle soap nothing strong in the shower, dont overscrub, gently wash always, no *hot* water, baths, saunas, pools, oceans etc...</li>
            <li>Whenever I get a new tat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a person who likes the goopy feel of aquaphor on my new tattoos.</li>
            <li>helped my new tattoo heal faster</li>
            <li>My new tattoo was healing well with A + D ointment.  </li>
            <li>and they still look brand new.  </li>
            <li>I use it for new tattoos and razor burn.</li>
            <li>IT makes my old tattoos look so vibrant.</li>
            <li>This can was so small, and it&#x27;s my fault that I didn&#x27;t pay more attention to the size.</li>
            <li>I got two more recently and I was using only Aguaphor and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li>it felt well or like the skin was moisturized properly, it applies extremely easy and you need a thin layer, doesent stain clothes and smells like pine type of smell, nothing too strong, smells</li>
            <li>I originally got this to help heal a half sleeve tattoo, but in between getting the outline and color done I ended up with a severe heat rash between my thighs.</li>
            <li>Bought like 5 so far</li>
            <li>my old tattoos</li>
            <li>, so I got It re-touched by Ivy, She said it  was very overworked to the point of scarring, it was pushed in too deep and ended up kinda falling out, so</li>
            <li>for ex: I have a inner bisep tattoo all the way accross, I dont apply with a whole hand?</li>
            <li>My $100 tattoo healed completely within 2 weeks without any scabbing</li>
            <li>No alcohol and all natural.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I have no issues, I got a tattoo by an idiot in Philly PA and the tattoo was a total disaster, it ended up scarring and it faded in many parts, went to Davidian tattoo in Horsham PA, got work done or somewhat covered by Ivy</li>
            <li>do buy a new pot for each new tattoo, but this little pot does last, and it certainly does the trick!  </li>
            <li>use the Yakuza method as its called, turn on the shower on to cold, and let it gently run over the tattoo area, (after the warm shower ofcource, again for the dummies out there) it will close your poores and tighten it up, then gently pat dry and apply the lotion(s)</li>
            <li>After the coloring, not only did the wicked itch not set in (I still did itch, but it was a mild itch that came and went and could be ignored), but it healed in a week and a half.</li>
            <li>An all natural product, I find this to be invaluable when caring for a recent tattoo.</li>
            <li>Just use a thin layer, its all you need, 3-4 times a day should be ok.</li>
            <li>I just got my first tattoo a week and a half ago.</li>
            <li>This product makes my tattop look like new, sepcially having dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Dont use to too much despite how thick it is because it&#x27;s really greasy.</li>
            <li>It is thin, making it easy to apply so you&#x27;re not stretching your skin when rubbing it on.</li>

            <li> and so is Aquaphor, there are other great tricks for tattoos right from the start to help you eliminate all scabbing/peeling or most of it period.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product, but the size is super small.</li>
            <li> Then wash the tattoo with warm water and something gentle (Aveeno childrens soap etc..natural and no alcohol or too many dyes), dont over work it when washing, then let air dry mostly.</li>
            <li> Keeps my colors vibrant :)</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and moisturizes like no other lotion or salve.</li>
            <li> Overall amazing product</li>
            <li> , I hear in the beginning regular vitamin e capsules and their oil is also as effective in the healing process, you can switch and use it at night per say.</li>
            <li> i love how it natural, and the scent of it is a lavender oil smell</li>
            <li> Other than that its a good product</li>
            <li> bought it in daytona with my first tattoo</li>
            <li> I have better results with this than my friends using a variety of different products.</li>
            <li> I got my first tattoo</li>
            <li> Hopefully this helps everyone, use the hot compress method, it works...</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more..</li>
            <li> I was given Tattoo Goo after I got my first tattoo.</li>
            <li> Amazon also has great prices on the goo, the local tattoo shop wants $12.00 for the same amount.</li>
            <li> Also the more time you can give your tattoo to heal naturally, I mean by not having clothing or any layers rub on it as its healing is better, if, and only if you have the ability to be at home walk aroung with it exposed at all times while healing the better.</li>
            <li> it was overall straight and ok</li>
            <li> but it really wasn&#x27;t that hot at the time.</li>
            <li> I got my first tattoo and religiously used this the first few weeks to keep it moisturized, great product, will order agin</li>
            <li> Some say, goo is like thick like Vaseline, but it stays on it feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> I use it for all of my tattoos and it really speeds the healing process.</li>
            <li> It really makes the colors pop on  </li>
            <li> Too much</li>
            <li> i can keep repeating myself but some people with too much stuff in their ears wont hear me,</li>
            <li> I apply with a finger or 2, and rub it in to my skin gently, thats it.</li>
            <li> and it really aids in the healing.</li>
            <li> Thanks Tattoo Goo.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was doing so much Christmas shopping, I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size listed.  </li>
            <li> I see more tattoo&#x27;s in the near future.</li>
            <li> It works well for me and is the first ointment I ask for after getting a new tattoo.</li>
            <li> I as many others have used A&amp;D, Aguaphor and other ointments</li>
            <li> + -, some do it for a week +), its still an open wound and needs to be kept clean and needs moisture from the healing ointment (to help heal).</li>
            <li> an brand new!</li>
            <li> The itching that sets in about a week after a new tattoo always drives my NUTS, but this time, I bought Tattoo Goo from Amazon, and it is an anti-itching miracle!</li>
            <li> use it now and again on my tattoos and it keeps them look vibrant</li>
            <li> It has kept the colors vibrant.  </li>
            <li> I used natural oils and A&amp;D and nothing could soothe that wicked itching all over my large tat.</li>
            <li> and i know the colors on my new ones will stay looking new  for years to come!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing without being overly thick, it also has a nice scent-maybe</li>
            <li> Also use the same gentle soap nothing strong in the shower, dont overscrub, gently wash always, no *hot* water, baths, saunas, pools, oceans etc...</li>
            <li> Whenever I get a new tat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person who likes the goopy feel of aquaphor on my new tattoos.</li>
            <li> helped my new tattoo heal faster</li>
            <li> My new tattoo was healing well with A + D ointment.  </li>
            <li> and they still look brand new.  </li>
            <li> I use it for new tattoos and razor burn.</li>
            <li> IT makes my old tattoos look so vibrant.</li>
            <li> This can was so small, and it&#x27;s my fault that I didn&#x27;t pay more attention to the size.</li>
            <li> I got two more recently and I was using only Aguaphor and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> it felt well or like the skin was moisturized properly, it applies extremely easy and you need a thin layer, doesent stain clothes and smells like pine type of smell, nothing too strong, smells</li>
            <li> I originally got this to help heal a half sleeve tattoo, but in between getting the outline and color done I ended up with a severe heat rash between my thighs.</li>
            <li> Bought like 5 so far</li>
            <li> my old tattoos</li>
            <li> , so I got It re-touched by Ivy, She said it  was very overworked to the point of scarring, it was pushed in too deep and ended up kinda falling out, so</li>
            <li> for ex: I have a inner bisep tattoo all the way accross, I dont apply with a whole hand?</li>
            <li> My $100 tattoo healed completely within 2 weeks without any scabbing</li>
            <li> No alcohol and all natural.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have no issues, I got a tattoo by an idiot in Philly PA and the tattoo was a total disaster, it ended up scarring and it faded in many parts, went to Davidian tattoo in Horsham PA, got work done or somewhat covered by Ivy</li>
            <li> do buy a new pot for each new tattoo, but this little pot does last, and it certainly does the trick!  </li>
            <li> use the Yakuza method as its called, turn on the shower on to cold, and let it gently run over the tattoo area, (after the warm shower ofcource, again for the dummies out there) it will close your poores and tighten it up, then gently pat dry and apply the lotion(s)</li>
            <li> After the coloring, not only did the wicked itch not set in (I still did itch, but it was a mild itch that came and went and could be ignored), but it healed in a week and a half.</li>
            <li> An all natural product, I find this to be invaluable when caring for a recent tattoo.</li>
            <li> Just use a thin layer, its all you need, 3-4 times a day should be ok.</li>
            <li> I just got my first tattoo a week and a half ago.</li>
            <li> This product makes my tattop look like new, sepcially having dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Dont use to too much despite how thick it is because it&#x27;s really greasy.</li>
            <li> It is thin, making it easy to apply so you&#x27;re not stretching your skin when rubbing it on.</li>
            <li> I kept the little tin in my purse, and just put a dab on my new art every time it started to itch.</li>
            <li> Let air dry, Then use Aquaphor (which I would recomment for 3-4 days after the tattoo, then I will use tattoo goo), this helps alot in the begining, and follow all the other steps for not picking scabs and no peeling etc, if it even happens in the 1st place, It shouldnt in general.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Aquaphor, A+D Ointment, and other tattoo aftercare products, and Tattoo Goo is the only one that works time after time.</li>
            <li> i also use it on chapped lips, cuts that need to heal and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive, and non-allergenic, so at the very least you should try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t met a single tattoo artist that didn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> If your tattoo is much bigger than the tin itself (a quarter) than this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> So during the time it needed a healing ointment the most i used almost nothing, I followed directions of this so called 25 year veteran to the \\&quot;T\\&quot;, and it got bad, scabbing, peeling, and the tattoo fade in alot of spots, due to</li>
            <li> Im not sure why some people are not able to think logically???</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the tin was bigger!</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, my tattoo became extremely itchy, raised, swollen, and red.</li>
            <li> and Im not sure how big your tattoo is but</li>
            <li> and iv used it on other tattoos</li>
            <li> I was using it like 10 days after the tattoo originally done, I was using aveeno moist lotion, this idiot told me to wait 24-48 hours after the tattoo then use the moisturizing aveeno, a totally BS idea.</li>
            <li> but why is it down to 1 penny ?</li>
            <li> Tattoo goo is what you have to get when getting any  tattoo big or small!</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this to someone that has a VERY small tattoo.</li>
            <li> Comes in a small tin but a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I switched to Tattoo Goo because it was recommended and is less messy.</li>
            <li> I do think its a little pricey for the quantity</li>
            <li> I do, however, keep one just for tattoos (because I&#x27;m a little OCD).     </li>
            <li> The ingredients in the salve when applied in a thin to moderate coat allow the skin to breathe and speed up healing.</li>
            <li> If simply you rub off a thin layer</li>
            <li> In the beginning wash your tattoo a few times a day ( for 3-4 days</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have extremely sensitive skin and was allergic to something in their products.  </li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve ordered two 1.5 oz cans from the company&#x27;s website for less than twice the price of this small can.</li>
            <li> Also never apply a globb of any stuff, any lotion, its not good at all, it will become too weak or too soft, etc..</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s about the size of a half dollar and about a half inch thick.</li>
            <li> , I try to keep it in a room temp place where its not too watery or too stiff.</li>
            <li> Keeps your tattoo moisturized for at least half the day.</li>
            <li> I think it smells a little like Bag Balm!  </li>
            <li> therefore theguy doing it originally is a total jackass,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had skin irritation issues in the past, tattoo or not.</li>
            <li> No more smelling like a baby rash...</li>
            <li> It made the normal itch of a healing tattoo really bad.</li>
            <li> I hardly use this because of them smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> of advice: don&#x27;t apply it too thick.</li>
            <li> This is a very small tin</li>
            <li> I mean thin, then it applies as thin, NO???</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and non greasy.</li>
            <li> Even my tattoo was crappy earlier by the idiot doing it after applying goo</li>
            <li> then it applies as a thin layer, no???  </li>
            <li> what the idiot that initially F&#x27;d up.</li>
            <li> You can use anything your heart desires, thats a personall choice but to base a balm like this as too thick , which has worked for hundreds of people without any problems as a bad product or something you didnt like makes no sense to me personally.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> i cant think of anything bad about it, so</li>
            <li> The worst case scenario is that it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works well for me and is the first ointment I ask for after getting a new tattoo. It is soothing &amp; smells great. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to keep some bacatracin on hand as an antibiotic (as well as some A&amp;D ointment for further healing later in the healing process) but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with Tattoo Goo for over a dozen years and over a dozen tattoos.</li>
            <li> This is actually a good product. Most ink artist have their own opinions. Some say, goo is like thick like Vaseline, but it stays on it feels pretty good. Some say it clogs the pores for your ink, all my ink has not had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some ink artist want you to just moisturerizer, but you have to keep appling it over and over. With GOO, you put on now and then. It feels better too!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and works really well for healing tattoos. I do think its a little pricey for the quantity but I&#x27;ll pay it.</li>
            <li> I hardly use this because of them smell.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like men cologne and I being a woman, am not to keen on that.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes my tattoos look nice</li>
            <li> Great stuff but why is it down to 1 penny ?</li>
            <li> People are complaining about how gloppy it is. Ha. It&#x27;s thin and non greasy. It works like wonders. I like I better than a&amp;d. Let&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> I just got this stuff today, I love it. It smells amazing, which is a huge plus. It appears to be very healthy for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve put it on about 3 times today, and each time I applied it, it left my skin feeling nice (no nasty sticky feeling on clothing), and best of all, it makes the color on your tattoos come out strong and bright. I&#x27;ve never seen them look so vibrant and nice. So if you want pretty, healthy tattoos, this is the good stuff! My only complaint is that I wish the tin was bigger!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years. This can was so small, and it&#x27;s my fault that I didn&#x27;t pay more attention to the size. I could&#x27;ve ordered two 1.5 oz cans from the company&#x27;s website for less than twice the price of this small can. It is an excellent product, but the size is super small. Just looked and realized I could&#x27;ve ordered a can with 2.5 times this amount on Amazon for $2 more.</li>
            <li> I have several tattoos, and have ended up using Tattoo Goo for the aftercare on all of them. An all natural product, I find this to be invaluable when caring for a recent tattoo. I&#x27;ve tried Aquaphor, A+D Ointment, and other tattoo aftercare products, and Tattoo Goo is the only one that works time after time. It&#x27;s not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.     It doesn&#x27;t smell like cologne, in fact I think it smells sweet - kind of like beeswax.     I&#x27;ve used it for chapped lips, burns, scrapes, and just about anything else. I do, however, keep one just for tattoos (because I&#x27;m a little OCD).     It&#x27;s not expensive, and non-allergenic, so at the very least you should try it for yourself. As with all tattoos or piercings, ask your artist. I haven&#x27;t met a single tattoo artist that didn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing ! Helped my tattoo heal faster!! Bought like 5 so far</li>
            <li> This is a very small tin but the product is wonderful.  This size is nice to carry in your pocket or purse.  Keeps your tattoo moisturized for at least half the day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. bought it in daytona with my first tattoo so of course it reminds me of the beach!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it now and again on my tattoos and it keeps them look vibrant an brand new! :) everyone enjoy!</li>
            <li> Whenever I get a new tat this is what I use. My artist recommends Aquaphor but I find this to be superior. I have better results with this than my friends using a variety of different products. Have got several friends to switch to tattoo goo.</li>
            <li> I got my first tattoo and I put on lotionlike they told me to....it stung like a....#&amp;*...I bought this product and I loved it my tatt healed quicker and the color didn&#x27;t peel and I&#x27;m sooo happy....Just wished it was a bigger size for the price and shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person who likes the goopy feel of aquaphor on my new tattoos. This smells great, is all natural, and works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I used to use tattoo goo on my tattoos when I was younger and it was great. Stuff still works great and everyone with tattoo&#x27;s should use this product! Good for use with tanning beds too (for protecting your ink.)</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! I use it for all of my tattoos and it really speeds the healing process. Keeps my colors vibrant :)</li>
            <li> I have numerous tattoos and have used numerous products over the year to help with the healing process, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do buy a new pot for each new tattoo, but this little pot does last, and it certainly does the trick!  Moisturizing without being overly thick, it also has a nice scent-maybe mint?-I don&#x27;t know, but whatever the scent, I dig it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Great iteam! I always use this on my tattoos. It really makes the colors pop on  my old tattoos and i know the colors on my new ones will stay looking new  for years to come! Tattoo goo is what you have to get when getting any  tattoo big or small!</li>
            <li> helped my new tattoo heal faster</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Shines up your tattoos so beautifully That they look brand new. Makes the color go BAM. Great way to sport the tat</li>
            <li> I originally got this to help heal a half sleeve tattoo, but in between getting the outline and color done I ended up with a severe heat rash between my thighs. I didn&#x27;t have anything else to apply so I started using this. It works as amazingly there as it did my tattoos, and the lavender and rosemary makes for a nice natural perfume too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice: don&#x27;t apply it too thick. The ingredients in the salve when applied in a thin to moderate coat allow the skin to breathe and speed up healing. Too much and it will create a barrier, trapping in bacteria and overly moistening (read: weakening) the skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great and worth buying.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have no issues, I got a tattoo by an idiot in Philly PA and the tattoo was a total disaster, it ended up scarring and it faded in many parts, went to Davidian tattoo in Horsham PA, got work done or somewhat covered by Ivy there, she&#x27;s awesome, so far (knock, knock), looks good. Eventhough she didnt recomment goo to me and advised me to use aquaphor, I will use it after 3-4 days of using aquaphor. I was using it like 10 days after the tattoo originally done, I was using aveeno moist lotion, this idiot told me to wait 24-48 hours after the tattoo then use the moisturizing aveeno, a totally BS idea. So during the time it needed a healing ointment the most i used almost nothing, I followed directions of this so called 25 year veteran to the \\&quot;T\\&quot;, and it got bad, scabbing, peeling, and the tattoo fade in alot of spots, due to it was lettering it was overall straight and ok just faded, so I got It re-touched by Ivy, She said it  was very overworked to the point of scarring, it was pushed in too deep and ended up kinda falling out, so therefore theguy doing it originally is a total jackass, Ivy at Davidian did a great jog and I cannot complain, and looks good so far like I said. Hopefully if it does peel and scabb its the regular stuff thats supposed to happen anyway and the ink under the skin that fades out comes back in. Tattoo goo is a good product, ingredients are mostly all natural stuff, it has sooo many good reviews and alot of tattoo artist&#x27;s recommend it. Even my tattoo was crappy earlier by the idiot doing it after applying goo I saw a difference in the color and it got a bit better, before the retouch. it felt well or like the skin was moisturized properly, it applies extremely easy and you need a thin layer, doesent stain clothes and smells like pine type of smell, nothing too strong, smells fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**In regards to a review stating its too stiff***&lt;br /&gt;It may be a stiffer formula but if kept in room temperature would spread just fineyou just have to be a gentler, To me its no stiffer than regular Aquaphor, If simply you rub off a thin layer I mean thin, then it applies as thin, NO??? then it applies as a thin layer, no???  i can keep repeating myself but some people with too much stuff in their ears wont hear me, Im not sure why some people are not able to think logically??? Also the can works well with being on the go (easy to keep ina pocket, lol! for the dummies) and Im not sure how big your tattoo is but for ex: I have a inner bisep tattoo all the way accross, I dont apply with a whole hand? I apply with a finger or 2, and rub it in to my skin gently, thats it. You can use anything your heart desires, thats a personall choice but to base a balm like this as too thick , which has worked for hundreds of people without any problems as a bad product or something you didnt like makes no sense to me personally. Before I make a review I think and read reviews to see people dealing with similar issue where I might learn something to help me use the product (and ask questions). Other than that its a good product and so is Aquaphor, there are other great tricks for tattoos right from the start to help you eliminate all scabbing/peeling or most of it period. Here is what I recommend:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when getting a tattoo, leave the plastic or cover that the artist left on there for 2-3 hrs. Then wash the tattoo with warm water and something gentle (Aveeno childrens soap etc..natural and no alcohol or too many dyes), dont over work it when washing, then let air dry mostly. Then take a hot or as hot as you can handle compress and apply to the tattoo, continue for 20-25 min re-applying warm compress. Let air dry, Then use Aquaphor (which I would recomment for 3-4 days after the tattoo, then I will use tattoo goo), this helps alot in the begining, and follow all the other steps for not picking scabs and no peeling etc, if it even happens in the 1st place, It shouldnt in general. Also use the same gentle soap nothing strong in the shower, dont overscrub, gently wash always, no *hot* water, baths, saunas, pools, oceans etc... You can also after a shower and washing gently with warm water use the Yakuza method as its called, turn on the shower on to cold, and let it gently run over the tattoo area, (after the warm shower ofcource, again for the dummies out there) it will close your poores and tighten it up, then gently pat dry and apply the lotion(s), I hear in the beginning regular vitamin e capsules and their oil is also as effective in the healing process, you can switch and use it at night per say. Also the more time you can give your tattoo to heal naturally, I mean by not having clothing or any layers rub on it as its healing is better, if, and only if you have the ability to be at home walk aroung with it exposed at all times while healing the better. Thats the best way. Also never apply a globb of any stuff, any lotion, its not good at all, it will become too weak or too soft, etc.. Just use a thin layer, its all you need, 3-4 times a day should be ok. In the beginning wash your tattoo a few times a day ( for 3-4 days + -, some do it for a week +), its still an open wound and needs to be kept clean and needs moisture from the healing ointment (to help heal). Hopefully this helps everyone, use the hot compress method, it works...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE,,,10/24/2013**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Goo for almost 2 weeks now after using the Aquaphor for the 1st 4 days after the tattoo/touchup. Works great, color looks better, Ivy did an awesome job touching up what the idiot that initially F&#x27;d up. Goo works great, no break outs, And I break out very easily from any greasy stuff, I try to keep it in a room temp place where its not too watery or too stiff. Helps in applying. Great product so far.</li>
            <li> This sounded good but I ordered it and when it got to my hands it was MELTED cant say I didn&#x27;t expect in too seeing how im in AZ and all but it really wasn&#x27;t that hot at the time.</li>
            <li> This product makes my tattop look like new, sepcially having dry skin.  I use this daily .</li>
            <li> This is an awsome product great for anyone with tattoos. IT makes my old tattoos look so vibrant. Great buy</li>
            <li> When I got my outline done, it took almost 4 weeks for my tattoo to heal. I used natural oils and A&amp;D and nothing could soothe that wicked itching all over my large tat. I dreaded the coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then someone recommended tattoo goo and swore that it made her tattoo heal in 4-5 days. I figured, hey, what did I have to lose? The worst case scenario is that it wouldn&#x27;t work. I was in for a pleasant surprise. After the coloring, not only did the wicked itch not set in (I still did itch, but it was a mild itch that came and went and could be ignored), but it healed in a week and a half. I am very impressed and will be using tattoo goo from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used A + D ointment with my tattoos and I&#x27;ve never had skin irritation issues in the past, tattoo or not. My new tattoo was healing well with A + D ointment.  I switched to Tattoo Goo because it was recommended and is less messy. After using it for a few days, my tattoo became extremely itchy, raised, swollen, and red. I went back to the A + D and the irritation stopped almost immediately. Everyone reacts differently, so be cautious.</li>
            <li> It worked and made my tattoo look like it didn&#x27;t lose any ink! Also I didn&#x27;t smell like a baby butt all day!! Lol oh and it doesn&#x27;t stain ur clothes like a&amp; d  does</li>
            <li> I love Tattoo Goo!  I have used it for years on my tats and they still look brand new.  It has kept the colors vibrant.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! The itching that sets in about a week after a new tattoo always drives my NUTS, but this time, I bought Tattoo Goo from Amazon, and it is an anti-itching miracle! I kept the little tin in my purse, and just put a dab on my new art every time it started to itch. Instant relief! I definitely recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> I just got my first tattoo a week and a half ago. I tried Tattoo Goo and it goes on smooth,it isn&#x27;t greasy and it really aids in the healing.It really brings out the colors...bottom line I Love It !!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. It smells amazing, and moisturizes like no other lotion or salve. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s pretty pricey for a small tin.</li>
            <li> i have 3 tattoos. 2 of them i used this on. its better than any over the counter thing like a&amp;d. i use it in the healing process of the tattoo as well as healed tattoo to keep the skin moisturized. i also use it on chapped lips, cuts that need to heal and dry skin. its not greasy or anything like that. and stays on the skin well. i love how it natural, and the scent of it is a lavender oil smell but it isnt strong at all. you have to put your nose to the container to be able to smell it. so its not over powering like something else you may use. i cant think of anything bad about it, so 5 stars</li>
            <li> Good price and shipping time; this product is amazing!! My tattoos healed beautifully and still look very vivid after 2 years, as the &#x27;goo&#x27; kept the colors from peeling/fading/bleeding off...Will definitely buy more..</li>
            <li> Tattoo Goo works great and I&#x27;ve used it for all my tattoos. I&#x27;ve only ever seen one size tin that it comes in that&#x27;s about the size of a half dollar and about a half inch thick. MUCH larger than what was shipped to me. The size of this product is about as big in diameter and thickness as a quarter. I would only recommend this to someone that has a VERY small tattoo. If your tattoo is much bigger than the tin itself (a quarter) than this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Always my favorite for after care!</li>
            <li> Great product. Dont use to too much despite how thick it is because it&#x27;s really greasy. My $100 tattoo healed completely within 2 weeks without any scabbing</li>
            <li> I was given Tattoo Goo after I got my first tattoo. It was miraculous, and I started using it for my children&#x27;s scrapes and cuts. This products speeds healing and reduces scarring. I always have a tin in my bag, my car, and my dive gear. One try, and you&#x27;ll never go anywhere without it.</li>
            <li> this works wonders on my tattoo sleeve its awesome and smells nice as well wishing they only sold a bigger one</li>
            <li> Tattoo goo is amazing. It is thin, making it easy to apply so you&#x27;re not stretching your skin when rubbing it on. It isn&#x27;t petroleum based, which I love, and YAY! also no mineral oil!!!  I noticed it absorbes nicely and also soothes my fresh tattoo - took the sting away nicely. I will never use A&amp;D again! No more smelling like a baby rash...I think it smells a little like Bag Balm!  don&#x27;t worry...the texture is nothing like bag balm. Overall amazing product and I&#x27;d pay double for it just to not have to deal with smelling like a diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Cant go wrong. I use it for new tattoos and razor burn. No alcohol and all natural. Love it.</li>
            <li> I as many others have used A&amp;D, Aguaphor and other ointments and I always get a rash. I was afriad to get another tattoo because of the infections and rash. I got two more recently and I was using only Aguaphor and the same thing happened. I thought I would give Tattoo Goo a try and what a difference. I am very happy with this product and I will never use anything else again. It cleared up the rash and restored some of the color back. I also noticed it helps the healing process. This is an excellent product. I bought two kits one for myself and one for my wife and she also loves it as well. I see more tattoo&#x27;s in the near future. I just ordered more Tattoo Goo.I do think it should come in a bigger contianer for larger tats. Amazon also has great prices on the goo, the local tattoo shop wants $12.00 for the same amount. Thanks Tattoo Goo.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a bigger tin but for a penny yout cant beat it! This is more expensive at tattoo shops.  I love this stuff and it smells really good.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Helped my tattoo heal nicely. Also smells great! Comes in a small tin but a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff. Used it on both of my tattoos and healed up nicely.</li>
            <li> I got my first tattoo and religiously used this the first few weeks to keep it moisturized, great product, will order agin</li>
            <li> The product works great and iv used it on other tattoos but my latest tattoo was fully healed before It was delivered</li>
            <li> The area of application makes the skin vibrate in a positive manner like a pet that has been moistured with a healthy blend of nutrients, it smells like health and the good kind.</li>
            <li> I was doing so much Christmas shopping, I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size listed.  So it was really my own fault.  I just think if I realized it&#x27;s not much bigger than a quarter, then I wouldn&#x27;t paid 5 bucks for it.  It&#x27;s more like 1.50 worth.</li>
            <li> Works great, I wish I could get a bigger can of this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have friends and family who love Tattoo Goo products.  Unfortunately I have extremely sensitive skin and was allergic to something in their products.  It made the normal itch of a healing tattoo really bad.</li>
