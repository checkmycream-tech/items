    <ol>
            <li>Got here in perfect timing.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now and it is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I love Clinique - their products are perfect for my skin type.</li>
            <li>Clinique Clarifying Lotion 3 is a good toner for oily skin &amp; I&#x27;ve used it for years.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased - would recommend.</li>
            <li>It is not expensive and works excellent for her pourpouse to mantein a beatifull skin</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have.</li>
            <li>My skin in general is &amp;#34;in good condition&amp;#34; however it becomes flawless when I use the clinique 3 step system &amp;#34;REGULARLY&amp;#34; like the instructions recommend.</li>
            <li>The clinique is better for pulling out dirt from my pores, but not stripping all of the oil from my skin as well.</li>
            <li>sometimes in the evening I bypass the clarifying lotion and within 4 days can see the &amp;#34;flawlessness&amp;#34; diminish:)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>BUT during my \\&quot;girl time\\&quot; my skin is more oily</li>
            <li>and I feel like you will see better results.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product since the very first time that I tried it.</li>
            <li>But maybe for some people it works fine?</li>
            <li>and you have the genuine product guarantee.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face super clean with no build up!</li>
            <li>My skin has never been more clear, more clean, or more fresh since using this product of skin</li>
            <li>This product is the only thing that gave me good result, even reduced pigmentation.</li>
            <li>If you use a good face wash, I use pureology as facial cleanser and Clinique moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so I get the 2 which helps with that more oily week, and I will alternate the two because I think the 2 does a better cleansing job than the 3.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great toner, as Clinque matches their products to individual skin types.</li>
            <li>use it after cleansing with the Clinique Facial Soap and love the results!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Rare for a teenager</li>
            <li>This will be my first time using Clinique, ALL my friends are using it and it has worked.</li>
            <li>but it has a funny smell.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne and oily skin my whole life.</li>
            <li>i bought this product as a gift for my wife and i have to tell that she is very pleasent about it.</li>
            <li>I do suggest using the whole 3 pack combo though, the face wash, clarifying lotion and moisturizer though.</li>
            <li>I have used Clinique&#x27;s line of skin care since I was in high school, and I am 27 now.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, I leave the skin soft and dull, not burning as other products I have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While most face washes can dry out your skin, the last thing you would want to add to your face is a skin toner.  </li>
            <li>However, after using Clinque, or any other face wash, I find that this skin toner not only takes the shine and grime from my face, it makes my face feel, fresh, clean, and even.  </li>
            <li>Clinique has changed bottles a couple times and I see old products on here.  </li>
            <li>I believe that this set of skin care products are worth every penny I&#x27;ve spent on it, and have even compared it to the Pro-Active equivalent.  </li>
            <li>I use it together with the other 2 steps of the Clinique system for oily/combination skin and it really does what it says - it exfoliates gently yet does not dry out the skin.</li>
            <li>Skin looks and feel soft and it definitely clear-up the skin in a day or two.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend it for other combination skin people.</li>
            <li>They really take the time to address each and every different skin situation - I&#x27;m a big fan of this clarifying lotion - it helps take out redness and reduced the size of my pores a little...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an amazing product! It really deep cleans!I can&#x27;t imagine ever going without it.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after cleansing with the Clinique Facial Soap and love the results!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne and oily skin my whole life. This product is the only thing that gave me good result, even reduced pigmentation.</li>
            <li> A lot of people recommend witch hazel ($4 a bottle) as a daily toner. While I like witch hazel it tends to dry my skin out. The clinique is better for pulling out dirt from my pores, but not stripping all of the oil from my skin as well. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter, no complaints.  Rare for a teenager</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Got here in perfect timing. I also appreciate the little mirror and perfume sample that came along with it</li>
            <li> like I said my skin hated it. So may be its just not for me. But maybe for some people it works fine?</li>
            <li> have oily skin, no acne problems. My skin in general is &amp;#34;in good condition&amp;#34; however it becomes flawless when I use the clinique 3 step system &amp;#34;REGULARLY&amp;#34; like the instructions recommend. sometimes in the evening I bypass the clarifying lotion and within 4 days can see the &amp;#34;flawlessness&amp;#34; diminish:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always like this product. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face super clean with no build up!</li>
            <li> This helped clear-up my skin from acne. it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all while I use it atleast twice a day. (Other toners used to do that to my skin) Skin looks and feel soft and it definitely clear-up the skin in a day or two.Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months now and it is absolutely amazing! Prior to using it, my skin was extremely oily but now I find the oil production has actually decreased ALOT. I use it together with the other 2 steps of the Clinique system for oily/combination skin and it really does what it says - it exfoliates gently yet does not dry out the skin. I can&#x27;t say it has made my pores any smaller though... I would really recommend it for other combination skin people.</li>
            <li> This will be my first time using Clinique, ALL my friends are using it and it has worked. I Hope so TOO !</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very good product, I leave the skin soft and dull, not burning as other products I have used.</li>
            <li> It says combination normal/oil skin BUT during my \\&quot;girl time\\&quot; my skin is more oily so I get the 2 which helps with that more oily week, and I will alternate the two because I think the 2 does a better cleansing job than the 3.  Also beware of buying online.  Clinique has changed bottles a couple times and I see old products on here.  I buy from macys and pay a fraction of the cost including shipping...and you have the genuine product guarantee.</li>
            <li> Clinique Clarifying Lotion 3 is a good toner for oily skin &amp; I&#x27;ve used it for years.

            <li> Entrega en tiempo establecido por el vendedor, producto nuevo y en perfecto estado y correctamente embalado. Compre con toda confianza</li>
            <li> i bought this product as a gift for my wife and i have to tell that she is very pleasent about it. It is not expensive and works excellent for her pourpouse to mantein a beatifull skin</li>
            <li> Clinique is the only product my wife will use, so instead of fighting the shoppers at the mall, I ordered online from Amazon.  Product arrived on time as promised.  Will do again next Christmas.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped my acne.  Needs a moisturizer afterwards, though.</li>
            <li> Seems to remove make up but it has a funny smell. : : : :: : d:: :: :; ;</li>
            <li> I have used Clinique&#x27;s line of skin care since I was in high school, and I am 27 now.  I believe that this set of skin care products are worth every penny I&#x27;ve spent on it, and have even compared it to the Pro-Active equivalent.

            <li> This is like a basic item everyone should have. I don&#x27;t use it all the time but it&#x27;s nice to have.</li>
            <li> I love Clinique - their products are perfect for my skin type. They really take the time to address each and every different skin situation - I&#x27;m a big fan of this clarifying lotion - it helps take out redness and reduced the size of my pores a little... I do suggest using the whole 3 pack combo though, the face wash, clarifying lotion and moisturizer though. They all complement EACHOTHER and I feel like you will see better results. If you use a good face wash, I use pureology as facial cleanser and Clinique moisturizer. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product since the very first time that I tried it. You see how the impurities go away from your face. I would totally recommend it to a friend</li>
