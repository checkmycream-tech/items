            <li> I have very fine hair that likes to frizz and be dry. This stuff works wonders, makes my hair soft and smooth and look healthy. And it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. I love it.</li>
            <li> I just love this shampoo.  It is truly made for fine hair.  What volume &amp; body!  The shine and feel of my hair is really unbelievable.  My previous bottle lasted a long time because all you need is a small amount.  It is truly worth it.</li>
            <li> It is great for volumizing, but, it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as other shampoos. The conditioner isn&#x27;t all that great either...</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal products, always make my hair shine and have a wonderful scent. For me it works better then most products i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo so far but have said that about many that are no sitting half full. My husband is always remarking about the number of shampoo bottles in the shower. I always use them to wash out hand washables when traveling, rinse well without soapy residue so I do recycle -:) The smell is good and feel of my thin hair light and curly so as I said  it seems good and I will keep rotating it in with the other favorites. I would recommend this one. It it sure it&#x27;s worthy of five stars yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for many years and love it. It doesn&#x27;t condition which is perfect for baby fine hair. It gives hair lots of volume and shine.</li>
            <li> I damaged my hair so much I cried. Its so thin and lifeless. Dry and breakable. My hair used to be thick and strong. Not anymore  thanks to bleaching. Its black now. Point is...I ordered this shampoo that I found during my sleepless nights trying to find remedies for my hair. I am very pleased because it does EXACTLY what it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt thicker! Stronger! Fuller! Very Soft and silky!! It has shine and bounce!. I love it..I feel more confident and hopeful. I hope this can help someone out there that ever went through the disastrous thin hair problems i went through like it has helped me! No doubt about it Five Stars!</li>
            <li> I use this when I run out of my usual Korean hair conditioner. It detangles and makes my hair shiny but I use a lot more of it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 5 years and it makes my hair feel soft and gives it great volume.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo and conditioner duo based on the reviews.  It did nothing for my fine, thin hair except made it even softer with less volume if that is even possible, and I only apply the conditioner to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to try something else :(  Maybe a hair transplant at this point.  Ugh.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with fine, fly away hair. Hair  appears thicker and is easier to handle. It also helps your hair to shine; however, shine is also produced by good nutrition and eating good olive oil in your salad.&lt;br /&gt;I am frustrated that I can no longer find it at the local stores. L&#x27;Oreal keeps changing the products on the shelf. Now it is &#x27;Paris&#x27; and Viva Pro is no longer there. If they continue this I will change to another companies product. It costs too much to buy it on the computer.</li>
            <li> I wish L&#x27;Oreal would carry this shampoo again in the stores. This is one of the best for fine, color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many others but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> It does produce  volume and conditions well but the best part is it detangles as well. Have fine hair and it makes it easy to comb thru damp hair.</li>
            <li> Extremely strong fragrance with this product...it was leaking when it arrived and it triggered an asthma attack... I had to throw it out on the porch!  Luckiy Amazon took care of things for me--</li>
            <li> I need a shampoo for fine hair. This is great it give my hair the need lift it has needed. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to females that care about their hair care. I like this product because I have used it and it works better compared to other brands. I choose this rating because I haven&#x27;t been able to use this product for some time until I found it here at Amazon.</li>

            <li> This shampoo and conditioner gave my hair extra volume - and shine - that lasted 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely fine hair - so I am very happy with this product.</li>
