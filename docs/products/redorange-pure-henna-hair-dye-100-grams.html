    <ol>
            <li>Which means it seemed as though the gray hairs were going to win the race!  </li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the price, quality, and experience of using this product, and will def.</li>
            <li>The product worked great!</li>
            <li>The greatest hair dye ever...</li>
            <li>I have seen great results for those with blond hair or chemically bleached hair.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>This product combined with indigo, works perfectly, but I do wish it lasted longer but other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>The process for this henna is so easy - just mix with warm water and apply to your hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is in much better condition now too.</li>
            <li>have so many peaple compliment me on my hair color and ask what I use on it</li>
            <li>Make sure to put cream or petroleum jelly along your hairline because henna WILL stain your skin, and you don&#x27;t want to have orange temples.  </li>
            <li>a note - when purchasing the product, be sure to check that the seller is \\&quot;Harvest Moon\\&quot; or \\&quot;Henna Hut.\\</li>
            <li>I love the color of my hair since using this.  </li>
            <li>most of us don&#x27;t have hair that is THAT color.</li>
            <li>Better put a shower-cap on it or you lose mud bits to the floor.</li>
            <li>And it does create interesting nuances.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re FAMILY OWNED with FANTASTIC customer service!</li>
            <li>At first it looks great, a really nice bright red orange.</li>
            <li>This works as good as conventional dye...make sure to use it with shelly oil (aka mehndi/mehandi/henna oil) to get the full bright orange shade!</li>
            <li>SO easy; easiest coloring I have ever done</li>
            <li>Colors came out fantastic too...</li>
            <li>The color makes the grey a beautiful bright copper shade with sparkling red highlights in the brown portion.</li>
            <li>Great product, it did provide a nice red hue,but  hair gets super dry, just make sure to follow up with a good deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>The combination makes a beautiful, rich black.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been asked what I use to dye my hair by complete strangers because the color is so nice and truly eye</li>
            <li>It has a smell of hay, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>HOT!</li>
            <li>It dyed my hair a bit darker than I liked and the consistency was not as easy to work with and use, so I was happy to see that Harvest Moon was once again the seller, as I love the Henna Hut product in particular, and really appreciate being able to purchase it here instead of via their website (which is a little hard to navigate).</li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for over a year, gives a beautiful natural red color with vibrant highlights.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I was happy to find that you can have intense red hair with a completely natural</li>
            <li>Tips for use: make sure the powder is completely mixed (no bumps) and apply to sections using a dye brush (found in any beauty supply store).</li>
            <li>I like the color my hair came out and would recommend this product to anyone interested in trying a healthier choice to hair color.</li>
            <li>a little oranger then i expected but as always henna works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair red for seven years, and recently decided to move away from chemical hair dyes, as they aren&#x27;t good for you.  </li>
            <li>Well ... after extensive research, and many failed attempts at finding a substitute for the toxic, chemical dyes, I found the combination of Red Henna, and Indigo coloring to be the perfect solution!</li>
            <li>I used all sorts of color protection products but it still fades fast.</li>
            <li>It was messy and the waiting time is long but the color it great.  </li>
            <li>because it is more of a solid/paste than conventional dye it is easier to control.</li>
            <li>It only needs to sit for one hour, and the color is vibrant, lively, and natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Invest in some gloves and use old towels.  </li>
            <li>There is no grating, no heating, no adding of other ingredients - and the texture is very easy to apply to your head (though messy!).  </li>
            <li>This dye does NOT give a red head a natural looking color.....</li>
            <li>I could see a tiny reflection of red in direct sunlight.</li>
            <li>I was concerned because the directions were different and the ingredients were not listed, but the seller assured me it was the exact same product as I had previously used.  </li>

            <li> I am an African American that learned in my 30&#x27;s that I was allergic to dye, but didn&#x27;t have any grey hair back then, so it wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long for some reason..</li>
            <li> Also, the henna hardens as it sets so it is easiest to do the roots to tips of an entire section before moving on to another section (unlike conventional dyes where all the roots are done before all the rest).</li>
            <li> It remains dark, without fading, and I only have to reapply for outgrown roots.</li>
            <li> So now I mix the red/orange with deep red henna in a half in half formula.</li>
            <li> It was not a cute streak or distinguishing spot, but a splash of white framing my face, leaving the rest of my hair brown!</li>
            <li> I get no hives or other unwanted effects.</li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate ladies who developed an allergy to hair dye ... later in life ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thicker than I expected when adding the recommended amount of water, so added about two cups of  green tea and black cherry tea mixture.</li>
            <li> NO boiling water, NO p.i.t.a. mess like the typical henna or coloring.</li>
            <li> I found that it wasn&#x27;t nearly as messy as all the reviews claimed...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was supposed to wash out after a few weeks?</li>
            <li> wasted effort and money.</li>
            <li> The henna smelled like dried grass, and even after leaving it in for two hours, there was no change in the color of my hair.  </li>
            <li> But within just a few washes its faded to a dull, slightly brown.</li>
            <li> never liked putting chemical dyes on my hair</li>
            <li> Twenty years later I had to wage war on the grey that sprouted, creating the worst effect I could never dream up.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

I only use Harvest Moon and could not be happier!</li>
            <li> i only used hanna red, it covers my gray and it gave a brownish /red color, which i like , so i don&#x27;t bother use the indigo color.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for over a year, gives a beautiful natural red color with vibrant highlights.&lt;br /&gt;I have so many peaple compliment me on my hair color and ask what I use on it so I just recommend henna hut products.</li>

I was concerned because the directions were different and the ingredients were not listed, but the seller assured me it was the exact same product as I had previously used.  It dyed my hair a bit darker than I liked and the consistency was not as easy to work with and use, so I was happy to see that Harvest Moon was once again the seller, as I love the Henna Hut product in particular, and really appreciate being able to purchase it here instead of via their website (which is a little hard to navigate).</li>

            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long for some reason.. I didn&#x27;t think it was supposed to wash out after a few weeks?</li>
            <li> I love the color of my hair since using this.  It was messy and the waiting time is long but the color it great.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Hmmmm. This dye does NOT give a red head a natural looking color.....carrot colored...&amp;#34;carrot top&amp;#34; is an expression....most of us don&#x27;t have hair that is THAT color. Good luck if you give it a try....I wanted it for my beard....sigh....wasted effort and money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thicker than I expected when adding the recommended amount of water, so added about two cups of  green tea and black cherry tea mixture. It smells like dirt, but I don&#x27;t mind, I will post pictures after (it&#x27;s on my hair currently)</li>
            <li> The product worked great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been asked what I use to dye my hair by complete strangers because the color is so nice and truly eye-catching.&lt;br /&gt;I never liked putting chemical dyes on my hair and I was happy to find that you can have intense red hair with a completely natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is very different though. You mix the powder with water until you have a yoghurt like paste. It has a smell of hay, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant. That paste goes onto and into the hair for one to two hours. That&#x27;s the &amp;#34;mudhead&amp;#34; phase. Better put a shower-cap on it or you lose mud bits to the floor. You wash it out and are finished when the water runs clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each consequent washing the color does bleed a bit into the water. So it goes from a deep red to a bit of a lighter tone, but I think that is only noticeably to me. And it does create interesting nuances.</li>
            <li> you MUST check out henna hut.. SO easy; easiest coloring I have ever done and it smells, feels divine. And, \\&quot;you know\\&quot; - it&#x27;s Henna! Here a one step process too. NO waiting, NO boiling water, NO p.i.t.a. mess like the typical henna or coloring. LOVE it. and they&#x27;re FAMILY OWNED with FANTASTIC customer service! Colors came out fantastic too... See my pic - used Deep Red/Natural Henna mix.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time..!!!! The greatest hair dye ever...Doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair and last a loooong time!</li>
            <li> I have dark/medium brown hair and decided to try this product for a a hint of highlights. I could see a tiny reflection of red in direct sunlight. I left the product in for several hours thinking that would make a difference. I have seen great results for those with blond hair or chemically bleached hair. I will try a semi-permanent color.</li>
            <li> a little oranger then i expected but as always henna works great!</li>
            <li> This dye did not work for me.  I followed the directions on the packet, as well as advice and instructions from several websites.  The henna smelled like dried grass, and even after leaving it in for two hours, there was no change in the color of my hair.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product combined with indigo, works perfectly, but I do wish it lasted longer but other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> makes my wife&#x27;s hair look just like it did when she was a teenager. HOT!</li>
            <li> Great product, it did provide a nice red hue,but  hair gets super dry, just make sure to follow up with a good deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I rated this 5 stars because of the price and quality.  I like the color my hair came out and would recommend this product to anyone interested in trying a healthier choice to hair color.</li>
