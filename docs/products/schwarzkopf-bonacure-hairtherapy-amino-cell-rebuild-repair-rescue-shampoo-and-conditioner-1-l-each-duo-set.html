            <li>I love the smell and the way my hair feels and looks after I use this shampoo and conditioner.</li>

            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li>I just love this BC product.  </li>
            <li>It feels so much better and adds body &amp; shine.  </li>
            <li>Love this combo.</li>
            <li>I also love the way it makes my hair smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I actually first bought this product in a store and loved it but could no longer find it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product from my suply house where I live, and it is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>Previous version of Schwartzkopf Bonacure was wonderful.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I can find it and the conditioner on Amazon.com for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>My hair is damaged from a chemical process I had done &amp; this has helped to smooth out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li>The product was in its original package.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem like the original product.</li>
            <li>Ever since I first started using Schwarzkopf products, I fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is the original.</li>
            <li>I find myself having to have to wash my hair a couple times to feel like it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, my favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>I really wish this stuff was better than it is.</li>
            <li>I decided to use this product after having my hair permed straight and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Quick.</li>
            <li>It feels light, foamy and very gentle on the hair, yet still cleanses the hair well.</li>
            <li>It comes with a great little re-usable tote bag and pumps for both bottles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than others for a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent is so fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dissapointed because I love so many of Schwarzkopf&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li>Actually I like the shampoo little more than cream rinse but both still great.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and is very easy to comb though after conditioning.</li>
            <li>Talk about fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Caitlin was using this product when we first met, but then stopped when it ran out.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll have to ask her about how well it works ;-)</li>
            <li>The top of the plastic wrapping on the shampoo and conditioner was ripped open on receipt.</li>
            <li>There was a cheap red lunch bag also but, honestly, I&#x27;d rather have the second pump.</li>
            <li>These products really did rescue my hair and continue to do so every day!</li>
            <li>It works so well and feels like it has helped my hair so much since I started using it!</li>
            <li>this stuff helped bring some life back in to it but still needs more work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for that day a washing after it&#x27;s dry, but it make my hair more oily the next day than other shampoos/conditioners.</li>
            <li>Spend a little but more and get it a salon!</li>
            <li>Plus it makes my unbleached hair extra strong and silky.</li>
            <li>This leads me to conclude that it is either very old, or more likely counterfeit packaging of another product.</li>
            <li>use it for few years now and can;t say anything but good things about this product, nice smell and consistency, last long</li>
            <li>Really helped my damaged hair; feels much softer and stronger.</li>
            <li>and it really smoothed my hair a lot.  </li>
            <li>It really does repair damage.  </li>
            <li>I think that the name really fits.  </li>
            <li>I believe this product has really helped restore my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is to be expected when using bleach, but this shampoo and conditioner makes those strips much more manageable.</li>
            <li>It smells different, and doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original.  </li>
            <li>If you have healthy hair, it might weigh it down a lot if you use it every day.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this shampoo and conditioner is that I do not have to use a different shampoo and conditioner once a week to remove the build up that I can get from those that claim to deliver extra moisture and repair damage.  </li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a product to help restore you hair, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner set left my hair feeling soft, silky, and clean.</li>
            <li>absolutely worth it especially for the price .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product normally would make ur hair supper soft and have lots of volume.</li>
            <li>have been using this product for nearly 7 years now and even if I switch over to some other product , invariably I come back to this one :)</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and silky,smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>The hair becomes soft, untangled and I always feel tempted to skip the conditioner.</li>
            <li>They make my hair soft and think.</li>
            <li>I never realized how much I missed that smell until I bought this for her as a birthday present</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive scalp, I would not recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>When I bought this product from the salon my hair was soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have my hair professionally dyed 4 or 5 times a year.</li>
            <li>I had no issues and it came in nice packaging with 2 pumps (one was broken but</li>
            <li>I already have pretty coarse hair, and prior to damaging it, I used this shampoo and conditioner combo</li>
            <li>just because of this reason I m not going to buy this product in near future..........</li>
            <li>Not as thick as the original formulation.</li>
            <li>Also my hair did not feel at all like it normally does with the shampoo I buy other times.</li>

            <li> Not as thick as the original formulation.</li>
            <li> Also my hair did not feel at all like it normally does with the shampoo I buy other times.</li>
            <li> I recently had some blonde strips (bleach) put in my very dark hair and it make my normally shiny and silky hair turn course and brittle.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the conditioner is the real deal.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged by blow drying and flat iron</li>
            <li> I am disapointed, I  received the previous version, therefore received an old product</li>
            <li> I have been getting perms for a long time now and stopped because my hair was turning brittle on the ends.  </li>
            <li> When my hair is dry, I also feel that the hair is still well moisturized</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry my hair out at all like a lot of shampoos can do.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hairstylist recommended this product for her in order to protect her hair color and provide more time between coloring which is very expensive for someone with long curly hair; the conditioner leaves her hair manageable.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner have the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> it feels like my money I spent in buying this product is getting leaked...........</li>
            <li> My hairdresser has warned me to be careful of using stronger/salon products to once a week because it can go the other way and feel mushy on the ends.  </li>
            <li> There  were no damages, no leakages and, unlike other reviewers, I received pumps for the each bottle I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I had extremely damaged hair from stripping the black dye out of it.  </li>
            <li> So thankful I found it on Amazon for half the cost.</li>
            <li> I am half way through the bottles.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it one star is because I used to use the l&#x27;oreal pro intensive repair (too expensive), and my experience with that has set the bar too high.</li>
            <li> like the way it feels after it has dried.</li>
            <li> This was definitely not genuine product from Schwarzkopf</li>
            <li> Hence a lot of shampoo is getting wasted every day........</li>
            <li> I am hairstylist and I ordered this product on here to just save a few dollars!</li>
            <li> The quality is not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the product because some reviews said it was diluted/ fake.</li>
            <li> But the pumps were broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the outcome, this has allot of perfume smell to it &amp; does not help repair or rebuild hair.</li>
            <li> It is crazy what hair salons &amp; even those beauty supply stores want to charge you for a small bottle of shampoo</li>
            <li> It is so unfortunate they don&#x27;t sell all of their products in the US.</li>
            <li> My hair was stiff and it&#x27;s the worst shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed to find out the formula was changed.</li>
            <li> totally disappointed..........</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and feel I was ripped off.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner is great and smells amazing. I was a little skeptical about the product because some reviews said it was diluted/ fake. I had no issues and it came in nice packaging with 2 pumps (one was broken but idc because I dont use them anyway). I decided to use this product after having my hair permed straight and so far so good. The reason I gave it one star is because I used to use the l&#x27;oreal pro intensive repair (too expensive), and my experience with that has set the bar too high.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed to find out the formula was changed. It smells different, and doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original.  I would not recommend this changed version at all! Wish they would change it back.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the purchase, the shampoo is so nice as is the conditioner.  I have long hair and is very easy to comb though after conditioning.</li>
            <li> Really helped my damaged hair; feels much softer and stronger.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the conditioner. The shampoo is ok but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll order again. Both conditioner and shampoo smells like something my grandma would wear.  I do like the repair rescue sealed ends. The only thing is I couldn&#x27;t find it in he 5.1 oz size only the 2.6 oz size. The 2.6 size cost 11.00 when I can buy the 5.1 size at a beauty store for 20.00 with out shipping cost.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like I hadn&#x27;t washed the conditioner out properly. My hair was stiff and it&#x27;s the worst shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m dissapointed because I love so many of Schwarzkopf&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> Previous version of Schwartzkopf Bonacure was wonderful. The texture, aroma and results were great and friends and strangers alike commented often on my hair quality, as well as the wonderful aroma. This version changed and diminished the quality in each of these attributes. I will no longer purchase these products.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased same from amazon or my hairstylist but this time  it smells completely different. Also my hair did not feel at all like it normally does with the shampoo I buy other times. This leads me to conclude that it is either very old, or more likely counterfeit packaging of another product. I was very disappointed and feel I was ripped off.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my order and especially impressed with the way the order was packed. There  were no damages, no leakages and, unlike other reviewers, I received pumps for the each bottle I ordered.  Shampoo and conditioner have the quality I expected. I will recommend  Larkin Supply seller, I ordered from, to my friends and I will order my supply from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I am disapointed, I  received the previous version, therefore received an old product</li>
            <li> I love Schwarzkopf hair products. It is so unfortunate they don&#x27;t sell all of their products in the US. Finding this one made my day! I love the smell and the way my hair feels and looks after I use this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s absolutely worth it especially for the price .&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for nearly 7 years now and even if I switch over to some other product , invariably I come back to this one :)</li>
            <li> I just love Schwarzkopf product.I have been using this product since 2 years and I am very happy with its quality.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and silky,smooth and shiny. The hair becomes soft, untangled and I always feel tempted to skip the conditioner. It feels light, foamy and very gentle on the hair, yet still cleanses the hair well. When my hair is dry, I also feel that the hair is still well moisturized&lt;br /&gt;It has a great scent.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it feels after it has dried. It&#x27;s better than others for a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I love. I really love this product.</li>
            <li> Quick. The product was in its original package. But the pumps were broken.</li>
            <li> Talk about fast shipping! Ordered Saturday was on my door step Monday. Price is amazing, product even better.</li>
            <li> I love these products! They make my hair soft and think. The scent is so fresh. I bought the shampoo, conditioner and the repair for split ends. They are all great! I would reccommend.</li>
            <li> Caitlin was using this product when we first met, but then stopped when it ran out. I never realized how much I missed that smell until I bought this for her as a birthday present and she used it again. I can only vouch for the scent--you&#x27;ll have to ask her about how well it works ;-)</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hairstylist recommended this product for her in order to protect her hair color and provide more time between coloring which is very expensive for someone with long curly hair; the conditioner leaves her hair manageable.  She just loves the way her hair feels, shines and looks.</li>
            <li> I received the 1L bottles of shampoo and conditioner I ordered and received 1 pump. Am I supposed to take it out of the shampoo and put it in the conditioner every time I wash my hair? I wouldn&#x27;t think that is what you had in mind and doesn&#x27;t even make sense. The top of the plastic wrapping on the shampoo and conditioner was ripped open on receipt. There was a cheap red lunch bag also but, honestly, I&#x27;d rather have the second pump.</li>
            <li> I had extremely damaged hair from stripping the black dye out of it.  I already have pretty coarse hair, and prior to damaging it, I used this shampoo and conditioner combo and it really smoothed my hair a lot.  It was a godsend after I fried my hair, and I continue to use it now that my hair is healthier.  It really does repair damage.  If you have healthy hair, it might weigh it down a lot if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, my favorite shampoo and conditioner! I have tried so my and nothing compares. Plus, I have been paying double for it at the salon. So thankful I found it on Amazon for half the cost. What an awesome for great stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it! It leaves my hair healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li> simply awesome. I have been using product for 2 years now. it make my hair look good and healthy. It does not frizz your hair.</li>
            <li> This was definitely not genuine product from Schwarzkopf</li>
            <li> Not happy with the outcome, this has allot of perfume smell to it &amp; does not help repair or rebuild hair. Does cause allot of build up though. If you have a sensitive scalp, I would not recommend using this product. I will not purchase this product ever again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!!!</li>
            <li> I just love this BC product.  Actually I like the shampoo little more than cream rinse but both still great.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product! I am hairstylist and I ordered this product on here to just save a few dollars! Big mistake! I have used this product from my suply house where I live, and it is an amazing product! The shampoo and conditioner I ordered her off amazon was counterfeit! This product normally would make ur hair supper soft and have lots of volume. This product left my hair with massave build up! To the point of needing a clarifying treatment to fix this problem! Do not purchase this product!!!!!! Spend a little but more and get it a salon!</li>
            <li> This shampoo really takes care of my colored, chlorine and salt water soaked and sun dried hair.  I am thrilled that I can find it and the conditioner on Amazon.com for a reasonable price.  My favorite part about this shampoo and conditioner is that I do not have to use a different shampoo and conditioner once a week to remove the build up that I can get from those that claim to deliver extra moisture and repair damage.  I think that the name really fits.  These products really did rescue my hair and continue to do so every day!</li>
            <li> use it for few years now and can;t say anything but good things about this product, nice smell and consistency, last long</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem like the original product. When I bought this product from the salon my hair was soft and silky. Won&#x27;t buy this again. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after 2 months of its delivery....Packing of product ( Shampoo) is not at all good....its getting leaked.....Hence a lot of shampoo is getting wasted every day........ just because of this reason I m not going to buy this product in near future..........it feels like my money I spent in buying this product is getting leaked........... you should check the products packing before shipping..............I m totally disappointed..........:::.....&lt;br /&gt;(</li>
            <li> The product was good. Ever since I first started using Schwarzkopf products, I fell in love with them. Though not in excellent quality as the 8oz, it still serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged from a chemical process I had done &amp; this has helped to smooth out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Smells really good &amp; a great price.  It is crazy what hair salons &amp; even those beauty supply stores want to charge you for a small bottle of shampoo, it is a good bargain going through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is amazing!  It is my favorite of all shampoo&#x27;s and conditioner&#x27;s that I have used! A++++</li>
            <li> Good hair care products-</li>
            <li> It is not the same conditioner as before. Not as thick as the original formulation. No pumps were sent when I ordered 3 sets of conditioner/shampoo. Not sure if the conditioner is the real deal. The shampoo is the original.</li>
            <li> I have been getting perms for a long time now and stopped because my hair was turning brittle on the ends.  I did some research and several articles mentioned trying products with Protein. I actually first bought this product in a store and loved it but could no longer find it.  I believe this product has really helped restore my hair.  It feels so much better and adds body &amp; shine.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it every time you wash, but maybe once a week.  My hairdresser has warned me to be careful of using stronger/salon products to once a week because it can go the other way and feel mushy on the ends.  But if you are looking for a product to help restore you hair, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife tells me that this is the exact product that she usually buys from her salon.  It comes with a great little re-usable tote bag and pumps for both bottles.</li>
            <li> Love this combo. It works so well and feels like it has helped my hair so much since I started using it!</li>
            <li> only one problem...it&#x27;s so good that my daughter swiped it from me!</li>
            <li> LUV the smell of this stuff. My hair is damaged by blow drying and flat iron this stuff helped bring some life back in to it but still needs more work. I am half way through the bottles.</li>
            <li> I have my hair professionally dyed 4 or 5 times a year. I recently had some blonde strips (bleach) put in my very dark hair and it make my normally shiny and silky hair turn course and brittle. This is to be expected when using bleach, but this shampoo and conditioner makes those strips much more manageable. Plus it makes my unbleached hair extra strong and silky.</li>
            <li> I really wish this stuff was better than it is. I find myself having to have to wash my hair a couple times to feel like it&#x27;s clean. It&#x27;s great for that day a washing after it&#x27;s dry, but it make my hair more oily the next day than other shampoos/conditioners.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner set left my hair feeling soft, silky, and clean. I also love the way it makes my hair smell. It didn&#x27;t dry my hair out at all like a lot of shampoos can do. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but this is NOT the same product that I purchased in a salon.  The quality is not nearly as good.</li>
