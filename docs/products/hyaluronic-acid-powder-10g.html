            <li>Well I started getting low and did some research only to find, I could make my own much much cheaper and more effective hyaluronic acid by buying from Bulk Supplement.</li>
            <li>As usual bulk has done a great job in refining another product</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used hyaluronic acid powder so I have nothing to compare it to.  </li>

            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It takes so little and it is a huge money saver!  </li>
            <li>HA but with this you can make your serum as powerful as you like AND you can take it internally as well !</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a taste, but sprinkled on food is the easy way down and not a lot is required.</li>
            <li>This is much better than taking pills which were not effective for me.</li>
            <li>So far it works well on my skin.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I used it daily, in am as a facial serum.  It&#x27;s been 2 weeks, and I&#x27;ll give it another 2-4weeks to see effects on wrinkles. So far it feels great on the skin with out reaction.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use, good value for the size.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Even the smallest bag gives you tons of powder to make lots of HA. Easy to make.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Came on time</li>
            <li> As usual bulk has done a great job in refining another product</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use in home made cosmetics. Fast delivery. Very good quality. Quality report included. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Makes a nice gel you can use alone or add to you lotions.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and high quality</li>
            <li> Very difficult to dissove!  Clumped up like crazy.  Should have come with instructions on how to do this.</li>
            <li> I used this to make hyaluronic acid serum...it worked great</li>
            <li> Great I used 5 scoops of powder for 98grams of water!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used hyaluronic acid powder so I have nothing to compare it to.  I made a serum with hyaluronic acid and distilled water.  After two weeks of use I like the change in the appearance of my skin, it seems smoother.</li>
            <li> I have use this product for first time, and I am glad that is work fantastic my skin look very nice!</li>
            <li> I SAW IT HAD ARSENIC IN IT  ....DONT KNO WHETHER TO USE IT AS FACE LOTION NOW</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It is very difficult to mix. It comes with a one gm. measure which helps.  Fill a quart jar one half full with ice. Add water until the ice is covered. Add one teaspoon of sea salt. Mix until the water is ice cold. Slowly sift in two or three grams of powder while swirling the water ice mix. Shake well to mix. Then fill the bottle full with cold water. Keep in the refrigerator. Drink 1/4th cup (150 to 200mg) twice a day to free up joints and to help skin health. This is much better than taking pills which were not effective for me. Injections may work better but this works just fine. After a month both my wife and I (we are both tennis players) could tell a big difference in how our joints and skin feel.</li>
            <li> Super fast arrival on product!!  seems to be great. I was buying this to mix in skincare.  Although not part of the purchase deal,  thought it would be great to have a paper with more info about product included inside. There was one with all molecular theory, but some uses or ratios on mixing would have been really awesome! Just a thought :)</li>
            <li> It was as Beautiful as expected</li>
            <li> Well, I bought some hyaluronic acid made already, and I loved it! I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of moisture it drew into my very dry sun damaged skin.

I will continue to buy these products and recommend them to anyone who wants to make their own face regiment that really works and is super cheap!</li>
            <li> This product works well and I just sprinkle it on food. I do notice a difference in the stiffness of my knees and will continue to use it. Don&#x27;t try and put it in a liquid as it doesn&#x27;t dissolve well. It clumps up. It has a bit of a taste, but sprinkled on food is the easy way down and not a lot is required.</li>
            <li> Perfect for an HA cream.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery time. I use this for a face serum.&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT for making your OWN serum ! Most HA serum is all water &amp; only 1% HA but with this you can make your serum as powerful as you like AND you can take it internally as well !</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have HA to work with in my home cosmetic routine. I am enjoying using the solution I made with it. So far it works well on my skin. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!! I made my own serum and it&#x27;s fantastic my skin is really transforming, its kind of amazing. I try not to get my hopes up about trendy products but hyaluronic acid serum is no joke it actually works to reduce fine lines and wrinkles and moisturize your skin without a greasy feeling. Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> Works similar to the bottled formulations for sale for much more money. I wish there were mixing instructions because first batch was too thick.</li>
