            <li>It is very light which is good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healthy/natural and smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also on their Pinterest board @urbanette under Organic Beauty Products We Love.</li>
            <li>Love Love  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mine and my daughter&#x27;s favorite brand of body oil.</li>
            <li>luxurious, lovely scented body oil.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for any more.</li>
            <li>It mostly smells like chamomile, which is a smell I dislike.</li>
            <li>I thought, for the price, I&#x27;d get something better.</li>
            <li>My skin has a healthy sheen to it but is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I truly love this.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is mild and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Rich, emollient, and has a very pleasant smell- this is coming from someone who loves rose and such is very picky about what kinds of rose smells</li>
            <li>I saw this reviewed in Urbanette Magazine as a great natural product.</li>
            <li>Love this product, but the Damascus Rose Hip scent may be off-putting to some folks who&#x27;re sensitive to thicker scents.</li>
            <li>So smooth to apply and the fragrance is heavenly.</li>
            <li>and it looked very nice the next day.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder how much of the good stuff you&#x27;re really getting.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Not at all heavy, and the scent is light and nice.  </li>
            <li>I put it on after the shower and it absorbed fairly fast.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and soft without any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I mix this my Cleure body lotion for a little extra moisturizing, leaves my skin soft and wonderful feeling without any irritation</li>
            <li>healthful, organic and pure.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>It is readily absorb-able.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this again and I will order the whole collection now.</li>
            <li>oil is a lighter moisturizer than coconut oil but works very well.</li>
            <li>This one really does it.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely, and very detectable...yet does evaporate so that it does not hang in the air and is not heavy enough to bother any scent-sensitive people.</li>
            <li>I used to use pure coconut oil, which has a pleasant but also very thick smell.</li>
            <li>The oil is very hydrating and healing for even the most sensitive or dry skin.</li>
            <li>It smells calming and high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it if you like the scent of roses.</li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning with super soft skin!</li>
            <li>Despite the moisturizing effect, it soaks in pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an overly &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; residue on your skin like other oils do.</li>
            <li>but my skin is super dry</li>
            <li>This is pretty bog standard stuff.</li>
            <li>but if you want to extend the life of the bottle just mix a little in your hands with unscented or lightly scented lotion when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, totally not an oily feel, I even put some on my face the other night because it felt particularly dry</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of the &amp;#34;dream cream&amp;#34; by LUSH handmade cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at the third bottle and not tired of it yet.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t have any bad reaction to this rose body oil.</li>
            <li>I am going against general opinion here</li>
            <li>Although a little goes a long way I find I need more than other oils when applying</li>

            <li> only complaint is that while I like the pump and bottle size the pump has started to leak a bit after a little use.</li>
            <li> The coconut was too thick of a smell for them, so I switched to this.</li>
            <li> Nothing in this oil has become irritating.</li>
            <li> Having spent $23.00 on this I am very disappointed and won&#x27;t order any fragrance again that I have not already smelled.</li>
            <li> All in in all, a disappointment.</li>

            <li> Rich, emollient, and has a very pleasant smell- this is coming from someone who loves rose and such is very picky about what kinds of rose smells I think are &#x27;good&#x27;. This is great.</li>
            <li> I saw this reviewed in Urbanette Magazine as a great natural product. It&#x27;s also on their Pinterest board @urbanette under Organic Beauty Products We Love. It&#x27;s healthy/natural and smells AMAZING. I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Love Love  Love this oil!!.</li>
            <li> very warm and sexy oil. perfect after bath time! great scent too :) I will buy again for sure :D</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mine and my daughter&#x27;s favorite brand of body oil. healthful, organic and pure. don&#x27;t need to use much. goes a long way.</li>
            <li> luxurious, lovely scented body oil.  I love using it!</li>
            <li> Best versatile oil EVER. So smooth to apply and the fragrance is heavenly. I bought this two weeks ago and already ordered the next bottle!</li>
            <li> There is no junk in this oil.  As a person who will NOT apply anything but edible quality ingredients to their body this oil hits the mark.  It is readily absorb-able.  Not at all heavy, and the scent is light and nice.  You can&#x27;t ask for any more.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, totally not an oily feel, I even put some on my face the other night because it felt particularly dry and it looked very nice the next day. The smell reminds me of the &amp;#34;dream cream&amp;#34; by LUSH handmade cosmetics. It smells calming and high quality. Ingredients are a perfect combination. I will buy this again and I will order the whole collection now.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. This doesn&#x27;t even remotely smell like roses. It mostly smells like chamomile, which is a smell I dislike. I also noticed that on the ingredient listing, sea buckthorn oil is way down the list in order, even after the essential oils used to scent it. Makes me wonder how much of the good stuff you&#x27;re really getting. I thought, for the price, I&#x27;d get something better. This is pretty bog standard stuff. All in in all, a disappointment. No reflection on the seller, who shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about trying a body oil but my skin is super dry so I bought it. I put it on after the shower and it absorbed fairly fast. The rose scent is mild and is not overpowering. I woke up the next morning with super soft skin! All dry patches were gone! My skin has a healthy sheen to it but is not greasy. I have super sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t have any bad reaction to this rose body oil. I highly recommend trying it if you like the scent of roses.</li>
            <li> I truly love this. The scent is lovely, and very detectable...yet does evaporate so that it does not hang in the air and is not heavy enough to bother any scent-sensitive people. I used to use pure coconut oil, which has a pleasant but also very thick smell. I ended up moving into an apartment with two extremely allergic and sensitive people. The coconut was too thick of a smell for them, so I switched to this. Success!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This oil is a lighter moisturizer than coconut oil but works very well. I have sensitive skin, and so far so good! Nothing in this oil has become irritating. I actually find it soothing. I don&#x27;t currently use any other moisturizer. This one really does it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the third bottle and not tired of it yet. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I mix this my Cleure body lotion for a little extra moisturizing, leaves my skin soft and wonderful feeling without any irritation</li>
            <li> Very nice oil and smells very nice. This works and lasts all day on my out of space dry skin. Though my only complaint is that even though I apply this when damp right out of the shower, I still feel that I can run out of this quickly (do not get me wrong, a little can go a long way). It is very light which is good, I will continue with this to see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly~! Leaves skin smooth and soft without any greasy feeling. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Love this product, but the Damascus Rose Hip scent may be off-putting to some folks who&#x27;re sensitive to thicker scents.</li>
            <li> I am going against general opinion here but I do not like the scent of this oil! It smells like the stuff we used to use to drive away mosquitos. Having spent $23.00 on this I am very disappointed and won&#x27;t order any fragrance again that I have not already smelled.</li>
            <li> This oil is absolutely delightful! It is the perfect combination of floral, lavender, and chamomile scent and leaves my skin shimmering and smooth. The oil is very hydrating and healing for even the most sensitive or dry skin. Despite the moisturizing effect, it soaks in pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an overly &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; residue on your skin like other oils do. It does work best when applied in the evening so your skin has the night to soak it in or after a shower/bath. Although a little goes a long way I find I need more than other oils when applying but if you want to extend the life of the bottle just mix a little in your hands with unscented or lightly scented lotion when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that while I like the pump and bottle size the pump has started to leak a bit after a little use.</li>
