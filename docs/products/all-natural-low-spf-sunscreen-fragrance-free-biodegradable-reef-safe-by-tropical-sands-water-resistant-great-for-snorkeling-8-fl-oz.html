    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This sunscreen fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked perfectly everywhere.</li>
            <li>excellent</li>
            <li>It worked great for me.</li>
            <li>This works great on my skin and from keeping me get burned.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product and non toxic!!!</li>
            <li>I have used this sunscreen before and loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li>- you know when it is in good for maximum protection.</li>
            <li>Smells good too (not like chemicals).</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be one of those hippy products that sound wonderful but don&#x27;t work.      </li>
            <li>The best sunblock in the world isn&#x27;t as effective as protective clothing that blocks the light.  </li>
            <li>It keeps her from getting burned, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin any more than it already is!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>me, I like this lotion because the lotion feels good, smells good, and it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>Nice job blaming the consumer for a flaw in their product.</li>
            <li>For the rest of the family, we can get away with using any kind of sunscreen like Coppertone, but for my youngest daughter, I don&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li>Nice idea</li>
            <li>w/this on (could have been my own fault for not reapplying).  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a very safe rating though.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also biodegradable so you can safely use it if you go to eco-parks which is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>This year I have the best no-burn suntan I&#x27;ve had in my adult life.</li>
            <li>It comes out of the bottle in a nice smooth consistency as does the SPF30 and as soon as you apply it to your skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles and am ordering more.  </li>
            <li>The best sunblocks are the \\&quot;physical blockers\\&quot; which include both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.  </li>
            <li>the physical blockers, zinc oxide is broader spectrum, but it&#x27;s best to have a sunblock that has both the zinc and titanium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It served with great protection while also allowing me a nice brown tan...with no harsh chemical reactions.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT..</li>
            <li>I am rating them all better.</li>
            <li>Threw it out - better off with nothing.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe there aren&#x27;t more people complaining about this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could say better things about this</li>
            <li>If i&#x27;m going swimming, then fine, it seems to be okay</li>
            <li>More of a problem for hairy areas like the chest or legs for us men, but was still an issue even when applying to smooth skin (ladies).</li>
            <li>This summer, I tried three other sunscreens, all well rated by the Environmental Working Group, not all perfect, but way easier to use.  </li>
            <li>Mexitan (I still can&#x27;t get over the name...) goes on smoothly and stays on even after swimming.  </li>
            <li>So, I switched to the spf 15, and I managed to get a light tan after two weeks of being on the islands.  </li>
            <li>This year, I ordered two bottles (because I thought I already knew that I loved it) and was surprised to discover that it balls up and flakes off while you are applying it.</li>
            <li>I would use/buy it again and highly recommend it :) Have a blessed day!</li>
            <li>It spreads over the skin very easily and my skin doesn&#x27;t spread sunscreen very well.  </li>
            <li>Beyond this small issue this sunscreen is perfect.</li>
            <li>and i wanted a lotion that would be reef friendly.  </li>
            <li>So after I apply the product I have to use a towel to remove the flaking of the product from me and clean up the floor.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s pleasant to use, such as this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: good product, and well worth the relatively minor drawbacks, given the importance of keeping the plant life (i.e.. fish food) from dying off and keeping the aquatic environment healthy.</li>
            <li>Getting ready for our first camping trip on a beautiful Texas lake since my hypothyroidism diagnosis and going gluten free, I wanted a suntan lotion that was all natural.</li>
            <li>On the balance, I prefer the superior protection and lack of irritation from the \\&quot;physical blockers\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen last year and loved it.</li>
            <li>, I really wanted to love it.  </li>
            <li>At first, I used the spf 30 and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Really, except for the white flakes, this would be a great option.</li>
            <li>The word \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; is not the accurate scientific usage, because zinc oxide is a chemical just as much as Avobenzone is, it just isn&#x27;t a dye.  </li>
            <li>There are two types: \\&quot;physical blockers\\&quot; and chemicals that are, effectively, UV dyes.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use it with the ease of knowing it was all natural.</li>
            <li>This goes on very easily, but it does stay white on the skin because of the zinc.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m swimming and having fun in the sun, this doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but the teenager or the more self-conscious adult might refuse to use it for this reason.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s larger size and a better smell than most natural sunscreens--I have not used it in the sun yet though.</li>
            <li>There are other brands of sunscreen free of toxic ingredients that I like better.</li>
            <li>I have used it on fairly hot days when I have gone running - and it seemed to protect without sweating off.  </li>
            <li>You do need to make sure and rub it in to disappear, but I think that&#x27;s actually a plus</li>
            <li>After the first couple of days, I noticed I wasn&#x27;t burning, or getting any darker.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time yesterday at the pool.  </li>
            <li>Her skin is super sensitive to sun, and bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>However, now the 15 behaved like the 30 then, if not worse.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything.  </li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s invisible, but you have to rub it in really well.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much you will end up with that white-clown-makeup look.    </li>
            <li>I read the reviews that stated if that happens you are rubbing it in too much</li>
            <li>and I was very mindful of that,</li>
            <li>Other sunscreens might be easier to use but much more harmful to you than this stuff.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that it did offer sun protection and it was reef friendly.</li>
            <li>, I guess I&#x27;ll have to spend a few more dollars for a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>but  it kind of flakes off once you put it on which I am not sure if it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>I was fine with just letting it dry and then brushing off the chunks lightly with a dry towel, but I was applying in a bathroom, with a mirror.</li>
            <li>When you tried to rub it in more it just peeled up on your skin making a mess.  </li>
            <li>It works great, stays on for a minimum of 3 hours (which was as long as I spent outside).</li>
            <li>This product was highly recommended when researched on the web.</li>
            <li>You pretty much need to apply it until the white tint goes away and stop.</li>
            <li>To better clarify, I cannot rate this product on the effectiveness of the &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; as it pertains to blocking the suns harmful rays as I didn&#x27;t keep it on long enough.  </li>
            <li>I took a shower and put on my normal sunscreen instead.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the way the 30 went on, but the 15, I like.&lt;br /&gt;I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin, as I am very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Then, the 30 went on white and in little pieces, while the 15 went on smoothly and mostly disappeared, except for a barely detectably white sheen.  </li>
            <li>I have used the SPF 30 in the past and love it</li>
            <li>My wife felt the exact same way.  </li>
            <li>I spent a long time researching sunscreens that were actually more beneficial than harmful to the body.</li>
            <li>the smell is minimal and not unpleasant at all.  </li>
            <li>I know it has a shorter shelf life because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>With that in mind, I bought the 15 again, because I wanted a natural and biodegradable sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I tend to have negative reactions to many chemicals and ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and all natural (I am allergic to chemical sunscreens).</li>
            <li>I never did completely eliminate the stripes before winter.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;all natural&#x27; and &#x27;biodegradable&#x27; thing caught me, though, so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>We frequent the beach often, and spend a lot of time in the sun.  </li>
            <li>We bought this sunscreen specifically for her because of her sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, my skin is not too dry for the bottle I bought last year because I have some left and can easily apply that without any flaking.</li>
            <li>OK, the stuff is called &#x27;Mexitan&#x27;, and you have to admit that&#x27;s pretty cheesy.  </li>
            <li>Coming from fog country, I&#x27;m pretty white, and was concerned I would burn and have to make a second application every day.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen goes  on very easily - a little bit thicker than traditional brands, but easily rubs into the skin without leaving a film on the skin.  </li>
            <li>The later category are normally called \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; blocks and include things like Avobenzone etc.  </li>
            <li>Really, when you&#x27;re getting a physical blocker sunblock that&#x27;s titanium and zinc, they&#x27;re all the same.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem much different from regular sunscreen, and application wasn&#x27;t very tricky at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Mexitan 15 and 30 on crazy hot / bright days, and spent a lot of time out in the sun.</li>
            <li>I started using it early last summer and immediately developed &#x27;tiger stripes&#x27; in all the wrinkled places such as inside the elbows, as the stuff dilutes with sweat.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it for a trip to Mexico and barely used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to try another &amp;#34;All Natural Biodegradable Sunscreen&amp;#34; &amp; see if there are similar characteristics.</li>
            <li>I am quite disappointed that I must choose between getting a natural sunscreen at a low price but having to put up with flaking or purchasing a much more expensive sunscreen that goes on nice and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is too bad, because I like the good price for an all natural, non-nano sunscreen.</li>
            <li>If I were dressing up for an outdoor wedding on a sunny day, I&#x27;d definitely use a standard sunscreen that rubs in completely and unnoticeably for my face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>The 15 (far more than the 30) forms cottage cheesy globules as you apply it.</li>
            <li>We were really careful about re-applying, being 1st time users &amp; not sure how easily it washes off compared to standard sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must have applied too much because it turned into little balls and peeled off.  </li>

            <li> I have used the SPF 30 in the past and love it</li>
            <li> My wife felt the exact same way.  </li>
            <li> I spent a long time researching sunscreens that were actually more beneficial than harmful to the body.</li>
            <li> the smell is minimal and not unpleasant at all.  </li>
            <li> I know it has a shorter shelf life because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, I bought the 15 again, because I wanted a natural and biodegradable sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have negative reactions to many chemicals and ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It was inexpensive and all natural (I am allergic to chemical sunscreens).</li>
            <li> I never did completely eliminate the stripes before winter.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;all natural&#x27; and &#x27;biodegradable&#x27; thing caught me, though, so I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> We frequent the beach often, and spend a lot of time in the sun.  </li>
            <li> We bought this sunscreen specifically for her because of her sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, my skin is not too dry for the bottle I bought last year because I have some left and can easily apply that without any flaking.</li>
            <li> OK, the stuff is called &#x27;Mexitan&#x27;, and you have to admit that&#x27;s pretty cheesy.  </li>
            <li> Coming from fog country, I&#x27;m pretty white, and was concerned I would burn and have to make a second application every day.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes  on very easily - a little bit thicker than traditional brands, but easily rubs into the skin without leaving a film on the skin.  </li>
            <li> The later category are normally called \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; blocks and include things like Avobenzone etc.  </li>
            <li> Really, when you&#x27;re getting a physical blocker sunblock that&#x27;s titanium and zinc, they&#x27;re all the same.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem much different from regular sunscreen, and application wasn&#x27;t very tricky at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mexitan 15 and 30 on crazy hot / bright days, and spent a lot of time out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I started using it early last summer and immediately developed &#x27;tiger stripes&#x27; in all the wrinkled places such as inside the elbows, as the stuff dilutes with sweat.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it for a trip to Mexico and barely used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to try another &amp;#34;All Natural Biodegradable Sunscreen&amp;#34; &amp; see if there are similar characteristics.</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed that I must choose between getting a natural sunscreen at a low price but having to put up with flaking or purchasing a much more expensive sunscreen that goes on nice and smoothly.</li>
            <li> It is too bad, because I like the good price for an all natural, non-nano sunscreen.</li>
            <li> If I were dressing up for an outdoor wedding on a sunny day, I&#x27;d definitely use a standard sunscreen that rubs in completely and unnoticeably for my face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> The 15 (far more than the 30) forms cottage cheesy globules as you apply it.</li>
            <li> We were really careful about re-applying, being 1st time users &amp; not sure how easily it washes off compared to standard sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must have applied too much because it turned into little balls and peeled off.  </li>
            <li> I had read all the previous reviews and understand that this sunscreen goes on differently than my normal sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> So I can only recommend it if the product being natural overrides all other concerns.</li>
            <li> 2nd drawback is aesthetic: especially if you&#x27;re trying NOT to rub too much (see &#x27;chunks&#x27; above), it&#x27;s difficult NOT to look obviously whitened by this sunscreen</li>
            <li> The only way to get it off was to get it wet.</li>
            <li> According to their website, this is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; and occurs because of dry skin.</li>
            <li> With my excessively dry skin (per the company - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s dry at all)</li>
            <li> This process became much more of a chore or almost impossible when out on the beach or in the boat.</li>
            <li> But I only used it once or twice because I just looked ridiculous with white stuff all over my body and face.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than some other products, but I like that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seemed to protect us from burning as well as any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m assuming this is due to the zinc-oxide).</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is what it is</li>
            <li> It&#x27; not worth the money to find out.</li>
            <li> and sometimes you can see it run down my arms or legs, but</li>
            <li> However, with a better understanding of how terribly harmful standard sunscreen chemicals can be to aquatic life, from now on I&#x27;ll be using this or some other higher-priced biodegradable product ANYWHERE I swim (rivers, streams, lakes or ocean... probably not in a swimming</li>
            <li> It is so hard to put on, leaves the little white pieces everywhere</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even try to apply it if you&#x27;re slightly damp.  </li>
            <li> It has  a little bit of a fruity smell(which</li>
            <li> Little flakes and balls of sunscreen were all over the place - the floor, my bathing suit, and my skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not familiar with biodegradable sunscreens, but I would expect for it to behave like non-biodegradable sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Although it did leave behind little white flecks when rubbed in, I still gave it five stars.</li>
            <li> Plus, the stuff dried out my skin to the point of feeling prickling in some places.  </li>
            <li> And she&#x27;s got eczema which seems to get worse after being outside in the sun.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those sunblocks that are not easy to apply, it leaves a thin white residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a sunscreen w/good ingredients like this one, but I can&#x27;t get past the mess it makes.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong perfume to knock you out.  </li>

            <li> I just found it too difficult to apply (even when following directions I found online for this type of sunscreen).  </li>
            <li> Got an uneven burn in cloudy conditions!  </li>
            <li> I must say the lotion was not very good.</li>
            <li> Hardly visible,</li>
            <li> I did not use this product until the expiration to return window was closed and now I am stuck with a useless product.  </li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ll use those terms because, inaccurate as they are, those are the terms in common</li>
            <li> The product was &amp;#34;lumpy&amp;#34;, meaning it felt like I was applying cottage cheese to my skin &amp; would not effectively absorb into the skin - hence the &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; comment as it felt I was applying SPF 300.</li>
            <li> I was not very happy with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> this stuff on is not a good look.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible - sits on the surface of your skin and rubs right off.  </li>
            <li> It looked weird, and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use it for myself.</li>
            <li> I,m not sure if it&#x27;s just a bad bottle or the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I got a bad batch -- who knows.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> cutoms took it away--boo</li>
            <li> I have used this sunscreen before and loved it. I know it has a shorter shelf life because it&#x27;s all natural. The lotions I received just flaked up.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes  on very easily - a little bit thicker than traditional brands, but easily rubs into the skin without leaving a film on the skin.  It has  a little bit of a fruity smell(which I like).  I have used it on fairly hot days when I have gone running - and it seemed to protect without sweating off.  My husband uses the SPF30 and it works just as well.  He has had problems in the past with sunscreen stinging his skin -no problem with this brand.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I spent a long time researching sunscreens that were actually more beneficial than harmful to the body. This sunscreen fits the bill perfectly. It&#x27;s also biodegradable so you can safely use it if you go to eco-parks which is a nice feature.  I&#x27;ve used this sunscreen in Mexico, Aruba and the Gulf Coast and it&#x27;s worked perfectly everywhere. You do need to reapply if you go in the water as it gets washed off. There is also a learning curve to the application process. Unfortunately this is the sacrifice to having a healthy sunscreen. You pretty much need to apply it until the white tint goes away and stop. If you continue to rub the sunscreen will begin to flake off.   Beyond this small issue this sunscreen is perfect. Other sunscreens might be easier to use but much more harmful to you than this stuff.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product because i was going to do alot of smorkeling on my vacation and i wanted a lotion that would be reef friendly.  I must say the lotion was not very good. I was not very happy with this lotion.  It would not rub into the skin and left you white everywhere.  When you tried to rub it in more it just peeled up on your skin making a mess.  The only way to get it off was to get it wet. I would not buy this again. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that it did offer sun protection and it was reef friendly.</li>
            <li> I had bought and used both a Mexican SPF 30 and SPF 15 before.  Then, the 30 went on white and in little pieces, while the 15 went on smoothly and mostly disappeared, except for a barely detectably white sheen.  With that in mind, I bought the 15 again, because I wanted a natural and biodegradable sunscreen.  However, now the 15 behaved like the 30 then, if not worse.  It is so hard to put on, leaves the little white pieces everywhere and I worry that I am not evenly protected, that I actually don&#x27;t use it now.  So I can only recommend it if the product being natural overrides all other concerns.</li>
            <li> I have used the SPF 30 in the past and love it so I thought I would try the SPF 15.  This product does not apply well at all.  It comes out of the bottle in a nice smooth consistency as does the SPF30 and as soon as you apply it to your skin it flakes no matter how it is applied.  So after I apply the product I have to use a towel to remove the flaking of the product from me and clean up the floor. I did not use this product until the expiration to return window was closed and now I am stuck with a useless product.  Do not purchase this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.  I&#x27;ve gone through two bottles and am ordering more.  Here&#x27;s what you need to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The best sunblock in the world isn&#x27;t as effective as protective clothing that blocks the light.  This means a layer of tight-woven fabric that can fully block sunlight, and a broad-brim hat or umbrella.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you&#x27;re not going to cover up like that, then you need a sunblock.  There are two types: \\&quot;physical blockers\\&quot; and chemicals that are, effectively, UV dyes.  The later category are normally called \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; blocks and include things like Avobenzone etc.  The word \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; is not the accurate scientific usage, because zinc oxide is a chemical just as much as Avobenzone is, it just isn&#x27;t a dye.  However I&#x27;ll use those terms because, inaccurate as they are, those are the terms in common use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The best sunblocks are the \\&quot;physical blockers\\&quot; which include both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.  Failing that you need a broad-spectrum \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; blocker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the physical blockers is they do create a transparent white-ish film on the skin.  Hardly visible, but it&#x27;s there.  The problem with the \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; sunblocks is that they have a tendency to cause eye irritation, etc.  On the balance, I prefer the superior protection and lack of irritation from the \\&quot;physical blockers\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the physical blockers, zinc oxide is broader spectrum, but it&#x27;s best to have a sunblock that has both the zinc and titanium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings us back to this sunblock.  It&#x27;s titanium and zinc.  It&#x27;s in a big bottle.  Really, when you&#x27;re getting a physical blocker sunblock that&#x27;s titanium and zinc, they&#x27;re all the same.  The differences are in packaging, smell, marketing, feeling of the carrier (lotion), etc.  The active ingredient is what it is and I doubt there&#x27;s any difference from one zinc oxide to another zinc oxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I like this lotion because the lotion feels good, smells good, and it&#x27;s cheap.  Don&#x27;t believe marketing claims.  Just go with a zinc / titanium that&#x27;s pleasant to use, such as this one.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product and non toxic!!!</li>
            <li> Getting ready for our first camping trip on a beautiful Texas lake since my hypothyroidism diagnosis and going gluten free, I wanted a suntan lotion that was all natural. I tend to have negative reactions to many chemicals and ingredients.  The reviews on this one led me to try it. Although it did leave behind little white flecks when rubbed in, I still gave it five stars. It served with great protection while also allowing me a nice brown tan...with no harsh chemical reactions. I was able to use it with the ease of knowing it was all natural. I would use/buy it again and highly recommend it :) Have a blessed day!</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen last year and loved it. It was inexpensive and all natural (I am allergic to chemical sunscreens). This year, I ordered two bottles (because I thought I already knew that I loved it) and was surprised to discover that it balls up and flakes off while you are applying it. Little flakes and balls of sunscreen were all over the place - the floor, my bathing suit, and my skin. According to their website, this is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; and occurs because of dry skin. Nice job blaming the consumer for a flaw in their product. Apparently, my skin is not too dry for the bottle I bought last year because I have some left and can easily apply that without any flaking. I am quite disappointed that I must choose between getting a natural sunscreen at a low price but having to put up with flaking or purchasing a much more expensive sunscreen that goes on nice and smoothly. With my excessively dry skin (per the company - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s dry at all), I guess I&#x27;ll have to spend a few more dollars for a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mexitan 15 and 30 on crazy hot / bright days, and spent a lot of time out in the sun. It works great, stays on for a minimum of 3 hours (which was as long as I spent outside). You do need to make sure and rub it in to disappear, but I think that&#x27;s actually a plus - you know when it is in good for maximum protection. Smells good too (not like chemicals). LOVE IT..</li>
            <li> Environmentally correct and non-carcinogenic, BUT you just can&#x27;t put this stuff on without looking like a ghost.  I started using it early last summer and immediately developed &#x27;tiger stripes&#x27; in all the wrinkled places such as inside the elbows, as the stuff dilutes with sweat.  I never did completely eliminate the stripes before winter.  Plus, the stuff dried out my skin to the point of feeling prickling in some places.  This summer, I tried three other sunscreens, all well rated by the Environmental Working Group, not all perfect, but way easier to use.  I am rating them all better.</li>
            <li> OK, the stuff is called &#x27;Mexitan&#x27;, and you have to admit that&#x27;s pretty cheesy.  The &#x27;all natural&#x27; and &#x27;biodegradable&#x27; thing caught me, though, so I ordered it.  I thought it was going to be one of those hippy products that sound wonderful but don&#x27;t work.      I was surprised.  This stuff is *excellent*.  Mexitan (I still can&#x27;t get over the name...) goes on smoothly and stays on even after swimming.  It&#x27;s thicker than some other products, but I like that.  A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve used it on the kids, and they like it too.  It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything.  There&#x27;s no strong perfume to knock you out.  Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s invisible, but you have to rub it in really well.  If you use too much you will end up with that white-clown-makeup look.    I will definitively buy this again.  We frequent the beach often, and spend a lot of time in the sun.  This year I have the best no-burn suntan I&#x27;ve had in my adult life.</li>
            <li> This stuff works for protection.  But I only used it once or twice because I just looked ridiculous with white stuff all over my body and face.  My wife felt the exact same way.  It spreads over the skin very easily and my skin doesn&#x27;t spread sunscreen very well.  But it doesn&#x27;t dissappear.  The white flakes and specks were all over.  I just wouldn&#x27;t buy this again for that reason alone.  I love that it has a very safe rating though.  I will use the rest of this bottle on my legs and when I&#x27;m alone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those sunblocks that are not easy to apply, it leaves a thin white residue on your skin. I purchased it for a trip to Mexico and barely used it. There are other brands of sunscreen free of toxic ingredients that I like better. Kiss My Face is one of them.</li>
            <li> I bought the spf 15 and the spf 30 for a trip to Hawaii.  At first, I used the spf 30 and it worked fine.  I applied the sunscreen every morning and I didn&#x27;t burn once.  After the first couple of days, I noticed I wasn&#x27;t burning, or getting any darker.  So, I switched to the spf 15, and I managed to get a light tan after two weeks of being on the islands.  It didn&#x27;t seem much different from regular sunscreen, and application wasn&#x27;t very tricky at all.  Coming from fog country, I&#x27;m pretty white, and was concerned I would burn and have to make a second application every day.  But, I didn&#x27;t burn nor needed a second application.  It worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not familiar with biodegradable sunscreens, but I would expect for it to behave like non-biodegradable sunscreen.  To better clarify, I cannot rate this product on the effectiveness of the &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; as it pertains to blocking the suns harmful rays as I didn&#x27;t keep it on long enough.  The product was &amp;#34;lumpy&amp;#34;, meaning it felt like I was applying cottage cheese to my skin &amp; would not effectively absorb into the skin - hence the &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; comment as it felt I was applying SPF 300. I washed it off &amp; applied standard sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a bad batch -- who knows.  I&#x27;ll have to try another &amp;#34;All Natural Biodegradable Sunscreen&amp;#34; &amp; see if there are similar characteristics.</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended when researched on the web. When it&#x27;s applied to your skin, it all balls up.  I,m not sure if it&#x27;s just a bad bottle or the product. It&#x27; not worth the money to find out.</li>
            <li> Our daughter is blond, and she&#x27;s got very white skin.  Her skin is super sensitive to sun, and bubble bath.  And she&#x27;s got eczema which seems to get worse after being outside in the sun.  We bought this sunscreen specifically for her because of her sensitive skin.  It WORKS!!!  It keeps her from getting burned, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin any more than it already is!  For the rest of the family, we can get away with using any kind of sunscreen like Coppertone, but for my youngest daughter, I don&#x27;t use anything else.  This goes on very easily, but it does stay white on the skin because of the zinc.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that rubs into the skin to be invisible, this doesn&#x27;t do that.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought the 30 and 15. I didn&#x27;t like the way the 30 went on, but the 15, I like.&lt;br /&gt;I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin, as I am very sensitive.  This works great on my skin and from keeping me get burned. I don&#x27;t like that its white and sometimes you can see it run down my arms or legs, but overall.. I would and will buy this again.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, this isn&#x27;t the easiest product to apply.  Don&#x27;t even try to apply it if you&#x27;re slightly damp.  Beyond that, I did not burn and I wasn&#x27;t turned away from the beach when they inquired about sun block.</li>
            <li> I bought these to snorkel in areas of the Yucatan where they are trying to protect the fish and the reef. However, with a better understanding of how terribly harmful standard sunscreen chemicals can be to aquatic life, from now on I&#x27;ll be using this or some other higher-priced biodegradable product ANYWHERE I swim (rivers, streams, lakes or ocean... probably not in a swimming pool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemed to protect us from burning as well as any other sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. We were really careful about re-applying, being 1st time users &amp; not sure how easily it washes off compared to standard sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest drawback is difficulty of application. The 15 (far more than the 30) forms cottage cheesy globules as you apply it. More of a problem for hairy areas like the chest or legs for us men, but was still an issue even when applying to smooth skin (ladies). I was fine with just letting it dry and then brushing off the chunks lightly with a dry towel, but I was applying in a bathroom, with a mirror. This process became much more of a chore or almost impossible when out on the beach or in the boat. In addition, the stuff you have to brush off is technically being lost/wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 2nd drawback is aesthetic: especially if you&#x27;re trying NOT to rub too much (see &#x27;chunks&#x27; above), it&#x27;s difficult NOT to look obviously whitened by this sunscreen (I&#x27;m assuming this is due to the zinc-oxide). If I&#x27;m swimming and having fun in the sun, this doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but the teenager or the more self-conscious adult might refuse to use it for this reason. If I were dressing up for an outdoor wedding on a sunny day, I&#x27;d definitely use a standard sunscreen that rubs in completely and unnoticeably for my face &amp; neck. But for the beach or the river? A bit of white stuff won&#x27;t kill you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: good product, and well worth the relatively minor drawbacks, given the importance of keeping the plant life (i.e.. fish food) from dying off and keeping the aquatic environment healthy. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen for a snorkeling trip in mexico.  The morning of the trip, I attempted to apply this sunscreen.  I had read all the previous reviews and understand that this sunscreen goes on differently than my normal sunscreen.  I just found it too difficult to apply (even when following directions I found online for this type of sunscreen).  I must have applied too much because it turned into little balls and peeled off.  I took a shower and put on my normal sunscreen instead.  I understand this is just the nature of this type of sunscreen.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try it again this summer around the pool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger size and a better smell than most natural sunscreens--I have not used it in the sun yet though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible - sits on the surface of your skin and rubs right off.  Got an uneven burn in cloudy conditions!  Threw it out - better off with nothing.</li>
            <li> Nice idea but  it kind of flakes off once you put it on which I am not sure if it is suppose to do. We needed it to get into an eco park but I don&#x27;t believe we would use it if we didn&#x27;t have to</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday at the pool.  When I applied it there was a lot of clumping and pieces building up.  I read the reviews that stated if that happens you are rubbing it in too much and I was very mindful of that, yet I could not seem to feel like I was getting it all over without that happening.  I will not buy this again.  I did buy Blue Lizard for my face and did not seem to have a problem with that lotion.  I will probably give that a try all over</li>
            <li> This sunscreen seems to work okay. I used it on my 1 and 4 year olds for the pool. It rubbed in, but it also left white specks of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;--don&#x27;t know what--all over their skin. It looked weird, and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use it for myself. It is too bad, because I like the good price for an all natural, non-nano sunscreen.</li>
            <li> get your sun block in Mexico.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe there aren&#x27;t more people complaining about this sunscreen.  No matter how I applied it, it would always leave tons of white flakes.  I tried a lighter touch, a heavier one, anything, and nothing helped.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a sunscreen w/good ingredients like this one, but I can&#x27;t get past the mess it makes.  I wear sunscreen daily and can&#x27;t walk around like that.  If i&#x27;m going swimming, then fine, it seems to be okay once I take a dip, but again, just walking around w/this stuff on is not a good look.  I wish I could say better things about this, I really wanted to love it.  Side notes, the smell is minimal and not unpleasant at all.  I got a tiny bit red on my chest when I was out by the pool for a couple hours w/this on (could have been my own fault for not reapplying).  But it did not irritate my skin in any way.  Really, except for the white flakes, this would be a great option.</li>
