            <li>beautiful soft floral scent that is not overpowering.</li>

            <li>scent too light, goes away immediately</li>
            <li>It is quite light.</li>

            <li>I bought the mini size at a store first and used it for a few months to make sure I wanted to commit to the larger bottle.</li>

            <li>A little strong, but I like it.</li>
            <li>There is nothing sweet or sickly about this fragrance, it is a white floral with a touch of citrus and some clean aquatic notes.</li>

            <li> My only gripe is that it does not last very long on the skin.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical that is was so much cheaper, but the one I received was still sealed in the cellophane in a perfectly new box!</li>
            <li> One squeeze goes a long way and the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I will probably wear it all year long.</li>

            <li> The only drawback Ive found is the longevity which is poor, a couple of hours</li>
            <li> Not sure about the quality for the money.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant when I bought this because I saw a few reviews had said it was fake.</li>
            <li> One complaint...</li>
            <li> If youre looking for a fresh-from-the-shower floral, something girly yet tough, then Id recommend this.</li>
            <li> Plus my husband can&#x27;t keep his hands of me whenever I have this on, and he&#x27;s one tough man to please!</li>
            <li> If its a fake, I cant tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed  with any of their prducts</li>

            <li> Great deal . Beautiful item.  As usual your delivery is the best. Thank you</li>
            <li> Fast delivery ... Very happy</li>
            <li> I actually got this for my mother. I love the smell but there&#x27;s no way I would get it for my girl and have her smell like mom,,lol</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant when I bought this because I saw a few reviews had said it was fake. I had already bought this perfume for more money at a department store and absolutely adore the smell. When I saw Amazon had it for a cheaper price, I thought it was too good to be true but I took the risk and I&#x27;m glad I did! This is the real deal ladies!</li>
            <li> Perfect Gift!, Wrapped in original package!</li>
            <li> My husband gave me this for my birthday. It was a wonderful gift.</li>
            <li> Love this light and fresh perfume.</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s not the lasting power and what I get in a store. I spray it on and 30 minutes later it&#x27;s gone. I did a test and went to a store and sprayed it on and I still smelled it hours later. It was the exact same strength . Makes we wonder if this is a fraud or watered down.</li>
            <li> A little strong, but I like it.</li>
            <li> excellent smelling perfume</li>
            <li> It meet my expectations smell delicious</li>
            <li> I received the product fast and was exactly as described</li>
            <li> I adore this fragrance. It is fresh, crisp and very feminine. There is nothing sweet or sickly about this fragrance, it is a white floral with a touch of citrus and some clean aquatic notes.

The only drawback Ive found is the longevity which is poor, a couple of hours and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Really lovely fragrance. My only gripe is that it does not last very long on the skin. You will have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> scent too light, goes away immediately</li>
            <li> Oh my GOD  this is such a beautiful bottle and smells wonderful  I love dolce gabbana  they have beautiful bottles and smells wonderful.  I have never been disappointed  with any of their prducts</li>
            <li> Great buy wife is happy</li>
            <li> Fast delivery I love it</li>
            <li> Great perfume and a great price!</li>

            <li> The packaging was good, the perfume is delightful, and it came when it was supposed to.  I love this perfume!  Great for price!</li>
            <li> The service was good but the fragrance is not. No staying power for me and the scent is nothing special....some sort of Hugo boss woman and some freshness....nothing to pay so much money for, that&#x27;s for sure!!!</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful scent that has lovely undertones. Not sure about the quality for the money.  Perfume arrived in sealed box, perfect condition. One complaint...this fragrance does not last at all, no staying power! I will have to compare with a fragrance from an actual store to see if there is a difference.</li>
            <li> I loooove this perfume! It is quite light. Great to wear day to day even to the office as it is not over powering. I bought the mini size at a store first and used it for a few months to make sure I wanted to commit to the larger bottle. Was skeptical that is was so much cheaper, but the one I received was still sealed in the cellophane in a perfectly new box!</li>
            <li> beautiful soft floral scent that is not overpowering. delicious</li>
