            <li>Very good hair product.  </li>
            <li>Great product by a great brand.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>but my hair always looks great when I use this.  </li>
            <li>Great for putting volume in your hair</li>
            <li>I love Kerastase Volumactive shampoo-have been using it for years and is the best shampoo I have found my hair which is baby fine-really gives it a boost.</li>
            <li>Good but dries out my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Smells quite nice as well</li>
            <li>The Kerastase shampoo arrived in a very timely manner and was in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>I have not used the coressponding conditioner yet, but this shampoo puts body into my very fine lifeless hair.</li>
            <li>but it is very light as I would prefer a smell that sticks with you</li>
            <li>Men&#x27;s Science also gives a sense of volume but leaves my hair feeling and looking cleaner and with a better texture.</li>
            <li>I like this product much better than their newer shampoos.</li>
            <li>I love Kerastase</li>
            <li>The smell is just OK</li>
            <li>This product makes my scalp even more oily, and the ends aren&#x27;t shiny anymore.</li>
            <li>I now have more body and more life in my hair.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this I really do love it.</li>
            <li>I will also try more products in this line.</li>
            <li>and I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>On top on that, I have well water and have tried dozens of products that have not made any difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I just love this product being introduced to it by a salon in Scottsdale Arizona.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly as advertised online, and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to get my hair squeaky clean, and I didn&#x27;t notice it made a difference with creating more volume.</li>
            <li>I have had good luck with the other Kerastase products and was expecting this to be as good.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely order from this seller again as the order was shipped promptly and was very tidy.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Try it, its worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li>so you really have to be committed to doing something better for your hair.  </li>
            <li>After the first wash, I had more volume and less fly away hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that tends to get weighed down very easily</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is the best hands down especially combined with the mousse to add volume.</li>
            <li>Easily style able and maintains the hold with minimal</li>
            <li>Great to use daily, does not weigh fine hair down.</li>
            <li>This brand consistently produces quality product.  </li>
            <li>First time trying volume by keratase.</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged and thin, and the shampoo is gentle, pleasant in use, and makes my hair look and feel much better.</li>
            <li>Great smelling shampoo works well for my sensitive skin and fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li>It has really repaired my damaged hair and you will notice a difference on the first use.</li>
            <li>This seems to dry my hair more and that seems to be where the &#x27;body&#x27; is coming from.  </li>
            <li>It is unnecessary to use a large amount so the price shouldn&#x27;t be a deterrent to look smell and feel great about yourself.</li>
            <li>much)---</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shampoo,  fairly expensive but for my head of fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>Gives great volume and texture, and takes very little product with each use so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Gradually massage it through out and any excess suds palm those precious suds and apply to less soapy areas.</li>
            <li>Price was high.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about what shampoo I use since most make my scalp itch and leave my hair looking dull (I have very soft hair and longish).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it for the past 5 years and have not found a better shampoo for my hair&#x27;s texture.  </li>
            <li>This gets my very short, straight hair clean, but does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>However, it takes only a small drop to turn your hair into manageable and healthy locks.  </li>
            <li>On several high recommendations I bought and have been using the Kerastase shampoo for over a month.  </li>
            <li>It was highly recommended on several websites and it lives up to  these recommendations.</li>
            <li>A very small amount of this shampoo really cleans my hair leaving it with more body than any other product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>A very little bit leaves my hair thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>It rinses out clean and seems to remove all of the junk that used to remain from my hard water as well.</li>
            <li>The price may be high for the initial outlay but it lasts for a long time if you are judicious with the amount used (you don&#x27;t need</li>

            <li> Went from thin to full in one use, if only I could get my ass to do the opposite...</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair feel thicker than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> Men&#x27;s Science works much better and is slightly less money but still expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair and did research before purchases this product.</li>
            <li> I have oily roots and dry ends.</li>
            <li> I have  been using this product for over 6 years now and tested a number of different shampoos from cheap to very expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend for dry hair, but wouldn&#x27;t use daily, as it&#x27;d make hair limp.</li>
            <li> Sooo, I thoroughly wet my hair and apply about the size of a nickel in the palm of my hand and spread it through both palms and inside of the fingers.</li>
            <li> I noticed a definite difference in the thickness of my hair within a few days.  </li>
            <li> The consistency seems too liquidy and aside from the Kerastase label I would have assumed it was cheap shampoo :/ Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I generally purchase this shampoo locally but their prices have gotten to be ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> 4 stars vs. 5 due to price.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day when I shampoo.</li>
            <li> I also use the Kerastase Volumactive Conditioner and it does not weight my hair down.</li>
            <li> My medication makes my hair a little on the &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; side.  </li>
            <li> so the actual costs are really not that expensive.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but can definitely see the texture of hair has improved since using this product.</li>
            <li> To use the least amount evenly apply a sparing amount around the outer perimeter of your hair.</li>
            <li> (I hate all of the environmental odors my long hair picks up).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately Kerastase cut it out of their line, and you can&#x27;t get it from them anymore.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive shampoo</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>

Men&#x27;s Science also gives a sense of volume but leaves my hair feeling and looking cleaner and with a better texture.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about what shampoo I use since most make my scalp itch and leave my hair looking dull (I have very soft hair and longish).&lt;br /&gt;This is the only shampoo that gives me some volume and leaves my hair untangled. Smells quite nice as well and you do not need to use a lot of it. I have  been using this product for over 6 years now and tested a number of different shampoos from cheap to very expensive. This is the best hands down especially combined with the mousse to add volume.</li>
            <li> Good but dries out my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Kerastase cut it out of their line, and you can&#x27;t get it from them anymore. I like this product much better than their newer shampoos. I hate when this happens.</li>
            <li> Gives a volume and shine. My hair is very damaged and thin, and the shampoo is gentle, pleasant in use, and makes my hair look and feel much better.</li>

            <li> This is an expensive shampoo so you really have to be committed to doing something better for your hair.  However, it takes only a small drop to turn your hair into manageable and healthy locks.  My friend recommended this and I was hesitant because of the price.  However, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I would definitely order from this seller again as the order was shipped promptly and was very tidy.  I am not impressed with the product.  I love Kerastase but this shampoo accompanied with my volumizing products did not give me the vavoom I was expecting.  The smell is just OK but it is very light as I would prefer a smell that sticks with you (I hate all of the environmental odors my long hair picks up).  The consistency seems too liquidy and aside from the Kerastase label I would have assumed it was cheap shampoo :/ Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I have oily roots and dry ends. This product makes my scalp even more oily, and the ends aren&#x27;t shiny anymore. I&#x27;m going back to Fekkai....</li>
            <li> Great smelling shampoo works well for my sensitive skin and fine and thin hair. It is unnecessary to use a large amount so the price shouldn&#x27;t be a deterrent to look smell and feel great about yourself. I use this along with the conditioner and mousse. Easily style able and maintains the hold with minimal hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention the instructions are not in English. Sooo, I thoroughly wet my hair and apply about the size of a nickel in the palm of my hand and spread it through both palms and inside of the fingers. To use the least amount evenly apply a sparing amount around the outer perimeter of your hair. Above your forehead, above your ears and above the nape of your neck. Gradually massage it through out and any excess suds palm those precious suds and apply to less soapy areas. After massage your scalp and twisting through any length of hair thoroughly rinse and apply the matching Kerastase conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great for putting volume in your hair</li>
            <li> Expensive but can definitely see the texture of hair has improved since using this product. Hair looms fuller and healthier.will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I alternate this with another shampoo.  This gets my very short, straight hair clean, but does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo hair care product I have ever used on my hair and I have tried them all. A very little bit leaves my hair thoroughly clean. The best part is no residue. It rinses out clean and seems to remove all of the junk that used to remain from my hard water as well. I now have more body and more life in my hair. I will continue to use this I really do love it. I will also try more products in this line.</li>
            <li> I generally purchase this shampoo locally but their prices have gotten to be ridiculous!  This brand consistently produces quality product.  The price may be high for the initial outlay but it lasts for a long time if you are judicious with the amount used (you don&#x27;t need much)--- so the actual costs are really not that expensive.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Price was high. First time trying volume by keratase. A bit drying if used too often.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day when I shampoo. It has really repaired my damaged hair and you will notice a difference on the first use. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair feel thicker than it has in a long time. It was highly recommended on several websites and it lives up to  these recommendations.</li>
            <li> The Kerastase shampoo arrived in a very timely manner and was in perfect condition.  It was exactly as advertised online, and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and I love this shampoo.  It lathers well so I don&#x27;t feel the need to use a ton.  I noticed a definite difference in the thickness of my hair within a few days.  Try it, its worth the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same product you buy in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for dry hair, but wouldn&#x27;t use daily, as it&#x27;d make hair limp.</li>
            <li> Very good hair product.  It provides volume and texture to each hair shaft.  I have used it for the past 5 years and have not found a better shampoo for my hair&#x27;s texture.  My hair stylist recommends it too.</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair.  On top on that, I have well water and have tried dozens of products that have not made any difference in my hair.  This shampoo is fantastic!  After the first wash, I had more volume and less fly away hair.  I would definitely give this shampoo a try!</li>
            <li> My medication makes my hair a little on the &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; side.  This shampoo has helped to not show this is not the case to everyone else!</li>
            <li> Love this! Great to use daily, does not weigh fine hair down. Gives great volume and texture, and takes very little product with each use so it lasts a long time. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I just love this product being introduced to it by a salon in Scottsdale Arizona.  I have not used the coressponding conditioner yet, but this shampoo puts body into my very fine lifeless hair.</li>
