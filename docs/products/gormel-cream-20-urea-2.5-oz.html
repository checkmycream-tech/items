    <ol>
            <li>I have today ordered 3 more!!!!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Best remedy I have tried,</li>
            <li>The best part is it&#x27;s effectiveness, but, it is not greasy and absorbs into your skin.  </li>
            <li>A great buy!</li>
            <li>With all the creams out there this is the best, none of the others worked for me.</li>
            <li>Two uses and my feet felt perfect.</li>
            <li>I fully intend on stocking up on this stuff, that&#x27;s how wonderful it is.</li>
            <li>I promise you this is the best cream I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>best thing I have ever used on my feet!</li>
            <li>It is excellent.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll continue to look for the perfect callus &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Urea is a constituent of urine, but if you get over that part, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>The price is great.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>GREAT SERVICE.</li>
            <li>Based on all the great reviews I purchased this for my calloused feet.</li>
            <li>works great for them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>so we could share nice feet for the summer season!  </li>
            <li>My daughter has used it on just one side of her neck for 3 days and it is significantly better than the untreated side of her neck, and is the best her neck has looked in some months.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products but this is the best.</li>
            <li>The Gormel creme works great, I love the product!</li>
            <li>The cream is good.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is good</li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>Works as good as you want it to I like it every where I even use it on my lips</li>
            <li>This is good for applying to feet after soaking, but it does nothing for reoccuring calloused skin on feet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good on elbows.</li>
            <li>Like tougher in a good manly way.</li>
            <li>Which is good if your a man.</li>
            <li>so many great creams and lotions out in the market</li>
            <li>I use the creme on my heels and it does a great job of softening them and giving them a better appearance.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your hands after!</li>
            <li>I used the cream for 3 days, and found it to be an amazing product for dryness.</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I really liked my Carmol 20.</li>
            <li>I put socks on my feet, but don&#x27;t put gloves on my hands - it&#x27;s worked nicely in both cases.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who has used Carmel and liked it.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this wonderful product!!</li>
            <li>This cream helps some with the arms, but what really, really impressed me is how great this stuff is on dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>I paid more at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Using for two weeks and heels almost completely smooth!</li>
            <li>This product, Gormel Creme, is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I decided to order this cream and give it one more shot.  </li>
            <li>I have to tell you that this is the best thing ever, it actually works, in two days</li>
            <li>I love it and plan to order more.</li>
            <li>I ordered this cream without really expecting great results.</li>
            <li>One use and my feet felt so much better.</li>
            <li>I love the Gormel Creme.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but I thought my doctor charged too much for it</li>
            <li>AND I HAD USED ANOTHER BRAND AND WAS PLEASED WITH BOTH JARS OF CREME.  </li>
            <li>even better, although i can&#x27;t be sure what&#x27;s happened, it seems to have cleared up a decades-old fungus toenail.</li>
            <li>After getting some type of poison or infection to my hands, and trying every over the counter solution (from oatmeal soap &amp; bath, poison ivy/oak ointments, benadryl, epsom salts, baking soda pastes, and more....) I bolted to the mailbox on delivery day and used this creme immediately.  </li>
            <li>My feet are getting a lot better too.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look at how many ounces were in the container, and it was way overpriced for the amount</li>
            <li>I will look for a better price.</li>
            <li>If it does work great, I will be back for more and write a better review!</li>
            <li>THIS WAS SOFT AND THE SERVICE IN THE DELIVERY WAS GREAT FOR ME</li>
            <li>The product was delivered very quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and arrived promptly and well packaged</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent healing cream, superior to the many really expensive \\&quot;designer\\&quot; creams that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Best foot lotion for super dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>I am grateful for this cream and perplexed with doctors lack of knowledge about it  .</li>
            <li>When visiting our exchange student in Europe, her doctor father and nurse mother, were horrified to find that cortizone creams were used as a primary treatment for eczema.  </li>
            <li>It did smooth out the feet and even gives the skin a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I have put this cream on 3 different times and experienced stomach aches that ranged from mild to gut wrenching.</li>
            <li>As usual - it was the greatest!</li>
            <li>Maybe if I put a layer of the cream on first and then waited a while and then put on a layer of vaseline, the combination would work better than each product alone.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry skin and splits on fingers, etrc.  </li>
            <li>Great product for those dry winter feet!</li>
            <li>Great for rough skin on heels, balls of feet and elbows.  </li>
            <li>I have bought over the counter creams with urea in them and they were ok; however the 20% urea really makes the difference.</li>
            <li>This product is just as good and maybe a little better.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do any better than any normal cream you would buy over the counter.</li>
            <li>Rub it in until it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li>I attribute the success to this cream.</li>
            <li>It looks kind of gross</li>
            <li>so I was excited to get it so much cheaper through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I use Gormel Cream right when my hands start to peel they will stop within a day.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>this is so great, no more chapped, sandpaper, cracked and bleeding hands for me.</li>
            <li>Great product, I applied it daily and the difference is definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Works very well!  </li>
            <li>Fantastick results much quicker than anything I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li>After 2 years of many different doctor&#x27;s and many different prescriptions, I, myself, found this cream on the internet and it is the miracle cream.  </li>
            <li>I first saw it in my Podiatrists office and she raved about it.  </li>
            <li>and sure enough, right there in the product title in large letters was Size: 2.5 oz.  </li>
            <li>I works much better than regular hand cream or foot cream</li>
            <li>will not make you hands feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product was originally recommended by my podiatrist and has kept my feet soft, healed cracks and helped prevent fungus.</li>
            <li>(hey, there&#x27;s only so much you can expect, even from a miracle), but they do feel a lot better.</li>
            <li>The best cream for dry, cracked skin, small jar.</li>
            <li>, I have gotten positive results with this cream like nothing I have tried before.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought they are just copying name from Carmol, but I when I started using I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>I bought this jar of cream to see if it works better than what I had been using for my feet and hands, which are particularly dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li>, so it was easy to open and begin to use.</li>
            <li>and I am surprised it is working well and no unpleasant side effects.</li>
            <li>I use this 2-3 times a day and it really helps.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and delivery prompt.  </li>
            <li>A very soothing non greasy formula</li>
            <li>but, this cream wo0rks very well.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>My callouses seem to be smooth but not necessarily softened.  </li>
            <li>at any rate that condition has disappeared -- i believe thanks to this low-cost, easy-application remedy.</li>
            <li>After much searching online, I figured out that I must have suffered gastritis.</li>
            <li>I have run the gambit with OTC and prescription medications and nothing has really worked very well, until I found Gormel Cream here on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, the palms of my hands almost look normal.  </li>
            <li>My face has also never broken out because the cream is so gentle.</li>
            <li>It has really help with my exzema.  </li>
            <li>Tried everything to no avail, but this stuff really worked.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and smooth and young looking.</li>
            <li>My skin problem is do to an allergy of a particular chemical in certain shoes.  </li>
            <li>Creams didn&#x27;t help, Microplanes didn&#x27;t help enough (they DO make special ones for feet)...</li>
            <li>Again, so far it seems to be working when the combo of the first two did</li>
            <li>I wish it came in a larger jar as I go through it so quickly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone with chapped hands.  </li>
            <li>so it looks normal.  </li>
            <li>I have not found a better lotion or creme for healing dried, cracked skin.</li>
            <li>I live at 9100 ft in Colorado.</li>
            <li>Immediately after months of embarrassing rashes on my face this completely got rid of my patch!</li>
            <li>baby skin soft!</li>
            <li>This cream has also done wonders for my very dry winter hands - that alone would have been worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works very well for dry, scaly feet, wish it came in a bigger container, seems like I constantly need to come back and look for more.</li>
            <li>My hands are so soft and not greasy nor slimmy.  </li>
            <li>After one use they are so soft.</li>
            <li>In the morning you will be surprised how well</li>
            <li>Feet are now soft.</li>
            <li>So far this product seems to be working.</li>
            <li>It made my hands feel drier directly after use,</li>
            <li>This 20% Urea Cream works fine for me which I use on my face sometimes daily, sometimes every other day.</li>
            <li>It too standard delivery of 3 days to receive the delivery (which was excellent except when you are in a desperate situation!).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it as a regular lotion, but I have normal looking feet again.</li>
            <li>Since I stopped the urea cream my stomach is back to normal.</li>
            <li>Good cream, a little thick but works well.</li>
            <li>In the long run this creme is good for your hands but oddly enough it leaves them feeling a bit rough at furst, as if the creme dried in your hands and wasnt unctuous before you are done applying it.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I am hoping my new Gormel Creme works as well as my last product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I live in Colorado and it is so dry here that you really need to use moisturizer, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>It really helps heal dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from dry skin on my hands every winter and this is the one creme that really works.</li>
            <li>the first application I saw results and after the 2nd, all dry, flaking skin and allergy rashes were gone.  </li>
            <li>Truly - after only a few applications, my heels were super soft and stayed that way for months.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used this long enough on my feet to know what it is capable of doing.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that fixed my cracked heels.  </li>
            <li>Even the most dried skin is healed in a few days.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I attribute the success to this cream.</li>
            <li> It looks kind of gross</li>
            <li> so I was excited to get it so much cheaper through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I use Gormel Cream right when my hands start to peel they will stop within a day.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> this is so great, no more chapped, sandpaper, cracked and bleeding hands for me.</li>
            <li> Great product, I applied it daily and the difference is definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Works very well!  </li>
            <li> Fantastick results much quicker than anything I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li> After 2 years of many different doctor&#x27;s and many different prescriptions, I, myself, found this cream on the internet and it is the miracle cream.  </li>
            <li> I first saw it in my Podiatrists office and she raved about it.  </li>
            <li> and sure enough, right there in the product title in large letters was Size: 2.5 oz.  </li>
            <li> I works much better than regular hand cream or foot cream</li>
            <li> will not make you hands feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product was originally recommended by my podiatrist and has kept my feet soft, healed cracks and helped prevent fungus.</li>
            <li> (hey, there&#x27;s only so much you can expect, even from a miracle), but they do feel a lot better.</li>
            <li> The best cream for dry, cracked skin, small jar.</li>
            <li> , I have gotten positive results with this cream like nothing I have tried before.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought they are just copying name from Carmol, but I when I started using I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> I bought this jar of cream to see if it works better than what I had been using for my feet and hands, which are particularly dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> , so it was easy to open and begin to use.</li>
            <li> and I am surprised it is working well and no unpleasant side effects.</li>
            <li> I use this 2-3 times a day and it really helps.  </li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and delivery prompt.  </li>
            <li> A very soothing non greasy formula</li>
            <li> but, this cream wo0rks very well.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> My callouses seem to be smooth but not necessarily softened.  </li>
            <li> at any rate that condition has disappeared -- i believe thanks to this low-cost, easy-application remedy.</li>
            <li> After much searching online, I figured out that I must have suffered gastritis.</li>
            <li> I have run the gambit with OTC and prescription medications and nothing has really worked very well, until I found Gormel Cream here on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, the palms of my hands almost look normal.  </li>
            <li> My face has also never broken out because the cream is so gentle.</li>
            <li> It has really help with my exzema.  </li>
            <li> Tried everything to no avail, but this stuff really worked.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and smooth and young looking.</li>
            <li> My skin problem is do to an allergy of a particular chemical in certain shoes.  </li>
            <li> Creams didn&#x27;t help, Microplanes didn&#x27;t help enough (they DO make special ones for feet)...</li>
            <li> Again, so far it seems to be working when the combo of the first two did</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a larger jar as I go through it so quickly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone with chapped hands.  </li>
            <li> so it looks normal.  </li>
            <li> I have not found a better lotion or creme for healing dried, cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I live at 9100 ft in Colorado.</li>
            <li> Immediately after months of embarrassing rashes on my face this completely got rid of my patch!</li>
            <li> baby skin soft!</li>
            <li> This cream has also done wonders for my very dry winter hands - that alone would have been worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works very well for dry, scaly feet, wish it came in a bigger container, seems like I constantly need to come back and look for more.</li>
            <li> My hands are so soft and not greasy nor slimmy.  </li>
            <li> After one use they are so soft.</li>
            <li> In the morning you will be surprised how well</li>
            <li> Feet are now soft.</li>
            <li> So far this product seems to be working.</li>
            <li> It made my hands feel drier directly after use,</li>
            <li> This 20% Urea Cream works fine for me which I use on my face sometimes daily, sometimes every other day.</li>
            <li> It too standard delivery of 3 days to receive the delivery (which was excellent except when you are in a desperate situation!).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it as a regular lotion, but I have normal looking feet again.</li>
            <li> Since I stopped the urea cream my stomach is back to normal.</li>
            <li> Good cream, a little thick but works well.</li>
            <li> In the long run this creme is good for your hands but oddly enough it leaves them feeling a bit rough at furst, as if the creme dried in your hands and wasnt unctuous before you are done applying it.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I am hoping my new Gormel Creme works as well as my last product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I live in Colorado and it is so dry here that you really need to use moisturizer, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> It really helps heal dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry skin on my hands every winter and this is the one creme that really works.</li>
            <li> the first application I saw results and after the 2nd, all dry, flaking skin and allergy rashes were gone.  </li>
            <li> Truly - after only a few applications, my heels were super soft and stayed that way for months.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used this long enough on my feet to know what it is capable of doing.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that fixed my cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> Even the most dried skin is healed in a few days.</li>
            <li> Would definitely purchase again or recommend to anyone with dry, crack or calloused areas.</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet as well and it only takes me one use for dry patches and peeling skin to disappear.</li>
            <li> My husband is diabetic with very dry skin on his feet and this is the only cream that has come close to softening his skin</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my entire body - but for feet (Heels) and rough hands after a shower</li>
            <li> It also last a long time because you only have to use a little.</li>
            <li> If nothing works for your dry cracked skin, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I used for dry skin and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> My heels were dry and sometimes cracked - ouch@#$%&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of dry, cracking skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin on my forearms, and was at my wit&#x27;s end, because nothing seemed to help.</li>
            <li> I have had a big nasty callous on my foot from biking and weight lifting that was causing great pain on my side step.</li>
            <li> Soothing to dry heels and calluses.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product I had been to the dermatologist three times trying every prescription for a dry flaky patch on my face that would not go away.</li>
            <li> This creme also helps get rid of the dry cuticles that form around the edges between the toe nail and skin.</li>
            <li> as well as my feet hands face, and where it seems dry.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hands, or dry, peeling and cracking feet, give it a try!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been a frustrating journey, only developed this eczema last year.</li>
            <li> I am using it on my hands for eczema and after only a few days, my hands seem to be clearing up, the new skin seems moist except for some small spots.</li>
            <li> for only $2.00 less.</li>
            <li> have previously purchased a container with twice the amount for the same price from my podiatrist!</li>
            <li> So far, my feet are still hard and dry.</li>
            <li> I have had very dry cracked heels</li>
            <li> For use on my dads very dry feet.</li>
            <li> I love it, my feet were in bad shape</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money trying everything on my feet.  </li>
            <li> During the winter I had rough spots around my finger nails.</li>
            <li> I am also using this for my foot eczema along with salicylic acid and ammonium lactate cream, the salicylic acid and ammonium lactate to break down the thick skin and this cream to moisturize the new skin.</li>
            <li> This product works well after filing down the dry skin.</li>
            <li> I thought I was stuck with my feet being a mess - dry, cracked, just ugh.</li>
            <li> You only need a very little bit two to three times a day to see a difference.</li>
            <li> There are other 20% Urea creams in prescription form...</li>
            <li> I have used other 20% urea creams to remove calluses from the feet and elbows and got overnight results.</li>
            <li> The product is a little thicker and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dry like Carmol 20 did.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble in the spring with dry, flaking skin from allergies but have never found anything that helped.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in so it isn&#x27;t greasy and a little goes a long way so even though it is not cheap, it lasts.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint but will not purchase again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll slow down and read the print and not rely on pictures on Amazon for future purchases.  </li>
            <li> I have to file it down often.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> this stuff has worked wonders on my toes, which used to become encrusted with dead skin in winter.</li>
            <li> Not sure about other skin conditions, but it does work for me!</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a product that works so well on dried cracked chapped hands.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the marketing that my first order was a jar containing 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I can&#x27;t get that anymore.</li>
            <li> a small dab does the job.</li>
            <li> I will look no more</li>
            <li> I had no more cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I am using coconut oil for the past week</li>
            <li> the cream was too small for the size of the jar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> cream is fairly expensive, but I know I have paid a lot for other medications which have a concentration of urea in them.  </li>
            <li> This is less expensive and truly feels like a miracle to us.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve given up hope about your painful dry, cracked and bleeding skin, try this.  </li>
            <li> After approximately three days, I would ALWAYS have a cracked thumb or heel.</li>
            <li> It does work well, but not great.  </li>
            <li> The doctors allow her to use cortizone on and off, for two week stretches, but it isn&#x27;t enough to prevent the terrible flaking lately.  </li>
            <li> Helped my poor skin drastically!</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter suffers terribly from eczema on her neck and chin.  </li>
            <li> I am too afraid to try anything on my calloused feet with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I use that for my feet, but the lanolin odor is unpleasant on my hands.</li>
            <li> But my bad...</li>
            <li> My hands peel really badly about once a month.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on the palm of my hand and thumb as well as as painful cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> But I soon found it painful to walk.  </li>
            <li> At the worst stages, I put it on my feet in the morning and at night with a pair of socks.    </li>
            <li> I have terrible skin all over and recommend this product to anyone!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The cream is good.  I was disappointed in the marketing that my first order was a jar containing 4 oz. and the second was 2.5 oz. for only $2.00 less.</li>
            <li> Have used the product before - bought it for friends so we could share nice feet for the summer season!  As usual - it was the greatest!</li>
            <li> This product was originally recommended by my podiatrist and has kept my feet soft, healed cracks and helped prevent fungus.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good but I really liked my Carmol 20. Not sure why I can&#x27;t get that anymore. I am hoping my new Gormel Creme works as well as my last product. So far so good. If it does work great, I will be back for more and write a better review!</li>
            <li> I have eczema on the palm of my hand and thumb as well as as painful cracked heels.  I use this 2-3 times a day and it really helps.  It doesn&#x27;t cure it, of course, but it dramatically reduces the scaling and dryness.   My skin hasn&#x27;t cracked and bleed since I started using it a month ago.  No perfume too.  The price was reasonable and delivery prompt.  If you&#x27;ve given up hope about your painful dry, cracked and bleeding skin, try this.  I use it for a face cream too.  I also reviewed another urea cream that has lanolin in it.  I use that for my feet, but the lanolin odor is unpleasant on my hands.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent healing cream, superior to the many really expensive \\&quot;designer\\&quot; creams that I&#x27;ve used.  I use it on my feet and hands, but could use it all over.  I wish it came in a larger jar as I go through it so quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been succesfully using Carmol 20 for year to control Psoriasis on elbows, knees and hands. But when it disapeared, started looking for another solution until I&#x27;ve found Gormel cream. At first I thought they are just copying name from Carmol, but I when I started using I didn&#x27;t really care. The product is a little thicker and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dry like Carmol 20 did. Not sure about other skin conditions, but it does work for me!</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream last week.  I received my shipment immediately.  I used the cream for 3 days, and found it to be an amazing product for dryness. My hands are so soft and not greasy nor slimmy.  I have today ordered 3 more!!!!  Love this product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I live at 9100 ft in Colorado. Very low humidity and we have radiant heating in our floors which doesn&#x27;t help. After approximately three days, I would ALWAYS have a cracked thumb or heel. After using Gormel nightly only, I have not had one!! Best remedy I have tried, and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> This creme was given to me by my podiatrist.  Works very well!  I paid more at the doctor&#x27;s office. If nothing works for your dry cracked skin, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have had very dry cracked heels and this is a miracle!  Fantastick results much quicker than anything I&#x27;ve tried!  Using for two weeks and heels almost completely smooth!</li>
            <li> Best foot lotion for super dry cracked feet. I&#x27;ve tried others, but always come back to this lotion!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used this long enough on my feet to know what it is capable of doing. So far, my feet are still hard and dry. Maybe with further use, the skin will change.</li>
            <li> I thought I was stuck with my feet being a mess - dry, cracked, just ugh. Creams didn&#x27;t help, Microplanes didn&#x27;t help enough (they DO make special ones for feet)... I was at a loss. Then I somehow stumbled across reviews of this Gormel Cream - it&#x27;s fabulous. My feet may never make an appearance outside of my shoes again (hey, there&#x27;s only so much you can expect, even from a miracle), but they do feel a lot better. This cream has also done wonders for my very dry winter hands - that alone would have been worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a small dab does the job. Rub it in until it&#x27;s absorbed. I put socks on my feet, but don&#x27;t put gloves on my hands - it&#x27;s worked nicely in both cases.</li>
            <li> This works very well for dry, scaly feet, wish it came in a bigger container, seems like I constantly need to come back and look for more.</li>
            <li> After 2 years of many different doctor&#x27;s and many different prescriptions, I, myself, found this cream on the internet and it is the miracle cream.  This helps itchy, cracking, peeling skin.  It&#x27;s amazing! In 2 days you will see and feel the difference!  My father-in-law also has a skin condition.  I lent him this cream and he, too loves it!  I don&#x27;t know why the medical field isn&#x27;t using this.  There are other 20% Urea creams in prescription form...they don&#x27;t compare!  This is less expensive and truly feels like a miracle to us. The best part is it&#x27;s effectiveness, but, it is not greasy and absorbs into your skin.  At the worst stages, I put it on my feet in the morning and at night with a pair of socks.    My skin problem is do to an allergy of a particular chemical in certain shoes.  I have incurred years of struggle and severe cracking of my skin.  I am grateful for this cream and perplexed with doctors lack of knowledge about it  .</li>
            <li> I have used other 20% urea creams to remove calluses from the feet and elbows and got overnight results. This cream DOES NOT deliver despite claiming it has 20% urea. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product, I applied it daily and the difference is definitely noticeable. I used for dry skin and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> The best cream for dry, cracked skin, small jar.</li>
            <li> I bought this jar of cream to see if it works better than what I had been using for my feet and hands, which are particularly dry in the winter.  It does work well, but not great.  I do use socks in bed so the cream doesn&#x27;t get on my sheets.  I don&#x27;t use gloves, but maybe I should.  Maybe if I put a layer of the cream on first and then waited a while and then put on a layer of vaseline, the combination would work better than each product alone.  Just a thought.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that fixed my cracked heels.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use it as a regular lotion, but I have normal looking feet again.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have  ordered this item.  I first saw it in my Podiatrists office and she raved about it.  My husband is diabetic with very dry skin on his feet and this is the only cream that has come close to softening his skin so it looks normal.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble in the spring with dry, flaking skin from allergies but have never found anything that helped.  Until now.  This product, Gormel Creme, is fantastic!  Aftter the first application I saw results and after the 2nd, all dry, flaking skin and allergy rashes were gone.  I&#x27;ll be ording this again!</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  It really helps heal dry skin.  I use it on psorisis</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff.  Please do not discontinue this product.  It is so hard to find a product that works so well on dried cracked chapped hands.  I will look no more this is so great, no more chapped, sandpaper, cracked and bleeding hands for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried every hand cream on the market for my cracked and chaffed hands that come in the winter months. I read an article in a women&#x27;s health magazine and they recommended this product. I was totally about to give up on my hands, put up with cracked fingers and cover with band aids.  I decided to order this cream and give it one more shot.  I have to tell you that this is the best thing ever, it actually works, in two days I had no more cracked skin. GONE. With all the creams out there this is the best, none of the others worked for me. Try it, use it twice a day and you will be amazed at how well it works. I love it and plan to order more.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my entire body - but for feet (Heels) and rough hands after a shower it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> A very soothing non greasy formula</li>
            <li> Helped my poor skin drastically! I thought there was nothing left to try for my KP, but this helps! Be sure to wash your hands after!</li>
            <li> Great for rough skin on heels, balls of feet and elbows.  Just be careful not to get it near your eyes.  Urea is a constituent of urine, but if you get over that part, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I love it, my feet were in bad shape but, this cream wo0rks very well.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money trying everything on my feet.  My heels were dry and sometimes cracked - ouch@#$%&lt;br /&gt;My doctor told me to try this and finally I found my cream.</li>
            <li> I have not found a better lotion or creme for healing dried, cracked skin. It works amazingly fast. Even the most dried skin is healed in a few days. It also last a long time because you only have to use a little. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of dry, cracking skin on my feet. It doesn&#x27;t do any better than any normal cream you would buy over the counter. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream without really expecting great results. My dermatologist had recommended that I try carmol cream, which has been discontinued. I have extremely dry skin on my forearms, and was at my wit&#x27;s end, because nothing seemed to help. This cream helps some with the arms, but what really, really impressed me is how great this stuff is on dry, cracked heels. One use and my feet felt so much better. Two uses and my feet felt perfect. I haven&#x27;t tried it for a third time yet, but I expect that within days my heels will be vastly improved. I fully intend on stocking up on this stuff, that&#x27;s how wonderful it is. If you have dry hands, or dry, peeling and cracking feet, give it a try! I promise you this is the best cream I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because as a teenager, I used to use a prescribed compound of hydrocortisone and urea.  Since I can no longer get this prescribed compound product I decided to try Gormel Creme since it has urea. It keeps my skin soft and smooth and young looking. It manages the oil issues that tended to aggravate my facial skin . The price is great. This jar lasts me about 4 months after which case I reorder.  If it stings a lot you might want to try a lesser percentage of urea, perhaps 10% urea.  This 20% Urea Cream works fine for me which I use on my face sometimes daily, sometimes every other day.</li>
            <li> best thing I have ever used on my feet! After one use they are so soft.</li>
            <li> This product works well after filing down the dry skin. A little goes along way. I use is 3 times a weed at night and wear socks after applying the cream to my feet. In the morning you will be surprised how well this hydrates feet.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has used Carmel and liked it.  This product is just as good and maybe a little better.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with chapped hands.  It is excellent.</li>
            <li> I used this faithfully for 1 month.  It simply didn&#x27;t work as I&#x27;d hoped.  I guess I&#x27;ll continue to look for the perfect callus &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Miracle cream. Used this while recovering from laser tattoo removal. I attribute the success to this cream.</li>
            <li> I love the Gormel Creme.  It&#x27;s a great product, but I thought my doctor charged too much for it so I was excited to get it so much cheaper through Amazon.  I took one look at the picture, saw it was a 4 oz. container and clicked on the stores and ordered from the store with the cheapest price.  I did not bother reading the print, because I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Imagine my surprise when I opened the package and there was this itsy-bitsy jar of cream. I went back online and sure enough, right there in the product title in large letters was Size: 2.5 oz.  Ha-ha!  Hopefully I learned a lesson that will save me a lot of $$$ in the future. I&#x27;ll slow down and read the print and not rely on pictures on Amazon for future purchases.  I cannot even come close to getting a 4 oz jar of Gormel Creme online for the price my doctor sells it to me for. The product was delivered very quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> For use on my dads very dry feet. Works great. Feet are now soft.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter suffers terribly from eczema on her neck and chin.  The doctors allow her to use cortizone on and off, for two week stretches, but it isn&#x27;t enough to prevent the terrible flaking lately.  When visiting our exchange student in Europe, her doctor father and nurse mother, were horrified to find that cortizone creams were used as a primary treatment for eczema.  They suggested I seek out a cream containing urea.  My daughter has used it on just one side of her neck for 3 days and it is significantly better than the untreated side of her neck, and is the best her neck has looked in some months.  She&#x27;s moving on to use it everywhere she has eczema now that we know it works!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this crème has some properties that would &amp;#34;eat away&amp;#34; at the callouses of my feet since I have metatarsalgia.  It did smooth out the feet and even gives the skin a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;.  But I soon found it painful to walk.  My callouses seem to be smooth but not necessarily softened.  I have to file it down often.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE WAY THIS CREME WOULD GO ON AND I HAD USED ANOTHER BRAND AND WAS PLEASED WITH BOTH JARS OF CREME.  THIS WAS SOFT AND THE SERVICE IN THE DELIVERY WAS GREAT FOR ME ARRIVED IN TIME FOR A TRIP AND WAS PACKED WITH PROTECTION.  GREAT SERVICE.</li>
            <li> I works much better than regular hand cream or foot cream</li>
            <li> this stuff has worked wonders on my toes, which used to become encrusted with dead skin in winter. even better, although i can&#x27;t be sure what&#x27;s happened, it seems to have cleared up a decades-old fungus toenail. for years my wife had howled about how hideous it was and her fears that i might spread the fungus to her if i didn&#x27;t seek medical attention -- expensive, time-consuming attention which most doctors advised against. at any rate that condition has disappeared -- i believe thanks to this low-cost, easy-application remedy.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  Truly - after only a few applications, my heels were super soft and stayed that way for months.  Would definitely purchase again or recommend to anyone with dry, crack or calloused areas.</li>
            <li> So far this product seems to be working. I am using it on my hands for eczema and after only a few days, my hands seem to be clearing up, the new skin seems moist except for some small spots. I am also using this for my foot eczema along with salicylic acid and ammonium lactate cream, the salicylic acid and ammonium lactate to break down the thick skin and this cream to moisturize the new skin. Again, so far it seems to be working when the combo of the first two did not.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a frustrating journey, only developed this eczema last year.</li>
            <li> I have had a big nasty callous on my foot from biking and weight lifting that was causing great pain on my side step. After a week of treatment 1/2 of the callous was gone and after a month it fell of. The stuff works.</li>
            <li> Based on all the great reviews I purchased this for my calloused feet. I have put this cream on 3 different times and experienced stomach aches that ranged from mild to gut wrenching. After much searching online, I figured out that I must have suffered gastritis. The urea must have irritated a stomach lining that is already susceptible. Since I stopped the urea cream my stomach is back to normal. I am too afraid to try anything on my calloused feet with chemicals. I am using coconut oil for the past week and I am surprised it is working well and no unpleasant side effects.</li>
            <li> It too standard delivery of 3 days to receive the delivery (which was excellent except when you are in a desperate situation!). After getting some type of poison or infection to my hands, and trying every over the counter solution (from oatmeal soap &amp; bath, poison ivy/oak ointments, benadryl, epsom salts, baking soda pastes, and more....) I bolted to the mailbox on delivery day and used this creme immediately.  The next day, the itching stopped and the healing process started.  Thank you for my last resort miracle cure!</li>
            <li> I have been under the care of several doctors for years with a skin condition on my hands and feet.  I have run the gambit with OTC and prescription medications and nothing has really worked very well, until I found Gormel Cream here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is fairly expensive, but I know I have paid a lot for other medications which have a concentration of urea in them.  I received the package containing two jars of Gormel Cream last week.  I put it on immediately, and have followed up a couple times a day.  I have to ssy, I have gotten positive results with this cream like nothing I have tried before.  For the first time in years, the palms of my hands almost look normal.  My feet are getting a lot better too.  Wish I had found Gormel Cream years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> Soothing to dry heels and calluses.</li>
            <li> The Gormel creme works great, I love the product! But my bad...I didn&#x27;t look at how many ounces were in the container, and it was way overpriced for the amount I got.&lt;br /&gt;I have previously purchased a container with twice the amount for the same price from my podiatrist! Guess I&#x27;ll be going back to him for Gormel!</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product I had been to the dermatologist three times trying every prescription for a dry flaky patch on my face that would not go away. I was finally told to purchase a cream with urea in the ingredients. Immediately after months of embarrassing rashes on my face this completely got rid of my patch! I swear this is miracle cream. I use it on my feet as well and it only takes me one use for dry patches and peeling skin to disappear. My face has also never broken out because the cream is so gentle. I have terrible skin all over and recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference. It made my hands feel drier directly after use,</li>
            <li> the cream was too small for the size of the jar.  My only complaint but will not purchase again.  This a needed for medical reasons for anyone who buys it.  I will look for a better price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I live in Colorado and it is so dry here that you really need to use moisturizer, especially in the winter. In the long run this creme is good for your hands but oddly enough it leaves them feeling a bit rough at furst, as if the creme dried in your hands and wasnt unctuous before you are done applying it.&lt;br /&gt;With so many great creams and lotions out in the market, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin and splits on fingers, etrc.  Easy to apply and arrived promptly and well packaged, so it was easy to open and begin to use.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry skin on my hands every winter and this is the one creme that really works. I use it at night and even a hangnail or cuticle that is rough and hurts seems to be smoother and not as sensitive in the morning. It soaks in so it isn&#x27;t greasy and a little goes a long way so even though it is not cheap, it lasts.  I have tried many products but this is the best.</li>
            <li> It has really help with my exzema.  You only need a very little bit two to three times a day to see a difference. I have bought over the counter creams with urea in them and they were ok; however the 20% urea really makes the difference.</li>
            <li> I use the creme on my heels and it does a great job of softening them and giving them a better appearance. This creme also helps get rid of the dry cuticles that form around the edges between the toe nail and skin.</li>
            <li> Great product for those dry winter feet!</li>
            <li> During the winter I had rough spots around my finger nails. Tried everything to no avail, but this stuff really worked.</li>
            <li> Works as good as you want it to I like it every where I even use it on my lips works great for them. as well as my feet hands face, and where it seems dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using DiabeticDerm foot cream with L-argenine and urea for several years.  Suddenly, it is no longer sold on any website.  This product has the urea, but not the amino acid (which increases circulation and helps to prevent diabetic neuropathy).&lt;br /&gt;  As a softening and healing cream this product works well, but the price per ounce is double what I was paying for the DiabeticDerm.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my spider veins in my legs,  (the urea is supposed to help).  The veins have lessened.</li>
            <li> This is good for applying to feet after soaking, but it does nothing for reoccuring calloused skin on feet.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.  Keeps your heals baby skin soft! I will always use this product.  It&#x27;s also good on elbows.</li>
            <li> Good cream, a little thick but works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read urea can help treat peeling hands. My hands peel really badly about once a month. It looks kind of gross so I wanted to get ride of it.&lt;br /&gt;If I use Gormel Cream right when my hands start to peel they will stop within a day.&lt;br /&gt;This will not make you hands feel soft and smooth. It almost feels like your hands are getting tougher. Like tougher in a good manly way. Which is good if your a man.</li>
