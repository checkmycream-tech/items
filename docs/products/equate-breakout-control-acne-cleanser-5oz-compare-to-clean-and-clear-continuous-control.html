            <li>but it&#x27;s a perfect solution for me.</li>
            <li>lol!</li>
            <li>This is the best breakout treatment I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I think it would be a great body acne product, no lie!</li>
            <li>I think this would be a great spot treatment or just a mask.</li>
            <li>, I rub in circular motions and then rinse with very warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After this I rinse again with very warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now after I apply this all over my face I rub it in for about 45 seconds and rinse with very warm water until it&#x27;s off.</li>
            <li>On the bright side..</li>
            <li>and I have been very satisfied with that version.</li>
            <li>my face was gonna feel better!</li>
            <li>It kind of took me awhile to figure out how this product work.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I think they did this because you don&#x27;t need a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am an adult who had battled acne and this seems to be the best wash I have used to date.</li>
            <li>I splash my face with very warm almost hot water.</li>
            <li>I did not have what most people have happen with it leaving a film.</li>
            <li>but I decided ot try it one more time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 2 hours and parts of my face are still burning all though I have managed to get most of this garbage off of it.</li>
            <li>I had to check to make sure hydrofluoric acid wasn&#x27;t one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>The instructions state that you should wash this product out; however it will coat the face more like a lotion.</li>
            <li>For some, it might be better to use this product before bed.</li>
            <li>So I reached for some apricot scrub I had and used that in top of it to try to scrape this gunk off my face.</li>
            <li>: It lessens the visibility if stretch marks and a lot more....</li>
            <li>and it contains 10% benzoyl peroxide, which is 2-4x stronger than most acne washes.</li>
            <li>Now, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was just me, or if it was the product specifically.</li>
            <li>From what I have read, it seems this is the medication remaining on your skin to work its magic.</li>
            <li>I follow the instructions and don&#x27;t leave it on for more than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>It works better</li>
            <li>my skin has more acne than ever before</li>
            <li>It even works better than proactive for us.</li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a pleasant scent and a very creamy texture, which I like :)</li>
            <li>I loved this, I thought it was cheaper than buying a tube, and it really has kept my face clearer.</li>
            <li>As soon as I applied it to my face, it gave me a fresh, kind of minty sensation.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years and this one seems to be worth well more than its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will come off quite easily.</li>
            <li>The Clean and Clear version is great though.</li>
            <li>I was fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;First I wash my face 2x with neutrogena&#x27;s oil free grapefruit face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Put a junk load of this on your chest or back, and leave it on for 1 minute after rubbing it in for a minute lol.</li>
            <li>You might be tempted to pick it up at Wal-Mart just because it&#x27;s so cheap, but it DOES NOT wash off your face.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use it because I do enjoy the tingly feel and</li>
            <li>I would never use this to clean my face alone.</li>
            <li>I brought it at Walmart for 3.68$, on the bottle it says compare to clean &amp; clear(which</li>
            <li>Like smearing grease all over my face, felt like it was doing nothing to clean my face, burnt, but I kept washing, and washing, and washing....</li>
            <li>today I&#x27;m bright red..</li>
            <li>Spend the extra dollar on good face wash.</li>
            <li>My face would often feel sore and I couldn&#x27;t find many products that could really reduce the bumps or acne.</li>
            <li>plus there is this over powering cool mint feel on your face witch</li>
            <li>product is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>Then my face turned bright red and got HOT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the original Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser for months as my dermatologist had instructed and absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li>I had to get it very hot</li>
            <li>Avoid this stuff, use the real Clean and Clear.</li>
            <li>despite the cons it left my face 10x better!</li>
            <li>Pay the extra money to get the name brand version - it is a MUCH better product!</li>
            <li>It is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera offers so many benefits to your skin.</li>
            <li>Nice try Walmart..... but not the same.</li>
            <li>However, it got too fresh, to the point where it felt like it was burning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I enjoy the 5% from clean and clear...</li>
            <li>It drys up right away.</li>
            <li>The only reason this product is great and I will repurchase is because after you&#x27;ve left it on your face for so long, it completely gets rid of your acne or diminishes the size greatly.</li>
            <li>For a cheap price and positive results, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Hard and not so great feeling..</li>
            <li>My entire face burned for most of the day.</li>
            <li>First off if you are in the market for a benzoyl peroxide product then you already know that you risk bleaching of clothing, towels and wash rags.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning (after my C&amp;C Continous control was out of stock (convenient)</li>
            <li>Yikes, I guess this is why you should read reviews first.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many acne products, this one actually keeps my face moist without drying out.</li>
            <li>For those who have suffered with acne, you are well aware of what benzoyle peroxide is and used for.</li>
            <li>because it is 10% BP; Most tubes are only 5%.</li>
            <li>, it is not a cleanser really, it is benzoyle peroxide!</li>
            <li>I got out of the shower and used a hot wash cloth to try to remove it.</li>
            <li>So I apply it in my hands first and try to work up a lather.</li>
            <li>That stuff works very well!</li>
            <li>The first time I wash.</li>
            <li>I knew immediately the first time I used it that it contained menthol.</li>
            <li>I literally felt like someone burnt my face to a crisp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was only 3$</li>
            <li>First..</li>
            <li>But we just learned after the first washing to use a wash cloth EVERY time you wash your face to get it all off.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I tried it over the sink.</li>
            <li>Does not even come CLOSE to comparing with Clean &amp; Clear, as it advertises.</li>
            <li>next morning my face was still bright red and splotchy.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to switch from Clearasil to Clean and Clear but went to walmart and saw this &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; brand Clean and Clear look-a-like from Equate.</li>
            <li>the way my skin glows after using Clean and Clear&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>I did not havemoney to buy the clean &amp; clear</li>
            <li>and I thought this product will continue taking my acne off like my clean &amp; clear 5in 1cleanser.</li>
            <li>I needed a replacement to clean and clear</li>
            <li>use the name brand version of this - Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control face wash &amp; I</li>
            <li>Although this product is very thick/pasty and takes more work to rinse off, it def has worked for myself and my teenage son with our acne.</li>
            <li>I use Aveeno Positively Radiant with spf 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;IF you must purchase this, a fair warning would be to ONLY use on the actual problem spots and not your whole face.</li>
            <li>After I was finally able to get it all off my face with a washcloth my face felt dry and irritated and it stung like I had carpet burn all over my face.</li>
            <li>and it will take a lot more than 10% BP to dry out this face</li>
            <li>I use AUbrey Organics pure aloe Vera.</li>
            <li>After washing this product leaves fine later of whitish gray on skin, I suspect it is not for any therapeutic purposes , but rather a side effect of an inferior filling ingredient.</li>
            <li>I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>This product is very oily, almost like butt paste (for babies)</li>
            <li>Caused intense itching and burning on my face and body where it ran off in the shower.  </li>
            <li>When I went to buy it from Walmart it was out of stock (maybe because that&#x27;s the one everyone wants)</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t even used that much and somehow it expanded and was everywhere.</li>
            <li>do this because I wear makeup and have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how much makeup is on this brush after I use it.</li>
            <li>I use it as a treatment and it really does work.</li>
            <li>Be ready for it because it stings.</li>
            <li>Zinc oxide is very known for treating acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not found in stores unless maybe in a whole foods store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s widely known for treating sunburn but does way more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using all of these products and doing this routine has changed my skin so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>If you have very oily skin, try this.</li>
            <li>My face feels very refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>just continue to gently work it on your skin.</li>
            <li>and boy, I won&#x27;t use it much again...</li>
            <li>It was really really like...</li>
            <li>If you are used to the real product and you like</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>The only reason i even purchased the equate version was because of course Walmart was out of the original.</li>
            <li>Ok so due to experimenting with makeup foundation and bb creams.</li>
            <li>You do not feel clean - your face feels oily and gross</li>
            <li>After the second use my face started to burn and turned bright red, I went to sleep shortly after</li>
            <li>But, otherwise, I would expect some drying to occur with the high percentage of acne medication contained within this face</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 18 years old, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m supposed to have those yet!!</li>
            <li>I have used the Clean and Clear variety for several years and had no issues like this at all.</li>
            <li>I am a regular user of Clean and Clear&#x27;s Continuous Control Acne Cleanser</li>
            <li>That stuff works very well!lean and Clear.</li>
            <li>Then I pat my face dry with a clean</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend this product as far as consistency.</li>
            <li>In the rare occasion that I do breakout, I actually just put some of this on the area at night as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>I was messing with it to see how to make it work like a normal cleanser</li>
            <li>and then I get out of the shower and wash my face normally again, just to get the rest off.</li>
            <li>I am a sixteen year old with slightly oily skin and thought this would be an okay buy.</li>
            <li>but I had to wait for it to arrive and had run out of my other cleanser, the clean and clear acne cleanser with benzoyl peroxide which hadn&#x27;t really been helping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a gross side effect of being too cheap to spend the extra dollar for name brand face wash.</li>
            <li>Some went in my eye area which is usually no problem for me, but I couldn&#x27;t get this</li>
            <li>It allows the skin to heal quickly and naturaly with minimal skaring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have use the whole bottle though, and it did NOT clear my acne as much as others did.</li>
            <li>I tried rinsing it off really quickly, and I noticed it left a white film over my face.</li>
            <li>You can purchase a tiny tube of it at stores, but I liked this cleanser because I could wash my entire face for less money.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, The &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; some people have mentioned happens with Clean and Clear&#x27;s product as well if it is left on too long.</li>
            <li>I do NOT have sensitive skin and not only would this not wash off, it smells like a foot cream and it burned my skin so much.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>no where near my eyes or even my under eye area.</li>
            <li>I do NOT have sensitive skin at all and use benzoyl peroxide all the time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly I grab my olay professional pro-x and put a pea size of neutrogena on the brush.</li>
            <li>This stuff not only heals acne fast</li>
            <li>leaves contain a plethora of antioxidants including, beta carotene, vitamins C and E than can improve the skins natural</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at the one-star reviews here.</li>
            <li>, within 10 minutes last night, it made my eye very red.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With this, the hole is much smaller and it doesn&#x27;t come out as fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin and nothing has ever bothered it like this before.</li>
            <li>I do NOT recommend this for sensitive skin at all, my regimen is for people who have tougher skin and aren&#x27;t so sensitive, but might have acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I threw it directly into the trash where it belongs at that point.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was a little cheaper than the Clean &amp; Clear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used clean and clear for a few years now and while looking for a cheaper alternative I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend doing this often though, because once I did it two consecutive days, but ALL over my face, and the third day, my skin was SUPER dry in some spots.</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the directions properly, or about the right technique to apply it and how long I should leave it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it leaves behind a white film that isn&#x27;t easy to wash off just with water (especially if you haven&#x27;t shaved -- it will stick to the hairs).</li>
            <li>I recently decided to try the name brand clean &amp; clear of this product and it&#x27;s much less pasty</li>
            <li>I usually use the real stuff, but I suppose I was feeling cheap when I bought the Equate version the other day.</li>
            <li>I tried this on saturday, sunday, my face was red and itchy, and on monday, my face was completely swollen and puffy.</li>
            <li>apparently that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to be like.  </li>
            <li>I honestly thought there was something wrong with the product -</li>
            <li>Ok, so I have seen that this product has gotten ALL horrible reviews, but to be fair, it is not necessarily a cleanser, it is a benzoyle peroxide cleanser!</li>
            <li>only way to get rid of acne fast is to dry it up!</li>
            <li>Well worth the small side effects, all of which do not bother me.</li>
            <li>The 5% doesn&#x27;t bother me and I leave it on for a good minute for deep cleansing since my face never dries out badly.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I would never use this to clean my face alone.</li>
            <li> I brought it at Walmart for 3.68$, on the bottle it says compare to clean &amp; clear(which</li>
            <li> Like smearing grease all over my face, felt like it was doing nothing to clean my face, burnt, but I kept washing, and washing, and washing....</li>
            <li> today I&#x27;m bright red..</li>
            <li> Spend the extra dollar on good face wash.</li>
            <li> My face would often feel sore and I couldn&#x27;t find many products that could really reduce the bumps or acne.</li>
            <li> plus there is this over powering cool mint feel on your face witch</li>
            <li> product is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> Then my face turned bright red and got HOT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser for months as my dermatologist had instructed and absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li> I had to get it very hot</li>
            <li> Avoid this stuff, use the real Clean and Clear.</li>
            <li> despite the cons it left my face 10x better!</li>
            <li> Pay the extra money to get the name brand version - it is a MUCH better product!</li>
            <li> It is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera offers so many benefits to your skin.</li>
            <li> Nice try Walmart..... but not the same.</li>
            <li> However, it got too fresh, to the point where it felt like it was burning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I enjoy the 5% from clean and clear...</li>
            <li> It drys up right away.</li>
            <li> The only reason this product is great and I will repurchase is because after you&#x27;ve left it on your face for so long, it completely gets rid of your acne or diminishes the size greatly.</li>
            <li> For a cheap price and positive results, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Hard and not so great feeling..</li>
            <li> My entire face burned for most of the day.</li>
            <li> First off if you are in the market for a benzoyl peroxide product then you already know that you risk bleaching of clothing, towels and wash rags.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning (after my C&amp;C Continous control was out of stock (convenient)</li>
            <li> Yikes, I guess this is why you should read reviews first.  </li>
            <li> Unlike many acne products, this one actually keeps my face moist without drying out.</li>
            <li> For those who have suffered with acne, you are well aware of what benzoyle peroxide is and used for.</li>
            <li> because it is 10% BP; Most tubes are only 5%.</li>
            <li> , it is not a cleanser really, it is benzoyle peroxide!</li>
            <li> I got out of the shower and used a hot wash cloth to try to remove it.</li>
            <li> So I apply it in my hands first and try to work up a lather.</li>
            <li> That stuff works very well!</li>
            <li> The first time I wash.</li>
            <li> I knew immediately the first time I used it that it contained menthol.</li>
            <li> I literally felt like someone burnt my face to a crisp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was only 3$</li>
            <li> First..</li>
            <li> But we just learned after the first washing to use a wash cloth EVERY time you wash your face to get it all off.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I tried it over the sink.</li>
            <li> Does not even come CLOSE to comparing with Clean &amp; Clear, as it advertises.</li>
            <li> next morning my face was still bright red and splotchy.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to switch from Clearasil to Clean and Clear but went to walmart and saw this &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; brand Clean and Clear look-a-like from Equate.</li>
            <li> the way my skin glows after using Clean and Clear&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> I did not havemoney to buy the clean &amp; clear</li>
            <li> and I thought this product will continue taking my acne off like my clean &amp; clear 5in 1cleanser.</li>
            <li> I needed a replacement to clean and clear</li>
            <li> use the name brand version of this - Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control face wash &amp; I</li>
            <li> Although this product is very thick/pasty and takes more work to rinse off, it def has worked for myself and my teenage son with our acne.</li>
            <li> I use Aveeno Positively Radiant with spf 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;IF you must purchase this, a fair warning would be to ONLY use on the actual problem spots and not your whole face.</li>
            <li> After I was finally able to get it all off my face with a washcloth my face felt dry and irritated and it stung like I had carpet burn all over my face.</li>
            <li> and it will take a lot more than 10% BP to dry out this face</li>
            <li> I use AUbrey Organics pure aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> After washing this product leaves fine later of whitish gray on skin, I suspect it is not for any therapeutic purposes , but rather a side effect of an inferior filling ingredient.</li>
            <li> I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> This product is very oily, almost like butt paste (for babies)</li>
            <li> Caused intense itching and burning on my face and body where it ran off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> When I went to buy it from Walmart it was out of stock (maybe because that&#x27;s the one everyone wants)</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t even used that much and somehow it expanded and was everywhere.</li>
            <li> do this because I wear makeup and have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how much makeup is on this brush after I use it.</li>
            <li> I use it as a treatment and it really does work.</li>
            <li> Be ready for it because it stings.</li>
            <li> Zinc oxide is very known for treating acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not found in stores unless maybe in a whole foods store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s widely known for treating sunburn but does way more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using all of these products and doing this routine has changed my skin so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> If you have very oily skin, try this.</li>
            <li> My face feels very refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> just continue to gently work it on your skin.</li>
            <li> and boy, I won&#x27;t use it much again...</li>
            <li> It was really really like...</li>
            <li> If you are used to the real product and you like</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> The only reason i even purchased the equate version was because of course Walmart was out of the original.</li>
            <li> Ok so due to experimenting with makeup foundation and bb creams.</li>
            <li> You do not feel clean - your face feels oily and gross</li>
            <li> After the second use my face started to burn and turned bright red, I went to sleep shortly after</li>
            <li> But, otherwise, I would expect some drying to occur with the high percentage of acne medication contained within this face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 years old, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m supposed to have those yet!!</li>
            <li> I have used the Clean and Clear variety for several years and had no issues like this at all.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of Clean and Clear&#x27;s Continuous Control Acne Cleanser</li>
            <li> That stuff works very well!lean and Clear.</li>
            <li> Then I pat my face dry with a clean</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend this product as far as consistency.</li>
            <li> In the rare occasion that I do breakout, I actually just put some of this on the area at night as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I was messing with it to see how to make it work like a normal cleanser</li>
            <li> and then I get out of the shower and wash my face normally again, just to get the rest off.</li>
            <li> I am a sixteen year old with slightly oily skin and thought this would be an okay buy.</li>
            <li> but I had to wait for it to arrive and had run out of my other cleanser, the clean and clear acne cleanser with benzoyl peroxide which hadn&#x27;t really been helping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a gross side effect of being too cheap to spend the extra dollar for name brand face wash.</li>
            <li> Some went in my eye area which is usually no problem for me, but I couldn&#x27;t get this</li>
            <li> It allows the skin to heal quickly and naturaly with minimal skaring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have use the whole bottle though, and it did NOT clear my acne as much as others did.</li>
            <li> I tried rinsing it off really quickly, and I noticed it left a white film over my face.</li>
            <li> You can purchase a tiny tube of it at stores, but I liked this cleanser because I could wash my entire face for less money.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, The &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; some people have mentioned happens with Clean and Clear&#x27;s product as well if it is left on too long.</li>
            <li> I do NOT have sensitive skin and not only would this not wash off, it smells like a foot cream and it burned my skin so much.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> no where near my eyes or even my under eye area.</li>
            <li> I do NOT have sensitive skin at all and use benzoyl peroxide all the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly I grab my olay professional pro-x and put a pea size of neutrogena on the brush.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only heals acne fast</li>
            <li> leaves contain a plethora of antioxidants including, beta carotene, vitamins C and E than can improve the skins natural</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the one-star reviews here.</li>
            <li> , within 10 minutes last night, it made my eye very red.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With this, the hole is much smaller and it doesn&#x27;t come out as fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin and nothing has ever bothered it like this before.</li>
            <li> I do NOT recommend this for sensitive skin at all, my regimen is for people who have tougher skin and aren&#x27;t so sensitive, but might have acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I threw it directly into the trash where it belongs at that point.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was a little cheaper than the Clean &amp; Clear.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used clean and clear for a few years now and while looking for a cheaper alternative I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend doing this often though, because once I did it two consecutive days, but ALL over my face, and the third day, my skin was SUPER dry in some spots.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the directions properly, or about the right technique to apply it and how long I should leave it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that it leaves behind a white film that isn&#x27;t easy to wash off just with water (especially if you haven&#x27;t shaved -- it will stick to the hairs).</li>
            <li> I recently decided to try the name brand clean &amp; clear of this product and it&#x27;s much less pasty</li>
            <li> I usually use the real stuff, but I suppose I was feeling cheap when I bought the Equate version the other day.</li>
            <li> I tried this on saturday, sunday, my face was red and itchy, and on monday, my face was completely swollen and puffy.</li>
            <li> apparently that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to be like.  </li>
            <li> I honestly thought there was something wrong with the product -</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have seen that this product has gotten ALL horrible reviews, but to be fair, it is not necessarily a cleanser, it is a benzoyle peroxide cleanser!</li>
            <li> only way to get rid of acne fast is to dry it up!</li>
            <li> Well worth the small side effects, all of which do not bother me.</li>
            <li> The 5% doesn&#x27;t bother me and I leave it on for a good minute for deep cleansing since my face never dries out badly.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product at Walmart after trying all of the overly expensive Proactiv and similar products, and this stuff is the only thing that I have seen real progress with in the first week.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE- I use Clean and Clear and this wash said comparable to Clean and Clear daily facewash</li>
            <li> Definitely try it out on your skin, perhaps check on your wrist prior to applying it to your face to see how long you can leave it on.</li>
            <li> Some people say it burns, but I think when you first apply it, you feel a cooling sensation, or at least I do.</li>
            <li> and now I have long, deep pinkish creases under my eyes.</li>
            <li> After the second time my face felt like leather it was so dry!</li>
            <li> I was actually dumb enough to buy this product twice hoping that my first sample was just a fluke.</li>
            <li> What happened for me was, even though I did not use it on my neck area, I broke out in a major rash all up and down my neck and jaw line.</li>
            <li> One star for this product is saying way too much, if i could give this product a negative review i would.</li>
            <li> Also, only wash for about thirty sec.</li>
            <li> Plus the film doesn&#x27;t stay for long.</li>
            <li> I spent years and a lot of money trying different ones for nothing to work.</li>
            <li> and it does not completely wash off.</li>
            <li> I believe this has to do partially with that it does leave a tiny film on your face as it states (it keeps working even after washing off).</li>
            <li> , I just put it on at night and for however long</li>
            <li> It makes my face very red also, but some of that might be because I had to use a wet towel to rub the cleanser off after I rinsed, followed by a cotton ball with toner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually switch it up every time I need a new one.</li>
            <li> Not only has this caused physical pain, it&#x27;s embarrassing how red and raw</li>
            <li> My skin was a mixture of red and raw after I finally seemed to get the lingering white film off of my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you have dry skin, I&#x27;d be careful, because it could further dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> and I noticed the white film that all of the other reviewers were talking about</li>
            <li> This one, like every other reviewer said, leaves a white film on your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walmart, and I can&#x27;t use it because it leaves a waxy white residue after rinsing (possibly due to the mineral oil in the cleanser?</li>
            <li> you can feel alcohol burning your face and it leaves a white film that is hard to come off completely unless you scrub your face.</li>
            <li> but my face began to dry out.</li>
            <li> If your face is dry then use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> it was so dry.</li>
            <li> Secondly  it does leave a \\&quot;film\\&quot; as it is supposed to leave a coating that leaves the medicine to work actively after you have washed.  </li>
            <li> It really picks up what is left behind.</li>
            <li> I always avoid my eyes and somehow every single time I washed my face with this it burnt my face and eyes.</li>
            <li> I think most people put it all over their face, and gave it a bad review.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely not purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few different Equate face washes without a problem.</li>
            <li> It burned my skin and i was like no haha not again.</li>
            <li> I do not really see this as a face wash though since it is so creamy but</li>
            <li> My face began to burn and my hands had went from slipping over my skin to sticking like glue.</li>
            <li> I am a male and I have always had trouble with shaving bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, you can rub the product deeper into your face to lose the white film.</li>
            <li> I only use it once a day because twice a day was too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> and my cheeks were pink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually TOTAL shit as a cleanser, like NO, DON&#x27;T USE IT AS A CLEANSER.</li>
            <li> do you mean the white layer of face cream, or the red bumps</li>
            <li> The other thing that happened was, I went</li>
            <li> Not sure how such a product was ever marketed without being tested.</li>
            <li> Nothing like any other cleaner out there.  </li>
            <li> Had to repeatedly rub over my skin with a wet washcloth to get it off!  </li>
            <li> It also ran up to the other eye!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other reviews are correct in that it leaves a residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> It does feel a bit like an oily lotion, however I prefer it feeling a little oily vs feeling dry</li>
            <li> It helped a little bit, but when I got out of the shower I had to use a dry hand towel to forcefully scrape the equate cleanser sludge off of my face.</li>
            <li> It stays on your face providing moisture while fighting acne with its active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> As other people have stated it leaves a thick residue on face and leaves face red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> It will become a white hard residue in some areas and stick to your skin and produce continous burning.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I tried I could not get the greasy white residue off my face.</li>
            <li> total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> But, I have oily skin to begin with, so it wasn&#x27;t THAT dry, just dryer than usual.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for less than a week</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this one since is it half the price</li>
            <li> Took half an hour to remove.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that Walmart is trying to save us some money by offering a product comparable to the name brand at less expense.</li>
            <li> The black head scrub works..</li>
            <li> It hurt so bad that I had to put a cool wash cloth on my face.</li>
            <li> I usually take a pea sized portion in the palm of my hands and apply it to my face which is still wet from the shower.</li>
            <li> Yes, it burns a little, but you can also feel every pore on your face opening up as you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Saving the couple dollars is not worth it!</li>
            <li> It soaks into the skin and goes away after a little while, so no biggie.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And sometimes it leaves a little film on the sink basin</li>
            <li> a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> But, my face burned after each use, my cheeks turned red and stayed red for a few hours, and when I accidentally got it under both my eyes it dried the skin so badly that when I moved the skin stretched or something</li>
            <li> Your back and chest has a very thick skin and you would not irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> Never buy this waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced the pain this product has left.</li>
            <li> Eventually i started waking up with clearer skin everyday.</li>
            <li> It may leave a white residue behind.</li>
            <li> To get rid of residue left behind use a cotton pad or cotton ball dipped in toner or alcohol and rub the spots that have residue left behind.</li>
            <li> My skin absorbs it after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Its a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I used it once a day for a continuous week and it completely dried my face out to the point where my skin hurt.</li>
            <li> It leaves a thin layer of white cream on your face which is nearly impossible to get off even with hot water.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two days and thought I had finally found something to get rid of the three blind pimples I&#x27;d had due to hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, it leaves a white residue that is incredibly difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> It was really hard to completely rinse off, I had to scrub real hard.</li>
            <li> Yes it burns a little after washing but BP usually does burn.</li>
            <li> I ran my fingernails lightly down my face and got TONS of nasty white residue under my nails - my whole face was covered in it!</li>
            <li> It feels as if my skin has been rubbed raw with sand or fiberglass.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with another cleanser, after I pat dry my face, I put a thin layer on my acne and just let it sit for hours.</li>
            <li> Using VERY little, is also another recommendation of mine.</li>
            <li> it forms a slick residue on your face which does not come off unless you scrub.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now been about a week since I have used the product and my face is still dried out and peeling!</li>
            <li> I picked this up from walmart after they ran out of the wash that I usually use.</li>
            <li> waste your money on this one!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product got past the testing phase because it is flat out dangerous.</li>
            <li> It also has a menthol like cooling sensation, so you may not want to scrub your face too hard before using this product.</li>
            <li> Scrubbing too hard then using breakout control may cause a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I had to kinda push hard into my skin to wipe it off.</li>
            <li> It caused my face and eyes to burn and sting for at least an hour after using it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s getting late</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, what I have seen in negative reviews are people complaining about a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> This product goes on thick.</li>
            <li> It was like having some sort of thick crisco stuck to my skin.</li>
            <li> at first i HATED it.</li>
            <li> you use it, use a very small bead size and DO NOT rub it in for 20-30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I seriously wonder if this product is defective.</li>
            <li> A face cleanser that requires concentrated dish soap and a scouring pad to remove is not a good face cleanser.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not good.</li>
            <li> There was one, but it was weak.</li>
            <li> And then I just keep it on and since it&#x27;s so difficult to get off, I usually take a shower and wash it off there,</li>
            <li> and it is very hard to get</li>
            <li> Few weeks later though my face was terrible with acne</li>
            <li> So I have not experienced any drying.</li>
            <li> It just gets worse as you use it.</li>
            <li> This product made my face feel cold a few minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute worst acne product ever.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and this is so itchy and painful!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of face washes over the years and this by far the worst.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get it in my eyes and they burnt BAD for almost an hour to the point that I could not open them without squinting badly.</li>
            <li> and it dried ALL of my acne up overnight but dried my face terribly.</li>
            <li> and then when I rinsed it off it left this awful oily film behind.</li>
            <li> The rash is red and itchy and its awful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking you will go blind</li>
            <li> It was difficult to sleep that night because of</li>
            <li> From the moment I rubbed this stuff on my face, I knew something has gone horribly wrong.</li>
            <li> After showering, there was an awful white residue like an impenetrable mask covering my face.</li>
            <li> Thought maybe I did it wrong.</li>
            <li> This totally broke out my skin horribly.</li>
            <li> Oh man I was wrong, with the equate beauty</li>
            <li> It is also extremely difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> it leaves this terrible white film over your skin that cannot be washed off.</li>
            <li> It drys like a very thin see through mask.</li>
            <li> The residue is very thin and not noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and leaves this annoying film almost like paste</li>
            <li> There is something wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this leaves a waxy/oily residue on your face that is very difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> It is also nearly impossible to wash off your face.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to get it off</li>
            <li> The morning after my face felt as if I had just had a bad sunburn, I stopped using the product</li>
            <li> It is really, really bad.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and within seconds my face was burning so bad that I felt like it was standing too close to a fire</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle and washed my face in the shower bad idea after 3 seconds</li>
            <li> but we broke out so bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this today.. probably a bad idea.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy, its just bad.</li>
            <li> I feel like I will wake up tomorrow to peeling skin, it is that bad.</li>
            <li> It also was painful to rinse off.</li>
            <li> but dear lord that was a painful experience.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this face wash.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s off I then change the water to very cold.</li>
            <li> I hate to think what anyone is going through that got this in their eye.</li>
            <li> I hate how I had to test it out like that</li>
            <li> Holy crap..</li>
            <li> its leaves a disgusting film on your face and as others have said it is nearly impossible to get off, when you rinse the face wash off</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser in hopes that it would do something for when I break out really bad, and it did!</li>
            <li> Then it had a really really cold sensation!!</li>
            <li> This product is the worst face cleanser I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I have the msot horrible rash on my face because of this, it wont go away and burns and itches...</li>
            <li> Horrible and burns face.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Awful!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible.</li>
            <li> Really disgusting!  </li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> and it was just horrible.</li>
            <li> This is the worst cleaner I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The worst part is burns!</li>
            <li> This product is awful - do not buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it does not look, feel or smell at all like the name brand product and the worst part is that IT DOES NOT COME OFF!</li>
            <li> One of the worst purchases I have ever made.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This product is very oily, almost like butt paste (for babies) it forms a slick residue on your face which does not come off unless you scrub.  Caused intense itching and burning on my face and body where it ran off in the shower.  I would absolutely not purchase this product.  I have used the Clean and Clear variety for several years and had no issues like this at all.</li>
            <li> This product is the worst face cleanser I have ever bought. I do not have sensitive skin. I did not have what most people have happen with it leaving a film. What happened for me was, even though I did not use it on my neck area, I broke out in a major rash all up and down my neck and jaw line. The rash is red and itchy and its awful! I can&#x27;t stop scratching. I was fine the night i used it and then i woke up in the middle of the night tearing my neck up from the scratching. Hydrocortizone cream wont even stop the itch. The other thing that happened was, I went no where near my eyes or even my under eye area. I used it around my nose, cheek and jaw area and forehead. By the time i got out of the shower, my undereye area was on fire and swollen. Face cleasers should not do this! Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> Do not buy!! Used this product for two days (once a day) it leaves a white film on your face that won&#x27;t come off unless you scrub multiple times. After the second use my face started to burn and turned bright red, I went to sleep shortly after and when I woke in the morning my pillow had a white spot on it from the cream. The morning after my face felt as if I had just had a bad sunburn, I stopped using the product but my face began to dry out.The day after I stopped using the product my face began to peel (as it would if I had just got a sunburn). It&#x27;s now been about a week since I have used the product and my face is still dried out and peeling! Do not recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have the msot horrible rash on my face because of this, it wont go away and burns and itches... its been 2 days since ive used this product and noting is helping</li>
            <li> Do NOT use this product. Horrible and burns face. I used it once and never again. The Clean and Clear version is great though. I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible product. What was Equate thinking??? Does not even come CLOSE to comparing with Clean &amp; Clear, as it advertises. As others have stated, this leaves a waxy/oily residue on your face that is very difficult to wash off. Next time my store runs out of C&amp;C, I&#x27;ll just do without.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this as it leaves a white film over the face which does not go away even after rinsing thoroughly. Not sure how such a product was ever marketed without being tested. Never buy this waste.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.  It leaves a white film on your face that will not come off - looks and feels like zinc oxide!!! Awful!! It&#x27;s going in the garbage; total waste of money!! I repeat - DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> I picked this up from walmart after they ran out of the wash that I usually use. I have been using this for less than a week and it is already making my acne flare up. I am a sixteen year old with slightly oily skin and thought this would be an okay buy. It was not. It leaves my face red and leaves a filmy residue, which I thought was the medicine or something like that. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s just a gross side effect of being too cheap to spend the extra dollar for name brand face wash. Please, for your sake, do not buy this. It is really, really bad. Spend the extra dollar on good face wash.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product at Walmart after trying all of the overly expensive Proactiv and similar products, and this stuff is the only thing that I have seen real progress with in the first week. Yes, it burns a little, but you can also feel every pore on your face opening up as you rinse it off. For a cheap price and positive results, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE- I use Clean and Clear and this wash said comparable to Clean and Clear daily facewash so I decided to try this one since is it half the price and my face Burned. It has now been 12 hours since I used it and my face continues to get redder and redder and is starting to welt!! I do not have sensitive skin and this is so itchy and painful!! DO NOT BUY EVER!!</li>
            <li> I have used a few different Equate face washes without a problem. This stuff is horrible. My entire face burned for most of the day. As other people have stated it leaves a thick residue on face and leaves face red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> So, I had just bought a cleanser online but I had to wait for it to arrive and had run out of my other cleanser, the clean and clear acne cleanser with benzoyl peroxide which hadn&#x27;t really been helping. I saw this while shopping and thought I&#x27;d try it. I feel like I just burned a layer of my face off. It also was painful to rinse off. I don&#x27;t think I ever managed to get it all off even after scrubbing for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> First off if you are in the market for a benzoyl peroxide product then you already know that you risk bleaching of clothing, towels and wash rags.  Secondly  it does leave a \\&quot;film\\&quot; as it is supposed to leave a coating that leaves the medicine to work actively after you have washed.  I personally use a wash rag with this product to help exfoliate and a toner afterwards which gets rid of the extra \\&quot;film\\&quot; that the product intended.  I am an adult who had battled acne and this seems to be the best wash I have used to date.</li>
            <li> One star for this product is saying way too much, if i could give this product a negative review i would. I&#x27;ve been using the original Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser for months as my dermatologist had instructed and absolutely love the product. The only reason i even purchased the equate version was because of course Walmart was out of the original. Thinking it would be the same thing as is specifically states on the packaging i gave it a shot. Not even two days of using this product, morning and night, my face is red, pealing, and sore as every. I&#x27;ve never experienced the pain this product has left. It feels as if my skin has been rubbed raw with sand or fiberglass. Not only has this caused physical pain, it&#x27;s embarrassing how red and raw my face looks! I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT USING THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I used this product one time and I noticed the white film that all of the other reviewers were talking about but I decided ot try it one more time. After the second time my face felt like leather it was so dry! Saving the couple dollars is not worth it!</li>
            <li> at first i HATED it. It burned my skin and i was like no haha not again. Few weeks later though my face was terrible with acne so i decided to give it a try again. Eventually i started waking up with clearer skin everyday. I do not really see this as a face wash though since it is so creamy but despite the cons it left my face 10x better!</li>
            <li> To put it bluntly, it you want to know what napalm feels like, rub this on your face. It will become a white hard residue in some areas and stick to your skin and produce continous burning. I used it for the first time this morning (after my C&amp;C Continous control was out of stock (convenient) and this was next to it.) I can tell you It&#x27;s been 2 hours and parts of my face are still burning all though I have managed to get most of this garbage off of it. I hate to think what anyone is going through that got this in their eye. I&#x27;m thinking you will go blind, i&#x27;m not joking, stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product this morning before work. No matter how hard I tried I could not get the greasy white residue off my face. I do NOT have sensitive skin at all and use benzoyl peroxide all the time. There is something wrong with this product! My face was burning and red and splotchy. So after failing to get the greasy film off with another face wash, I had to resort to using DAWN on my face just so I could go to work. I am returning this and getting my money back. I have never had an experience like this with Equate brand acne washes. Please do not put this on your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was a little cheaper than the Clean &amp; Clear.  I put it on my face and within seconds my face was burning so bad that I felt like it was standing too close to a fire and my lips were tingling.  I immediately washed it off but my face still burned.  When I looked in the mirror my face was red and splotchy.  It hurt so bad that I had to put a cool wash cloth on my face. It was difficult to sleep that night because of the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning my face was still bright red and splotchy.  My face was red and hurt all day.  How this got passed threw all the testing is beyond me!!!!  Shame on you Equate!</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of Clean and Clear&#x27;s Continuous Control Acne Cleanser and I have been very satisfied with that version. When I went to buy it from Walmart it was out of stock (maybe because that&#x27;s the one everyone wants) so I picked up the Equate version instead. Never again. It caused my face and eyes to burn and sting for at least an hour after using it. I had to check to make sure hydrofluoric acid wasn&#x27;t one of the ingredients. It is also nearly impossible to wash off your face. It left a white, chalky film on my face that did not come off even with repeated washing. I had some scruff/facial hair when I used it and the residue clung to my hair and wouldn&#x27;t come out. After I was finally able to get it all off my face with a washcloth my face felt dry and irritated and it stung like I had carpet burn all over my face. I don&#x27;t know how this product got past the testing phase because it is flat out dangerous. Sending it back to the store for a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser in hopes that it would do something for when I break out really bad, and it did! But, my face burned after each use, my cheeks turned red and stayed red for a few hours, and when I accidentally got it under both my eyes it dried the skin so badly that when I moved the skin stretched or something and now I have long, deep pinkish creases under my eyes. I&#x27;m 18 years old, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m supposed to have those yet!!</li>
            <li> I tried this on saturday, sunday, my face was red and itchy, and on monday, my face was completely swollen and puffy. This product made me burn and itch, so I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really disgusting!  Nothing like any other cleaner out there.  It sticks to your face like glue!  Had to repeatedly rub over my skin with a wet washcloth to get it off!  ICK.</li>
            <li> Yikes, I guess this is why you should read reviews first.  I swear I&#x27;ve used this product before but dear lord that was a painful experience.  I do NOT have sensitive skin and not only would this not wash off, it smells like a foot cream and it burned my skin so much.  My entire face is red and burning afterwards, my eyes red &amp; puffed up and swollen - I feel like i poured acid all over my face.  I honestly thought there was something wrong with the product - like maybe it got mixed up with a foot cream in the factory but going by these reviews apparently that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to be like.  DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> Wanted to switch from Clearasil to Clean and Clear but went to walmart and saw this &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; brand Clean and Clear look-a-like from Equate. From the moment I rubbed this stuff on my face, I knew something has gone horribly wrong. My face began to burn and my hands had went from slipping over my skin to sticking like glue. After showering, there was an awful white residue like an impenetrable mask covering my face. It burned. Took half an hour to remove. Tossed this in the trash before I left the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This product has worked wonders for me. I am a male and I have always had trouble with shaving bumps on my face. My face would often feel sore and I couldn&#x27;t find many products that could really reduce the bumps or acne. The instructions state that you should wash this product out; however it will coat the face more like a lotion. Don&#x27;t try to get it all off your face because it will not come out. I think that is the point of the product. It stays on your face providing moisture while fighting acne with its active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide. This product goes on thick. I usually take a pea sized portion in the palm of my hands and apply it to my face which is still wet from the shower. It may leave a white residue behind. After a few minutes, you can rub the product deeper into your face to lose the white film. Unlike many acne products, this one actually keeps my face moist without drying out. It does feel a bit like an oily lotion, however I prefer it feeling a little oily vs feeling dry (it doesn&#x27;t shine). This one may not work for everybody but it&#x27;s a perfect solution for me. It also has a menthol like cooling sensation, so you may not want to scrub your face too hard before using this product. Scrubbing too hard then using breakout control may cause a burning sensation. For some, it might be better to use this product before bed.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have seen that this product has gotten ALL horrible reviews, but to be fair, it is not necessarily a cleanser, it is a benzoyle peroxide cleanser! For those who have suffered with acne, you are well aware of what benzoyle peroxide is and used for. BP is for drying out the acne, which in turn, dries out the skin. You can purchase a tiny tube of it at stores, but I liked this cleanser because I could wash my entire face for less money. Yes it burns a little after washing but BP usually does burn. Also, only wash for about thirty sec. because it is 10% BP; Most tubes are only 5%. To get rid of residue left behind use a cotton pad or cotton ball dipped in toner or alcohol and rub the spots that have residue left behind. If your face is dry then use a moisturizer. I loved this, I thought it was cheaper than buying a tube, and it really has kept my face clearer. Remember though, it is not a cleanser really, it is benzoyle peroxide!</li>
            <li> These Equate products are hit or miss. I appreciate that Walmart is trying to save us some money by offering a product comparable to the name brand at less expense. This product is a definite miss. I was actually dumb enough to buy this product twice hoping that my first sample was just a fluke. Same results with the second sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plain and simple this stuff just doesn&#x27;t rinse off. Be prepared for a lot of scrubbing with a wash cloth if you want to get the white residue left by this product off your face. I&#x27;ve used a lot of face washes over the years and this by far the worst.</li>
            <li> I usually use the real stuff, but I suppose I was feeling cheap when I bought the Equate version the other day. I was excited to use it because I do enjoy the tingly feel and the way my skin glows after using Clean and Clear&#x27;s version. None of this happened with the Equate version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First shower, used it. Noticed it was almost like spreading A&amp;D ointment all over my face, but with that minty tingle. I lathered it up as well as I could (some bubbles) just as the back said. I went to rinse it off and it didn&#x27;t come off!! It was like having some sort of thick crisco stuck to my skin. It was awful. I got out of the shower and used a hot wash cloth to try to remove it. I had to get it very hot but then wring the water out of it as much as possible and SCRUB this stuff off my face (this was All after washing it off as stated on the directions). My skin was a mixture of red and raw after I finally seemed to get the lingering white film off of my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Round 2. Used it again tonight. Thought maybe I did it wrong. Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the directions properly, or about the right technique to apply it and how long I should leave it on. So I apply it in my hands first and try to work up a lather. There was one, but it was weak. I began washing my face as directed, but the greasy feeling came back immediately. I felt like someone had smeared my face is Cisco. So I reached for some apricot scrub I had and used that in top of it to try to scrape this gunk off my face. It helped a little bit, but when I got out of the shower I had to use a dry hand towel to forcefully scrape the equate cleanser sludge off of my face. I hadn&#x27;t even used that much and somehow it expanded and was everywhere. I threw it in the garbage immediately. This is one of those times where it doesn&#x27;t pay to go with the cheaper brand. I&#x27;m so disappointed in this face wash. Hours later and I still can&#x27;t get rid of that greasy feeling it left on my face. Avoid this stuff, use the real Clean and Clear. That stuff works very well!lean and Clear. That stuff works very well!</li>
            <li> Ok so due to experimenting with makeup foundation and bb creams. This totally broke out my skin horribly. I started to do some research on things that can treat acne and helps to heal the skin. Here is what I came up with and it works tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I wash my face 2x with neutrogena&#x27;s oil free grapefruit face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I do this because I wear makeup and have very oily skin. The first time I wash. I splash my face with very warm almost hot water. This opens your pours and helps the face wash to do its job at cleaning them out. Then I squart one pump on my hands, I rub in circular motions and then rinse with very warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly I grab my olay professional pro-x and put a pea size of neutrogena on the brush. If you don&#x27;t have this I suggest you get one. It is totally worth it. You won&#x27;t believe how much makeup is on this brush after I use it. It really picks up what is left behind. After this I rinse again with very warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly I use the equate breakout control cleanser. This stuff is no joke. Yes it does burn and leaves a film but that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The film is the medication that stays so it can treat and prevent breakouts. Plus the film doesn&#x27;t stay for long. My skin absorbs it after a few minutes. I would never use this to clean my face alone. I use it as a treatment and it really does work. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in weeks. Now after I apply this all over my face I rub it in for about 45 seconds and rinse with very warm water until it&#x27;s off. Once it&#x27;s off I then change the water to very cold. Be ready for it because it stings. I do this because it closes your pores . Then I pat my face dry with a clean towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after that&#x27;s done I apply calamine lotion to my face as a night mask. Calamine lotion has 8% zinc oxide in it. Zinc oxide is very known for treating acne. The calamine and zinc together work to treat and heal especially if you have popped pimples. This stuff is also a must have if your struggling with acne. This stuff not only heals acne fast but it totally conditions your skin. I don&#x27;t use this every night. I use it about once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If im not using the calamine lotion I use AUbrey Organics pure aloe Vera. It&#x27;s not found in stores unless maybe in a whole foods store. Aloe Vera offers so many benefits to your skin. It&#x27;s widely known for treating sunburn but does way more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: It treats acne.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera  has anti inflammatory properties that reduce skin inflammation. It allows the skin to heal quickly and naturaly with minimal skaring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: It fights aging.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe leaves contain a plethora of antioxidants including, beta carotene, vitamins C and E than can improve the skins natural firmness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3: It lessens the visibility if stretch marks and a lot more....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on and on about the benefits of aloe Vera but it&#x27;s getting late and I have to wrap this up. After I apply this to my face I wait for it to dry. It drys like a very thin see through mask. Then I apply a moisturizer. I use Aveeno Positively Radiant with spf 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using all of these products and doing this routine has changed my skin so much. It has not only cured my acne but has improved my skins appearance.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this because I never buy name brand face wash and it contains 10% benzoyl peroxide, which is 2-4x stronger than most acne washes. I am almost 27 and have struggled with moderate breakouts since puberty at twelve. I have tried many products over the years and this one seems to be worth well more than its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, it does leave a film. Now, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was just me, or if it was the product specifically. So I searched reviews and found that it is the product. From what I have read, it seems this is the medication remaining on your skin to work its magic. However, the film does not bother me. It soaks into the skin and goes away after a little while, so no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, what I have seen in negative reviews are people complaining about a burning sensation. I knew immediately the first time I used it that it contained menthol. It&#x27;s a tingling sensation, not burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I have very oily skin and it will take a lot more than 10% BP to dry out this face lol! So I have not experienced any drying. But, otherwise, I would expect some drying to occur with the high percentage of acne medication contained within this face wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant scent and a very creamy texture, which I like :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product. Well worth the small side effects, all of which do not bother me.</li>
            <li> This is the best breakout treatment I have ever used. I spent years and a lot of money trying different ones for nothing to work. Yes, this does leave a residue of product on your face but that&#x27;s why it works. I have very oily skin but this stuff controls it. The residue is very thin and not noticeable. I only use it once a day because twice a day was too harsh on my skin. In the rare occasion that I do breakout, I actually just put some of this on the area at night as a spot treatment. It drys up right away. If you have very oily skin, try this.</li>
            <li> Wow. I&#x27;m surprised at the one-star reviews here. I like this product. My face feels very refreshed after using it. I have NEVER felt burned. I follow the instructions and don&#x27;t leave it on for more than 30 seconds. It&#x27;s true that it leaves behind a white film that isn&#x27;t easy to wash off just with water (especially if you haven&#x27;t shaved -- it will stick to the hairs). But JUST USE A FACECLOTH! It will come off quite easily.</li>
            <li> I always avoid my eyes and somehow every single time I washed my face with this it burnt my face and eyes. It just gets worse as you use it. I decided to try it three separate occasions and it was just horrible. I literally felt like someone burnt my face to a crisp. And then it feels like you can never get it off! Save your money and do not buy.</li>
            <li> It kind of took me awhile to figure out how this product work.  It&#x27;s very thick and leaves this annoying film almost like paste and it&#x27;s impossible to get it off gently.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow about the 4th time using this I was messing with it to see how to make it work like a normal cleanser( I don&#x27;t want to have to toss it away) and what work was instead of doing 20-30 seconds on your face try 40-50 seconds just continue to gently work it on your skin. It works better and i guess it somehow melts the product.  I hate how I had to test it out like that and it to be a challenge rather than simply following directions on the back but whatever. I don&#x27;t really recommend this product as far as consistency.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the 10% peroxide always worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it and the damn stuff would not come off! Because of this, I had to kinda push hard into my skin to wipe it off. Some went in my eye area which is usually no problem for me, but I couldn&#x27;t get this off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, within 10 minutes last night, it made my eye very red.&lt;br /&gt;I woke up to a swollen eye, even though I didn&#x27;t purposely rub it in that area...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I enjoy the 5% from clean and clear... but I wanted something heavier when I shave because I irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you must purchase this, a fair warning would be to ONLY use on the actual problem spots and not your whole face. Using VERY little, is also another recommendation of mine. I think most people put it all over their face, and gave it a bad review. The 5% doesn&#x27;t bother me and I leave it on for a good minute for deep cleansing since my face never dries out badly. So I tried this and boy, I won&#x27;t use it much again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am actually scared to hangout with this girl because I have a swollen eye. It also ran up to the other eye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, with the 5%, it has a lot of application per use. With this, the hole is much smaller and it doesn&#x27;t come out as fast. Honestly, I think they did this because you don&#x27;t need a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum this up, it made my eye swollen! I&#x27;m glad it was only 3$ lol.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it, use a very small bead size and DO NOT rub it in for 20-30 seconds. Put it on, rub for 5 seconds, and wash it off without rubbing it in anymore. AVOID eye area! Avoid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to get rid of acne fast is to dry it up! I used something when I was younger and it dried ALL of my acne up overnight but dried my face terribly. So this should not be for the face. I think it would be a great body acne product, no lie! Put a junk load of this on your chest or back, and leave it on for 1 minute after rubbing it in for a minute lol. Your back and chest has a very thick skin and you would not irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> A face cleanser that requires concentrated dish soap and a scouring pad to remove is not a good face cleanser. It has one job, and it does the opposite.</li>
            <li> Do NOT use this!! First.. It was really really like... Hard and not so great feeling.. Then it had a really really cold sensation!! Then it turned my dace completely red... AND BURNED!?!! What in the actual oblivion?! I purchased this thinking my face was gonna feel better! Not be covered by a toxic acid!! On the bright side.. The black head scrub works.. Holy crap.. Ow.</li>
            <li> If you are used to the real product and you like it- don&#x27;t switch! I&#x27;ve used the Johnson &amp; Johnson brand for years, switched to Equate and within 2 days my face was pealing it was so dry. The product burns for about 10 minutes after applying. Nice try Walmart..... but not the same.</li>
            <li> I brought it at Walmart for 3.68$, on the bottle it says compare to clean &amp; clear(which I was using before). I did not havemoney to buy the clean &amp; clear tthat day and I thought this product will continue taking my acne off like my clean &amp; clear 5in 1cleanser. Oh man I was wrong, with the equate beauty my skin has more acne than ever before and it does not completely wash off. Its a waste of my money. Never will I purchase again. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> So I used it at my sisters house and it looked like it would work for my acne. I purchased a bottle and washed my face in the shower bad idea after 3 seconds it was burning I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all so I got out and my cheeks were pink and so was the skin around my chin. That was yesterday today I&#x27;m bright red.. I&#x27;m Hispanic so not even sunburns make me red. I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> This face wash is horrid. I needed a replacement to clean and clear so I bought this for 3 bucks at Walmart but it&#x27;s really not good. you can feel alcohol burning your face and it leaves a white film that is hard to come off completely unless you scrub your face. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product actually works i recomend. I am deff Going to use this brand from now on. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two days and thought I had finally found something to get rid of the three blind pimples I&#x27;d had due to hormonal acne. On the third day, I used it before picking my brother up from the train station (yesterday). By the time I got there, my face was itchy, burning, red, and had a gritty feel to it. Even my sister said I needed to wash my face again immediately when I got home after feeling my gritty skin. I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin and nothing has ever bothered it like this before. Today I still have all the symptoms. I&#x27;ve taken allergy medication, moisturized, and even put honey, milk, and jojoba oil on my face trying to make it stop. My sister spent hours yesterday trying to find natural remedies to fix it. Nothing works!&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and &amp;#34;keeps fighting acne even after you wash it off&amp;#34; means it doesn&#x27;t come off. It leaves a thin layer of white cream on your face which is nearly impossible to get off even with hot water. I washed it off three times and each time someone would ask me what was on my face. &amp;#34;Oh do you mean the white layer of face cream, or the red bumps all over it?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely won&#x27;t use again. Might TEST it on JUST my pimples, but definitely don&#x27;t put it on the rest of your face.</li>
            <li> After washing this product leaves fine later of whitish gray on skin, I suspect it is not for any therapeutic purposes , but rather a side effect of an inferior filling ingredient.</li>
            <li> This is the worst cleaner I&#x27;ve tried. I usually switch it up every time I need a new one. This one, like every other reviewer said, leaves a white film on your face. It is also extremely difficult to wash off. The worst part is burns! My eyelids feel like they&#x27;re falling off. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> do not buy this product. it leaves this terrible white film over your skin that cannot be washed off. you literally have to scrape it off with a loofa or pumice stone, and even then it doesn&#x27;t all come off.</li>
            <li> Although this product is very thick/pasty and takes more work to rinse off, it def has worked for myself and my teenage son with our acne. It even works better than proactive for us. I believe this has to do partially with that it does leave a tiny film on your face as it states (it keeps working even after washing off). But we just learned after the first washing to use a wash cloth EVERY time you wash your face to get it all off. And sometimes it leaves a little film on the sink basin but I&#x27;ll deal with these things because it helps our acne. I recently decided to try the name brand clean &amp; clear of this product and it&#x27;s much less pasty but we broke out so bad. So I went back to the generic and will never go back.</li>
            <li> I bought this today.. probably a bad idea. As soon as I applied it to my face, it gave me a fresh, kind of minty sensation. However, it got too fresh, to the point where it felt like it was burning. I tried rinsing it off really quickly, and I noticed it left a white film over my face. It was really hard to completely rinse off, I had to scrub real hard. And the burning lasted even after I had rinsed over and over. Please don&#x27;t buy, its just bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually TOTAL shit as a cleanser, like NO, DON&#x27;T USE IT AS A CLEANSER. You might be tempted to pick it up at Wal-Mart just because it&#x27;s so cheap, but it DOES NOT wash off your face. I used it as a cleanser and had to wash my face with another cleanser just to remove it, because it leaves this tacky residue on your face. BUT IT DOES WORK BY CONTROLLING ACNE. I do NOT recommend this for sensitive skin at all, my regimen is for people who have tougher skin and aren&#x27;t so sensitive, but might have acne prone skin. What I personally do is I wash my face with another cleanser, after I pat dry my face, I put a thin layer on my acne and just let it sit for hours. I&#x27;ve slept with it on my face before, I just put it on at night and for however long I stay up, I keep it on my face. Some people say it burns, but I think when you first apply it, you feel a cooling sensation, or at least I do. And then I just keep it on and since it&#x27;s so difficult to get off, I usually take a shower and wash it off there, and then I get out of the shower and wash my face normally again, just to get the rest off. The only reason this product is great and I will repurchase is because after you&#x27;ve left it on your face for so long, it completely gets rid of your acne or diminishes the size greatly. Definitely try it out on your skin, perhaps check on your wrist prior to applying it to your face to see how long you can leave it on. I have hyper pigmentation, so all that remains on my skin are my marks after I do my regimen. I think this would be a great spot treatment or just a mask. I don&#x27;t recommend doing this often though, because once I did it two consecutive days, but ALL over my face, and the third day, my skin was SUPER dry in some spots. But, I have oily skin to begin with, so it wasn&#x27;t THAT dry, just dryer than usual. So if you have dry skin, I&#x27;d be careful, because it could further dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walmart, and I can&#x27;t use it because it leaves a waxy white residue after rinsing (possibly due to the mineral oil in the cleanser? I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not a scientists...). It makes my face very red also, but some of that might be because I had to use a wet towel to rub the cleanser off after I rinsed, followed by a cotton ball with toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!</li>
            <li> do not get this!!! its leaves a disgusting film on your face and as others have said it is nearly impossible to get off, when you rinse the face wash off it never comes off, it just sticks to your face. plus there is this over powering cool mint feel on your face witch makes my eyes water some times. I have use the whole bottle though, and it did NOT clear my acne as much as others did. I will never get this ever again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used clean and clear for a few years now and while looking for a cheaper alternative I decided to try this. The other reviews are correct in that it leaves a residue on your skin. I only use about a 1.5 centimeter ribbon and wash if off but it still leaves a layer of &amp;#34;gross&amp;#34; on my skin. I&#x27;ve also noticed that it tends to make my skin peel a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;The product is pretty strong. I used it once a day for a continuous week and it completely dried my face out to the point where my skin hurt. In my opinion, The &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; some people have mentioned happens with Clean and Clear&#x27;s product as well if it is left on too long.</li>
            <li> This product is awful - do not buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I use the name brand version of this - Clean &amp; Clear Continuous Control face wash &amp; I love it... I bought this generic version of it thinking it would be the same and I could save myself some money - IT IS NOT THE SAME! The consistency of the cream is not the same - it does not look, feel or smell at all like the name brand product and the worst part is that IT DOES NOT COME OFF! I washed my face with it and then when I rinsed it off it left this awful oily film behind. I ran my fingernails lightly down my face and got TONS of nasty white residue under my nails - my whole face was covered in it! You do not feel clean - your face feels oily and gross and it is very hard to get off!&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money on this product. Pay the extra money to get the name brand version - it is a MUCH better product!</li>
            <li> This product made my face feel cold a few minutes afterwards. Then my face turned bright red and got HOT! Only used it once and it&#x27;s going back tomorrow. My face did NOT like this product!</li>
            <li> One of the worst purchases I have ever made. I seriously wonder if this product is defective. As other reviewers have mentioned, it leaves a white residue that is incredibly difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute worst acne product ever. I saw it had 10% benzoyl peroxide and thought I would try it. I should have thrown it away before I left Walmart. The first time I used it I tried it over the sink. It was like smearing grease all over my face. it does not lather at all and feels like it&#x27;s doing nothing except burning off your face and eyes. I didn&#x27;t get it in my eyes and they burnt BAD for almost an hour to the point that I could not open them without squinting badly. I do not have sensitive skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I tried it was in the shower. Same thing. Like smearing grease all over my face, felt like it was doing nothing to clean my face, burnt, but I kept washing, and washing, and washing....for several minutes under the water and when I got out and looked in the mirror there STILL was a white film on my face. I had to scrub it off with a damp towel and it still felt like there was residue on my face. I threw it directly into the trash where it belongs at that point. NEVER AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I used a dime sized amount this morning at 8AM. It is now almost 7PM and my face is STILL burning. I feel like I will wake up tomorrow to peeling skin, it is that bad. I have never had this reaction from product before.</li>
