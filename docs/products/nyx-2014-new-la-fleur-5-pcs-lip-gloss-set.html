            <li> Not thrilled. All colors except two look &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;. Love the nude color and blush but the others look horrible. Also very sticky and doesn&#x27;t last long. You would get more for your money just going to Sephora.</li>
            <li> I have made a group of friends that all work at my favorite restaurant and wanted to give them each a little something for Christmas.  I bought this pkg. and individually wrapped each tube and tied a small bow on it.  All the colors are pretty neutral so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about someone not liking the color they got.  The girls tell me they keep them in their pockets at work and apply whenever they need to.  I kept the 5th one myself and have been using it.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Love nyx and these are awesome glosses love the colors and the way they feel.</li>
            <li> A nice little set to supplement a larger kit for a little girl !</li>
            <li> Shouldve just rubbed jelly all over my lips if i wanted them to be sticky oh wait the jelly is actaully more pigmented then these garbage lipglosses</li>
            <li> Not so satisfied. You get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a xmas gift for my very picky sister in law. She said she loves them!</li>
