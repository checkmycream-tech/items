            <li>It also helps with getting rid of pimples more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Better than &amp;#34;Face Doctor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have been using this soap for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>He is looking better than ever, I will update in a couple weeks to let ya&#x27;ll know if it&#x27;s still working.</li>
            <li>This should work even better on those who have already gone thru puberty....</li>
            <li>It is mild, has a nice scent, and isn&#x27;t drying or oily.</li>
            <li>I used AcneFree Severe treatment, and it worked really great because it got rid of my acne completely.</li>
            <li>Smells good, works very well, and washes off easily without any residue like soap.</li>
            <li>and the delivery was just fine</li>
            <li>Great deal, especially since my husband burns through this!</li>
            <li>It provides effective yet gentle cleansing for skin and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not this product, within 1 week the forehead was 80% clearer(He primarily has forehead acne)</li>
            <li>Liked that they are the real deal.  </li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned this is the best facial soap available.  </li>
            <li>but my face feels clean.</li>
            <li>Regimin : he uses this soap morning and night, and dries with clean towel every time.</li>
            <li>Better than products costing 5 times as much.  </li>
            <li>gentle cleansing- Hypo-allergenic formula won&#x27;t over-dry while it gently and effectively cleanses away excess oil from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and would definitely order again.</li>
            <li>, I bought this amazing soap, and my acne hasn&#x27;t come back on my face again.</li>
            <li>It seems to help, and I rarely get zits.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t find anything else that feels right.</li>
            <li>The ability of this soap for removing the acne is not bad and the size is small but the smell is good.</li>
            <li>Rinses completely, leaving skin free of residue which can interfere with the effectiveness of acne medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now onto 2nd week and looking better than ever.</li>
            <li>So far, I would highly recommend you try this!!!!  </li>
            <li>I saved a lot of $$ thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li>I still get very oily within an hour, but the soap helps in reducing the amount of acne.  </li>
            <li>It cuts through grime and residual sunscreen really well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Neutrogena face soap!</li>
            <li>Moreover, I must say that I&#x27;d bought this soap a lot of times before, but it never worked because I only washed my face quickly like less than 30 seconds, but now I&#x27;m using it for 2 minutes, and that has much and BETTER results</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the more expensive types cleansers I have tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like creams and pads because I need to take time out from the normal course of my day to apply them.</li>
            <li>I have used neutrogena soap since my 20&#x27;s and it helped me tremendously with minor outbreaks.</li>
            <li>A clean unlike after any other type of cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have had acne since I was 15 years old.</li>
            <li>I suppose if it means I&#x27;m still young.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve also listed ingredient in case you have any known allergies as well as 800 number for questions to can directly ask Neutrogena):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Break</li>
            <li>my whole life and this actually works.  </li>
            <li>and the doctor tells me I have [OLD FART] SENILE ANCE</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses this facial bar for cleaning our faces.</li>
            <li>I used this soap as a young person, and now my kids use it, too.</li>
            <li>There is barely any other soap on the market that rinses as cleanly.</li>
            <li>It can completely clean your face in 1 day or maybe even in a few hours.</li>
            <li>I then wash it right off, and the only remnant is perhaps a slightly dry feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>After the acne was replaced by swaggering overconfidence, I found that any other soap, including Neutrogena&#x27;s regular translucent soap, just didn&#x27;t feel right on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t so bad either, imagine a pleasant smelling old-school Listerine plus vanilla.</li>

            <li> only issue I have is if you don&#x27;t keep it in a dry place it basically melts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands trying to save a buck but in the end I always go back to Neutregena.</li>
            <li> One thing though:  If you have dry skin, you might want to apply a non-comedogenic cream just to keep you skin from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really does help keep the skin -- at least ours!</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> are the advantages of using this soap over other acne treatments like cream or pads?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this soap from Amazon but felt compelled to write a review to help other acne sufferers.</li>
            <li> The hyper pigmentation is still there but active acne is down 90% now.</li>
            <li> There is a slight medicine smell to it</li>
            <li> Sometimes it drys my skin a little bit in the winter</li>
            <li> I started using it in the early 80&#x27;s as an insecure, pimply-faced teenager.</li>
            <li> I was actually scared to have him use it for fear it would make it worse, because everything seemed to.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this in the stores but decided to check out Amazon.</li>
            <li> Sometimes difficult to find the acne-prone version in local drugstores/supermarkets, so I purchase a bunch online from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Although I am 50 years old, I still have trouble with acne which isn&#x27;t all bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactive which sadly didn&#x27;t work, and other things.</li>
            <li> No more icky soap residue on your feet, ankles, where-ever!</li>
            <li> It is not just soap, It is impossible to express what it actually is.   </li>
            <li> My son has had some acne since last April(2014) it progressively got worse over the summer and this fall with school and sports, it exploded!!!</li>
            <li> We bought some items off Amazon, that seemed to work for a couple days and then boom, worse than ever.</li>
            <li> Salycilic acid in some made everything worse.</li>
            <li> Of course, since I still get pimples, it&#x27;s not a perfect treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no good!!   </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> so he is in the worst (acne) stage of his life.</li>

            <li> I have had acne since I was 15 years old. Now I&#x27;m 21 and still have some acne. I&#x27;ve tried Proactive which sadly didn&#x27;t work, and other things. I used AcneFree Severe treatment, and it worked really great because it got rid of my acne completely. However, months later I ran out of my AcneFree treatment, and I couldn&#x27;t buy another one any sooner, so I had to buy something else, I bought this amazing soap, and my acne hasn&#x27;t come back on my face again. IT&#x27;S AMAZING!!!! Moreover, I must say that I&#x27;d bought this soap a lot of times before, but it never worked because I only washed my face quickly like less than 30 seconds, but now I&#x27;m using it for 2 minutes, and that has much and BETTER results, it&#x27;s like basically having the treatment again.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this in the stores but decided to check out Amazon. I&#x27;m glad I did - I saved a lot of $$ thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Clean rinsing and good for acne prone skin. Used it for years.</li>
            <li> Been using this product since I was a teenager and it has always worked for me.  I have extremely oily skin and acne prone skin.  Still do.  However, this soap cleans my skin well.  I still get very oily within an hour, but the soap helps in reducing the amount of acne.  I use this with bp.</li>
            <li> Great deal, especially since my husband burns through this! They arrived fast and were in great condition. Will definitely reorder this bundle again!</li>
            <li> Although I am 50 years old, I still have trouble with acne which isn&#x27;t all bad I suppose if it means I&#x27;m still young. Anyway, in an attempt to escape the scourge of pimples, I have decided to use Neutrogena&#x27;s \\&quot;transparent facial bars\\&quot; which is a fancy way of saying \\&quot;acne soap.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the advantages of using this soap over other acne treatments like cream or pads? I like the fact that I can apply this soap to my face whenever I shower. I then wash it right off, and the only remnant is perhaps a slightly dry feeling on my face. I don&#x27;t like creams and pads because I need to take time out from the normal course of my day to apply them. Cream also can remain visible for awhile after it&#x27;s applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How effective is this soap? It seems to help, and I rarely get zits. Of course, since I still get pimples, it&#x27;s not a perfect treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will this soap help you with your acne? I&#x27;d recommend you try it. It&#x27;s a fairly easy way to apply treatment, and it can be effective in reducing pimples. Don&#x27;t expect it to eliminate acne, though.</li>
            <li> I guess I owe Neutrogena a shout-out for this product. I started using it in the early 80&#x27;s as an insecure, pimply-faced teenager. After the acne was replaced by swaggering overconfidence, I found that any other soap, including Neutrogena&#x27;s regular translucent soap, just didn&#x27;t feel right on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m a doddering 48 year-old... I still can&#x27;t find anything else that feels right. It rinses completely, leaves you feeling squeaky clean, and doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell. Never stop making this, Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> It is not just soap, It is impossible to express what it actually is.   It can completely clean your face in 1 day or maybe even in a few hours. It has unbealiveble effect on my face. I have never seen anything like this.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need acne to want to use Neutrogena soap. There is barely any other soap on the market that rinses as cleanly. No more icky soap residue on your feet, ankles, where-ever! The smell isn&#x27;t so bad either, imagine a pleasant smelling old-school Listerine plus vanilla.</li>
            <li> and the delivery was just fine</li>
            <li> This has been the most effective soap I have ever used. It was more effective than my perscribed acne medication. Sometimes it drys my skin a little bit in the winter but my face feels clean. A clean unlike after any other type of cleanser. I like it much better than the more expensive types cleansers I have tried. I am glad I tried it and I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, lo recomiendo 100%. / Excellent product, I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s happened.  My baby girl is growing up.  We have found that this soap is amazing when it comes to taming oily skin.  It also helps with getting rid of pimples more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually started using it after I come in from gardening.  It cuts through grime and residual sunscreen really well.  One thing though:  If you have dry skin, you might want to apply a non-comedogenic cream just to keep you skin from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what it says on the back of the box (I&#x27;ve also listed ingredient in case you have any known allergies as well as 800 number for questions to can directly ask Neutrogena):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Break the Breakout Cycle&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Cleansing Bar, Acne-Prone Skin Formula is recommended by dermatologists.  It provides effective yet gentle cleansing for skin and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pure, gentle cleansing- Hypo-allergenic formula won&#x27;t over-dry while it gently and effectively cleanses away excess oil from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Superior rinsability- Rinses completely, leaving skin free of residue which can interfere with the effectiveness of acne medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Won&#x27;t clog pores- Clinically tested to be non-comedogenic, so it won&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine, TEA Stearate, Sodium Tallowate, Glycerin, TEA-Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Cocoate, Water, Sodium Ricinoleate, Sodium Oleate, Cetyl Acetate, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Stearate, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, Trisodium HEDTA, Fragrance (1347-018)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, you can call Neutrogena at 1-800-582-4048 (USA only).</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned this is the best facial soap available.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and wouldn&#x27;t think of changing brands.  It is the only soap I use.  I highly recommend Neutrogena face soap!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve struggled with problem skin (I&#x27;m in my 30s) my whole life and this actually works.  There is a slight medicine smell to it but it&#x27;s not that bad. only issue I have is if you don&#x27;t keep it in a dry place it basically melts.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best face soap. I&#x27;ve tried several other brands trying to save a buck but in the end I always go back to Neutregena.</li>
            <li> GREAT! soap I have had acne ALL my life 58years and the doctor tells me I have [OLD FART] SENILE ANCE I guess they named it  just for me. I feel great after using it .  RUSS</li>
            <li> Great deal on this classic face bar!</li>
            <li> Good product delivered on time</li>
            <li> todo bien el envio , la entrega , la calidad , el servicio etc . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Better than products costing 5 times as much.  Better than &amp;#34;Face Doctor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is one of Neutrogena&#x27;s best products; it does a marvelous job on oily skin and can be used once or twice a day without leaving your skin overly dry. I have been using it for over 5 years with sucess. There is nothing else quite like it.</li>
            <li> Our whole family uses this facial bar for cleaning our faces. It is mild, has a nice scent, and isn&#x27;t drying or oily. Sometimes difficult to find the acne-prone version in local drugstores/supermarkets, so I purchase a bunch online from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years and love it.  All indications are that they are discontinuing it so I stocked up enough to last several years.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this soap from Amazon but felt compelled to write a review to help other acne sufferers. My son has had some acne since last April(2014) it progressively got worse over the summer and this fall with school and sports, it exploded!!! I cannot tell the amount of products we have tried on him and NOTHING worked. We bought some items off Amazon, that seemed to work for a couple days and then boom, worse than ever. Salycilic acid in some made everything worse. It&#x27;s no good!!   Well,  I was at my local grocery store and came across this item. I have used neutrogena soap since my 20&#x27;s and it helped me tremendously with minor outbreaks. I swear by it, so I decided to give acne prone neutrogena a try for my son. I was actually scared to have him use it for fear it would make it worse, because everything seemed to. Not this product, within 1 week the forehead was 80% clearer(He primarily has forehead acne) all the pimples were coming to a head, quickly too!! Now onto 2nd week and looking better than ever. The hyper pigmentation is still there but active acne is down 90% now. This is the best results we have had with ANY product.  Regimin : he uses this soap morning and night, and dries with clean towel every time. After that, he dabs 100% tea tree oil on pimples after the nighttime wash. A couple cysts that were under skin got a dab of diluted apple cider vinegar too and came to head overnight. He is looking better than ever, I will update in a couple weeks to let ya&#x27;ll know if it&#x27;s still working. There is finally a bit of hope with this soap. So far, I would highly recommend you try this!!!!  Btw- son is age 14, almost 15 so he is in the worst (acne) stage of his life. This should work even better on those who have already gone thru puberty....</li>
            <li> The ability of this soap for removing the acne is not bad and the size is small but the smell is good.</li>
            <li> I used this soap as a young person, and now my kids use it, too. Really does help keep the skin -- at least ours!</li>
            <li> Liked that they are the real deal.  It&#x27;s easy to stock up and have a good supply.  Amazon saves you money and time by not having to chase around stores.  Very satisfied and would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Smells good, works very well, and washes off easily without any residue like soap. No irritation either. I&#x27;ve used many and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Great way better than paying for it at the store :)</li>
