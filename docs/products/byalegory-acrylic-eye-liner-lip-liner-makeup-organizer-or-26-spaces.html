            <li>I will be buying more of these to hold my makeup.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than having my lipliners laying in a drawer somewhere.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>So much better than the cheap plastic ones!  </li>
            <li>This gets the job done, and I appreciate the two sizes, but three sizes would help even more of my pencil products fit nicely.</li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>I got 2 and will buy 2 more.</li>

            <li>Good quality and fast shipment!</li>
            <li>very cool for organizing your lipliners</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Since I bought this, I&#x27;m able to see them all at the same time (easier to chose from a selection I can see), can easily keep up with them</li>
            <li>Very chic and useful for keeping eyeliners and jumbo lip crayon pencils organized and easy to access.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s not made out of cheap, thin material.</li>
            <li>I bought several of the acrylic organizers and love them all.</li>
            <li>top row fits the standard lipliners (like MAC liners) bottom row fits fat lipliners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first I thought that the price was pretty steep</li>
            <li>Most of my eyeliners fit on there except for the little ink eyeliner bottle.</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Everything i expected &amp; more</li>
            <li>These little organizers allow me to keep the inside of my draws very neat and easy access to make that I want.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several cosmetic organizers from byAlegory and have been pleased with every single one of them.  </li>
            <li>Does not feel like cheap plastic like other products.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with the first row they are for bigger pencils I guess</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s also has a slightly smaller foot print that I imagined, which is also a bonus as I have very limited space.</li>

            <li> but I feel it was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Fits all my eyeliners and small mascaras neatly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small</li>
            <li> have it in the bathroom and it hasn&#x27;t clouded over from the steam and the one time I accidentally dropped it (HARD!)</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I wish some of the ones in back were just a tiny bit wider so my Lights, Camera, Lashes liquid liner pen would work, but otherwise, this works fantastically. I can see the colors of my eyeliner and even pick out the brand without shuffling through a door. It&#x27;s also has a slightly smaller foot print that I imagined, which is also a bonus as I have very limited space.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy me another one</li>
            <li> Love it amaizing product..it hold my eyeliners and lipliner perfect..5 star product</li>
            <li> Fits all my eyeliners and small mascaras neatly</li>
            <li> Love this organizer. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> very cool for organizing your lipliners</li>
            <li> Fits great in my new make up 5 draw stand that I bought from IKEA to better organize my make up and hats and scarfs.

            <li> Works great! Great quality</li>
            <li> LOVE This!!! Perfect for make-up organizing. So glad i got it and i highly recommend it! Does not feel like cheap plastic like other products. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how heavy this was but it&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s not made out of cheap, thin material. I&#x27;m in love with it and it looks great on my dresser. Most of my eyeliners fit on there except for the little ink eyeliner bottle. I will be buying more of these to hold my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 2 weeks and I&#x27;m wondering why I didn&#x27;t get this sooner! This is so much better than having my lipliners laying in a drawer somewhere. Since I bought this, I&#x27;m able to see them all at the same time (easier to chose from a selection I can see), can easily keep up with them and I now see them so often that I probably won&#x27;t accidentally buying them over again.&lt;br /&gt;The top row fits the standard lipliners (like MAC liners) bottom row fits fat lipliners.&lt;br /&gt;I have it in the bathroom and it hasn&#x27;t clouded over from the steam and the one time I accidentally dropped it (HARD!) it didn&#x27;t even crack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought that the price was pretty steep but now I&#x27;m glad I got it. It was definitely worth the money! HTH!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several cosmetic organizers from byAlegory and have been pleased with every single one of them.  The acrylic is a great quality and has a good weight so as not to be knocked over easily.  I bought one of these for my eyeliners and will purchase another for my lipliners.  So much better than the cheap plastic ones!  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Very good investment! I&#x27;m in love! I love their products! Good quality and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Another great quality product from Alegory.  Very chic and useful for keeping eyeliners and jumbo lip crayon pencils organized and easy to access.</li>
            <li> Everything i expected &amp; more</li>
            <li> This is a nice organizer for pencils. Works well and is sturdy. A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> Great product, great quality.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done, and I appreciate the two sizes, but three sizes would help even more of my pencil products fit nicely. Also holds twist-up lip primers by MAC and ColorPop. Stays put and never falls over.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my collection of eyeliners!</li>
            <li> ByAlegory is now my Go-To brand for organizing my vanity. Their acrylic organizers are sturdy, glass-like in appearance, and accommodate a multitude of brands.</li>
            <li> I love the product but I feel it was a little pricey. It&#x27;s very small but then again it&#x27;s for pencils so if you don&#x27;t mind the price then go for it. It&#x27;s good quality. I have a problem with the first row they are for bigger pencils I guess but I don&#x27;t own any so I guess it would be for the jumbo liners.</li>
            <li> Great quality!!  I agree it&#x27;s expensive, but to me worth the money.  It gets the job done!! I got 2 and will buy 2 more.</li>
