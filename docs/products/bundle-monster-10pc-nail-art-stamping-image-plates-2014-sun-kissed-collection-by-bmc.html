            <li>I am excited to try these.</li>
            <li>These are unique and fun designs for the summer, vacations, or Shark Week!</li>
            <li>, this is my first purchase from Bundle Monster nail art template and I am glad that I did it.  </li>
            <li>The quality is fantastic and the shipping was super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cool &amp; unique for any time of year here.</li>
            <li>I have other stamping plates that work great, but these just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida &amp; love all things nautical</li>
            <li>Bundle Monster is my favorite brand of stamping plates thus far.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>There are a couple detailed designs that are really hard to clean out and stamp with and the plates get scratched easily if they are not stored properly, but most of the stamps work well and are cute designs.</li>
            <li>These are super cute but most of the images aren&#x27;t cut deep enough.</li>
            <li>and I most likely won&#x27;t do it again</li>
            <li>This was my first set of stamping plates I purchased when I became interested in nail stamping</li>
            <li>The designs transferred beautifully &amp; I have nothing negative to say!</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, fast shipping as described.</li>
            <li>I tried extra thick polish, and the best I ever got after trying for a good half an hour was a half a jellyfish.</li>
            <li>Many of the plates are not etched deep enough and the pattern does not transfer</li>
            <li>The full nail designs will only cover smaller nails, but I&#x27;ll work with it like it is because I like it so much!</li>
            <li>How fun this is takes practice but worth the time saver when you get it down packed</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchased them directly from Bundle Monster.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-patterns are not easily transferable; when I use my stamper, only partial pattern gets stamped even though I used Konad stamping polish and a really good scraper.&lt;br</li>

            <li> If you are just starting out, buy a single plate to test it out, then commit to this larger bundle.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure you are either a mermaid or a surfer girl because they are all sea/beach themed and can get boring quickly if you like a bunch of variety.</li>
            <li> I could only get a few pictures to turn out well for me</li>
            <li> Will update when I have tested the other images.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed this didn&#x27;t work because the designs were adorable, but I have no choice now but to return it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is one of the plates doesn&#x27;t transfer the images.</li>
            <li> Usually get 20 plates for $15-$18.</li>
            <li> so getting 10 for $10 was a little expensive for me</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> (too bad that I order it waaay to late and now its October 2014, fall season)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad batch or if they are all that way.</li>
            <li> so I was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This was my first set of stamping plates I purchased when I became interested in nail stamping &amp; it did not disappoint! Bundle Monster is my favorite brand of stamping plates thus far. This sun kissed collection is so cute, I love all the designs. I live in Florida &amp; love all things nautical so it was perfection in my opinion. Cool &amp; unique for any time of year here. The designs transferred beautifully &amp; I have nothing negative to say! If you&#x27;re looking for nautical themed plates, this is a great collection to own!</li>
            <li> All images work perfectly! Super excited!</li>

            <li> There are a couple detailed designs that are really hard to clean out and stamp with and the plates get scratched easily if they are not stored properly, but most of the stamps work well and are cute designs. I would recommend this only to people who are planning on stamping a lot. If you are just starting out, buy a single plate to test it out, then commit to this larger bundle. Also, make sure you are either a mermaid or a surfer girl because they are all sea/beach themed and can get boring quickly if you like a bunch of variety.</li>
            <li> Very nice images, they came in good condition and they stamp well.</li>
            <li> I got this because when I saw it I knew that I had to have it, this is my first purchase from Bundle Monster nail art template and I am glad that I did it.  It&#x27;s a really beautiful well designed and I can not wait to use it next summer (too bad that I order it waaay to late and now its October 2014, fall season) however I can not wait to use it and create many beautiful summer manicures on my nails. This is a must have, Ocean and Nature theme never goes out of style. &#x3D;)</li>
