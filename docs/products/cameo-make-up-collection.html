            <li>The make up is nice quality.  </li>
            <li>Sister loved opening this for Christmas, very pleased and was thrilled to get this huge amount of cameo make up.</li>
            <li>On Christmas day, we did play a bit with it on her eyelids and the color was lovely and went on nice.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my 13 year old.  </li>
            <li>My grandaughter was so happy with this make kit, came in a great zebra print case and had everything a teenage girl would want.</li>
            <li>it is a good variety of colors and is great for my 16 year old to start experimenting with makeup.</li>
            <li>love that it has a  magnetic clasp....</li>
            <li>I bought this for my teenage daughter, I reviewed a lot and this is definately the best deal.</li>
            <li>I think she will love it.</li>
            <li>I really love the colors and pigmented.</li>
            <li>I specially love the zebra pattern cover.</li>
            <li>I will sure take it with me when we travel, has everything I need.</li>
            <li>I really love this and would buy this every time i love how it has glitter to make my eyes pop and has many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>You can take on the go as well! :)</li>
            <li>If you want more color, spritz your application tool with a bit of water to pick up more of that pigment and layer the color on.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with these blush colors.</li>
            <li>when she got it she says she love it&lt;</li>
            <li>the on time delivery make it even better</li>
            <li>The lip brilliances and blushers are okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought better make up at Forever 21.</li>
            <li>She loved it and started using it right away.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing kit LOVE it worth every penny.</li>
            <li>other then that its great!</li>
            <li>so i just re glued it its fine</li>
            <li>This little kit packs an impressive array of color!!</li>
            <li>fortunately, i remove it..</li>
            <li>The two brown/bronz-y colors are perfect for blending out my contour lines, and the 4 pink colors are all completely different and look fantastic on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give this a fair review because it was a gift to my 10 year old niece.</li>
            <li>Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
            <li>This kit is great to take with me when I&#x27;m doing makeup on other people, and for myself.</li>
            <li>Some of the eyeshadows may not be super pigmented, but kits like this are meant to have build-able color</li>
            <li>My teenage Granddaughter was thrilled.</li>
            <li>Came right on time.  </li>
            <li>Its a little bit smaller but for the price is perfect!!</li>
            <li>It folds up and it is pretty small so great</li>
            <li>I was worried at first from all the reviews...but.</li>
            <li>The kit is exactly as portrayed here.</li>
            <li>favorite part are the 6 different blush colors that come in it.</li>
            <li>Everything you need for on the go make up applications, or great for those who may want something small but substantial without taking up space!</li>
            <li>The makeup came in super early, brand new and NONE of the makeup got ruined at all!</li>
            <li>This shipped fast and seems to be a reasonable product for the price .</li>
            <li>very resistant</li>
            <li>/&gt;she doesn&#x27;t use much make up</li>
            <li>She absolutely LOVES it</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>It did fit what i expected.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, and in amazing condition, minus one eye shadow that was loose.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m new to the makeup scene I&#x27;m only giving 5 on the looks, but if I have to revise anything when I get it</li>
            <li>Actually this product looks completely different in real when compared to pictures..</li>
            <li>The body glitters stayed on really well all through my night of hard partying, and the lipgloss colors are really pretty too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> She is a pre-teen and it is hard to know what to buy for her.</li>
            <li> but i have one complaint one part of the kit came of the card board</li>

            <li> It was broken when I received so</li>
            <li> My sister went crazy for this.</li>
            <li> and i just stick it back...not bad quality..</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that the eyeshadows are not pigmented at all!!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> I ordered this makeup kit for a Christmas gift for my daughter in law. When I got it in the mail, I liked it so well I ordered another one for myself. The kit is exactly as portrayed here. The sides lift out to show all the trays. There are a lot of color options in the trays. The makeup is moist and attractive. It seems like a really nice makeup kit.</li>
            <li> When I opened it.. I find it hard to open cuz the blusher got stuck inside.. i have to remove the blusher inside just to open it.. fortunately, i remove it.. and i just stick it back...not bad quality.. its nice!</li>
            <li> Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
            <li> we bought this for my daughters friend and she loved it. she is a little make up goo roo and can&#x27;t get enough of this product</li>
            <li> This kit is great to take with me when I&#x27;m doing makeup on other people, and for myself. Some of the eyeshadows may not be super pigmented, but kits like this are meant to have build-able color so you an achieve millions of different looks. If you want more color, spritz your application tool with a bit of water to pick up more of that pigment and layer the color on. The body glitters stayed on really well all through my night of hard partying, and the lipgloss colors are really pretty too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part are the 6 different blush colors that come in it. They are SO gorgeous. The two brown/bronz-y colors are perfect for blending out my contour lines, and the 4 pink colors are all completely different and look fantastic on my fair skin. I am so in love with these blush colors.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, and in amazing condition, minus one eye shadow that was loose. But with everything else I liked about it, I dont mind. It is a really good purchase and you definitely get what you buy.</li>
            <li> very nice and beautifull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good material...&lt;br /&gt;and very resistant&lt;br /&gt;beautiful colors&lt;br /&gt;of course that i&#x27;ll recommend to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It a nice gift</li>
            <li> Excellent... super like like like lol..</li>
            <li> the girlfriend loved it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she doesn&#x27;t use much make up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but she likes options</li>
            <li> Even thought each color is small it is a good variety of colors and is great for my 16 year old to start experimenting with makeup.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m new to the makeup scene I&#x27;m only giving 5 on the looks, but if I have to revise anything when I get it I will repost if I can giving my actual rating</li>
            <li> Wow!! This little kit packs an impressive array of color!! Everything you need for on the go make up applications, or great for those who may want something small but substantial without taking up space! Purchased for my daughter for Christmas- she LOVES it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give this a fair review because it was a gift to my 10 year old niece. She absolutely LOVES it but she is 10. On Christmas day, we did play a bit with it on her eyelids and the color was lovely and went on nice. I have not used it on my face which is why I can&#x27;t give a fair review.</li>
            <li> Sister loved opening this for Christmas, very pleased and was thrilled to get this huge amount of cameo make up.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter for her birthday and she loved it! great variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I just received my kit and i loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I got it way before the date it was supposed to be delivery and it is great! I loved the colors and the zebra case!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter after she researched it and picked it out.  She hasn&#x27;t been disappointed.  Lots of colors to choose from.  The make up is nice quality.  Came right on time.  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> my wife like it when we order it&lt;br /&gt;but when she got it she says she love it&lt;br /&gt;i will recomed it&lt;br /&gt;and the on time delivery make it even better</li>
            <li> I loved playing with all the beautiful colors.  The eye shadows are soft and powdery (sometimes the eye shadows in sets like these are very hard pressed and difficult to work with).  I was going on a trip and this had everything I needed in it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 13 year old.  It gives her a lot of options to practice putting on make up.</li>
            <li> Awesome....bought this for my daughter&#x27;s 13th birthday.  She loves it.  Lots of colors to experiment with.  Great for a starter...</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY IT! I&#x27;m very disappointed that the eyeshadows are not pigmented at all!!!!!!!!!! The lip brilliances and blushers are okay.</li>
            <li> it is a beatiful item. It did fit what i expected. I recommend you without problems</li>
            <li> Eyeshadows are poor quality, powder is loose, color doesn&#x27;t stick unless applied multiple times. I&#x27;ve bought better make up at Forever 21.</li>
            <li> The kit is really awesome, the product has really good quality, the size it&#x27;s perfect for a traveler woman.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was one day before that I expected.</li>
            <li> i just got this and i like everthing but i have one complaint one part of the kit came of the card board so it was unglued so i just re glued it its fine but i just need to be careful with it. so please package it better! other then that its great! lots of colors! and a good seliction!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my niece and she loves it.</li>
            <li> My teenage Granddaughter was thrilled.</li>
            <li> My sister went crazy for this. The makeup came in super early, brand new and NONE of the makeup got ruined at all! Loved it</li>
