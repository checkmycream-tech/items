            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>MY SUNTAN LASTS FOR A PRETTY GOOD LENGTH OF TIME.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid sailor and I have fair skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always want to smell of coconut due to insects in the yard or because a best friend can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems worth mentioning, so far so good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was in) was full of lotion.</li>

            <li>this goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering perfume odor.</li>
            <li>AND IT LEAVES YOUR SKIN SMOOTH</li>
            <li>Great product I use daily</li>
            <li>After Sun Lotion is among the very best few.</li>
            <li>If they&#x27;re not the same stuff, then it may be something about how &amp;#34;After Sun&amp;#34; lotions are made which creates a great hand &amp; body lotion.</li>
            <li>It is a light weight cream that keeps your skin moist.</li>
            <li>Thought with the aloe it would have a more clean fresh moisturizing feeling.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find in winter months, so glad to find it at a good price and easy to get!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was hard wrenching me from a product I loved, but I am very satisfied with \\&quot;Banana Boat.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It has healthy skin ingredients and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>My husband and step-daughter love it as much as me</li>
            <li>this can bring me out of a mild sunburn over night.</li>
            <li>Really good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The coconut oil gotta say is totally awesome and made the dry bumps on my arms as long as I can remember, disappear and makes my feet soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling light with a touch of natural shine..</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>First, you may want to consider saving some money and buy the 4-pack (listed separately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it, the only lotion I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li>Thanks Banana Boat!</li>
            <li>Most of my body did not peel, but my back did.&lt;br /&gt;However, once I tried this lotion, I never stopped using it.</li>
            <li>It is thick, non-greasy, soaks in quickly, and keeps the skin feeling good for hours.</li>
            <li>and i loved it so much i use it year round.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, use it on a daily basis, it is not greasy and really helps after you are in the sun or tanning bed to bring out your color.  </li>
            <li>Banana Boat is the best dry skin lotion for overall use I have found for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is enough aloe in the lotion to really make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It works well and is very comforting to use.</li>
            <li>This product works very well after a day in the sun.  </li>
            <li>and it really feels &amp;#34;still</li>
            <li>The whole household uses it.</li>
            <li>so I lost much of the lotion.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion in the whole wide beachy world.  </li>
            <li>I live on the beach and have already gotten pretty burnt since the Summer season started..</li>
            <li>Worked like a charm - better than other&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It was all in all ok, but nothing any other drug store lotion wouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>In winter or as an extra deep penetrating healing/calming step do the coconut oil at night:) it even clears face redness and diaper rash fast like lightning.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay, little heavier than my liking.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been also using it as my normal body lotion this summer.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>Because the pump bottle is not travel safe, I use a small travelsize container to carry this lotion with me in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I like the clear bottle because you can see when you are almost out</li>
            <li>So I settled for this product and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>, our six year old feels like the cream itself burns.</li>
            <li>Works good a little thick though</li>
            <li>If you live in Florida and like going to the beach regularly, then this product is for you!</li>
            <li>Be careful not to apply too much at once..</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite lotion - goes on a bit thick, which for dry skin, I need.</li>

            <li> This is my all-time favorite lotion - goes on a bit thick, which for dry skin, I need.</li>
            <li> I am 48 years old and never had dry flakey skin (or the build up of such I notice on other women&#x27;s feet much younger than I am).  </li>
            <li> on&amp;#34; through at least 8 hours (today) afterward of hand-washing and hot outdoor party attendance.</li>
            <li> Actually don&#x27;t use it for after-sunning, but for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying this lotion as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I apply the lotion every few hours for the first few days after a burn, and</li>
            <li> have dry skin, and have tried hundreds of creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> For some reason I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it locally.</li>
            <li> We order a case of this lotion and we still have a few bottles left.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a source for it in a few years now, and didn&#x27;t think to compare labels back when I had both at once.</li>
            <li> I use it as my daily hand, body and foot lotion all year round, not just sun season.  </li>
            <li> Actually works all year round.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll leave you looking like a polar bear!</li>

            <li> He typically doesn&#x27;t use lotion for any reason, so if this is the one that will get him to use some, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lotion was little leaked from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this lotion to go on a little smoother.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This also leaked &amp; some bottles were open, the box was soggy, and some of them I cannot give away, because they look like they have been used.</li>
            <li> Lotion was little leaked from the bottle. Otherwise, ok.</li>
            <li> I have used \\&quot;South Beach After Tan\\&quot; for years and simply could not find it! So I settled for this product and I was pleasantly surprised. It works well and is very comforting to use. My tan is still super.&lt;br /&gt;It was hard wrenching me from a product I loved, but I am very satisfied with \\&quot;Banana Boat.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Banana Boat is the best dry skin lotion for overall use I have found for my extremely dry skin. It has healthy skin ingredients and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is great.Can be used for face too.</li>
            <li> Have always loved this stuff</li>
            <li> I apply daily, especially after sun exposure. Great at avoiding dry/peeling skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion has helped me countless times when I have been sunburnt.  I apply the lotion every few hours for the first few days after a burn, and then once a day.  It has always enabled me to turn a sunburn into a tan.  I love the smell and use it year-round.  Because the pump bottle is not travel safe, I use a small travelsize container to carry this lotion with me in my purse.  I have been using this brand of lotion for years.  I think I go through about one 16 oz bottle per year.</li>
            <li> The best way to keep a tan!  Easy to use, easy to spread, absorbed quickly and keeps my tan glowing and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I got a bad sunburn yesterday and picked this stuff up at Target.  I applied it twice last night, woke up this morning, and my sunburn is already healing.  Some of it has already turned into a tan. This is probably the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Smells good and reminds me of being on vacation at the beach, blends into skin quickly. Not greasy !</li>
            <li> This is an excellent lotion.  Use on face and it will protect from wrinkles!  Have used it that way for 20 years and it has worked great.</li>
            <li> I buy this when i go on vacay for after sun bathin and i loved it so much i use it year round. My husband also loves it which is a miracle because i could never get him to put on any lotion. Its creamy but not oily. Leaves skin feeling light with a touch of natural shine..its a keeper</li>
            <li> Using this lotion everyday for years. Great alternative to traditional stretch mark creams as well. Smells great!</li>
            <li> this goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering perfume odor. Men and women can use this. I love it.</li>
            <li> I WEAR THIS AFTER IM IN THE SUN AND MY SUNTAN LASTS FOR A PRETTY GOOD LENGTH OF TIME.  AND IT LEAVES YOUR SKIN SMOOTH AND YOU DONT PEEL LIKE A ALLIGATOR EITHER LOL.  TRY IT !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, the fragrance more than anything. Reminds me of summer. For some reason I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it locally. Hopefully not a harbinger of things to come.  Packaging was ok. One of the containers leaked a bit.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the best after sun lotion.  Used with Noxema this can bring me out of a mild sunburn over night.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s the job done!  I live on the beach and have already gotten pretty burnt since the Summer season started.. I applied this multiple times daily last week and never got the nasty greasy feeling.  Worked like a charm - better than other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used, I&#x27;d say.  Be careful not to apply too much at once.. it&#x27;ll leave you looking like a polar bear! ;)</li>
            <li> Product had opened and leaked a bit. Just messy, but I&#x27;m the end only a small amount of product was lost.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion in the whole wide beachy world.  I&#x27;ve been using it forever.  Excellent moisturizer.  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this for after the beach to help prolong my tan. It smells great and is really moisturizing so I&#x27;ve been also using it as my normal body lotion this summer.</li>
            <li> Once again I love Banana Boat products.  Have used this product for many years and will continue to do so.  Great after a day in the sun product.  If used every day during tanning season, your tan remains beautiful with no flaking!</li>
            <li> Wonderful lotion.  I use it after I shower on my face and bald head.  I&#x27;ll keep buying this lotion as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite lotion - goes on a bit thick, which for dry skin, I need. It also smells like summer and during the winter, that&#x27;s a great advantage! Actually don&#x27;t use it for after-sunning, but for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great product I use daily</li>
            <li> If you live in Florida and like going to the beach regularly, then this product is for you! I haven&#x27;t had any problems worth mentioning, so far so good!</li>
            <li> This product works very well after a day in the sun.  Moisturizes skin and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. I have a saline pool and its drying on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I usually have dry/sensitive skin anyway and have tried  body butters, mane n tail, bath and body lotions (fragrance caused bad skin reactions after a few days), body shop butters, coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coconut oil gotta say is totally awesome and made the dry bumps on my arms as long as I can remember, disappear and makes my feet soft.&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t always want to smell of coconut due to insects in the yard or because a best friend can&#x27;t stand it. Also many nut allergy sufferers could be affected by it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I digress...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After pool and shower I apply the lotion and it really feels &amp;#34;still on&amp;#34; through at least 8 hours (today) afterward of hand-washing and hot outdoor party attendance. Even my feet are still soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend and plan to use year round. In winter or as an extra deep penetrating healing/calming step do the coconut oil at night:) it even clears face redness and diaper rash fast like lightning.</li>
            <li> Best product ever to rejuvenate your skin after tanning and also very good for everyday use whether tanning or not.&lt;br /&gt;I swear by this lotion and recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> i USE IT EVERY DAY AFTER I HAVE BEEN LAYING IN THE SUN FOR 30 TO 45 MINUTES KEEPS MY SKIN GREAT</li>
            <li> Working great after my radiation treatments</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling lotion. The whole household uses it.</li>
            <li> We order a case of this lotion and we still have a few bottles left. My husband and step-daughter love it as much as me</li>
            <li> Faint fragrance and absorbs well</li>
            <li> Product was opened and leaking lotion upon arrival</li>
            <li> Aloe lotion. Just like any other. Did not feel any specific benefits to this one but still great lotion at a great price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, little heavier than my liking. Thought with the aloe it would have a more clean fresh moisturizing feeling.</li>
            <li> First, you may want to consider saving some money and buy the 4-pack (listed separately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin, and have tried hundreds of creams and lotions. Banana Boat Aloe After Sun Lotion is among the very best few. It is thick, non-greasy, soaks in quickly, and keeps the skin feeling good for hours. Every summer, I&#x27;ve been stocking up, to last me through the winter months (when I don&#x27;t see it sold in retail stores in my snowy climate). The 4 pack from Amazon not only solves the seasonal problem, but the price is lower than my wife can get it wholesale at her pharmacy. If you use hand or body lotion, definitely give this a try. I can&#x27;t promise it&#x27;s ideal for everyone, but this lotion has impressed every person who has tried it from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, if you can find it, the &amp;#34;Western Family&amp;#34; brand of &amp;#34;After Sun Lotion&amp;#34; seemed equally good. It may be the same product, but sold at a lower price under the Western Family store brand. I haven&#x27;t found a source for it in a few years now, and didn&#x27;t think to compare labels back when I had both at once. If they&#x27;re not the same stuff, then it may be something about how &amp;#34;After Sun&amp;#34; lotions are made which creates a great hand &amp; body lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever!  Not just for after sun, but every day!  It is hard to find in winter months, so glad to find it at a good price and easy to get!</li>
            <li> Best way to moisturize and maintain a tan</li>
            <li> I love Banana Boat products and the price was even better... BUT, when I received my bottle, the pump was open and the bag(which I&#x27;m glad it was in) was full of lotion. After cleaning it up, my bottle was half empty...was not impressed with the handling</li>
            <li> I was expecting this lotion to go on a little smoother.  It was all in all ok, but nothing any other drug store lotion wouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Perfect to use after sitting a the beach all day no peeling!</li>
            <li> Great relief from too much sun.</li>
            <li> Outstanding! Have used it for 30 years! Tried other brands...no contest.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, use it on a daily basis, it is not greasy and really helps after you are in the sun or tanning bed to bring out your color.  Love this lotion, can&#x27;t survive a summer without it</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Works great on sunburns n you will never peel again.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this lotion for any sunburns he has...  I&#x27;m not a big fan of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband says it helps with healing his burns and help to moisturize as well. He typically doesn&#x27;t use lotion for any reason, so if this is the one that will get him to use some, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the smell is off.  We&#x27;ve had a couple bottles of it and they all smell the same.  I just don&#x27;t like it and don&#x27;t want to smell like it.  Also, it&#x27;s a bit greasy and heavy for me.  I stick with Lubriderm or Cetaphil for lotion and if I am burned, I&#x27;ll just use those.  I don&#x27;t think there is enough aloe in the lotion to really make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Nothing like this stuff for use after a day in the sun.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it all year round. It is good with keeping moister over the winter and also helps while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  It calms itchy skin and the best after tan lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion helps keep the skin softer in the winter.  Doesn&#x27;t burn skin like some lotions do.  Will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Love it, the only lotion I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped with a bunch of other items.  It was wrapped in plastic,  but not sufficiently,  as it leaked onto the other items.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for over 20 years.  I LOVE it.  I use it as my daily hand, body and foot lotion all year round, not just sun season.  I am 48 years old and never had dry flakey skin (or the build up of such I notice on other women&#x27;s feet much younger than I am).  It has a soft pleasant oder.  It&#x27;s creamy not greasy.  I like the clear bottle because you can see when you are almost out and you know you have gotten every last drop out.  I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.  Thanks Banana Boat!</li>
            <li> It smells good, I don&#x27;t love it but I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and this does not bother me at all. I bought this after I got a sun burn and dealt with endless peeling.  It seemed to halt the peeling and relieve my burns. I&#x27;ve used it religiously now after getting some sun and it&#x27;s been great, no peeling, my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before but purchased here since it wasn&#x27;t in stores at the time. It was still cold outside. Good stuff</li>
            <li> Works good a little thick though</li>
            <li> The item pictured was a 16 oz pump bottle. Instead, I received two 8 oz non-pump bottles. Not a big deal. It&#x27;s still a great product, but the item was not as pictured.</li>
            <li> Great product. Open in package so I lost much of the lotion.</li>
            <li> The go to after sun product !</li>
            <li> I am an avid sailor and I have fair skin so I end up getting burnt a lot, even though I use sunscreen and wear hats. If you use this as soon as you get home it turns burn to tan and you don&#x27;t peel, really good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution, our six year old feels like the cream itself burns.</li>
            <li> Living in Florida, this is a staple in our house!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> It works and it cools.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. It is a light weight cream that keeps your skin moist. Actually works all year round.  But don&#x27;t expect it to take a sunbruned sting away.  This is an after sun cream--not an aloe sunburn cream.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> First time I bought it was because of terrible sunburn. Most of my body did not peel, but my back did.&lt;br /&gt;However, once I tried this lotion, I never stopped using it. I use it daily all over my body. Also, it is great after weight loss surgery, makes your skin soft and firm, love it!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it year-round. Really good for dry skin. Won&#x27;t clog your pores and gives you beautiful skin</li>
