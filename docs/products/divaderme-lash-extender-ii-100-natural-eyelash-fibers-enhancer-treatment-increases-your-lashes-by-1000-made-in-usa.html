            <li>Best fiber lash</li>
            <li>They arrived and I am thrilled!!</li>
            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is INCREDIBLE.</li>
            <li>I do not understand these good reviews at all!  </li>
            <li>This is just as good as the Tarte Best in Faux</li>
            <li>Just beautiful.</li>
            <li>I think it is great .  </li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>a bunch of lil itty bitty fibers were all over my face lol.</li>
            <li>those are really great IF you use them correctly.</li>
            <li>but just by curling you lashes and then applying this and your mascara is great</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I was extremely happy with the way it looked.  </li>
            <li>However with this lash extender my lashes are amazing!  </li>
            <li>my daughter loved it, I didn&#x27;t think it was all that great at extending.</li>
            <li>I am been using lash extenders for 9 months since they work wonders, talk about great lashes, they are amazing.  </li>
            <li>good product would buy again</li>
            <li>Have had good experience with Davaderme&#x27;s lipsticks and mascaras</li>
            <li>I dont know how the others people who bought this,and use it like they said, how it when on sooo good.</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Perfect lashes the first time.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I just love this product!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, very effective and works well with any length of lashes.</li>
            <li>And the price was amazing.</li>
            <li>And the fact that you use your own mascara helps too.  </li>
            <li>It falls all over your face and when you put your own mascara on over it (as directed) there is NO difference at all.  </li>
            <li>It does thicken nicely abd adds a but if length.</li>
            <li>Now, I haven&#x27;t really had time to perfect it yet, but even so, my lashes were dramatically longer and curled up at the ends without even using an eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>I use the brush from my old Best in Faux instead of the one that comes with this</li>
            <li>It is not a mascara, it is very fine fuzz that you are meant to apply before mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it wears.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought from Ulta and the vial contains WAY more.  </li>
            <li>There are so many fibers in this vial</li>
            <li>and it seems to work better.</li>
            <li>The effect is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>better than lash extender 2 on Divaderm&#x27;s official website, why?</li>
            <li>It just is:)</li>
            <li>I will order more of this product.</li>
            <li>On top of this issue, their &amp;#34;2 for 1&amp;#34; deal which I was promised, never materialized as well.  </li>
            <li>Love this product .</li>
            <li>but I would use it often and when I want to feel fabulous!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>lashes - too much for a non-occasion in my opinion, but GREAT for pictures.  </li>
            <li>THEN TOP OFF WITH MASCARA SOME FLAKING</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>Tips for getting the most out of it are to apply it this way.</li>
            <li>But I am pretty good with being able to use stuff or put together things.</li>
            <li>great for a nive natural look.</li>
            <li>but this really works good for me.</li>
            <li>It will make you look like you have been to a salon, and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>There can be some stray fibers that get into your eyes or on your face, but they do not bother my eyes and wipe away easily from my skin.</li>
            <li>Beware it can get in your eyes easily.</li>
            <li>The extenders take a bit of time to get down perfectly but do not give up</li>
            <li>Just check yourself throughout the day and you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>I quickly tried to place another order from a famous tv shopping network but they were sold out.  </li>
            <li>You will not believe the look that will be achieved, just fabulous.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>The lash extender is perfect for anyone who wants long lashes.  </li>
            <li>My day-to-day pick is to pair this with Maybelline Full &amp; Soft waterproof formula and I get a lovely, long flutter of lashes that truly looks like I was just visited by the Lash Fairy - I especially love the definition, which lets me skip</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product</li>
            <li>was SO excited to receive it.</li>
            <li>With L&#x27;Oreal Voluminious mascara, I will get fat, dramatic lashes with good length - great for a sultry look for evening.  </li>
            <li>Still a good product overall.</li>
            <li>You may wish to quickly sweep a clean brush under eyes after all is done, to remove any trace fibers.</li>
            <li>then took to the internet and found Divaderm, placed my order quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much it takes like two coats depends on if your doing it right</li>
            <li>First one was absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li>new favorite beauty product.</li>
            <li>Too funny!</li>
            <li>However, if you do and you get a light sprinkle on your face, just take a powder brush and gentle swipe it off your face.</li>
            <li>This product is worth it.</li>
            <li>Other than that its good add on.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, full and thick!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>a very gentle zig zag motion.</li>
            <li>a side note: the packaging seems pretty cheap, but the product itself has worked pretty well so far.</li>
            <li>made that mistake the first time.</li>
            <li>i used to wear falsies pretty often</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say it is better than Younique&#x27;s 3D Fibers Mascara, but definitely easier on the wallet.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;No, they aren&#x27;t Falsies!&amp;#34; is all you HAVE to say ;)</li>
            <li>Additionally, after Divaderm came out, many other brands followed suit, i.e. Two Face, their product is great, but a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li>Now,  Apply 1 coat of  a &amp;#34;wetter&amp;#34; or fresh,  new mascara.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you layer mascara on before though because it won&#x27;t really stick to dry lashes.</li>
            <li>Wished it wouldn&#x27;t clog up so fast.</li>
            <li>If you have ever purchased Ready to Wear lash extensions from Hsn</li>
            <li>try to find a video of how to use this product - it really helped me with the application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, i really did notice a difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li>It really plumps up my lashes.</li>
            <li>it really works well and anyone who says otherwise is not using it correctly.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>but i really do like this product.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt extend your lashes as much.</li>
            <li>i really like it</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real by Benefit used with this</li>
            <li>It worked very well for me, but it did flake a bit.</li>
            <li>As for flaking I haven&#x27;t worn them a whole day to know if they flake yet</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much fiber.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on my lashes all the time thanks to this.</li>
            <li>I had bought fake eyelashes and loved the look, but this gives the look without the price and fumbling!</li>
            <li>, you must work quickly, have the mascara ready as well as the extender and do one eye at a time, in fact, I do triple applications, mascara, extender, mascara, extender mascara, extender and LAST mascara.  </li>
            <li>YOU NEED TO PUT ON CLEAR MASCARA FIRST</li>
            <li>This is by far the best fiber mascara I have ever used apply it in between coats of regular mascara looks like you have false lashes on I</li>
            <li>Make sure you look down when applying so that you don&#x27;t get them in your eyes.</li>
            <li>They are even Better than the other!  </li>
            <li>After using it for a while, you become a pro and less fibers get all over you :-)</li>
            <li>It is the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually makes me look like I have more lashes.  </li>
            <li>but I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>There is a bit of shedding, but that&#x27;s normal with fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes full and long.</li>
            <li>Live this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as good a tight lining and gives great definition &amp; thickness at the base.</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>Lush, Lavish, Lashes PDQ!  </li>
            <li>the mascara must be wet to give the full affect</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any trouble moving quickly enough between the two tubes - especially important with a waterproof formula, as these dry much quicker that regular mascara.  </li>
            <li>Just wish the manufacturer could find a way to maybe put a tiny, moisture absorbing packet in the tube as the fibers tend to clump together after awhile making the product hard to use when you still have a good amount left in the tube.</li>
            <li>first really read instructions carefully</li>
            <li>Ladies, do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>People do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>I completely recommend.</li>
            <li>Work on only 1 eye at a time, after these 1st  2 steps: Curl your bare lashes, gently.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Received my order and the tube of extender was dry; even attempting to use it, the fibers were so intense that they stuck onto my contacts, in my eyes and on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I think the fibers might not be quite as long as the ones in Tarte&#x27;s and the brush is kind of skimpy/doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the fibers as well.  </li>
            <li>Use a small amount and place a paper towel under your eyes before applying because there are many loose fibers that will get all over your face.</li>
            <li>I barely noticed any lengthening of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 16 and refuse to wear false lashes like most girls</li>
            <li>When you apply it is sort of flakes off on your face, but then it is very easily brushed off with the make up brush and no mess.</li>
            <li>Use a wet formula mascara with it or a very new one.</li>
            <li>love the dramatic effects this makes my lashes look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used countless kinds of mascaras and even tried false lashes (looked unnatural and too much of a hassle to apply anyway) without much success.  </li>
            <li>its really imortant u look down when applying that way the fibers can fall.</li>
            <li>they seemed longer and fuller, so much that i even started wearing less eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>This product, depending on the mascara you pair it with, it will deliver long, flirty, NATURAL looking lashes - completely opposite of the look one gets with Younique ( Rocky Horror Picture Show, anyone???).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half Asian and my lashes are short and flare straight out.  </li>
            <li>i am 56 years old and have hardly any real lashes left</li>

            <li> a very gentle zig zag motion.</li>
            <li> a side note: the packaging seems pretty cheap, but the product itself has worked pretty well so far.</li>
            <li> made that mistake the first time.</li>
            <li> i used to wear falsies pretty often</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it is better than Younique&#x27;s 3D Fibers Mascara, but definitely easier on the wallet.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;No, they aren&#x27;t Falsies!&amp;#34; is all you HAVE to say ;)</li>
            <li> Additionally, after Divaderm came out, many other brands followed suit, i.e. Two Face, their product is great, but a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> Now,  Apply 1 coat of  a &amp;#34;wetter&amp;#34; or fresh,  new mascara.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you layer mascara on before though because it won&#x27;t really stick to dry lashes.</li>
            <li> Wished it wouldn&#x27;t clog up so fast.</li>
            <li> If you have ever purchased Ready to Wear lash extensions from Hsn</li>
            <li> try to find a video of how to use this product - it really helped me with the application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , i really did notice a difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> It really plumps up my lashes.</li>
            <li> it really works well and anyone who says otherwise is not using it correctly.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> but i really do like this product.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt extend your lashes as much.</li>
            <li> i really like it</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real by Benefit used with this</li>
            <li> It worked very well for me, but it did flake a bit.</li>
            <li> As for flaking I haven&#x27;t worn them a whole day to know if they flake yet</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much fiber.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my lashes all the time thanks to this.</li>
            <li> I had bought fake eyelashes and loved the look, but this gives the look without the price and fumbling!</li>
            <li> , you must work quickly, have the mascara ready as well as the extender and do one eye at a time, in fact, I do triple applications, mascara, extender, mascara, extender mascara, extender and LAST mascara.  </li>
            <li> YOU NEED TO PUT ON CLEAR MASCARA FIRST</li>
            <li> This is by far the best fiber mascara I have ever used apply it in between coats of regular mascara looks like you have false lashes on I</li>
            <li> Make sure you look down when applying so that you don&#x27;t get them in your eyes.</li>
            <li> They are even Better than the other!  </li>
            <li> After using it for a while, you become a pro and less fibers get all over you :-)</li>
            <li> It is the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually makes me look like I have more lashes.  </li>
            <li> but I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> There is a bit of shedding, but that&#x27;s normal with fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes full and long.</li>
            <li> Live this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as good a tight lining and gives great definition &amp; thickness at the base.</li>
            <li> and wow!</li>
            <li> Lush, Lavish, Lashes PDQ!  </li>
            <li> the mascara must be wet to give the full affect</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any trouble moving quickly enough between the two tubes - especially important with a waterproof formula, as these dry much quicker that regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> Just wish the manufacturer could find a way to maybe put a tiny, moisture absorbing packet in the tube as the fibers tend to clump together after awhile making the product hard to use when you still have a good amount left in the tube.</li>
            <li> first really read instructions carefully</li>
            <li> Ladies, do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> People do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I completely recommend.</li>
            <li> Work on only 1 eye at a time, after these 1st  2 steps: Curl your bare lashes, gently.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Received my order and the tube of extender was dry; even attempting to use it, the fibers were so intense that they stuck onto my contacts, in my eyes and on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I think the fibers might not be quite as long as the ones in Tarte&#x27;s and the brush is kind of skimpy/doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the fibers as well.  </li>
            <li> Use a small amount and place a paper towel under your eyes before applying because there are many loose fibers that will get all over your face.</li>
            <li> I barely noticed any lengthening of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 and refuse to wear false lashes like most girls</li>
            <li> When you apply it is sort of flakes off on your face, but then it is very easily brushed off with the make up brush and no mess.</li>
            <li> Use a wet formula mascara with it or a very new one.</li>
            <li> love the dramatic effects this makes my lashes look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless kinds of mascaras and even tried false lashes (looked unnatural and too much of a hassle to apply anyway) without much success.  </li>
            <li> its really imortant u look down when applying that way the fibers can fall.</li>
            <li> they seemed longer and fuller, so much that i even started wearing less eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This product, depending on the mascara you pair it with, it will deliver long, flirty, NATURAL looking lashes - completely opposite of the look one gets with Younique ( Rocky Horror Picture Show, anyone???).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Asian and my lashes are short and flare straight out.  </li>
            <li> i am 56 years old and have hardly any real lashes left</li>
            <li> this is the exact same product for less then half the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;that said, the first few times i used it, the flakes got in my eyes and were pretty irritating.</li>
            <li> A little messy but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Feels like I have dust or eye lashes in my eyes all day long.</li>
            <li> Comes off clumpy if you have naturally long lashes</li>
            <li> My lashes have never looked so long</li>
            <li> Be careful applying too much, you will find little black hairs all day long.</li>
            <li> Now, apply to the lashes of your other eye in the same manner.  </li>
            <li> The material is completely dry.</li>
            <li> When I put the brush in the bottle the brush had no color it was dry.  </li>
            <li> As long as you use it with a mascara that is fairly wet and doesn&#x27;t come off during the day, it produces very long looking eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Yes, a few fibers end up on your face, but nothing extreme that a soft hair brush won&#x27;t remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you should really only apply this looking down</li>
            <li> Next, looking DOWN into a handheld or tilted mirror, to minimize fibers going INTO your eyes.</li>
            <li> Additionally, some of the similar product has &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; fibers instead of black.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with Christian Dior&#x27;s lash primer and Dior Show black mascara.</li>
            <li> She usually puts about ten layers of mascara on every day, now she&#x27; only needs three.</li>
            <li> Made a mess all over my face because I do my eye makeup last so all the fibers stuck to my foundation.</li>
            <li> The downside is that the little fibers get everywhere, so a fan brush is essential for clearing them away.</li>
            <li> This was a great product idea but an awful product.</li>
            <li> I tried it with a few different mascaras but none of them seemed to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money on an eyelash &amp;#34;growth&amp;#34; formula that was supposed to thicken my lashes</li>
            <li> I keep a few different mascara formulas on hand.  </li>
            <li> However, it seemed like I received an empty bottle.</li>
            <li> Works well, but you need practice and a wet mascara in order for it to work for you.</li>
            <li> Much prefer this to wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> Any comments on the company&#x27;s Facebook page that criticize the product to warn other consumers...are immediately deleted by Divaderme.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a lot of work, it&#x27;s really not &amp; REALLY worth it.  </li>
            <li> I am 49 years old and have never worn false eyelashes but have often thought about it.  </li>
            <li> It really gives you a false eyelash look !</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why you are looking down into the mirror.)</li>
            <li> and before you put on any other face makeup (i.e., foundation, primer, under-eye concealer), as you&#x27;ll probably have to wipe a few flakes</li>
            <li> if you put a few coats of mascara on afterwards, you won&#x27;t get any of the flaking throughout the day that some other users have described.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does look a little clumpy, but I&#x27;ve worn mascaras that were clumpier.  </li>
            <li> I find it easier to use with black fibers.</li>
            <li> Both times the little lashes ended up all over under my eyes, and also got into my eyes.</li>
            <li> Mascara alone doesn&#x27;t do it but with these little babies, it is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> (IF YOU ARE WORKING), GETS IN YOUR EYES AND CAUSES A LITTLE IRRITATION</li>
            <li> And a little messy; leaves fibers on your face.</li>
            <li> But not huge length.. they are like little fiber particles so they can give volume but not so length.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real  Mascara as the base coat, applied the fibers (which you must do rather quickly while the base coat is still wet), and sealed it with Estee Lauder Double Wear Zero-Smudge Lengthening Mascara.</li>
            <li> I wish that I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> Waste of my time.</li>
            <li> i have trouble with my lashes</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money.</li>
            <li> I like to wear false eyelashes for extra length, but i find them too fiddly.</li>
            <li> some back story I have been wearing false lashes individuals for 4 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as dramatic as with falsies bug definitely works as an alternative.</li>
            <li> I have short lashes and usually wear false lashes because mascara alone did not give me length, but sometimes I don&#x27;t feel like dealing with glue etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick or long lashes, and had tried growth serums in the past, but had an allergic reaction to them.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!  </li>
            <li> I followed the direction word for word, but my lashes did not look much different at all, no added length or volume just made them stick together and look gross and kinda clumpy/goopy but that could have just been a combination with the extra layers of mascara I used to try to seal this awful stuff from getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw it on a local TV channel</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very thin, so thus is a non invasive way to actually get some!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hard to apply and I expected it to be really messy after reading the other reviews, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff is hard to use.</li>
            <li> I would imagine it&#x27;s going to take me at least a year to finish, and I use this every day.  </li>
            <li> At least Im not burning my eyes out and looking like Im molting.</li>
            <li> Unscrew cap/brush from DivaDerm bottle, and while lashes are still wet from 1st coat of mascara, apply DD in deeply to lash base in</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes crazy long.</li>
            <li> and I was so disappointed when I finally did!</li>
            <li> An artist who worked at Sephora told me her secret to her lashes, I will always remember her help.</li>
            <li> Also, false eyelashes tend to make my eyes feel a bit tired..</li>
            <li> I would never think of using false eyelashes since using Lash Extender.  </li>
            <li> Everyone thought I had on false eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> I will stick with drug store maybelline and false eyes lashes.</li>
            <li> it is so dramatic....</li>
            <li> The fibers ended up all over my face and under my eyes were colored dark with fibers giving the appearance that I had terrible dark circles under the eyes!</li>
            <li> Just wear the fake lashes or get lashes extension.</li>
            <li> Difficult to take off though.....</li>
            <li> (Ow and irritating!</li>
            <li> All it did was get those weird fibers in my eyes (and I followed the directions).  </li>
            <li> I stopped using false lashes for even stage purposes!</li>
            <li> Holy wrong description if this product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible to contact the company by phone.  </li>
            <li> really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>
            <li> Worst product!  </li>
            <li> but it was just terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is great! As long as you use it with a mascara that is fairly wet and doesn&#x27;t come off during the day, it produces very long looking eyelashes. The material is completely dry. When you apply it is sort of flakes off on your face, but then it is very easily brushed off with the make up brush and no mess.</li>
            <li> I bought this and was amazed at the difference it made!  I don&#x27;t have very thick or long lashes, and had tried growth serums in the past, but had an allergic reaction to them.  However with this lash extender my lashes are amazing!  Beautiful, full and thick! I&#x27;m definitely ordering again!</li>
            <li> Love the way it wears. Wished it wouldn&#x27;t clog up so fast.</li>
            <li> my daughter loved it, I didn&#x27;t think it was all that great at extending.</li>
            <li> The lash extender is perfect for anyone who wants long lashes.  I use Christian Dior Blackout mascara to make the extender last longer.  I get compliments all the time.  It will make you look like you have been to a salon, and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I wish that I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on this. I tried it twice. Both times the little lashes ended up all over under my eyes, and also got into my eyes. I followed the instructions. I barely noticed any lengthening of my lashes. I do always curl my lashes before applying mascara though.</li>
            <li> Holy wrong description if this product! Penis extender? Too funny! I&#x27;m going to give it a try for my EYELASHES!</li>
            <li> If you have ever purchased Ready to Wear lash extensions from Hsn this is the exact same product for less then half the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff was so clumpy!  Made a mess all over my face because I do my eye makeup last so all the fibers stuck to my foundation.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the Tarte Best in Faux I&#x27;ve bought from Ulta and the vial contains WAY more.  There are so many fibers in this vial I would imagine it&#x27;s going to take me at least a year to finish, and I use this every day.  My only complaint is that I think the fibers might not be quite as long as the ones in Tarte&#x27;s and the brush is kind of skimpy/doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the fibers as well.  I use the brush from my old Best in Faux instead of the one that comes with this and it seems to work better.</li>
            <li> try to find a video of how to use this product - it really helped me with the application.&lt;br /&gt;that said, the first few times i used it, the flakes got in my eyes and were pretty irritating. you should really only apply this looking down and before you put on any other face makeup (i.e., foundation, primer, under-eye concealer), as you&#x27;ll probably have to wipe a few flakes away.&lt;br /&gt;once i figured out how best to use it, i really did notice a difference in my lashes. they seemed longer and fuller, so much that i even started wearing less eyeshadow. if you put a few coats of mascara on afterwards, you won&#x27;t get any of the flaking throughout the day that some other users have described.&lt;br /&gt;as a side note: the packaging seems pretty cheap, but the product itself has worked pretty well so far.</li>
            <li> I am been using lash extenders for 9 months since they work wonders, talk about great lashes, they are amazing.  Last week my last bottle fell on the tile floor and I freaked.  I quickly tried to place another order from a famous tv shopping network but they were sold out.  I freaked then took to the internet and found Divaderm, placed my order quickly. They arrived and I am thrilled!! They are even Better than the other!  The extenders take a bit of time to get down perfectly but do not give up, you must work quickly, have the mascara ready as well as the extender and do one eye at a time, in fact, I do triple applications, mascara, extender, mascara, extender mascara, extender and LAST mascara.  You will not believe the look that will be achieved, just fabulous.  Yes a few lashes may fall underneath your eye, just take a brush and gently brush off, no big deal.  An artist who worked at Sephora told me her secret to her lashes, I will always remember her help. No Sephora does not sell them.  Please Divaderm continue making this product, it makes me so happy and the look is beyond words!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have this on subscription. It really plumps up my lashes. Additionally, after Divaderm came out, many other brands followed suit, i.e. Two Face, their product is great, but a lot more expensive. Additionally, some of the similar product has &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; fibers instead of black. I find it easier to use with black fibers. I use this in combination with Christian Dior&#x27;s lash primer and Dior Show black mascara. The effect is phenomenal. I stopped using false lashes for even stage purposes!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!  Like powder and it flakes all over your face - a lot.  Did NOTHING for my eyelashes except make them darker.  I do not understand these good reviews at all!  I think it&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. The eye lashes stuff gets in my eyes. Feels like I have dust or eye lashes in my eyes all day long. Waste of my time. Just wear the fake lashes or get lashes extension.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  My eyelashes are very thin, so thus is a non invasive way to actually get some!</li>
            <li> good product would buy again</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. It has hair like fibers. And the price was amazing. I actually paid $46.00 in a beaty salon for the same item. It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a bottle of BS!😒</li>
            <li> This product is worth it. It makes my lashes crazy long. There is a bit of shedding, but that&#x27;s normal with fiber lashes. Just check yourself throughout the day and you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> Horrible product! Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Comes off clumpy if you have naturally long lashes</li>
            <li> THE BEST LASH EXTENDED PRODUCT EVER!  I would never think of using false eyelashes since using Lash Extender.  I am on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very short eyelashes and this is the only product that has ever extended them.  I think it is great .  You do have to still use mascara and I did not receive a brush.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well with every type of mascara.</li>
            <li> Very good. Gives you a falsies look. Difficult to take off though.....better than lash extender 2 on Divaderm&#x27;s official website, why? I don&#x27;t know. It just is:)</li>
            <li> new favorite beauty product. it really works well and anyone who says otherwise is not using it correctly. to avoid eye irritation, don&#x27;t apply it too close to your eye. made that mistake the first time. i used to wear falsies pretty often and now i feel like i don&#x27;t have to. i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it is better than Younique&#x27;s 3D Fibers Mascara, but definitely easier on the wallet.  And the fact that you use your own mascara helps too.  I will definitely buy again. I would say it is an equal equivalent to the Younique 3D.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail yesterday!! It is the best! I always wear mascara but it never gives my eyes enough definition. I like to wear false eyelashes for extra length, but i find them too fiddly. Also, false eyelashes tend to make my eyes feel a bit tired.. Maybe the extra weight of having something glued to them? Anyways, this stuff is the bees- knees! My eyes look awesome.. I even put some on my lowere lashes! Great product!</li>
            <li> This product does just as it advertised. My eyelashes were fuller, and longer. Just beautiful. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Worst product!  They stick to the brush and not to my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Very happy!</li>
            <li> Lives up to its claims of making lashes longer. A little messy but worth the effort. I will order more of this product. Much prefer this to wearing false lashes. Easy to remove with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Have had good experience with Davaderme&#x27;s lipsticks and mascaras BUT....the Lash Extender is a nightmare of a product!  I realize that any product can have a defect, manufacturing or otherwise but, for a contact lens wearer, this product is dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received my order and the tube of extender was dry; even attempting to use it, the fibers were so intense that they stuck onto my contacts, in my eyes and on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I immediately attempted to contact Divaderme, an exercise in futility.  On top of this issue, their &amp;#34;2 for 1&amp;#34; deal which I was promised, never materialized as well.  Emails keep kicking back as &amp;#34;undeliverable&amp;#34;...it&#x27;s impossible to contact the company by phone.

            <li> Be careful applying too much, you will find little black hairs all day long. Use a small amount and place a paper towel under your eyes before applying because there are many loose fibers that will get all over your face.</li>
            <li> I really really wanted this to work but it was just terrible! I tried it with a few different mascaras but none of them seemed to make a difference. It irritated my eyes and felt like I had sand in them all day, eye drops seemed to help but the irritation would come back. I followed the direction word for word, but my lashes did not look much different at all, no added length or volume just made them stick together and look gross and kinda clumpy/goopy but that could have just been a combination with the extra layers of mascara I used to try to seal this awful stuff from getting into my eyes. really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> this was intresting... first really read instructions carefully lol. i didnt so a bunch of lil itty bitty fibers were all over my face lol. its really imortant u look down when applying that way the fibers can fall. but i really do like this product. great for a nive natural look.</li>
            <li> Love this product . It really gives you a false eyelash look !</li>
            <li> I love this product! You have to follow the directions to the letter, but you get increased volume and length! I had bought fake eyelashes and loved the look, but this gives the look without the price and fumbling! I would not use this daily, bc it is so dramatic....but I would use it often and when I want to feel fabulous!</li>
            <li> I will never go without this again.  Perfect lashes the first time.  Everyone thought I had on false eye lashes.  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyelashes.  I am 49 years old and have never worn false eyelashes but have often thought about it.  I spent a lot of money on an eyelash &amp;#34;growth&amp;#34; formula that was supposed to thicken my lashes but I saw no difference after using it.  Then I saw this product on the Rachel Ray show.  I decided to try it and was amazed at the results!!  I LOVE it!  It is the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually makes me look like I have more lashes.  Mascara alone doesn&#x27;t do it but with these little babies, it is a miracle.  I will buy this product until I die!!!</li>
            <li> Takes some practice but the results are longer, thicker looking lashes!  Just wish the manufacturer could find a way to maybe put a tiny, moisture absorbing packet in the tube as the fibers tend to clump together after awhile making the product hard to use when you still have a good amount left in the tube.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product and I was so disappointed when I finally did! The fibers ended up all over my face and under my eyes were colored dark with fibers giving the appearance that I had terrible dark circles under the eyes! This was a great product idea but an awful product.</li>
            <li> those are really great IF you use them correctly. they made my lashes 200% longer and thicker. I use them with Lancom mascara though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Adds length and thickens</li>
            <li> Doesnt extend your lashes as much. And a little messy; leaves fibers on your face.</li>
            <li> it does make your lashes longer . i have trouble with my lashes i am 56 years old and have hardly any real lashes left but this really works good for me. i really like it</li>
            <li> It does work to lengthen lashes! The downside is that the little fibers get everywhere, so a fan brush is essential for clearing them away. Make sure you look down when applying so that you don&#x27;t get them in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago, and have used it daily.  This product, depending on the mascara you pair it with, it will deliver long, flirty, NATURAL looking lashes - completely opposite of the look one gets with Younique ( Rocky Horror Picture Show, anyone???).  I keep a few different mascara formulas on hand.  They&#x27;re Real by Benefit used with this gives me truly out-to-there lashes - too much for a non-occasion in my opinion, but GREAT for pictures.  With L&#x27;Oreal Voluminious mascara, I will get fat, dramatic lashes with good length - great for a sultry look for evening.  My day-to-day pick is to pair this with Maybelline Full &amp; Soft waterproof formula and I get a lovely, long flutter of lashes that truly looks like I was just visited by the Lash Fairy - I especially love the definition, which lets me skip liner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying mascara for 30 years, so I&#x27;m well-practiced.  I don&#x27;t have any trouble moving quickly enough between the two tubes - especially important with a waterproof formula, as these dry much quicker that regular mascara.  I curl my lashes, un-twist both tubes and hold them in one hand between my fingers, put on mascara, put on DivaDerme, another coat of mascara and boom - done.  There can be some stray fibers that get into your eyes or on your face, but they do not bother my eyes and wipe away easily from my skin.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;fuzz in a bottle&amp;#34; does not stay on the lashes.  It is not a mascara, it is very fine fuzz that you are meant to apply before mascara.  It falls all over your face and when you put your own mascara on over it (as directed) there is NO difference at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It worked very well for me, but it did flake a bit.</li>
            <li> item arrived in worn/bad shape.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best fiber mascara I have ever used apply it in between coats of regular mascara looks like you have false lashes on I love the dramatic effects this makes my lashes look. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> ADDS FIBERS YOU NEED TO PUT ON CLEAR MASCARA FIRST THEN TOP OFF WITH MASCARA SOME FLAKING</li>
            <li> I have never written a review in my life but I had to with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I was SO excited to receive it. I was tracking the package which came in 2days btw. Super fast shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I decided to try it as soon as I ripped open the box!&lt;br /&gt;Now some back story I have been wearing false lashes individuals for 4 years. And 3 weeks took them off and decided not to wear them. My lashes are damaged from the constant glue.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this before going back and I promise they are amazing!!! Gave me volume and length. Never doing falsies again. As for flaking I haven&#x27;t worn them a whole day to know if they flake yet but they are literally amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Buy if your thinking!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Beware it can get in your eyes easily. Every time I apply I tilt my head forward so if fibers fell they don&#x27;t fell in my eyes. Other than that its good add on. Gives some volume and length. But not huge length.. they are like little fiber particles so they can give volume but not so length. Still a good product overall.</li>
            <li> The item came on time and well packaged.  However, it seemed like I received an empty bottle. When I put the brush in the bottle the brush had no color it was dry.  I kept putting on my eyelashes and did not see anything.  The only I noticed it seemed like I had dirt in the circles of my eyes instead.  I wonder never purchase this type of product again.</li>
            <li> Ladies, do not waste your money on this. I dont know how the others people who bought this,and use it like they said, how it when on sooo good.But I am pretty good with being able to use stuff or put together things. But this stuff is hard to use. Flakes off on to your eyes and cheeks. God i got it into my eyes  because of its flaking and talk about burning. People do not waste your money on this. I will stick with drug store maybelline and false eyes lashes. At least Im not burning my eyes out and looking like Im molting.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter LOVES it!  She usually puts about ten layers of mascara on every day, now she&#x27; only needs three.</li>
            <li> Just ok. This is my second extender. First one was absolutely fabulous.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much fiber. I need 3 or 4 coats compared to just 1.</li>
            <li> This stuff is INCREDIBLE. I was skeptical when I saw it on a local TV channel but I said hey what the heck, it&#x27;s so cheap, what do I got to lose. I bought it and wow! Forget falsies, this here is it ladies &amp; gents! It makes my lashes full and long. One con is that if you don&#x27;t tap the wand out, it&#x27;ll get into your eyes or your face. However, if you do and you get a light sprinkle on your face, just take a powder brush and gentle swipe it off your face. Not a big deal at all. Make sure you layer mascara on before though because it won&#x27;t really stick to dry lashes.I completely recommend. I get compliments on my lashes all the time thanks to this. After using it for a while, you become a pro and less fibers get all over you :-) Promise if you buy you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Lush, Lavish, Lashes PDQ!  I love this product!  Tips for getting the most out of it are to apply it this way. Work on only 1 eye at a time, after these 1st  2 steps: Curl your bare lashes, gently.  If you line your upper lids, do both, so you&#x27;re evenly lined.  Now,  Apply 1 coat of  a &amp;#34;wetter&amp;#34; or fresh,  new mascara.  Next, looking DOWN into a handheld or tilted mirror, to minimize fibers going INTO your eyes. (Ow and irritating! That&#x27;s why you are looking down into the mirror.) Unscrew cap/brush from DivaDerm bottle, and while lashes are still wet from 1st coat of mascara, apply DD in deeply to lash base in a very gentle zig zag motion. It&#x27;s almost as good a tight lining and gives great definition &amp; thickness at the base. Work your way up to the tips in a  combo brush/roll motion.  Apply another coat of the Mascara. Comb thru your lashes (I&#x27;m a big fan of Ardell&#x27;s Lash Comb), and follow with another coat of Mascara, to seal the fibers to you your lashes.  If you need/desire a thicker &amp; longer look, apply another coat of DD to lashes, comb and seal with 1 last coat of Mascara, combing if needed.  Now, apply to the lashes of your other eye in the same manner.  You may wish to quickly sweep a clean brush under eyes after all is done, to remove any trace fibers. It sounds like a lot of work, it&#x27;s really not &amp; REALLY worth it.  Prepare to face the admiring glances and questions.  &amp;#34;No, they aren&#x27;t Falsies!&amp;#34; is all you HAVE to say ;)</li>
            <li> Erm.  All it did was get those weird fibers in my eyes (and I followed the directions).  I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  I threw it out</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much it takes like two coats depends on if your doing it right but just by curling you lashes and then applying this and your mascara is great the mascara must be wet to give the full affect I&#x27;m 16 and refuse to wear false lashes like most girls but I highly recommend this you&#x27;ll have a difference 😊</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very effective and works well with any length of lashes.</li>
            <li> Got then before estimated delivery date! Live this product</li>
            <li> FLAKES OFF AND DOESN&#x27;T LAST 8 HOURS (IF YOU ARE WORKING), GETS IN YOUR EYES AND CAUSES A LITTLE IRRITATION</li>
            <li> Works well, but you need practice and a wet mascara in order for it to work for you. It does thicken nicely abd adds a but if length. But not quite falsy length. Use a wet formula mascara with it or a very new one.</li>
            <li> I have short lashes and usually wear false lashes because mascara alone did not give me length, but sometimes I don&#x27;t feel like dealing with glue etc. This product definitely gives me fuller, longer lashes. It&#x27;s not as dramatic as with falsies bug definitely works as an alternative.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have virtually no eyelashes.  I&#x27;m half Asian and my lashes are short and flare straight out.  I&#x27;ve used countless kinds of mascaras and even tried false lashes (looked unnatural and too much of a hassle to apply anyway) without much success.  Until I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I have to say that I was extremely happy with the way it looked.  Now, I haven&#x27;t really had time to perfect it yet, but even so, my lashes were dramatically longer and curled up at the ends without even using an eyelash curler.  It wasn&#x27;t hard to apply and I expected it to be really messy after reading the other reviews, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad.  Yes, a few fibers end up on your face, but nothing extreme that a soft hair brush won&#x27;t remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using the wettest mascara to apply underneath it.  I used Benefit They&#x27;re Real  Mascara as the base coat, applied the fibers (which you must do rather quickly while the base coat is still wet), and sealed it with Estee Lauder Double Wear Zero-Smudge Lengthening Mascara. My lashes have never looked so long and it lasted all day both times without ever flaking or running.  My only complaint is that it does look a little clumpy, but I&#x27;ve worn mascaras that were clumpier.  Btw...there is a lot of the product in the bottle, so I&#x27;m thinking that one bottle will last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would defintely recommend this product to anyone and I do plan on reordering it in the future.</li>
            <li> I just love this product! Best fiber lash I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
