            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>These are wonderful!</li>
            <li>She is very good about &amp;#</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>(when a baby&#x27;s production of protective saliva is greatly reduced).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great for on-the-go and travel.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The best substitute for a toothbrush and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Before using these i used dr browns cherry flavor and she loved it, so this was an adjustment.</li>
            <li>Baby and I are both very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>love spiffies!</li>
            <li>The kids also didn&#x27;t mind the routine because the flavor is nice.</li>
            <li>This are great for a quick brush-up when my toddler falls asleep before we can brush his teeth.</li>
            <li>these are awesome, my dentist told me, babies mouths a&#x27;re actually sterile, and they get their bacteria from those around them.</li>
            <li>However, she falls asleep nursing most of the time so getting a Spiffie before bed has become part of her routine.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still not as safe as brushing the teeth, then not breastfeeding until daylight hours, but it helps mitigate the risk of decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this for my baby.</li>
            <li>I feel like these are more thorough than a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My son loves the flavors and I love that they have xylitol to help prevent cavities.</li>
            <li>These would be great if my 11 month old would let me use them on him!</li>
            <li>I felt like I was getting my son&#x27;s mouth really clean with these!</li>
            <li>more importantly my toddler loves it.</li>
            <li>then you can just as easily brush the teeth.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to lose your grip on the wipe, and could be a choking</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>down).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a huge battle.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the flavors and doesn&#x27;t mind me using them to clean her teeth.</li>
            <li>She wanted to make sure that I knew that although the risk is low, my baby could be at risk (and there&#x27;s no way to know if your child has the kind of teeth that will be at risk - until the damage is done).  </li>
            <li>Also they come in fun flavors that my daughter seems to prefer.  </li>
            <li>We liked how they were individually wrapped and could take them in my purse on the go</li>
            <li>Easy to use to clean the teeth and gums of our 8 month old.</li>
            <li>Great alternative for our 2 year old when regular teeth brushing is not an option.</li>
            <li>Some people would not care to spend the money on these and just use wash cloths and water but for me they are well worth it.  </li>
            <li>not handled right, or if your impulsive, autonomous demanding toddler wants to do it himself, and/or bites you</li>
            <li>Either flavor she uses right away.</li>
            <li>We chose these wipes in hope that it would make teeth cleaning go more smoothly with our 20 month old son, and so far it has.  </li>
            <li>; to get her mouth and new teeth clean throughout the day and at night.</li>
            <li>I tried the apple flavor first.</li>
            <li>I really like these wipes!  </li>
            <li>She actually opens her mouth to let me clean her teeth!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to hear that, because I&#x27;ve read so much about the subject, and most babies with teeth can safely breastfeed at night and not develop decay.  </li>
            <li>But the material tears easily if you want to 1/2 it to make them last longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with these, but wish the wipe was bigger, and maybe more of a pocket design, where your fingers can slip in, rather than a flat small</li>
            <li>but really prefers the apple.</li>
            <li>However, my pedodontist has seen tooth decay firsthand in the babies of very well-informed parents who did everything &#x27;by the book&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Another bonus is that the Spiffies really do seem to placate her if she&#x27;s teething.  </li>
            <li>And I really think the xylitol is preserving what&#x27;s left.&lt;br /&gt;After researching all the promising studies</li>
            <li>Before it used to be a real fight.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to carry around in the handbag, diaper bag or even keep some in the car for cleaning on the go.</li>
            <li>Kind of wish they were smaller pieces for when my kiddo only had 2 or 4 teeth.  </li>
            <li>I usually use the finger brush on a regular basis, but these come in handy if I don&#x27;t have easy access to the finger brush.</li>
            <li>We wipe his teeth and inside his mouth really well before brushing and feel that we&#x27;ve managed to get his teeth as clean as possible at this age.</li>
            <li>like so many lip/tongue tied babies, his upper 4 teeth need major work-</li>
            <li>, I am also purchasing a bag of xylitol, as most study&#x27;s state potential benefits start at a higher dose than what&#x27;s likely in these wipes alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was reluctant to do that, however, because my baby won&#x27;t drink cow&#x27;s or goat&#x27;s milk (and hates formula), and I produce much more milk at night than during the day.  </li>
            <li>They arrived just in time for my 9 month old&#x27;s first teeth.</li>
            <li>We did not use these with my older son and he got cavities.  </li>
            <li>I like these much better than tooth tissues because they are individually packaged and don&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li>The package doesn&#x27;t say anything about this particular usage of the product, but I trust my pedodontist, who explained that by coating the teeth with zylitol (a wood sugar), you give the mouth&#x27;s bacteria something to eat rather than the natural sugar in breastmilk.  </li>
            <li>did early brushing with my son, but the older and stronger he got,</li>
            <li>the only thing i dont like about these is that they are very sticky unlike the dr brown brand.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;ll really chomp down, suck hard on the Spiffie, and then relax and sleep better after being &#x27;Spiffied&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>and now they&#x27;ll have to give him general anesthesia to fix them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just be careful that you have a good hold on the Spiffie; my baby loves it so much she sucks really hard, and might swallow it if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the only way I can consistently clean his teeth now, (or at least without having to enlist for help holding him</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My grandchildren are very susceptible to tooth decay and these were recommended by their dentist for times they were unable to brush after eating- at the mall</li>

            <li> found these a little to late to have possibly avoided that,</li>

            <li> My pedodontist told me that in a small percentage of cases (perhaps 5%), breastfeeding during the night can cause tooth decay in babies.  </li>
            <li> -hard!-</li>
            <li> Brushing tears the upper lip where it&#x27;s attached to the base of his teeth, and they bleed.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> needless to say, thank God...</li>
            <li> I even tried chilling them in the fridge to help with teething but it didn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My son loves cleaning his teeth with these</li>
            <li> great product! Use these at night to wipe my toddlers mouth after breast feeding. Dentist also gave 2 thumbs up approval! Say no to cavities!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Kind of wish they were smaller pieces for when my kiddo only had 2 or 4 teeth.  But the material tears easily if you want to 1/2 it to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> I started using these wipes once my daughter turned 1 after receiving some samples from her dentist.  Prior to that, I used tooth tissues.  I like these much better than tooth tissues because they are individually packaged and don&#x27;t dry out.  Also they come in fun flavors that my daughter seems to prefer.  I have her lay down with her head in my lap so I can see inside her mouth.  I brush her teeth then wipe her teeth with the spiffies wipes.  Maybe it&#x27;s overkill but she hasn&#x27;t had any cavities or dental problems yet.</li>
            <li> my baby did not let me wipe her gums until the 3rd day... I tried the apple flavor first. Before using these i used dr browns cherry flavor and she loved it, so this was an adjustment. the only thing i dont like about these is that they are very sticky unlike the dr brown brand.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the flavors and doesn&#x27;t mind me using them to clean her teeth.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who&#x27;s a dentist recommended these when my baby&#x27;s teeth started to come in. We liked how they were individually wrapped and could take them in my purse on the go</li>
            <li> these are awesome, my dentist told me, babies mouths a&#x27;re actually sterile, and they get their bacteria from those around them. My family doesn&#x27;t have the healthiest teeth, so I have been extra careful... needless to say, thank God...My daughter&#x27;s teeth are perfect...and very white too!!!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! They arrived just in time for my 9 month old&#x27;s first teeth. Baby and I are both very pleased with this product. She is very good about &amp;#34;brushing her teeth&amp;#34; to get her mouth and new teeth clean throughout the day and at night. However, she falls asleep nursing most of the time so getting a Spiffie before bed has become part of her routine. She likes the grape okay but really prefers the apple. Either flavor she uses right away. After I wipe down her teeth, gums, tongue, and roof of her mouth she chews and sucks on it for a few minutes, then when finished hands it back to me to dispose of. The wipes to have a bit of a stick to them so you will need to wash your hands (and baby&#x27;s if baby is helping) after use.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  If you can wipe the teeth with the S Spiffy then you can just as easily brush the teeth. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The best substitute for a toothbrush and easy to use.  I felt like I was getting my son&#x27;s mouth really clean with these!</li>
            <li> We chose these wipes in hope that it would make teeth cleaning go more smoothly with our 20 month old son, and so far it has.  We wipe his teeth and inside his mouth really well before brushing and feel that we&#x27;ve managed to get his teeth as clean as possible at this age.</li>
            <li> I used these a few times then decided it wasn&#x27;t really worth the trouble. My daughter didn&#x27;t like any of the flavors. I even tried chilling them in the fridge to help with teething but it didn&#x27;t make a difference. Plus she didn&#x27;t like me shoving a finger in her mouth - go figure! Instead, we started using a Baby Buddy 360 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My pedodontist told me that in a small percentage of cases (perhaps 5%), breastfeeding during the night can cause tooth decay in babies.  I was surprised to hear that, because I&#x27;ve read so much about the subject, and most babies with teeth can safely breastfeed at night and not develop decay.  However, my pedodontist has seen tooth decay firsthand in the babies of very well-informed parents who did everything &#x27;by the book&#x27;.  She wanted to make sure that I knew that although the risk is low, my baby could be at risk (and there&#x27;s no way to know if your child has the kind of teeth that will be at risk - until the damage is done).  For this reason, she recommended I stop breastfeeding during sleep hours (when a baby&#x27;s production of protective saliva is greatly reduced).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reluctant to do that, however, because my baby won&#x27;t drink cow&#x27;s or goat&#x27;s milk (and hates formula), and I produce much more milk at night than during the day.  Given those circumstances, she recommended this product, and my baby LOVES the taste of both the apple and the grape.  **BEFORE** I breastfeed her in the wee hours, I wipe out her mouth thoroughly with a Spiffie.  The package doesn&#x27;t say anything about this particular usage of the product, but I trust my pedodontist, who explained that by coating the teeth with zylitol (a wood sugar), you give the mouth&#x27;s bacteria something to eat rather than the natural sugar in breastmilk.  Somehow (the details of it escape me), this prevents the bacteria from attacking the baby&#x27;s teeth.  It&#x27;s still not as safe as brushing the teeth, then not breastfeeding until daylight hours, but it helps mitigate the risk of decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that my baby chomps on my finger -hard!- sometimes.  It helps if I use a finger on my other hand to prop her mouth open.  Another bonus is that the Spiffies really do seem to placate her if she&#x27;s teething.  She&#x27;ll really chomp down, suck hard on the Spiffie, and then relax and sleep better after being &#x27;Spiffied&#x27;.  Just be careful that you have a good hold on the Spiffie; my baby loves it so much she sucks really hard, and might swallow it if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> They seem to do their job. My son likes the taste of them.</li>
            <li> This are great for a quick brush-up when my toddler falls asleep before we can brush his teeth. Just gently wipe his teeth and gums and I don&#x27;t feel so bad about skipping a tooth-brushing. The flavors are tolerable and he doesn&#x27;t seem to mind. I keep them in my purse and in the diaper bag, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about toothpaste spilling out and making a mess.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found out about these sooner.&lt;br /&gt;We did early brushing with my son, but the older and stronger he got, the more difficult it was to brush.&lt;br /&gt;I also wish I would have corrected his lip tie and tongue tie. Brushing tears the upper lip where it&#x27;s attached to the base of his teeth, and they bleed.&lt;br /&gt;And like so many lip/tongue tied babies, his upper 4 teeth need major work- and now they&#x27;ll have to give him general anesthesia to fix them.&lt;br /&gt;I found these a little to late to have possibly avoided that, but it&#x27;s the only way I can consistently clean his teeth now, (or at least without having to enlist for help holding him down).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a huge battle. I feel like I&#x27;m wrestling a bear, and he does bite my finger- but,  I can feel where I&#x27;m cleaning, and can see a difference afterwards. And I really think the xylitol is preserving what&#x27;s left.&lt;br /&gt;After researching all the promising studies, I am also purchasing a bag of xylitol, as most study&#x27;s state potential benefits start at a higher dose than what&#x27;s likely in these wipes alone.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with these, but wish the wipe was bigger, and maybe more of a pocket design, where your fingers can slip in, rather than a flat small piece.&lt;br /&gt;If not handled right, or if your impulsive, autonomous demanding toddler wants to do it himself, and/or bites you, it&#x27;s easy to lose your grip on the wipe, and could be a choking hazard.&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t leave them alone with it and pay close attention.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second multipack box that I have bought for my household.&lt;br /&gt;I have also given with an accompanied gift for baby showers..&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> love spiffies! more importantly my toddler loves it.</li>
            <li> These are great for on-the-go and travel. I usually use the finger brush on a regular basis, but these come in handy if I don&#x27;t have easy access to the finger brush. I keep different rooms stocked with a few spiffies for convenience. My girls seem to like the flavor.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  My grandchildren are very susceptible to tooth decay and these were recommended by their dentist for times they were unable to brush after eating- at the mall etc..  They don&#x27;t seem to mind the taste.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these.  She actually opens her mouth to let me clean her teeth!  Before it used to be a real fight.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use to clean the teeth and gums of our 8 month old. Great alternative for our 2 year old when regular teeth brushing is not an option.</li>
            <li> These would be great if my 11 month old would let me use them on him!</li>
            <li> Love this for my baby. Very convenient to carry around in the handbag, diaper bag or even keep some in the car for cleaning on the go.</li>
            <li> Some people would not care to spend the money on these and just use wash cloths and water but for me they are well worth it.  We did not use these with my older son and he got cavities.  We used them with my daughter and she never got cavities.  Maybe it was just luck but I don&#x27;t think so. I really like these wipes!  The kids also didn&#x27;t mind the routine because the flavor is nice.</li>
            <li> I feel like these are more thorough than a toothbrush. My son loves the flavors and I love that they have xylitol to help prevent cavities.</li>
            <li> A waste of money. My baby doesn&#x27;t like the flavor.</li>
