            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Mmmm, I love how my hair feels since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>Was very excited about receiving product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m literally excited to wash my hair with this stuff and promptly have a nice cup of tea with honey after.</li>
            <li>It really is a good deal for how much product you get!</li>
            <li>It makes your hair really soft, which is exactly what I was going for!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I bought again because the first one had a excellent quality, but this opportunity the quality was not the same</li>
            <li>With Amazon&#x27;s free 2 day shipping, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>The big bottles are great and should last me a good while.</li>
            <li>Now I use it on untouched hair and it makes soft and clean and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and keeps my bleach damaged hair soft.</li>
            <li>I love my hair so much.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>Kind of the opposite of what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner smells amazing, but my hair feels a bit dry after using it.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re not the same formula as the original Oatmeal and Honey...</li>
            <li>Other than that issue, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I loved the old stuff, but this is just not good.</li>
            <li>I broke my straightener a month ago, but now I won&#x27;t even bother buying a new one.</li>
            <li>Works REALLY well with very damaged and dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine limp hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair SO soft and really helps with the overall health of your hair.</li>
            <li>But my curls have been soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I first tried this at a friend&#x27;s house and found my former products just didn&#x27;t give me the same feel.</li>
            <li>Another thing I am thrilled about is that you can use very, very small amounts with big, big results … lots of lather.  </li>
            <li>and it did really well with the damage and making it soft until it grew out long enough to cut out the damage.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of damage to my hair and this is the only thing that helps keep it soft and not frizzy.</li>

            <li> but I ordered 3 sets and every single one was spilled all over inside the packing and the lids were barely screwed on.</li>

            <li> Product is good but I ordered 3 sets and every single one was spilled all over inside the packing and the lids were barely screwed on.</li>
            <li> This has given me the softest, shinest hair I have ever had, and it smells SO GOOD!!! In addition, the Amazon price for the set was the same price as just the shampoo at Target. With Amazon&#x27;s free 2 day shipping, you can&#x27;t beat it. I will be ordering over, and over, and over again!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair SO soft and really helps with the overall health of your hair. I have a lot of damage to my hair and this is the only thing that helps keep it soft and not frizzy. Also it smells great!</li>
            <li> This is everything I want in a shampoo and conditioner!  The Oatmeal &amp; Honey shampoo and conditioner SMELL GREAT!  It smells like oatmeal &amp; honey WITH CINNAMON to me, and I love it!  Another thing I am thrilled about is that you can use very, very small amounts with big, big results … lots of lather.  This is like the same size Bed Head, which lasted me close to a year…but I love this scent more than any of theirs.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair really soft, which is exactly what I was going for!!!!!  However, it smells like a muffin that would be served to you for your morning  breakfast.  Not exactly what I want my hair to smell like.  I think id they are going to add oatmeal to shampoo, they could add the smell of blue berries, or something fresher than oatmeal cinnamon.  I just don&#x27;t find that smell appealing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to the way their oatmeal and honey products both smell and feel in my hair. I first tried this at a friend&#x27;s house and found my former products just didn&#x27;t give me the same feel. I&#x27;ve been using these for a week and I&#x27;m literally excited to wash my hair with this stuff and promptly have a nice cup of tea with honey after.</li>
            <li> Some people were thinking if you don&#x27;t buy from a salon it&#x27;s probably &amp;#34;watered-down&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve bought from both the Salon &amp; Amazon, product was identical but Amazon was half the price of the Salon price</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good.  I have fine limp hair.  I actually have some movement now</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair really bad, smells great though</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. great deal</li>
            <li> this product is amazing :)</li>
            <li> Mmmm, I love how my hair feels since I started using this product. I never used to leave my hair curly because it was embarrassing. But my curls have been soft and manageable. I broke my straightener a month ago, but now I won&#x27;t even bother buying a new one. I love my hair so much. And this smells so wonderful!</li>
            <li> Works REALLY well with very damaged and dry hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner were horrible. I actually gave them away. I think they&#x27;re not the same formula as the original Oatmeal and Honey...something has changed. I loved the old stuff, but this is just not good.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my hair feel! Soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! Leaves your hair soft and smelling good for days!! Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> This is like $30 a bottle in store. buy it here.  It smells amazing and keeps my bleach damaged hair soft.</li>
            <li> This was the second time that I bought those products. I bought again because the first one had a excellent quality, but this opportunity the quality was not the same and I don&#x27;t like the product anymore.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner. I used this when I fist killed my hair and it did really well with the damage and making it soft until it grew out long enough to cut out the damage. Now I use it on untouched hair and it makes soft and clean and smells amazing. It really is a good deal for how much product you get!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smells amazing, but my hair feels a bit dry after using it. Kind of the opposite of what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Was very excited about receiving product. The big bottles are great and should last me a good while. The beauty supply stores in my area do not carry this product so I had to order it online. The tops were not screwed on all the way so some spilled out into the package. Other than that issue, I love this product.</li>
