    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>They don&#x27;t do a very good job of holding up rollers.</li>
            <li>These clips are great when used with the metal clips that came with my curlers.  </li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>These clips fit the rollers perfectly and keep the curlers in place.</li>
            <li>These are great, and much better than the cheap clips I was trying to use.</li>
            <li>Love having these handy.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for and work great.</li>
            <li>Worked great as opposed to the two prong pins that came with the hot roller set.</li>
            <li>I bought a Conair instant heat hairsetter and I need the clips for best results</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>Very well-made, great replacement</li>
            <li>These are so much better than the U-shaped metal clips that come with the rollers.  </li>
            <li>This clip is okay</li>
            <li>so there ok by me</li>
            <li>Very good for heated rollers, pinning hair back etc.</li>
            <li>, I prefer these easy to use clips.  </li>
            <li>I am using them for the medium size rollers and for those they work fine.</li>
            <li>Do NOT look for a cheap alternative.</li>
            <li>they hold long hair beautifully.</li>
            <li>These clips are faster and easier to use than the pins that came with my conair hot rollers and they are easy to find if you drop them.  </li>
            <li>but I actually liked the other clips better.  </li>
            <li>This clips were exactly what I was looking for and will order again!</li>
            <li>The metal clips were too short to work effectively by themselves, but together they work.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these Conair Super Clips for my Conair Hot Rollers.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend them to anyone using hot rollers.</li>
            <li>These clips work well to hold my Conair hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I use them with bit sets of hot rollers I have.</li>
            <li>These new ones, although boxed as Conair Super Clips, do not even come close to the quality of the ones I already had.</li>
            <li>They barely work to keep my fine hair rolled in place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend them only to people that are lookig for a cheap alternative.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, I found them here for a reasonable price...</li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these clips.</li>
            <li>I like the the way they open and close around the curler and stay on while the heat and curl is absorbed.</li>
            <li>The Supper Clips are large enough to wrap around the curler.  </li>
            <li>I use them on rather large heated rollers and they open wide enough and grip just fine.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more than 10 to a box--needs to include at least 12.</li>
            <li>These clips open wide to hold the large size hot rollers and stay in place.</li>
            <li>These clips were a little cheaply made and the teeth were too long.  </li>
            <li>Clips snap right into place and hold curlers tightly.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would solve the problem of hot pins on the scalp and the clips dont clip tight enough, and dont hold your hair in place either.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the conair hot rollers but found the pins that came with them difficult to use, I wasn&#x27;t able to position the curlers tightly.</li>

            <li> They solved the problem of loose curlers that would not stay put.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect, still makes a mark in the front if you don&#x27;t push it back far enough.</li>
            <li> Other clips that I tried were not strong enough to keep the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> ;  These clips were too small for some of the larger rollers.  </li>
            <li> This clip did not have a hard enough grip to hold the curlers in place as well as the Luxor clamps</li>
            <li> If you have thick and/or long hair, these will not do the job.</li>
            <li> They hold the rollers tight.  </li>
            <li> The point is that the clips are weak and you can&#x27;t grab firmly you hair on the roll.</li>
            <li> bad curls !!!!!!</li>

            <li> These clips are faster and easier to use than the pins that came with my conair hot rollers and they are easy to find if you drop them.  Good value.</li>
            <li> As expected.........perfect.</li>
            <li> These clips were a little cheaply made and the teeth were too long.  I&#x27;d recommend them only to people that are lookig for a cheap alternative.  My advice? Do NOT look for a cheap alternative.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would solve the problem of hot pins on the scalp and the clips dont clip tight enough, and dont hold your hair in place either.</li>
            <li> This clips were exactly what I was looking for and will order again! These clips open wide to hold the large size hot rollers and stay in place.</li>
            <li> I bought a Conair instant heat hairsetter and I need the clips for best results so I bought it too. The point is that the clips are weak and you can&#x27;t grab firmly you hair on the roll. The result..... bad curls !!!!!!</li>
            <li> These clips are a must for the Conair jumbo rollers. LOVE THEM. they hold long hair beautifully.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the conair hot rollers but found the pins that came with them difficult to use, I wasn&#x27;t able to position the curlers tightly. These clips fit the rollers perfectly and keep the curlers in place. I highly recommend these clips.</li>
            <li> Clips snap right into place and hold curlers tightly. I love them.  I wish there were more than 10 to a box--needs to include at least 12.</li>
            <li> Bought these clips to go with the Conair travel size rollers.  They hold the rollers tight.  Would recommend them to anyone using hot rollers.</li>
            <li> .... so I&#x27;ve ordered these several times and will continue to order them as I need them.  I don&#x27;t like the prongs that come with rollers, I prefer these easy to use clips.  I recommend them.</li>
            <li> These clips work well to hold my Conair hot rollers.  Other clips that I tried were not strong enough to keep the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> I already had some of these that I bought 3 years ago at a brick-and-mortar beauty supply store. These new ones, although boxed as Conair Super Clips, do not even come close to the quality of the ones I already had. These are made from inferior plastic - not as rigid as the \\&quot;real\\&quot; ones - and they are ever so slightly smaller. They barely work to keep my fine hair rolled in place. If you have thick and/or long hair, these will not do the job. Buy \\&quot;real\\&quot; ones from a brick-and-mortar store.</li>
            <li> Do not like these clips.  They leave creases in your hair.</li>
            <li> Ive been looking all over for these and I am a hairstylist who has access to  beauty supply houses. Thankfully, I found them here for a reasonable price...thanks!</li>
            <li> Very well-made, great replacement</li>
            <li> Very good for heated rollers, pinning hair back etc.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, still makes a mark in the front if you don&#x27;t push it back far enough. When are they going to buy a vowel and make these rounder with fewer tongs to grip and make marks on your hair. I use them on rather large heated rollers and they open wide enough and grip just fine.</li>
            <li> Not quite like the clips that came with my Conair hair roller system - but they still do the trick. Love having these handy.</li>
            <li> I ordered these Conair Super Clips for my Conair Hot Rollers.  Despite being advertised as clips that can be used for any size roller they in fact are not &amp;#34;One Size Fits All.&amp;#34;  These clips were too small for some of the larger rollers.  I am using them for the medium size rollers and for those they work fine.</li>
            <li> These clips are great when used with the metal clips that came with my curlers.  They solved the problem of loose curlers that would not stay put.  The metal clips were too short to work effectively by themselves, but together they work.  I like that they will hold different sizes of curlers also.</li>
            <li> These are so much better than the U-shaped metal clips that come with the rollers.  A must buy!</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for and work great. I use them with bit sets of hot rollers I have.</li>
            <li> These are great, and much better than the cheap clips I was trying to use.</li>
            <li> I bought something similar to these at a local drug store and they fell apart and broke after 5 use&#x27;s, however, from the review&#x27;s on these one&#x27;s it looks like I won&#x27;t be having that problem with these. I look forward to there arrival.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do a very good job of holding up rollers. Stick with pins!</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner. Worked great as opposed to the two prong pins that came with the hot roller set. These work really well. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this clip and also the Luxor vented clamps.  This clip is okay but I actually liked the other clips better.  This clip did not have a hard enough grip to hold the curlers in place as well as the Luxor clamps</li>
            <li> This was purchased by my wife she like them but would not wright the reveiw so there ok by me</li>
            <li> The Supper Clips are large enough to wrap around the curler.  I like the the way they open and close around the curler and stay on while the heat and curl is absorbed.</li>
