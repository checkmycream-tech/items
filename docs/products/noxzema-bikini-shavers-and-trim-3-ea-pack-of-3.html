            <li>I love these razors and have not been able to find them in any stores locally.  </li>
            <li>But the picture on the main product page is misleading cause I wanted the razors with the red handles since they don&#x27;t have the plastic protection in front of the razor blade and in my own opinion works better for me.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are perfect bikini razors and now that I can&#x27;t buy them locally I have had to resort to ordering them online.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find these in the stores anymore. They are the best by far for intimate shaving. It&#x27;s rare that I get cut or even have a nick.</li>
            <li> I love these tiny razors!  Great for easy shaving of the bikini area and does not cause irritation.  I can usually get about 3 to 4 uses out of each razor.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by these! We used to buy them all the time in stores, but now the only place can find them is online. They&#x27;re kinda pricey, but my wife really likes them.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan for many years. Perfect size for women&#x27;s grooming.</li>
            <li> Awesome little razors, wish I had bought more . Reach everything and the moisturizing strip makes things smooth as silk!</li>
            <li> I love these razors and have not been able to find them in any stores locally.  I am so glad I can still get them from Amazon!!! They are perfect for bikini area!! Love them!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores anywhere anymore! They work great for those hard to get places. So glad I found them online!</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical of this, but it works. It is not the closet cut ever but it is really close and it left the least amount of razor burn I have ever had which is a miracle. I will buy again happily. But I will say the first one I used just wouldn&#x27;t save for some reason but the rest in the pack worked great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved these I just can&#x27;t seem to find them in the store anymore.</li>
            <li> Right now as I write this review a picture of the product comes up... the razors with the green handles. But when I click back on the link to view the product completely, it has a picture of the razors with the red handles. I&#x27;m ok that I got the one with the green handles since any bikini razor is better than no razor. But the picture on the main product page is misleading cause I wanted the razors with the red handles since they don&#x27;t have the plastic protection in front of the razor blade and in my own opinion works better for me.  But instead I got the one with the plastic protection in front of the blade, the razors with the green handles. I hope they fix these pictures up soon cause i was a bit disappointed when I received my package.</li>
            <li> Best bikini razors ever!! I used them all the time and suddenly I cannot find them in any store! It is the ONLY razor I ever used that didnt leave me itching like crazy &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;!! LOVE these things..guess I&#x27;m gonna have to stock up online! Used to get them at Walmart for like $1.50 a 3 pk..but i&#x27;ll pay more online..they are worth it!! :-D</li>
            <li> I went crazy when I could no longer find these locally.  I bought a huge lot to carry me through the winter.  These do much less damage when used in the shower than other razors.  Forget the twin, triple or more blades.  This one keeps me burn free.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these little razors anywhere else now. I&#x27;m glad I bought a bunch so I don&#x27;t run out anytime soon. I&#x27;m usually able to get a few uses out of each razor as long as I keep it out of the shower. I make sure longer hairs are trimmed short before shaving.I&#x27;m always afraid of cutting myself when I use normal razors and I usually make it a point to be extra gentle. With these bikini razors, I no longer worry.</li>
            <li> these are great for quick touch ups anywhere and everywhere ... fit easily in a purse and for some reason hard to find in a store - buy several packs - you will love them too</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find them anywhere any more! Best bikini razor ever! Why have stores quit carrying them.</li>
            <li> Searched all over the city - Why have stores stopped carrying them? -- I am so glad these are available on line!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these razors at any stores now. So I have to order them online. They are the best razors for the use. And for some reason stores quit selling them. I guess it was because they weren&#x27;t selling enough. But I find that hard to believe. Well at least they have them on amazon. Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have any other choice but to use the regular ones. I don&#x27;t like shaving that area with regular razors. Thanks amazon for keeping these please don&#x27;t get rid of them. :):):)[[ASIN:B001EJIMRO Noxzema Bikini Shaver]][[ASIN:B003M0436C Special pack of 5 NOXZEMA BIKINI RAZORS DISPOSABLE 3PK 3 per pack]]</li>
            <li> Upset that I couldn&#x27;t find them in the store anymore.  I love these razors for the bikini line and I don&#x27;t get razor bumps or ingrown hairs when I use them.</li>
