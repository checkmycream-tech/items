            <li>Good value for the price paid.</li>
            <li>I just love it! :)</li>
            <li>I would rather be able to easily use the bottle!</li>
            <li>I have always had sort of dry hair issues and received a sample of this product and was so impressed that I switched to it and have used it ever since!!!</li>
            <li>I have strait fine hair.</li>
            <li>so I bought this thinking it would smooth out my hair and help my split ends.</li>
            <li>It even works great as a deep conditioner!</li>
            <li>It may cost more but it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair and this works well on it.</li>
            <li>Best daily use conditioner with just the right amount of moisture for silky soft hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner but the large bottle is too big for me to use easily-</li>
            <li>I go to great lengths to get this product since it&#x27;s hard to find.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Sebastaian Drench is the best conditioner on the market for my thick, long hair.</li>
            <li>Well, it didn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li>, my hair doesn get greasy nearly as fast.</li>
            <li>I have frizzy curly hair and it took much of the frizz away.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This really works well ...</li>
            <li>I feel pretty confident that the contents have been mixed with another (likely substandard)</li>
            <li>This is the first time in a long time that my conditioner is sufficient without any additional product to keep my hair from full out frizz.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I purchased (2) large bottles of the Sabastian Drench Conditioner and after using it for about a week, I had to go to the salon and purchase another bottle as the conditioner in the bottles I ordered did not perform nearly as well as the conditioner I get at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Been using this conditioner for about 4 years, it&#x27;s worth the cost and lasts for several months.</li>
            <li>I live in an APO location-</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and recently, a new stylist (mine moved) said how shiny and soft my hair was when I went to get it cut.</li>
            <li>This conditioner made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and easy to brush through, but you can spend a lot less and get the same results.</li>
            <li>Love the conditioner but next time I might buy the smaller bottle even though it&#x27;s less of a value-</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and a lot of curly hair products just aren&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>It works well with fine hair to make it extra silky and calms down dry frizzies.</li>

            <li> My hair has a lot of body and tends to get frizzy so I bought this thinking it would smooth out my hair and help my split ends. Well, it didn&#x27;t really. You&#x27;re just as good off buying dove. One thing I did like about it though, my hair doesn get greasy nearly as fast. My hair is shiny and easy to brush through, but you can spend a lot less and get the same results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner along with the shampoo for years now. Makes my hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking. Have found no better shampoo/conditioner. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I used to have to drive an hour to the nearest mall to buy the 32 oz size. Such a relief for the convenience, not to mention the price on amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner but the large bottle is too big for me to use easily- I actually have to get my boyfriend to fill a smaller bottle with the conditioner for me.  Love the conditioner but next time I might buy the smaller bottle even though it&#x27;s less of a value- I would rather be able to easily use the bottle!</li>
            <li> Quite moisturizing. Have been using this brand for years.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing conditioner. It does exactly what it says it will do. It even works great as a deep conditioner! I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I purchased (2) large bottles of the Sabastian Drench Conditioner and after using it for about a week, I had to go to the salon and purchase another bottle as the conditioner in the bottles I ordered did not perform nearly as well as the conditioner I get at the salon.  I feel pretty confident that the contents have been mixed with another (likely substandard) conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Best daily use conditioner with just the right amount of moisture for silky soft hair.  I go to great lengths to get this product since it&#x27;s hard to find.  It may cost more but it is so worth it.  It&#x27;s the only product I need to use for my hair and Amazon.com had the best price.</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian products for decades. Their conditioners are great. I&#x27;m always worried when they eliminate a product and you have to switch. I shouldn&#x27;t. Drench is as good as the products that preceded it. It leave my hair shiny and makes women notice it, which is my goal. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my son, who wears his curly hair very long.  Not only does this help condition his hair, but he uses it as a leave-in conditioner to tame his hair and remove the frizz.  His hair looks great now!</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair so soft. I have frizzy curly hair and it took much of the frizz away.</li>
            <li> I love Sebastian Drench, unfortunately the sellers warehouse burnt down. I hope they can get back up and running soon. Good Luck!!!</li>

            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Been using this conditioner for about 4 years, it&#x27;s worth the cost and lasts for several months.

And you only need to use a tiny bit, a little goes a long way with this stuff. Definitely recommended for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair that tends to get a bit dry on the ends even though I don&#x27;t often use styling tools on it. This conditioner is a life saver! My stylist recommended Drench and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since and recently, a new stylist (mine moved) said how shiny and soft my hair was when I went to get it cut. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product!!</li>
            <li> Great product and my hair feels awesome using this product!  I just love it! :)</li>
