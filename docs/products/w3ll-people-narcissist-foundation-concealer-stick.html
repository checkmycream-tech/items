    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I recommend using a color chart by googling this product to see what color fits you best.</li>
            <li>The color I chose is perfect for my skin</li>
            <li>Quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>I like to apply it best with a foundation brush.  </li>
            <li>Also I bought the samples on the website of this for $1.50 to see which one worked best for me.  </li>
            <li>Still looked good after a night of dancing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best but its certainly better than the Laura Mercier concealer I used to use...and the great thing is, it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes!</li>
            <li>This foundation feels great on my skin and works wonders for under the eye coverup.</li>
            <li>Great naturalist concealer.</li>
            <li>Works great but pricey.</li>
            <li>I use the well people finishing powder in translucent on top and it looks perfect.</li>
            <li>One of the best cruelty free and organic foundations I&#x27;ve tried!  </li>
            <li>It does settle into the lines around my eyes a bit mid-morning, but I just blot it off and am good to go.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I expect a lot of my make-up, both that it be good for me and work well,</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, good coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn it to many weddings already and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this foundation stick!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone nicely.</li>
            <li>Make sure you moisturize good before use.  </li>
            <li>I liked number 1 2 &amp; 3.</li>
            <li>Good coverage and goes on easy.</li>
            <li>Color selection made it easy to find a good match for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>nice to know that this stick is actually healthy for your face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also great to use by itself because it gives my skin a nice glow and is much quicker than applying powdered foundation on days when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about many of the w3ll people products are how versatile they are...</li>
            <li>The color is perfect for me, gives great coverage, and one tube lasts me for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li>I do think it has made my skin look better though, so</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, nice &amp; light weight.</li>
            <li>Love the coverage and easy application.  </li>
            <li>on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database) and I feel good about putting it on my skin!</li>
            <li>This product is very light on your face yet provides adequate coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this foundation primarily as a concealer for 3 years now.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s light coverage, which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Its safe, natural and the coverage is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really clean product (rated a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I wear it over a bit of foundation primer to help it go on smoothly, and it provides really nice, natural looking coverage.</li>
            <li>This is a great concealer - full coverage, highly pigmented, and with ingredients that are natural and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well as a full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this and even better that you can toss it right in your bag to take with you on the go!</li>
            <li>Have only been using it for a couple weeks, but it goes on smooth and blends easily, and I love</li>
            <li>also found that it has a tendency to get kind of cakey if I use too much or don&#x27;t blend it in very well.</li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>
            <li>New style packaging is lovely.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this exact product!</li>
            <li>I just finished using RMS&#x27;s uncoverup and liked it, too, but ended up feeling like the Narcissist gave better coverage and settled less into my lines.  </li>
            <li>Completely  worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the stick, but I find it works best if I dot my face with the stick directly and then blend in with a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>This stick is easy to travel with and great for touch ups and should last a very long time!</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, all natural, and very portable to touch up anywhere.</li>
            <li>Full coverage makeup that&#x27;s not heavy on skin and doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li>I apply it in an upside down triangle under the eye and pat with my finger to warm it up.</li>
            <li>My skin has not broken out at all since I started using it.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m particularly looking to hide any breakouts though, this product doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage on its own.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>So far, I am really liking this foundation - however, it&#x27;s by no means &amp;#34;full coverage&amp;#34;, though I suppose you could build it up to achieve a fuller coverage.</li>
            <li>probably worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I normally use one layer blended in</li>
            <li>I had trouble finding an all natural makeup product that made my skin look as good as some of my other products.</li>
            <li>I use this on top of an undereye brightener for days when my circles are extra dark.</li>
            <li>The coverage is matte but still looks natural, without drying out the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and does not react to this foundation at all.</li>
            <li>It wears beautifully on mature skin and doesn&#x27;t even look like makeup.</li>
            <li>and then I seal it with an all natural powder foundation from &amp;#34;the all natural face&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>that is has natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>mostly use the narcissist foundation + concealer stick as a base for my mineral powder foundation because I find that the two combined provide much better coverage without having to use too much of either products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for a natural foundation without all those toxic ingredients, and W3LL People&#x27;s stick foundation is one of the only ones I could find.</li>
            <li>The stick packaging is great for travel but is a little difficult to apply on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Works particularly well for dark undereye circles.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So far so good. I use this on top of an undereye brightener for days when my circles are extra dark. A little goes a long way. I apply it in an upside down triangle under the eye and pat with my finger to warm it up. Doesn&#x27;t cake and crease.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I&#x27;m converted to the W3ll people line, and this product takes the cake. It&#x27;s easy to apply, all natural, and very portable to touch up anywhere. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great concealer - full coverage, highly pigmented, and with ingredients that are natural and clean. The stick packaging is great for travel but is a little difficult to apply on a daily basis. The coverage is matte but still looks natural, without drying out the skin. Works particularly well for dark undereye circles.</li>
            <li> This foundation feels great on my skin and works wonders for under the eye coverup. My skin has not broken out at all since I started using it. I recommend using a color chart by googling this product to see what color fits you best. The color I chose is perfect for my skin and I love it. It does give some shine to the skin when using so I use the well people finishing powder in translucent on top and it looks perfect. I will continue to buy this exact product! Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the W3ll People Narcissist for about a year now.  Love the coverage and easy application.  My skin is sensitive and does not react to this foundation at all.</li>
            <li> Just the stick. Quality is excellent. New style packaging is lovely.</li>
            <li> Great naturalist concealer. Works great but pricey. I have bought it again. It&#x27;s well as a full coverage foundation. I&#x27;ve worn it to many weddings already and it worked great. Still looked good after a night of dancing!</li>
            <li> I received this product as a sample from a storefront where I previously purchased products. I gave it to my mom because it wasn&#x27;t my shade and she absolutely loves it! It wears beautifully on mature skin and doesn&#x27;t even look like makeup. She can&#x27;t stop raving about it, so I may try to get it in a shade for me. If you want a no-makeup makeup look, you should definitely think about giving this a try.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about many of the w3ll people products are how versatile they are... This being one of those products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use the narcissist foundation + concealer stick as a base for my mineral powder foundation because I find that the two combined provide much better coverage without having to use too much of either products.&lt;br /&gt;It is also great to use by itself because it gives my skin a nice glow and is much quicker than applying powdered foundation on days when I&#x27;m in a hurry.

But overall, this product has become a staple in my makeup essentials!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foundation primarily as a concealer for 3 years now. The color is perfect for me, gives great coverage, and one tube lasts me for at least 6 months. I like to apply it best with a foundation brush.  It does settle into the lines around my eyes a bit mid-morning, but I just blot it off and am good to go.

All in all, I expect a lot of my make-up, both that it be good for me and work well, which Narcissist does both.  It&#x27;s a really clean product (rated a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database) and I feel good about putting it on my skin!</li>

            <li> Love this product! Good coverage and goes on easy. I use it daily and it last about 1.5 months.</li>
            <li> Favourite foundation hands down. Its safe, natural and the coverage is pretty good.  Also it is moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>

            <li> Full coverage makeup that&#x27;s not heavy on skin and doesn&#x27;t cake. Can also be used as a concealer. Doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> One of the best cruelty free and organic foundations I&#x27;ve tried!  Also works well as a concealer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best but its certainly better than the Laura Mercier concealer I used to use...and the great thing is, it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes!</li>

            <li> Bought this on a recommendation from a friend.  Have only been using it for a couple weeks, but it goes on smooth and blends easily, and I love that is has natural ingredients.  Would definitely think of purchasing again, but the only downside is the price!  I do think it has made my skin look better though, so probably worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I have only been using this for about a week. I have been on the hunt for a natural foundation without all those toxic ingredients, and W3LL People&#x27;s stick foundation is one of the only ones I could find. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the stick, but I find it works best if I dot my face with the stick directly and then blend in with a foundation brush. So far, I am really liking this foundation - however, it&#x27;s by no means &amp;#34;full coverage&amp;#34;, though I suppose you could build it up to achieve a fuller coverage. I normally use one layer blended in and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s light coverage, which is what I prefer.</li>
