            <li>Yes I loved it especially for my sinusitis!!!!!!</li>
            <li>B0029XNTEU Arm &amp; Hammer Super Wash Soda, Detergent Booster 55 oz (1559 g)]] and Borax</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Cheerful, pure, clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and seems to clear my nose and breathe easier.</li>
            <li>Several drops in a warm bath helps our colds and sinuses.  </li>
            <li>Not as effective as a product I tried earlier.  </li>
            <li>I put this in the steamer only once so far, smells very nice</li>
            <li>It does have a clean pure smell.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve gone from never having heard of this stuff before to making certain that I always have a supply on hand!</li>
            <li>And thats not trying to be funny</li>
            <li>and you dont want to have the Vicks Hot vaporiser running all day in your living room</li>
            <li>Plantlife is superior to every other manufacturer I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>I really just don&#x27;t get it.  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I always but this brand very stong and order it all the time.</li>
            <li>but thats the whole point.  </li>
            <li>and thats what really matters.  </li>

            <li>Not as strong as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>

            <li>The Eucalyptus 100% Pure essential Oil works really well in draining my sinuses.</li>
            <li>hubby caught a cold, so I sprinkled on cotton disks and place on the top of the humidifier to help him breath better.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I had been looking for and in a larger size bottle.  </li>
            <li>but also to apply EXTERNALLY below your nostrils to clear your sinuses, to use in aromatherapy and also to use just on a damp sponge to really freshen the way your space smells.</li>
            <li>When I use this oil in my shower or in a boiling pot of water, and take deep inhaling breaths, it clears my ongoing sinus problems very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put it directly into the water, but in the area where the vapors come out.</li>
            <li>It was such a small potent amount of oil</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m come to rely on Plantlife eucalyptus oil, not only for use in the laundry (a dozen drops along with a little liquid detergent and small handfuls of Arm &amp; Hammer Super Washing Powder [[ASIN:B0029XNTEU Arm &amp; Hammer Super Wash Soda, Detergent Booster 55 oz (1559 g)]] and Borax [[ASIN:B000R4LONQ TWENTY MULE TM BORAX]]) but also to apply EXTERNALLY below your nostrils to clear your sinuses, to use in aromatherapy and also to use just on a damp sponge to really freshen the way your space smells. Cheerful, pure, clean fragrance. Plantlife is superior to every other manufacturer I&#x27;ve found so far. So I&#x27;ve gone from never having heard of this stuff before to making certain that I always have a supply on hand! I would not want to be without it. Really a key find. Makes your life better.</li>
            <li> OK, not very strong when placed into water, Would not buy it again</li>
            <li> This is used in a Bissell steam mop.  The mop cleans fine, but the added Eucalyptus oil makes the entire house smell great!</li>
            <li> It was such a small potent amount of oil that I know I will need more.  It is much more efficient then over-processed oils.  A few swipes of  a very small amount brings a soothing effect.</li>

            <li> Use  this product in the sauna when I have sinus problems. Also put it on a tissue and breathe it in helps alot.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly. I have not used this oil yet, but the plan is to add a couple of drops of the oil to a warm moist cloth to relieve a stuffed up nose.</li>
            <li> And to use with my steamer. I put this in the steamer only once so far, smells very nice I like it</li>
            <li> Used with oil pulling</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> This is a bargain deal for Eucalyptus oil!  I use this in my daughter&#x27;s bath and humidifier when she is sick and it seems to help with her congestion.</li>

            <li> I use this oil mixed with water to spray my dog that is allergic to over the counter flea medications.  It works great.  I even spray it in my carpet and on my furniture to make sure there are no fleas anywhere else.  It has actually helped rid off some other summer bugs too.</li>
            <li> When I use this oil in my shower or in a boiling pot of water, and take deep inhaling breaths, it clears my ongoing sinus problems very well.  I recommend it to anyone with sinus infections or allergies.</li>
            <li> I have used it with the inhaler and it was great. I cleared the nose and kept my nose open.</li>
            <li> This was ordered to help freshen the air and get rid of odors in the hospital and nursing home by making an air freshener in a patient&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> Too small, overpriced</li>

            <li> I use the oil with a plug in diffuser and unlike my last oil, this one doesn&#x27;t last long.  It does have a clean pure smell.  It just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
