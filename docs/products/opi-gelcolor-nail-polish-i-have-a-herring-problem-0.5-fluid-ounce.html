            <li>Beautiful gray color with some silver sparkle in it.  </li>

            <li>, if you don&#x27;t already know, the OPI Gelcolor is really easy to soak off!</li>
            <li>I gave this item as well as one other OPI get color as a gift to a very good friend, and she was extremely happy with both of them.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>

            <li>Love OPI Gelcolor.</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>so maybe more appropriate for weekend fun depending on how conservative your employer culture is.</li>
            <li>love it great color has tiny tiny gold flec in the color and it added a great touch. .  .</li>
            <li>The color is fine, but you do need three coats to see what it is.</li>
            <li>Beautiful blue grey color with a great shimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a great grey color with flecks of gold in it.</li>

            <li>I love it ,its like a charchol grey with gold glitter in its one of my favorite opi gelcolor colors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments on how pretty it is!</li>

            <li>Love it, especially the color</li>

            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>Super shine, long wear, yet easy removal with the OPI or Sephora wraps</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried two coats and three coats and within 2-3 days I had large chips of the color gone.</li>
            <li>but I really did not like this one bit.</li>
            <li>It is a nice subtle grey with flakes of glitter that show up well in the light.  </li>
            <li>Fun color, mixed reviews from coworkers</li>
            <li>You need three coats to make it look normal.</li>
            <li>, sophisticated mid gray with subtle gold sparkle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nail tips are bare as polish would not adhere to them.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> , sophisticated mid gray with subtle gold sparkle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nail tips are bare as polish would not adhere to them.</li>
            <li> This color can range from a pale green to medium blue depending upon the clothing color that you wear and the type of light that you are in.  </li>
            <li> It is unfortunate that there is no photo of this product applied on someone&#x27;s nails because it is a very unique color.  </li>
            <li> grey with an undertone of blue/green and tiny gold specks!&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The color is a little weird, grey with sparkles, not so nice.</li>
            <li> I love this color I have worn it for at least 3 years!!!</li>
            <li> Inside,it is a grey polish with iridescent glitter.</li>
            <li> It is a dark grey with flecks of shimmer.  </li>
            <li> Will last at least a week to 2 weeks depending upon the abuse my hands take</li>
            <li> Seemed like it was watered down.</li>
            <li> A little sparkle in the color.</li>
            <li> It seems to go on watery and uneven.</li>
            <li> We thought we maybe had a bad bottle the first color we bought</li>
            <li> this is the first polish I have used that was so bad that I felt like taking it off as soon as it was put on.</li>
            <li> Goes on thin</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the polish chips off your nails within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> but sadly that doesn&#x27;t seem the case.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle</li>
            <li> This polish was HORRIBLE.</li>

            <li> This is my go to gel polish! It&#x27;s a beautiful blue/gray polish with shimmer. Goes on thin so a lot of coats are needed.</li>
            <li> nice blue gray shadow</li>
            <li> Love it, especially the color</li>
            <li> Came ahead of schedule. Beautiful color, grey with an undertone of blue/green and tiny gold specks!&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you don&#x27;t already know, the OPI Gelcolor is really easy to soak off!</li>
            <li> It is a nice subtle grey with flakes of glitter that show up well in the light.  It is similar to automobiles with metal flakes in the paint coat that adds depth and beauty to the polish.</li>
            <li> It is my first try with OPI gel colors and I love it.  Nice gel to work with.  This color can range from a pale green to medium blue depending upon the clothing color that you wear and the type of light that you are in.  Will last at least a week to 2 weeks depending upon the abuse my hands take (I am in the water alot).</li>
            <li> The color is a little weird, grey with sparkles, not so nice. But if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, the quality is great as always</li>
            <li> Must have color. I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it. Beautiful blue grey color with a great shimmer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color. Brought it to wear for vacation, and it was a hit. A little sparkle in the color. This color so far is my favorite gel color.</li>
            <li> This is a great grey color with flecks of gold in it. Its great alone. No shrinkage here! Goes on really smooth!</li>
            <li> Beautiful gray color with some silver sparkle in it.  Love OPI Gelcolor. It is the only one I use on my nails</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> Fun color, mixed reviews from coworkers so maybe more appropriate for weekend fun depending on how conservative your employer culture is.</li>
            <li> I gave this item as well as one other OPI get color as a gift to a very good friend, and she was extremely happy with both of them.  Pretty color.</li>
            <li> I love it ,its like a charchol grey with gold glitter in its one of my favorite opi gelcolor colors</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous color but unfortunately the polish chips off your nails within a couple of days. We&#x27;ve tried two coats and three coats and within 2-3 days I had large chips of the color gone. This is our second OPI gel polish to do this. We thought we maybe had a bad bottle the first color we bought but sadly that doesn&#x27;t seem the case.  I will not be buying OPI gel polish ever again.</li>
            <li> This is the only OPI gel product I dislike. It seems to go on watery and uneven. You need three coats to make it look normal. The color is fine, but you do need three coats to see what it is.</li>
            <li> Amazon is blocking my feedback .. incredibly satisfied!</li>
            <li> Good product, prompt delivery&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, sophisticated mid gray with subtle gold sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a number of gel polishes but OPI is the best. Super shine, long wear, yet easy removal with the OPI or Sephora wraps</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate that there is no photo of this product applied on someone&#x27;s nails because it is a very unique color.  It is a dark grey with flecks of shimmer.  I really loved this and I got a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> love it great color has tiny tiny gold flec in the color and it added a great touch. .  .</li>
            <li> This is a \\&quot;chameleon\\&quot; colour in my opinion. Outdoors, it&#x27;s a greyish blue polish with blue and gold glitter. Inside,it is a grey polish with iridescent glitter. I was unsure about it at first but, have totally fallen in love with this colour!! I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments on how pretty it is!</li>
            <li> This polish was HORRIBLE. It did not cover my nails as it should. Seemed like it was watered down. Nail tips are bare as polish would not adhere to them. I have been using OPI for quite a while and this is the first polish I have used that was so bad that I felt like taking it off as soon as it was put on. Maybe I got a bad bottle but I really did not like this one bit.</li>
            <li> I love this color I have worn it for at least 3 years!!! I wish OPI hadn&#x27;t discontined it!! So very Thankful Amazon Has it!!</li>
