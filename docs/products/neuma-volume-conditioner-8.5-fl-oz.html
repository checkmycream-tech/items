            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product and I love it. It isn&#x27;t heavy on my hair and leaves it shiny and smelling nice.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo and the conditioner on a regular basis. It does provide the added volume to my fine hair. I also switch off with the moisturizing version when my hair feels dry. Dollar for dollar, it ranks up there with the more expensive brands in terms of quality.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.  Hair feels healthy and does not frizz.  Leaves nice shine and is a great detangler.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I could not use this product because of the odor.</li>
            <li> I used with Neuma Reneu Shampoo but I do not feel the combination worked well for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best good for fine hair..my hair styles great after the drying process.. of course it is all about product to get your hair to do what you want it to!</li>
            <li> I hesitated when I read the reviews.  This is a good conditioner, but I found applying it to the ends gave great results.  Whole-head application was less satisfactory because my fine hair didn&#x27;t get the lift I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and love the moisture it provides.</li>
            <li> Love this product and cheaper to purchase through Amazon rather than your hair stylist.</li>
            <li> This does not condition AT ALL.  I love Neuma products but this one really let me down.  It had a crack in the bottom upon arrival.  I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine introduced me to the Neuma products!  They are the best products in the world.  I have become a huge fan of all their products!  My hair finally has body!</li>
            <li> Sample at store was alot better</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it in combination with the Neuma Volume Shampoo and love the results. Recommended to me by my stylist, but costs less on Amazon than in the salon.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted and you got it here quickly, even at Christmas, one of the busiest times of the year. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I USUALLY DON&#x27;T HAVE TROUBLE WITH GETTING VOLUME IN MY HAIR EXCEPT FOR THE WINTER MONTHS AND THIS WORKS WONDERS!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this condition.  My hair is over processed due to excessive blow drying and coloring.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner leaves my hair feeling thicker, healthier, softer and gives me more volume,</li>
            <li> My new favorite conditioner! Smells great, love that it&#x27;s natural and makes my hair soft and shiny! Wish it lasted a little longer though!</li>
            <li> Have used this product before and thinks it&#x27;s on the list of best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not greasy, doesn&#x27;t make your hair droop and helps with the frizz.  I also love the smell!</li>
            <li> Yuck! Made my fine, thin, hair tacky and smell terrible. I&#x27;m using it as a shaving gel so as not to make it a total waste.</li>
            <li> Great products. Cute packaging!</li>
