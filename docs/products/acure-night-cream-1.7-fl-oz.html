            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>People have started commenting on my skin, smoother, tighter...and it&#x27;s got a nice underlying scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, not too oily, and with great lavender scent!</li>
            <li>My skin is really doing awesome,  </li>
            <li>This cream has a really nice lavender sent and seems to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>I was honestly offended by the suggestion of using another life for my own vanity.  </li>
            <li>This cream has been the best I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>Mostly drugstore $20/ per package varieties although I did buy one of hers that worked nicely too.  </li>
            <li>It smelled good and was fairly light.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love this night cream.  </li>
            <li>I love Acure night cream</li>
            <li>I normally love the process of moisturizing my face at night</li>
            <li>Light but effective night moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Lovely calming lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love this cream - just ordered another.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Acure works for so many people.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more and additional Acure products.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this night cream/lotion.</li>
            <li>And I love love love the ingredients list.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and they way my skin feels after I put it on.</li>
            <li>I love the Acure line of skin care, however this product for me is just so-so.  </li>
            <li>Great, gentle hydrating cream.</li>
            <li>It appears softer and a bit more youthful.  </li>
            <li>I simply love this stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s changed my life! :)</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I use it at night on top of Acure&#x27;s Argan oil.</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients, smell and texture.</li>
            <li>THIS CREAM IS OKAY...</li>
            <li>BUT MOST ORGANIC PRODUCTS HAVE THAT PROBLEM....</li>
            <li>Love that when you put this on at night, you can feel it working</li>
            <li>My acne has improved MUCH more than using prescription retinoids and antibiotics.</li>
            <li>Love the lavendar smell, which is relaxing.</li>
            <li>I really love Acure products</li>
            <li>Have been using this a couple years - love it.</li>
            <li>I love this night cream.  </li>
            <li>Love love that this company is also cruelty free!</li>
            <li>My skin looks great and is very healthy for my age but this night cream just didn&#x27;t feel dewy enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Does a really nice job at moisturizing, have a nice light lavender scent which is lovely right before bed to help you relax before sleep.</li>
            <li>For the first week I loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very lovely and strong lavender scent that fades dramatically over time (20 minutes?).</li>
            <li>It is not as strong at fighting signs of aging as more chemically laden creams, but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>I see a more even skin tone and smoothness to fine lines around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li>but I would describe the result as dewy, perfect for dry skin like mine!</li>
            <li>This night cream has a light lavender scent, which I love, and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I would call it an herbal scent, but extremely strong.</li>
            <li>IT HAS A REALLY STRONG SMELL...</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this brand at Whole Foods a while ago, and was pleased as punch to see it available for Prime at a much better price!</li>
            <li>Effective night cream at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It makes my face smooth and soft without any greasiness, and the fragrance is light and great.</li>
            <li>and i noticed my skin became smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I want to love this brand, but I&#x27;ve only been impressed with the eye crEam so far.</li>
            <li>It is light, creamy, and hydrating.</li>
            <li>Light, non greasy cream</li>
            <li>Perfect weight -- not too light or heavy</li>
            <li>and I credit my young complexion (at 57) to it, along with a good skin routine.</li>
            <li>Loved the scent and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am in love with all acure products right now.</li>
            <li>simply amazing and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I use it when I run out of the orange-y day cream, or whenever I want a rich, soothing moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I find this skin cream has significantly reduced those</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference in my skin when I wake up.</li>
            <li>I made a quick assumption with out all the facts and was too quick to get offended on that one!  </li>
            <li>I have dealt with sensitive skin for forever - since elementary school I&#x27;ve been fighting the good</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and leaves skin feeling tight - in a good way!</li>
            <li>My skin is combination, and this night cream is just right for me!</li>
            <li>so I love that this cream is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using many of Acure&#x27;s products and I&#x27;ve loved all except the hydrating toner, which made my skin break out into little bumps.</li>
            <li>I wake up with fresh, clean feeling skin.</li>
            <li>Has not caused any issues with breakouts and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs into my combination skin quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs super quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling after.</li>
            <li>One of the few products without phenoxyethanol, that smells good and penetrates your skin easily without leaving you feeling oily</li>
            <li>It has all natural ingredients which I love too.</li>
            <li>I finally have a skin care regimen that my skin is loving.</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning with soft, healthy skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that I&#x27;ve always battled acne and used all sorts of acne products.</li>
            <li>Also pretty sure I reviewed this night cream in the smaller size, so.. now that I order the larger size, it&#x27;s just that much more convenient and a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and in the morning my face looks super smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>Back to the night cream, it smells amazing,  much like their lavender body lotion.</li>
            <li>It also smell good and subtle, non greasy and light.</li>
            <li>Great night cream that is thick and firming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using firming creams for 2 years now, ever since I lost weight and wanted more help with toning, and I have to say this is the first brand that has actually produced results!</li>
            <li>I love all of the Acure line and use it daily.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my skin look better when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll start by saying that when I first used the Night Cream I did not like it.</li>
            <li>I buy it on Amazon because the price at Whole Foods is a lot higher.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and becomes imflammed quickly.</li>
            <li>makes your face feel nice and tight after applying.</li>
            <li>The cream is very soothing to my skin, and I love the way it looks the morning after: less red, more even texture, and moist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really getting hooked on Acure products.</li>
            <li>Skin smooth and owing after only 1 wk of use</li>
            <li>i wanted a product to wear at night but gentle.</li>
            <li>I tried the serum by itself and it didn&#x27;t do much without the night cream.</li>
            <li>My skin is also much softer.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>whole skin care line has done me wonders.</li>
            <li>BUT I&#x27;m still very moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s mostly responsible for clearing my acne.</li>
            <li>Feels nice going on and left my super dry skin soft and supple in the morning.</li>
            <li>this cream is a very gentle natural product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily I found something that works soon after and my face is now clear (for the first time in YEARS).</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to cream!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I used eminence before this but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price tag</li>
            <li>Using this with a high potency Vitamin C serum to reduce my sun damage.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>During the winter when my skin was super dry, it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin, but neither did anything else I used.</li>
            <li>I think that the Night Cream specifically is very balancing for sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>, it has very subtle and pleasant lavender scent.</li>
            <li>skin is older but still very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s part of my &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without it&amp;#34; list.</li>
            <li>I do have super dry skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have been using this for over a year.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is VERY sensitive</li>
            <li>I have to add a few drops of argan oil on top to really feel like im actually nourishing my face.</li>
            <li>After the first use, my skin was hyrdrated the following morning</li>
            <li>I have used the Acure Night Cream sporadically, yet still see positive results in the overall tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my dry skin, and feels very chalky.</li>
            <li>In general, I think Acure products are natural, affordable, and high quality.</li>
            <li>Working well so far - almost to the point of not using concealer on my spots.</li>
            <li>I gave it a shot as I have both medication induced and adult acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the few that genuinely appears to work.</li>
            <li>I wash my face with Dr Bronners Tea tree, and use diva wash on my body with a natural loofah.</li>
            <li>I know that some users have complained about the &amp;#34;strong smell,&amp;#34; but I love it.</li>
            <li>It made those worse instead of better and also doesn&#x27;t smell very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell when you first apply it, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant and it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>However, when I added the Seriously Firming Serum, it seemed to work better.</li>
            <li>In comparison to Acure&#x27;s Day Cream it just doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth, the application feels rough and dry.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and my skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li>Unlike the other brand I used earlier, it dries up so quickly</li>
            <li>I mixed it half and half with the Acure Day cream that I had purchased to give it a creamier consistency and to be able to utilize and not waste the product that I&#x27;d purchased.  </li>
            <li>I thought: &amp;#34;Great, I don&#x27;t have the dollars for a face lift&amp;#34;, but I kept up with this cream (which I used in the morning because its light enough) and today I have far less (exceptable) loose</li>
            <li>I HAVE FRAGILE SENSITIVE ALLERGY PRONE SKIN, WHEN I PUT IT ON IT</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my skin has a matte look like freshly washed and dried skin</li>
            <li>This combination is amazing for my dry skin, made even worse by the desert climate.</li>
            <li>No breakouts and no dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However I have very sensitive skin and typically break out with new products and this product did not break me out at all.</li>
            <li>Somehow it works really well with all skin types (since I&#x27;m a little bit of everything).</li>
            <li>I will warn you that the serum is very oily and to use as little as possible when you apply it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great, gentle hydrating cream.</li>
            <li> It appears softer and a bit more youthful.  </li>
            <li> I simply love this stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s changed my life! :)</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I use it at night on top of Acure&#x27;s Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients, smell and texture.</li>
            <li> THIS CREAM IS OKAY...</li>
            <li> BUT MOST ORGANIC PRODUCTS HAVE THAT PROBLEM....</li>
            <li> Love that when you put this on at night, you can feel it working</li>
            <li> My acne has improved MUCH more than using prescription retinoids and antibiotics.</li>
            <li> Love the lavendar smell, which is relaxing.</li>
            <li> I really love Acure products</li>
            <li> Have been using this a couple years - love it.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream.  </li>
            <li> Love love that this company is also cruelty free!</li>
            <li> My skin looks great and is very healthy for my age but this night cream just didn&#x27;t feel dewy enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Does a really nice job at moisturizing, have a nice light lavender scent which is lovely right before bed to help you relax before sleep.</li>
            <li> For the first week I loved it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very lovely and strong lavender scent that fades dramatically over time (20 minutes?).</li>
            <li> It is not as strong at fighting signs of aging as more chemically laden creams, but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I see a more even skin tone and smoothness to fine lines around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li> but I would describe the result as dewy, perfect for dry skin like mine!</li>
            <li> This night cream has a light lavender scent, which I love, and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I would call it an herbal scent, but extremely strong.</li>
            <li> IT HAS A REALLY STRONG SMELL...</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this brand at Whole Foods a while ago, and was pleased as punch to see it available for Prime at a much better price!</li>
            <li> Effective night cream at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It makes my face smooth and soft without any greasiness, and the fragrance is light and great.</li>
            <li> and i noticed my skin became smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I want to love this brand, but I&#x27;ve only been impressed with the eye crEam so far.</li>
            <li> It is light, creamy, and hydrating.</li>
            <li> Light, non greasy cream</li>
            <li> Perfect weight -- not too light or heavy</li>
            <li> and I credit my young complexion (at 57) to it, along with a good skin routine.</li>
            <li> Loved the scent and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am in love with all acure products right now.</li>
            <li> simply amazing and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I use it when I run out of the orange-y day cream, or whenever I want a rich, soothing moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I find this skin cream has significantly reduced those</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference in my skin when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I made a quick assumption with out all the facts and was too quick to get offended on that one!  </li>
            <li> I have dealt with sensitive skin for forever - since elementary school I&#x27;ve been fighting the good</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and leaves skin feeling tight - in a good way!</li>
            <li> My skin is combination, and this night cream is just right for me!</li>
            <li> so I love that this cream is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using many of Acure&#x27;s products and I&#x27;ve loved all except the hydrating toner, which made my skin break out into little bumps.</li>
            <li> I wake up with fresh, clean feeling skin.</li>
            <li> Has not caused any issues with breakouts and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs into my combination skin quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs super quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling after.</li>
            <li> One of the few products without phenoxyethanol, that smells good and penetrates your skin easily without leaving you feeling oily</li>
            <li> It has all natural ingredients which I love too.</li>
            <li> I finally have a skin care regimen that my skin is loving.</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning with soft, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that I&#x27;ve always battled acne and used all sorts of acne products.</li>
            <li> Also pretty sure I reviewed this night cream in the smaller size, so.. now that I order the larger size, it&#x27;s just that much more convenient and a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and in the morning my face looks super smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Back to the night cream, it smells amazing,  much like their lavender body lotion.</li>
            <li> It also smell good and subtle, non greasy and light.</li>
            <li> Great night cream that is thick and firming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using firming creams for 2 years now, ever since I lost weight and wanted more help with toning, and I have to say this is the first brand that has actually produced results!</li>
            <li> I love all of the Acure line and use it daily.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my skin look better when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll start by saying that when I first used the Night Cream I did not like it.</li>
            <li> I buy it on Amazon because the price at Whole Foods is a lot higher.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and becomes imflammed quickly.</li>
            <li> makes your face feel nice and tight after applying.</li>
            <li> The cream is very soothing to my skin, and I love the way it looks the morning after: less red, more even texture, and moist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really getting hooked on Acure products.</li>
            <li> Skin smooth and owing after only 1 wk of use</li>
            <li> i wanted a product to wear at night but gentle.</li>
            <li> I tried the serum by itself and it didn&#x27;t do much without the night cream.</li>
            <li> My skin is also much softer.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> whole skin care line has done me wonders.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;m still very moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s mostly responsible for clearing my acne.</li>
            <li> Feels nice going on and left my super dry skin soft and supple in the morning.</li>
            <li> this cream is a very gentle natural product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily I found something that works soon after and my face is now clear (for the first time in YEARS).</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to cream!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used eminence before this but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price tag</li>
            <li> Using this with a high potency Vitamin C serum to reduce my sun damage.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> During the winter when my skin was super dry, it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin, but neither did anything else I used.</li>
            <li> I think that the Night Cream specifically is very balancing for sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> , it has very subtle and pleasant lavender scent.</li>
            <li> skin is older but still very sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s part of my &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without it&amp;#34; list.</li>
            <li> I do have super dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been using this for over a year.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is VERY sensitive</li>
            <li> I have to add a few drops of argan oil on top to really feel like im actually nourishing my face.</li>
            <li> After the first use, my skin was hyrdrated the following morning</li>
            <li> I have used the Acure Night Cream sporadically, yet still see positive results in the overall tone of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my dry skin, and feels very chalky.</li>
            <li> In general, I think Acure products are natural, affordable, and high quality.</li>
            <li> Working well so far - almost to the point of not using concealer on my spots.</li>
            <li> I gave it a shot as I have both medication induced and adult acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few that genuinely appears to work.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with Dr Bronners Tea tree, and use diva wash on my body with a natural loofah.</li>
            <li> I know that some users have complained about the &amp;#34;strong smell,&amp;#34; but I love it.</li>
            <li> It made those worse instead of better and also doesn&#x27;t smell very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell when you first apply it, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant and it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> However, when I added the Seriously Firming Serum, it seemed to work better.</li>
            <li> In comparison to Acure&#x27;s Day Cream it just doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth, the application feels rough and dry.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and my skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other brand I used earlier, it dries up so quickly</li>
            <li> I mixed it half and half with the Acure Day cream that I had purchased to give it a creamier consistency and to be able to utilize and not waste the product that I&#x27;d purchased.  </li>
            <li> I thought: &amp;#34;Great, I don&#x27;t have the dollars for a face lift&amp;#34;, but I kept up with this cream (which I used in the morning because its light enough) and today I have far less (exceptable) loose</li>
            <li> I HAVE FRAGILE SENSITIVE ALLERGY PRONE SKIN, WHEN I PUT IT ON IT</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning my skin has a matte look like freshly washed and dried skin</li>
            <li> This combination is amazing for my dry skin, made even worse by the desert climate.</li>
            <li> No breakouts and no dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I have very sensitive skin and typically break out with new products and this product did not break me out at all.</li>
            <li> Somehow it works really well with all skin types (since I&#x27;m a little bit of everything).</li>
            <li> I will warn you that the serum is very oily and to use as little as possible when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Have not had it long enough to give a proper review</li>
            <li> No sure how long it will continue to work as I get older,</li>
            <li> It is a little thick, so I often use a little California Baby Healing and Soothing Spray mixed with the Acure Night Cream to make it easier to smooth all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> , I found that it felt really dry as a cream</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin this will probably work for you.</li>
            <li> I pair the night cream with their seriously firming serum (it&#x27;s really an oil blend), which is my holy grail serum/facial oil.</li>
            <li> I was freaked when I lost 45 pounds and that caused loose shin in my face.</li>
            <li> but I really do not like putting this stuff on.</li>
            <li> After a beauty Dr. at a medical spa convinced me that moisturizer was the missing component in m y beauty routine</li>
            <li> No longer need botox, but I found that I do have to use it every day or almost everyday or frown lines on forehead come back.  </li>
            <li> Organic and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very small amount and doesn&#x27;t go far due to the consistency (not very rich..</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; in other products trigger headaches for me</li>
            <li> The serum eventually sinks into your skin and feels less greasy.</li>
            <li> Could be a little heavier for me, my skin is little dry.</li>
            <li> The big negative is the scent.  </li>
            <li> I am not super fond of the smell</li>
            <li> besides being organic and not full of chemicals, it works.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel tight and tacky</li>
            <li> THis leaves my skin feeling mosturized but without the redness i usually get from other produts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try according to the reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work in my case (and does have a bad smell).</li>
            <li> I remove my makeup with a few drops of grapeseed oil on a washcloth.</li>
            <li> FOR A FEW WEEKS</li>
            <li> 1.75oz is quite small bottle...</li>
            <li> I read the complaint that it&#x27;s rather heavy</li>
            <li> The tube is rather small</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because of some of the reviewers having dry skin from using.  </li>
            <li> I just have a hard time using it, knowing I have to plug my nose before applying it to my face at night.</li>
            <li> Ingredients rate very low on toxicity scale via Think Dirty.  </li>
            <li> I even went home and complained to my husband.  </li>
            <li> I use it with the Seriously Firming Serum every night</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no harsh nasty stuff in Acure.</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t wake up looking like a disgusting greasy mess.</li>
            <li> IT DOESNT HAVE A LOT OF BAD THINGS IN IT....</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed with this night cream.</li>
            <li> The smell is unpleasant but the consistency is the worst part.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just this very cold weather!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice night cream with good ingredients. I am not super fond of the smell but it&#x27;s okay. It is not as strong at fighting signs of aging as more chemically laden creams, but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Like that it&#x27;s not greasy. Could even be used for day cream because it makes the skin matte.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream.  Goes on smooth and leaves skin feeling tight - in a good way!</li>
            <li> The smell is enough to knock your socks off.  What IS that smell in some of the Acure products?  I just have a hard time using it, knowing I have to plug my nose before applying it to my face at night.</li>
            <li> I like this cream - been using it for a month now with the radical wrinkle reducer.  I have not noticed any change in my appearance with this regimen though. The big negative is the scent.  My husband can&#x27;t stand it.  I don&#x27;t mind it.  I would call it an herbal scent, but extremely strong.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good night cream for ages. I love Acure night cream because I don&#x27;t wake up looking like a disgusting greasy mess. Somehow it works really well with all skin types (since I&#x27;m a little bit of everything). I buy it on Amazon because the price at Whole Foods is a lot higher.</li>
            <li> Great night cream that is thick and firming. Neutral smell too.</li>
            <li> Great price...and stuff....</li>
            <li> GreAt product.. Been using it for 3 days now and i noticed my skin became smooth and hydrated. It also smell good and subtle, non greasy and light. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Organic and a little goes a long way. I did not expect a miracle as I am 62, but it is a great moisturizer for all times of the day or night.</li>
            <li> Skin feels great in the morning. Smell is not my favourite but I got used to it.</li>
            <li> Does a really nice job at moisturizing, have a nice light lavender scent which is lovely right before bed to help you relax before sleep. Has not caused any issues with breakouts and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  Ingredients rate very low on toxicity scale via Think Dirty.  Product leaves skin feeling moisterized.</li>
            <li> i have no word to express i impressed i am with this product.  simply amazing and highly recommend it.  you will see a difference within 24 hours to your skin.</li>
            <li> Very small amount and doesn&#x27;t go far due to the consistency (not very rich.. Seems like a regular hand lotion consistency). I used eminence before this but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price tag so I decided to give this a try. Eminence lasts forever! However I have very sensitive skin and typically break out with new products and this product did not break me out at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this night cream, I found that it felt really dry as a cream and I wasn&#x27;t happy with my purchase.  I mixed it half and half with the Acure Day cream that I had purchased to give it a creamier consistency and to be able to utilize and not waste the product that I&#x27;d purchased.  I am not at all impressed with it and I would never recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ughhh. I am not a wasteful person but if I was this product would be in the trash. The smell is unpleasant but the consistency is the worst part. I normally love the process of moisturizing my face at night but I really do not like putting this stuff on. I have to add a few drops of argan oil on top to really feel like im actually nourishing my face. Plus, it does not have a good review on beautypedia, I wish I would have read that before I purchased this</li>
            <li> Light but effective night moisturizer.  Lovely calming lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> Perfect weight -- not too light or heavy</li>
            <li> The cream is silky and provide you excellent moisture  for your skin. I also love the smell. All Acure products have quality.</li>
            <li> Love it! One of the few products without phenoxyethanol, that smells good and penetrates your skin easily without leaving you feeling oily</li>
            <li> Where has this stuff been all my life?!?! People have started commenting on my skin, smoother, tighter...and it&#x27;s got a nice underlying scent.</li>
            <li> This cream has been the best I have tried so far.  I put on at night and a bit on my forehead and cheeks in the morning.  I have very sensitive skin and have been using this for over a year.  I see a more even skin tone and smoothness to fine lines around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve just fallen in love with ACURE products and the night cream is amazing just like the day cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really getting hooked on Acure products. Also pretty sure I reviewed this night cream in the smaller size, so.. now that I order the larger size, it&#x27;s just that much more convenient and a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very lovely and strong lavender scent that fades dramatically over time (20 minutes?). The cream is very soothing to my skin, and I love the way it looks the morning after: less red, more even texture, and moist. I use it when I run out of the orange-y day cream, or whenever I want a rich, soothing moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is combination, and this night cream is just right for me! It&#x27;s very moisturizing, not too oily, and with great lavender scent! Unlike the other brand I used earlier, it dries up so quickly and I had to apply twice.&lt;br /&gt;The only compliant is I hope this cream can come with a larger size. 1.75oz is quite small bottle...</li>
            <li> Love this cream - just ordered another. Using this with a high potency Vitamin C serum to reduce my sun damage. Working well so far - almost to the point of not using concealer on my spots. It has all natural ingredients which I love too. I read the complaint that it&#x27;s rather heavy but I would describe the result as dewy, perfect for dry skin like mine!</li>
            <li> This cream I use night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs into my combination skin quickly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good for soothing my over stressed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am tend to occasional breakouts and I find this skin cream has significantly reduced those occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be without this cream.  Best thing to happen to my skin. And I&#x27;ve tried prescriptions and all kinds of products that just couldn&#x27;t do what this cream does for me.</li>
            <li> I HAVE FRAGILE SENSITIVE ALLERGY PRONE SKIN, WHEN I PUT IT ON IT BURNS MY SKIN, I SHOULD NOT HAVE CONTINUED USING IT, AFTER 3 DAYS OF USING IT MY SKIN LOOKS BURNT, IT&#x27;S RED AND SWOLLEN.</li>
            <li> Great product. Skin smooth and owing after only 1 wk of use</li>
            <li> this cream is a very gentle natural product.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is older but still very sensitive. i wanted a product to wear at night but gentle. THis leaves my skin feeling mosturized but without the redness i usually get from other produts.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this brand at Whole Foods a while ago, and was pleased as punch to see it available for Prime at a much better price! Both the face cream and the body cream are out of this world! I&#x27;ve been using firming creams for 2 years now, ever since I lost weight and wanted more help with toning, and I have to say this is the first brand that has actually produced results! My neck is smoother than ever.</li>
            <li> besides being organic and not full of chemicals, it works.  I use it during day and night on my neck and face.  i do not need to by eye cream or something for around my mouth bc this works all over, so saves me $$ that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Acure works for so many people. I gave it a shot as I have both medication induced and adult acne. It made those worse instead of better and also doesn&#x27;t smell very good.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I found something that works soon after and my face is now clear (for the first time in YEARS). It&#x27;s worth a try according to the reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work in my case (and does have a bad smell).</li>
            <li> absolutely amazing. makes your face feel nice and tight after applying. and in the morning my face looks super smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> After having a severe allergic reaction to a supermarket brand moisturizer, I researched organic brands and settled on Acure Organics.  I love this cream and how it makes my skin feel. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this and mix it with Marula oil. Works well.</li>
            <li> This is the best night cream I have ever used. I will be purchasing more and additional Acure products. Great price and great quality!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this night cream/lotion. It makes my face smooth and soft without any greasiness, and the fragrance is light and great. I have noticed a significant difference in my skin when I wake up. And I love love love the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and they way my skin feels after I put it on. It absorbs super quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling after. I wake up with fresh, clean feeling skin. Not too moisturizing but feels like skin takes a big drink of water over the night.</li>
            <li> I love the Acure line of skin care, however this product for me is just so-so.  My skin looks great and is very healthy for my age but this night cream just didn&#x27;t feel dewy enough for me.  It makes my face feel tight and tacky which makes me add the Aragon oil to the cream and apply them together.</li>
            <li> Great, gentle hydrating cream. I love all of the Acure line and use it daily.</li>
            <li> This night cream seems to moisturize well without being greasy. It does have a strong smell when you first apply it, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant and it fades quickly. During the winter when my skin was super dry, it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin, but neither did anything else I used. However, when I added the Seriously Firming Serum, it seemed to work better. I tried the serum by itself and it didn&#x27;t do much without the night cream. I will warn you that the serum is very oily and to use as little as possible when you apply it. The serum eventually sinks into your skin and feels less greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used the Acure Night Cream sporadically, yet still see positive results in the overall tone of my skin.  It appears softer and a bit more youthful.  The tube is rather small but I&#x27;ve already reordered so I don&#x27;t run out of this product.  It&#x27;s one of the few that genuinely appears to work.</li>
            <li> Like it but don&#x27;t like the way it smells. Could be a little heavier for me, my skin is little dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years now and I believe it&#x27;s helping with the weight loss face sag.  My skin is also much softer.  I was freaked when I lost 45 pounds and that caused loose shin in my face. I thought: &amp;#34;Great, I don&#x27;t have the dollars for a face lift&amp;#34;, but I kept up with this cream (which I used in the morning because its light enough) and today I have far less (exceptable) loose skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Acure again.  i&#x27;ll always trust the Acure brand.</li>
            <li> I use this and the day cream.  I simply love this stuff and I credit my young complexion (at 57) to it, along with a good skin routine.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to cream! After a beauty Dr. at a medical spa convinced me that moisturizer was the missing component in m y beauty routine and it would help make my acne go away, I have been trying all kinds of creams.  Mostly drugstore $20/ per package varieties although I did buy one of hers that worked nicely too.  I am going to say this is the one.  My skin is really doing awesome,  I have greatly reduced my acne and my skin looks better than it did 20 years ago. This cream has a really nice lavender sent and seems to do the trick.  When she mentioned stem cell therapy I was honestly offended by the suggestion of using another life for my own vanity.  I even went home and complained to my husband.  After looking into it however these stem cells are from plants.  Whoops!  I made a quick assumption with out all the facts and was too quick to get offended on that one!  Oh well, I am using it now, good cream.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream.  I really like it.  My only reservation is that it isn&#x27;t as hydrating as I had hoped.  Maybe it&#x27;s just this very cold weather!</li>
            <li> I have dealt with sensitive skin for forever - since elementary school I&#x27;ve been fighting the good fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole skin care line has done me wonders. It&#x27;s part of my &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without it&amp;#34; list. I use the eye crime, day cream, and this night cream. I wash my face with Dr Bronners Tea tree, and use diva wash on my body with a natural loofah. I remove my makeup with a few drops of grapeseed oil on a washcloth. It&#x27;s changed my life! :)</li>
            <li> No longer need botox, but I found that I do have to use it every day or almost everyday or frown lines on forehead come back.  No sure how long it will continue to work as I get older, but I&#x27;m very happy it works right now. ;-)</li>
            <li> Love this. Feels nice going on and left my super dry skin soft and supple in the morning. And it feels great to support a company that produces quality beauty products that are vegan, cruelty free and subsequently good for the environment. I will definitely be buying this this one again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my dry skin, and feels very chalky. I want to love this brand, but I&#x27;ve only been impressed with the eye crEam so far.</li>
            <li> I am in love with all acure products right now. I finally have a skin care regimen that my skin is loving. This night cream has a light lavender scent, which I love, and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. I use it at night on top of Acure&#x27;s Argan oil. I wake up in the morning with soft, healthy skin. No breakouts and no dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, this night cream doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough for my skin in the winter, which is why I use the Argan oil as well.</li>
            <li> good item intersted to buy again</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients, smell and texture. Have not had it long enough to give a proper review but I believe it&#x27;s going to help my skin a lot!</li>
            <li> THIS CREAM IS OKAY... IT HAS A REALLY STRONG SMELL...I CANT FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS... BUT MOST ORGANIC PRODUCTS HAVE THAT PROBLEM....I LIKE THAT IT DOESNT HAVE A LOT OF BAD THINGS IN IT....I HAVE ONLY BEEN USING IF FOR A FEW WEEKS SO THE VERDICT IS STILL OUT... AMAZON HAS THE BEST PRICE FOR IT.</li>
            <li> I know that some users have complained about the &amp;#34;strong smell,&amp;#34; but I love it. It smells of herbs and lavender. It is light, creamy, and hydrating. My skin loves it! In general, I think Acure products are natural, affordable, and high quality.</li>
            <li> Effective night cream at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because of some of the reviewers having dry skin from using.  After the first use, my skin was hyrdrated the following morning and I had no allergy reactions.  My skin is sensitive and becomes imflammed quickly.</li>
            <li> When I wash my face at night, I use the Acure Hydrating Toner and then this Acure Night Cream.  It makes my skin feel wonderful in the morning.  It is a little thick, so I often use a little California Baby Healing and Soothing Spray mixed with the Acure Night Cream to make it easier to smooth all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;When I wash my face in the morning, I use Tropical Traditions Unscented Moisturizing Lotion as my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; in other products trigger headaches for me so I like the smell of lavender essence. It definitely makes my skin look better when I wake up in the morning. It&#x27;s not greasy at all. I have rosacea and very sensitive skin so I love that this cream is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love that when you put this on at night, you can feel it working and your skin tightening within seconds.  There&#x27;s no harsh nasty stuff in Acure. I love the way their products smell and the fact I get great results with it.</li>
            <li> Smells like eucalyptus. Very refreshing and makes my face feel great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Acure face products for about a month so I figured it was time to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start by saying that when I first used the Night Cream I did not like it. In comparison to Acure&#x27;s Day Cream it just doesn&#x27;t go on as smooth, the application feels rough and dry. Also, the Day Cream smells wonderful like oranges and the Night Cream smells like herbs, not bad but not wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve been using the Night Cream for awhile I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s seemingly &amp;#34;rough and dry&amp;#34; application is because it has no greasiness to it. When I wake up in the morning my skin has a matte look like freshly washed and dried skin BUT I&#x27;m still very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that I&#x27;ve always battled acne and used all sorts of acne products. My skin is VERY sensitive so I started using Acure after a descision to approach treating my acne in a different way. I use the Facial Cleansing Creme (Mint one), the spray toner and either the Day or Night cream. My acne has improved MUCH more than using prescription retinoids and antibiotics. I think that the Night Cream specifically is very balancing for sensitive combination skin and it&#x27;s mostly responsible for clearing my acne.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without being greasy. Love the lavendar smell, which is relaxing.</li>
            <li> This is a great night cream, your face feels super hydrated and the lavender scent is awesome!</li>
            <li> I really love Acure products but I was disappointed with this night cream. For the first week I loved it. It smelled good and was fairly light. But then I noticed that it turned my skin oily. I had been using it for a month and my skin was oily and starting to break out. I stopped using it and my skin went back to normal. If you have really dry skin this will probably work for you. Loved the scent and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Have been using this a couple years - love it. I&#x27;m 56 and it does the job. I use it daily and nightly.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Light, non greasy cream, it has very subtle and pleasant lavender scent. Feels very nice on my skin. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this night cream.  I use it with the Seriously Firming Serum every night and it just makes my skin feel great.  I do have super dry skin and it&#x27;s perfect.  Love love that this company is also cruelty free!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! I&#x27;m using many of Acure&#x27;s products and I&#x27;ve loved all except the hydrating toner, which made my skin break out into little bumps. Back to the night cream, it smells amazing,  much like their lavender body lotion. I pair the night cream with their seriously firming serum (it&#x27;s really an oil blend), which is my holy grail serum/facial oil. This combination is amazing for my dry skin, made even worse by the desert climate. I only wish the lotion came in a bigger bottle!</li>
