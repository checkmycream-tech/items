            <li>I place on sticky top coat</li>
            <li>okay, i got this set and when it arrived it was not 600 peices</li>

            <li>The product itself is fine, but I think the stones are too big for most of my nails...</li>
            <li>They only thing i would have liked is if they were separated, all the colors were in one bag.</li>

            <li>they are really pretty</li>
            <li>But aside from that, they&#x27;re really pretty</li>

            <li>They are super cut and simple.</li>
            <li>there was no black or gold ones, and was kinda hoping the colors wound be separated all ready.</li>

            <li>Happy when I received it but disappointed when I open it.</li>
            <li>but I really wish it would come with a wheel and not in a little plastic package</li>

            <li> I am not sure if it really comes with 600</li>
            <li> got mostly black, and also blue, shiny red, matte red, and pink.</li>
            <li> maybe just because i have smaller fingers but other</li>
            <li> I got blue, red, gold, silver, green and magenta.</li>
            <li> The squares I received were neon colors (neon pink, orange, blue, purple and black).  </li>
            <li> Blue, pink, orange, black, silver, and purple.</li>
            <li> 106 black, 98 red, 104 purple, 124 pink, 122 silver &amp; 98 teal.</li>
            <li> Every little piece and all the colors come mixed together...</li>
            <li> they came in a little packet a mixed together ..</li>
            <li> I received 7 colors black, silver, red, pink, blue, and a holographic green and pink..</li>
            <li> cheap little random glitter s***s that don&#x27;t stay on and no where in the amount it said.</li>
            <li> It mentions two shades of pink</li>
            <li> She got red gold silver matte pink and matte green.</li>
            <li> For the price a long wait isn&#x27;t the issue but when the product came with different color then originally stated in the detail is a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not the colors I thought and more disappointed</li>
            <li> I just wish the supplier separated the different colors so you don&#x27;t have to go &amp;#34;fishing&amp;#34; through a small plastic baggie just to match your colors so you can make a design.</li>
            <li> a while, but that was expected!</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because I could still use these for other designs.</li>
            <li> Bought theses for my wife, she&#x27;s disappointed, none of the colors in the picture where send, she said she wanted the turquoise (her favorite color) and the black.</li>
            <li> you get every other color except for black.</li>
            <li> i guess that would be my only complaint ..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll also use them in other art projects!</li>
            <li> And black was the color I wanted.</li>
            <li> it says you get black</li>
            <li> and black is not even in it</li>
            <li> Took a little longer them what I was told.</li>
            <li> one thing though the colours come in one little sealed plastic wrapper.</li>
            <li> Arrived a few days before estimated delivery.</li>
            <li> I was expecting all the colors as shown but only received the gold and silver that had approximately 500pcs</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> All 600 pieces where in one small bag, so I had divide them into separate colours myself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little sad about it</li>
            <li> I swear this was false advertisement ..</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed when I received this.</li>
            <li> &amp;#62;&#x3D;(</li>
            <li> It was horrible!</li>

            <li> Took a little longer them what I was told. Happy when I received it but disappointed when I open it. I had VB purchased SQUARE n most of them were expect for gold m black. They sent me CIRCLES!</li>
            <li> Love. But i thought i had purchased neon ones</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it really comes with 600 if it doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s close. they are really pretty but I really wish it would come with a wheel and not in a little plastic package</li>
            <li> They are pretty good but my only issue is that they are a bit larger then I thought so they don&#x27;t really fit flat against my nails so once I put them on I&#x27;m lucky if they last all day without getting chipped off. maybe just because i have smaller fingers but other then that they are good.</li>
            <li> you get every other color except for black. And black was the color I wanted. it says you get black but you don&#x27;t . And if u want to wait for ever to get something you don&#x27;t want get it. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love to do nails and found these studs to be trending so i decided to purchase them ....they are to big for my nails!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;They defiantly look smaller in the picture and they fall off a lot. Other than that the colors are really nice.</li>
            <li> Love this!! It doesn&#x27;t look like there is  600 of them!! But I did take the time to count and separate them. It is worth very cent I spent!</li>
            <li> Not the colors I thought and more disappointed there was no black or gold ones, and was kinda hoping the colors wound be separated all ready.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed when I received this. All 600 pieces where in one small bag, so I had divide them into separate colours myself! The product itself is fine, but I think the stones are too big for most of my nails...</li>
            <li> I love these, they are the perfect size and so easy to use. They are super cut and simple. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I received those today and I am so happy, although the colors are different.I got blue, red, gold, silver, green and magenta. I&#x27;m a little sad about it but this will work.</li>
            <li> the nail studs work well on any colors of the nails so many designs and mays your imaginations  run wild and see where it is the mind can and will go thank you</li>
            <li> My daughter really like this item and was happy to receive it in the mail.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> These are really cute but I though I was going to get the gold color also. Didn&#x27;t get it. But aside from that, they&#x27;re really pretty</li>
            <li> the MAIN reson why i ordered it was because of the black.... like on the picture... and black is not even in it</li>
            <li> These studs are bright and quite flat, so they will work very well for nail art and I&#x27;ll also use them in other art projects!</li>
            <li> I love studs so i was excited when I received my studs in different colours. they are a good size to try many diff designs</li>
            <li> It was horrible! The colors I got were not the colors I was expecting from the picture! I swear this was false advertisement .. Neither did I receive 600,, but then again that didn&#x27;t matter because the colors I wanted weren&#x27;t even in the packet!!!! &amp;#62;&#x3D;(</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item I was expecting to get exactly what was in the picture. Turns out the studs are really tiny (not nearly as big as shown in the picture) and the colors aren&#x27;t the ones in the picture.</li>
            <li> great price and a great addition to my nail art collection. I just wish the supplier separated the different colors so you don&#x27;t have to go &amp;#34;fishing&amp;#34; through a small plastic baggie just to match your colors so you can make a design. Every little piece and all the colors come mixed together...</li>
            <li> Took a while to come and the description said blacks was included and there are no black studs in the package!</li>
            <li> The squares I received were neon colors (neon pink, orange, blue, purple and black).  The product is great, just do what was advertised.</li>
            <li> These will add a little flare to your nails when used, they are easy to apply, and come with beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> The title says it all, I never got the studs in the mail. It was a waste of money! If I could give them 0 stars I would.</li>
            <li> got mostly black, and also blue, shiny red, matte red, and pink. Maybe another color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;took a while, but that was expected! can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
            <li> The colors in the picture look like rich iridescent jewel colors, but the colors I received are matte neon colors: Blue, pink, orange, black, silver, and purple. The photo shows a rose gold color but that didn&#x27;t come in my little baggy of squares. I gave this 3 stars because I could still use these for other designs.</li>
            <li> look great with Christmas nail art</li>
            <li> For the price a long wait isn&#x27;t the issue but when the product came with different color then originally stated in the detail is a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received 7 colors black, silver, red, pink, blue, and a holographic green and pink.. Overall the product was great. Except they were all mixed so I had to separate them by color which took w while..</li>
            <li> I love these they are exactly like the picture, the only thing is that I only recrived the black ones but I contacted the seller and they srnt me the rest of them about a week later</li>
            <li> I love doing nails so this is perfect for retro funky designs. Love all the colors too. I would reorder this again.</li>
            <li> Arrived a few days before estimated delivery. It mentions two shades of pink yet I received one, which is okay, I got silver instead. I do not recommend using tweezers because it scratches and removes the color on the stud but using a toothpick worked well for me.</li>
            <li> kids had a ball with these</li>
            <li> The items are good...arrived before the estimated time. one thing though the colours come in one little sealed plastic wrapper. The items are jumbled together. you just have to take the time out to separate them to make your work easier</li>
            <li> just received the assorted once today .. they came in a little packet a mixed together .. i guess that would be my only complaint .. other then that i love them .. the size .. the colors ... great buy</li>
            <li> I loved the size, along with the color. You also can&#x27;t beat this amount for this price. I would surly buy again.</li>
            <li> I was expecting all the colors as shown but only received the gold and silver that had approximately 500pcs instead 600&#x27;</li>
            <li> I assumed I&#x27;d be getting the colors pictured, but got gold, silver, metallic red, matte blue, and matte orange. OK for the price, a little too big to sit perfectly on my curved nail beds, would really have liked to get all the colors pictured.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe no gold in it 😔</li>
            <li> i havent recie this item</li>
            <li> They are just what i was hoping for. They only thing i would have liked is if they were separated, all the colors were in one bag. I would buy again</li>
            <li> They look like studs up close but could be mistaken for a crystal, overall they still look great and are fun to use!</li>
            <li> As described  and as pictured. Shipping isn&#x27;t too fast.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really get what the posting said it was sending out, cheap little random glitter s***s that don&#x27;t stay on and no where in the amount it said.</li>
            <li> I was expecting Squares, but got Stars... Really That&#x27;s fine this time but I&#x27;d like to get what I applied for.</li>
            <li> I think I got these, lol, I&#x27;ll have to check my stuff...</li>
            <li> The colors on these are so nice an bright!  The size is nice not at all big or too small.  No nail glue needed.  I place on sticky top coat let dry and follow up with a heavier layer of top coat and they stay on till I remove them.</li>
            <li> Came at a timely rate with an ample amount of all colors. However, I didn&#x27;t notice any gold studs. I&#x27;ll have to take a closer look and see.</li>
            <li> I love these cute little nail studs and the colors!! They look great once applied not to big and not too small</li>
            <li> These are wonderful little accents! I got the multi color 600 ct squares n got 652 total!! 106 black, 98 red, 104 purple, 124 pink, 122 silver &amp; 98 teal. Great deal n fast shipping too!! Theyre 3 mm square in size. Dont hesitate to get some.</li>
            <li> its okay, i got this set and when it arrived it was not 600 peices it maybe had about 300 or 350 and then it didnt have all colors it has in the pics. On the bright side it arrived really early and thats why it got 3 stars instead of 2</li>
            <li> Bought theses for my wife, she&#x27;s disappointed, none of the colors in the picture where send, she said she wanted the turquoise (her favorite color) and the black. She got red gold silver matte pink and matte green. She already has silver and gold.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted...</li>
