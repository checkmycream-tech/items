            <li>Happy to have a reliable source !!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>This is the BEST for covering my roots between coloring!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for adding shine, color and body.  </li>
            <li>this is a good brand</li>
            <li>my nan loved this</li>
            <li>So it didn&#x27;t do me any good.</li>
            <li>so well I&#x27;ll just get more bottles!</li>
            <li>it came out of my hair, mostly, in the pool    </li>
            <li>and i think it looks cute on her.</li>
            <li>I love Jerome Russell highlight sprays.  </li>
            <li>I have to spray my favorite fragrance over this colorspray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get more of a lightening effect by walking through a cloud of flour in a bakery.</li>
            <li>but it would take five or six bottles to cover all your hair in any believable fashion.</li>
            <li>The cheap kind from Walmart worked better.</li>
            <li>i love love it ....</li>
            <li>really i love it..</li>
            <li>I have waist-length medium-dark blond hair and using most of the can lightened my hair a bit.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that it washed out right away.</li>
            <li>They give a great look to bring contrast to the normal color.  </li>
            <li>its only good for a one night thing, like halloween party or similiar event, but really the color is awesome!  </li>
            <li>that it was basically like a huge glob of this glittery stuff on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>The smell is REALLY strong.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for either touching up the poof when wearing a full wig or toning the back and front with a bun wig.  </li>
            <li>The color itself is accurate...</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for a cosplay costume , at first I was  incredibly happy , it was blonde spray</li>
            <li>it let it turn to gray &amp; beautiful green ..</li>
            <li>The spray is a nice color, and it does not smell, but it does precious little to cover your hair.</li>
            <li>This product might be good if only it delivered about 20 times as much spray.</li>
            <li>Great for Halloween, if you have less hair than I do and use the entire can it could work OK.</li>
            <li>Very very displeased.</li>
            <li>On this day i was on a hot convention floor, worked out, drove to the skit</li>
            <li>.. didn&#x27;t realize I&#x27;d need more than one bottle for essentially 1/3 of my hair, but</li>
            <li>Patiently waited for it to arrive , which was quick  ( which is the main reason it is 3 stars ).</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work for that purpose at all, I used the entire can and her hair just looked brown with a layer of gold dust on top.</li>
            <li>It might smell good, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>Color looked more like grey than platinum blond.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand my pink scalp showing.. and more and more of it is showing daily.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to color my hair, just spray on a light blonde.  </li>
            <li>and I was hoping to go to a light blonde for a children&#x27;s Disney party.</li>
            <li>I bought this to be a touch up root spray on my very bleached hair.  </li>
            <li>It made her hair blonder but not nearly as light as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this Platinum color spray.</li>
            <li>but it leaves a glitter like substance on your scalp that itches to high hell.</li>
            <li>so fun to see what you would look like with different hair colors!</li>
            <li>This would be a good product to give your hair a little sparkle if you&#x27;re going out at night to a party, but it does not remotely make you look blonde.</li>
            <li>Me and my friends tried it and it worked on me, only because I have light golden blonde hair but on everyone else it looked grey.</li>
            <li>You need more than you think to cover your hair so buy two but the color (when mixed with other colors) looks natural.</li>
            <li>I have natural dark brown hair, and I just sprayed it lightly into my hair while tousling it about.</li>
            <li>I spent more money than I would for an average temporary spray color to get a product with decent reviews.</li>
            <li>and I should know because I&#x27;m an old lady.</li>
            <li>what hair I do have without weighing down curls and just give a light blonde brightness .</li>
            <li>Costs too much, but I plan to use it as long as they sell</li>
            <li>Also, it even turned my hair a grey if i put too much of it in.</li>
            <li>It is simple and no mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to other color sprays in texture, etc., but doesn&#x27;t add much color.</li>
            <li>I have a long mohawk, sides completely shaved</li>

            <li> I have a long mohawk, sides completely shaved</li>
            <li> Unless you have lighter than medium blonde hair, this just appears grey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is really worth it, maybe if you put a towel down or something before you use it so you don&#x27;t get it all over everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sprays out SO hard and fast</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not entirely unexpected for basically a temporary paint.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dark blonde</li>
            <li> The smell was quite strong, even being outside it was bad.</li>
            <li> It left a gross waxy feeling to my hair and looked like half dried wall paint, if it were to get in your hair.</li>
            <li> but you have to use an entire bottle for just a one or two inch section and should probably apply it outdoors and then run around for a little while afterward.  </li>
            <li> have terribly thin hair - but continue to receive compliments from men and women alike, thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> it doesnt hurt my hair much as other products do ..going to</li>
            <li> Not worth the shipping and effort.</li>
            <li> I have dark roots</li>
            <li> i have black hair...</li>
            <li> Wanted to see what my dark brown hair would look like if I were to go blond, this stuff worked!  </li>
            <li> This does work but it is messy.  </li>
            <li> My hair also became a sticky, hard , stiff texture.</li>
            <li> This Platinum shade is always hard to find at feiseanna and shops.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it for the past 11 years and plan to continue using it forever!  </li>
            <li> My daughter has dirty blond hair, the spray ended up looking hardly grey and did not cover whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Its very hard to control it because it sprays everywhere</li>
            <li> It looked awful, smelled awful, and is basically just light glitter.</li>
            <li> so streaks are virtually impossible.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> and it was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You need more than you think to cover your hair so buy two but the color (when mixed with other colors) looks natural. i would use again. this is a good brand</li>
            <li> Wanted to see what my dark brown hair would look like if I were to go blond, this stuff worked!  its only good for a one night thing, like halloween party or similiar event, but really the color is awesome!  will come out once you wash it, but so fun to see what you would look like with different hair colors!</li>
            <li> WORKED AWESOME!!!!!!  didn&#x27;t run at the anime convention.  I didn&#x27;t have to color my hair, just spray on a light blonde.  it survived from 10 am to 8 pm that day. On this day i was on a hot convention floor, worked out, drove to the skit location(it didn&#x27;t run in the car), and swam.  it came out of my hair, mostly, in the pool    kc</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this Platinum color spray. It&#x27;s sprays out SO hard and fast that it was basically like a huge glob of this glittery stuff on the top of my head. It looked awful, smelled awful, and is basically just light glitter. Also, after I sprayed it one time, that was it... there was nothing left in the can!! A total rip off.&lt;br /&gt;YUCK. I learned my lesson, and I&#x27;m never buying this again. The good thing is that it washed out right away.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for adding shine, color and body.  i&#x27;ve used it for the past 11 years and plan to continue using it forever!  Costs too much, but I plan to use it as long as they sell it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have terribly thin hair - but continue to receive compliments from men and women alike, thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Unless you have lighter than medium blonde hair, this just appears grey. Me and my friends tried it and it worked on me, only because I have light golden blonde hair but on everyone else it looked grey. Also, it even turned my hair a grey if i put too much of it in. And it turns your skin sparkly for about a week afterward... Its very hard to control it because it sprays everywhere so streaks are virtually impossible.</li>
            <li> My hair is already blonde so I assumed that it would make it platinum. Nope. Not worth the shipping and effort. Buy a wig instead.</li>
            <li> my nan loved this she is a fan of spray hair color and i think it looks cute on her.</li>
            <li> Color looked more like grey than platinum blond.My hair also became a sticky, hard , stiff texture.</li>
            <li> I love Jerome Russell highlight sprays.  They give a great look to bring contrast to the normal color.  It is simple and no mess.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand my pink scalp showing.. and more and more of it is showing daily. This product it such a time saver for me. I use it on my roots and scalp. I would have given it 5 stars but the smell is so &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34;... and I should know because I&#x27;m an old lady. I have to spray my favorite fragrance over this colorspray.</li>
            <li> This product might be good if only it delivered about 20 times as much spray. The spray is a nice color, and it does not smell, but it does precious little to cover your hair. My hair is dark blonde and I was hoping to go to a light blonde for a children&#x27;s Disney party. I spent more money than I would for an average temporary spray color to get a product with decent reviews. It might smell good, but don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;d get more of a lightening effect by walking through a cloud of flour in a bakery.</li>
            <li> This sort of works...but you have to use an entire bottle for just a one or two inch section and should probably apply it outdoors and then run around for a little while afterward.  The smell is REALLY strong.  That&#x27;s not entirely unexpected for basically a temporary paint.  The color itself is accurate...but it would take five or six bottles to cover all your hair in any believable fashion.</li>
            <li> My daughter has dirty blond hair, the spray ended up looking hardly grey and did not cover whatsoever. The smell was quite strong, even being outside it was bad. The cheap kind from Walmart worked better.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have to tone hair when wearing blonde Irish Dance wigs.  The Platinum shade neutralises Gold shades of blonde and lightns brunettes--when wearing a blonde wig.  This product is great for either touching up the poof when wearing a full wig or toning the back and front with a bun wig.  This Platinum shade is always hard to find at feiseanna and shops.  Happy to have a reliable source !!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with it. I hoped it to make my daughters hair almost white for her Elsa Costume this Halloween. It made her hair blonder but not nearly as light as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have natural dark brown hair, and I just sprayed it lightly into my hair while tousling it about. I kept layering color on, then ran out! I have a long mohawk, sides completely shaved.. didn&#x27;t realize I&#x27;d need more than one bottle for essentially 1/3 of my hair, but oh well.. it worked so well I&#x27;ll just get more bottles! I&#x27;m going to try using it on already styled hair, I just wanted to see what it would look like on relaxed flowing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Edge Blendable hair color.. and it was terrible. It left a gross waxy feeling to my hair and looked like half dried wall paint, if it were to get in your hair.</li>
            <li> i love love it .... i have black hair...it let it turn to gray &amp; beautiful green ..really i love it..it doesnt hurt my hair much as other products do ..going to but it again Inshallah :*</li>
            <li> I bought this to be a touch up root spray on my very bleached hair.  I have dark roots and I wanted to soften them a bit before going in for my touch up.  This does work but it is messy.  It got all over my bathroom and made my hands sparkly.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is really worth it, maybe if you put a towel down or something before you use it so you don&#x27;t get it all over everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to other color sprays in texture, etc., but doesn&#x27;t add much color. I have waist-length medium-dark blond hair and using most of the can lightened my hair a bit. Great for Halloween, if you have less hair than I do and use the entire can it could work OK.</li>
            <li> I have to wear  wigs and hair pieces.  This spray helps tint Ave compliment what hair I do have without weighing down curls and just give a light blonde brightness .</li>
            <li> I gave it one star becasue I was thinking platinum blonde not platinum silver.  So it didn&#x27;t do me any good.</li>
            <li> I have let my hair just be white instead of overall coloring it, but use this to highlight sometimes which works well for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a cosplay costume , at first I was  incredibly happy , it was blonde spray so I didn&#x27;t have to wear a wig. Patiently waited for it to arrive , which was quick  ( which is the main reason it is 3 stars ). When the product arrived I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. That&#x27;s when dissapointment set in. I ordered platinum blond expecting platinum blonde, what I got was silver, not only that but it leaves a glitter like substance on your scalp that itches to high hell. Very very displeased.</li>
            <li> I bought this to color my daughter&#x27;s brown hair blonde for a play. It didn&#x27;t work for that purpose at all, I used the entire can and her hair just looked brown with a layer of gold dust on top. This would be a good product to give your hair a little sparkle if you&#x27;re going out at night to a party, but it does not remotely make you look blonde.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST for covering my roots between coloring!</li>
