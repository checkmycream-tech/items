            <li>Very happy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my hair straightener for 2 years almost, still perfect :D</li>
            <li>so you have to have the perfect amount of hair under it for it to hold.</li>

            <li>It looks nice.</li>
            <li>but honestly i want to just return it or give it away</li>
            <li>Hold the hair very well and gives excellent heat.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my own hair this week.</li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly and leaves your hair looking great.</li>
            <li>Bought two (and got free shipping!).  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ceramic (better for your hair).  </li>
            <li>I usually love Remington products, so it saddens me to give this 1 star, but its GARBAGE.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This would work better for thinner and maybe longer hair.</li>
            <li>I give it a B- because of the cheap dial that turns on its own as you move the iron around.</li>
            <li>The color are so cute for those who want to match your room color and stff.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>however did not see any recommendations on what type of hair this would be most appropriate for.  </li>
            <li>The color are so cute for those who want to match your room color and stff.</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the correct size for my bob hair cut..</li>
            <li>I love the 30 adjustable heat settings.  </li>
            <li>I have curls for days and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>i love love love</li>
            <li>but im glad i purchased this</li>
            <li>its great, it heats up fast</li>
            <li>I love this curler.</li>
            <li>Considering that, I did make sure to give it a chance on the highest setting without involuntary adjustments, and it just doesn&#x27;t curl my hair.</li>
            <li>The product seems to be a good one, just be aware of the radius and what type of curls you are looking for though.</li>
            <li>It works great and gets super hot.  </li>
            <li>Their products don&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Two days ago, my mother purchased this curling iron in hopes of producing big, beautiful curls in my sister&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>was quick!   </li>
            <li>The dial on the side that controls the heat is very easily turned (even without touching the actual dial it seems to slide on its own just by moving it around while you are curling your hair)</li>
            <li>This curling iron is very smooth and the barrel gives big nice curls.. and for the cost you can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and has a nice curl.</li>
            <li>so overall its a great iron...</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>A great curling iron for big bouncy curls!</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>This really does what I had amazing curls in seconds.</li>
            <li>THIS  CURLING IRON IS GREAT FOR SHORT OR MEDIUM LENGTH HAIR .</li>
            <li>After searching high and low for what I thought would be a the best curling iron for me, I came across this one.  </li>
            <li>nice curls ceramic hair,i was needed and thank you so much and items is a brand new , nice price,thank you</li>
            <li>good things is that is does have an auto shut off and it does heat up fast even though not that hot.</li>
            <li>perfect enough for that bounce that i LOVE and NEED.. 30 heat settings, 350 degrees salon heat, 30 second heat up and auto shut-off after 60 minutes..</li>
            <li>was originally going to get a wand</li>
            <li>shipping time was fast and the product works great on natural and weave hair</li>
            <li>Heats up rather quick, unique looking and curls well.</li>
            <li>My hair was full of body after each use.  </li>
            <li>leaves a nice soft curl and it does not burn my hair</li>
            <li>I have thick medium length hair and this works perfectly!</li>
            <li>Not a bad value for the money.</li>
            <li>It will create perfect loose waves though it is better suited for really long hair.</li>
            <li>Gets hot very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I lovw this curler, its heats up quick doesn&#x27;t have that after burn smell when it heats up.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly to.</li>
            <li>I lovw this curler, its heats up quick doesn&#x27;t have that after burn smell when it heats up.</li>
            <li>NATURAL AN IS VERY EASY TO USE AN HANDLED.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this new product for such a great price.  </li>
            <li>Very hot</li>
            <li>Gets hot quickly and has auto turn off - good for forgetful people like me.</li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly and the setting don&#x27;t change while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>This 1-1/2 inch barrel is just right.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to be able to place your fingertips there, but this one doesn&#x27;t stay cool enough to do that.</li>
            <li>used it two times and decided that my hair needs LESS heat - more love.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair that has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>Purchased this on Monday, just received it, super fast shipping too..</li>
            <li>So, once more we decided to show the tool some mercy, and try it out on my other two sisters&#x27; medium and ultra fine hair.........SAME RESULTS.</li>
            <li>Gets hot super fast and shipment was on time like stated.</li>
            <li>My first curling iron was a DISASTER.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast!</li>
            <li>not even hot.  </li>
            <li>Again, it did absolutely nothing, not a curl, not a wave, NADA!</li>
            <li>but it got to hot, burnt my hair and then started smoking, since then it wont heat up at all.</li>
            <li>said, I like using it when I want straight hair with more body than my flat iron gives me, and it&#x27;s really pretty!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this item for anyone with long straight hair that&#x27;s looking for fabulous curls.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that the reviews on this were so positive (which is the reason we purchased it in the first place).  </li>
            <li>It has different settings and glides over hair nicely providing a nice long lasting curl.</li>
            <li>I sure wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money on this curling iron, mainly because the tip end gets too hot!</li>
            <li>It claims to heat up to 350 degrees, but I was able to touch it to my finger and it didn&#x27;t burn so it definitely doesn&#x27;t get nearly that hot.</li>
            <li>This curling iron was just ok, it doesnt really get hot enought for my hair, it might work better on thin hair</li>
            <li>The Curling Iron is great, a little too big for what I wanted but still works!&lt;br /&gt;leaves</li>
            <li>The correct length (I have long-ish hair)/width and really, a gem.</li>
            <li>It makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>For anyone who needed hair stying products, Remington is really the way to go.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I expected way more from this</li>
            <li>The barrel heats up as promised, fast and all the way to 350 F. Hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck on the clamp as with some curling irons.  </li>
            <li>your hair very shiny</li>
            <li>So, we thought that once again, her hair was too much for the tool.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this curling Iron.</li>
            <li>My daughter use it, but takes for ever to finally get curls on all her hair, I am a father trying to surprise a daughter, but well not a men product, not so familiar with this things ;(</li>
            <li>I had been using a 1\\&quot; high end curling iron this whole time</li>
            <li>great curls for long hair, big barrel as i hope for the loose curls</li>
            <li>No, seriously, this curling iron does NOTHING.  </li>
            <li>My high end 1\\</li>
            <li>ON A HIGH END CURLING IRON.  </li>
            <li>I have had other curling irons before but this by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this!!</li>
            <li>Also, the iron doesn&#x27;t get to the higher temps like 400+degrees, only to 350, so if you need the extra heat it might not work as well for you, but then again it might be worth a shot!  </li>
            <li>even on the highest level is not that hot and hair falls flat fast because of that.</li>
            <li>is there a way i can exchange it or return it for a new one?</li>
            <li>gave this iron several tries to make sure my disappointments were not user error.  </li>
            <li>Heat is evenly distributed across the barrel and quickly curls my super thick, super long hair.</li>
            <li>it wouldn&#x27;t curl right or stay hot not worth the money</li>
            <li>I have hard to curl hair - it&#x27;s very straight and fine.</li>
            <li>I would go with one a little smaller and stainless steel or something that will heat up better and longer.</li>
            <li>I had to return this item because it did not get hot enough for me to curl my hair with it.</li>
            <li>also i felt like the heat wasnt hot enough...</li>
            <li>Does not get hot enough, if i can return it i would!!</li>
            <li>I would say that maybe the one we purchased did not heat properly, but we put it on the highest setting and it was extremely hot.  </li>
            <li>did not get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>But when that much hair is being curled at the same time it doesn&#x27;t seem that the curling iron gets hot enough to curl it all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my curls stay with hot tool, but with this hot tool my curls fall in less than a hour</li>
            <li>Works really well curls last for days at a time.</li>
            <li>Because of this, ever curl has a divot in it that is very noticeable and would be embarrassing in public.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li>and I finally decided the curls didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>The minute i received it which was the next day, thanks to PRIME, I tried it on my neighbor who has extensions.</li>
            <li>and they last much greetings</li>
            <li>and I thought that the thick barrel would help, but the curl stays for at most 1 hour.</li>
            <li>I wear my long fine hair straight but wanted a little bounce curve at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I got this product a few days early and was so excited to use it</li>
            <li>Heats up fine but doesn&#x27;t clamp tight enough to hold my hair.</li>
            <li>i used it on 4 occasions and still the same thing i have wavy soft hair</li>
            <li>it is a complete waste of money first off</li>
            <li>Granted, my hair is very thick and coarse, but I was expecting a LOT more.</li>
            <li>But other then that there&#x27;s no serious downside.</li>
            <li>Using a curling iron with a large diameter will only create loose large curls, giving you a wavy hair look that will not last long, so if you&#x27;re looking for defined tight curls definitely go for a smaller size radius.  </li>
            <li>Wish barrel was a little bit longer but works really well</li>
            <li>I debated whether I should take a chance on this little guy, and whether such an inexpensive iron could really do the job, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> was originally going to get a wand</li>
            <li> shipping time was fast and the product works great on natural and weave hair</li>
            <li> Heats up rather quick, unique looking and curls well.</li>
            <li> My hair was full of body after each use.  </li>
            <li> leaves a nice soft curl and it does not burn my hair</li>
            <li> I have thick medium length hair and this works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Not a bad value for the money.</li>
            <li> It will create perfect loose waves though it is better suited for really long hair.</li>
            <li> Gets hot very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I lovw this curler, its heats up quick doesn&#x27;t have that after burn smell when it heats up.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly to.</li>
            <li> I lovw this curler, its heats up quick doesn&#x27;t have that after burn smell when it heats up.</li>
            <li> NATURAL AN IS VERY EASY TO USE AN HANDLED.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this new product for such a great price.  </li>
            <li> Very hot</li>
            <li> Gets hot quickly and has auto turn off - good for forgetful people like me.</li>
            <li> It gets hot quickly and the setting don&#x27;t change while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> This 1-1/2 inch barrel is just right.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to be able to place your fingertips there, but this one doesn&#x27;t stay cool enough to do that.</li>
            <li> used it two times and decided that my hair needs LESS heat - more love.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> Purchased this on Monday, just received it, super fast shipping too..</li>
            <li> So, once more we decided to show the tool some mercy, and try it out on my other two sisters&#x27; medium and ultra fine hair.........SAME RESULTS.</li>
            <li> Gets hot super fast and shipment was on time like stated.</li>
            <li> My first curling iron was a DISASTER.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast!</li>
            <li> not even hot.  </li>
            <li> Again, it did absolutely nothing, not a curl, not a wave, NADA!</li>
            <li> but it got to hot, burnt my hair and then started smoking, since then it wont heat up at all.</li>
            <li> said, I like using it when I want straight hair with more body than my flat iron gives me, and it&#x27;s really pretty!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this item for anyone with long straight hair that&#x27;s looking for fabulous curls.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that the reviews on this were so positive (which is the reason we purchased it in the first place).  </li>
            <li> It has different settings and glides over hair nicely providing a nice long lasting curl.</li>
            <li> I sure wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money on this curling iron, mainly because the tip end gets too hot!</li>
            <li> It claims to heat up to 350 degrees, but I was able to touch it to my finger and it didn&#x27;t burn so it definitely doesn&#x27;t get nearly that hot.</li>
            <li> This curling iron was just ok, it doesnt really get hot enought for my hair, it might work better on thin hair</li>
            <li> The Curling Iron is great, a little too big for what I wanted but still works!&lt;br /&gt;leaves</li>
            <li> The correct length (I have long-ish hair)/width and really, a gem.</li>
            <li> It makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> For anyone who needed hair stying products, Remington is really the way to go.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I expected way more from this</li>
            <li> The barrel heats up as promised, fast and all the way to 350 F. Hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck on the clamp as with some curling irons.  </li>
            <li> your hair very shiny</li>
            <li> So, we thought that once again, her hair was too much for the tool.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this curling Iron.</li>
            <li> My daughter use it, but takes for ever to finally get curls on all her hair, I am a father trying to surprise a daughter, but well not a men product, not so familiar with this things ;(</li>
            <li> I had been using a 1\\&quot; high end curling iron this whole time</li>
            <li> great curls for long hair, big barrel as i hope for the loose curls</li>
            <li> No, seriously, this curling iron does NOTHING.  </li>
            <li> My high end 1\\</li>
            <li> ON A HIGH END CURLING IRON.  </li>
            <li> I have had other curling irons before but this by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this!!</li>
            <li> Also, the iron doesn&#x27;t get to the higher temps like 400+degrees, only to 350, so if you need the extra heat it might not work as well for you, but then again it might be worth a shot!  </li>
            <li> even on the highest level is not that hot and hair falls flat fast because of that.</li>
            <li> is there a way i can exchange it or return it for a new one?</li>
            <li> gave this iron several tries to make sure my disappointments were not user error.  </li>
            <li> Heat is evenly distributed across the barrel and quickly curls my super thick, super long hair.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t curl right or stay hot not worth the money</li>
            <li> I have hard to curl hair - it&#x27;s very straight and fine.</li>
            <li> I would go with one a little smaller and stainless steel or something that will heat up better and longer.</li>
            <li> I had to return this item because it did not get hot enough for me to curl my hair with it.</li>
            <li> also i felt like the heat wasnt hot enough...</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough, if i can return it i would!!</li>
            <li> I would say that maybe the one we purchased did not heat properly, but we put it on the highest setting and it was extremely hot.  </li>
            <li> did not get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> But when that much hair is being curled at the same time it doesn&#x27;t seem that the curling iron gets hot enough to curl it all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my curls stay with hot tool, but with this hot tool my curls fall in less than a hour</li>
            <li> Works really well curls last for days at a time.</li>
            <li> Because of this, ever curl has a divot in it that is very noticeable and would be embarrassing in public.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair</li>
            <li> and I finally decided the curls didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> The minute i received it which was the next day, thanks to PRIME, I tried it on my neighbor who has extensions.</li>
            <li> and they last much greetings</li>
            <li> and I thought that the thick barrel would help, but the curl stays for at most 1 hour.</li>
            <li> I wear my long fine hair straight but wanted a little bounce curve at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I got this product a few days early and was so excited to use it</li>
            <li> Heats up fine but doesn&#x27;t clamp tight enough to hold my hair.</li>
            <li> i used it on 4 occasions and still the same thing i have wavy soft hair</li>
            <li> it is a complete waste of money first off</li>
            <li> Granted, my hair is very thick and coarse, but I was expecting a LOT more.</li>
            <li> But other then that there&#x27;s no serious downside.</li>
            <li> Using a curling iron with a large diameter will only create loose large curls, giving you a wavy hair look that will not last long, so if you&#x27;re looking for defined tight curls definitely go for a smaller size radius.  </li>
            <li> Wish barrel was a little bit longer but works really well</li>
            <li> I debated whether I should take a chance on this little guy, and whether such an inexpensive iron could really do the job, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> At the hottest setting, this doesn&#x27;t do much more than what a flat iron does - it puts a small curve onto the end of my hair and no more.</li>
            <li> I use a Remington flat iron and it&#x27;s the only flat iron that works on my hair</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> When I read the other reviews, I definitely had mixed feelings and did not know what to believe.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 2&#x27; long.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair.  </li>
            <li> So its very annoying when you get it nice and hot and get halfway through your hair and realize it isnt curling anymore...</li>
            <li> I do not know if those who rated it poorly know how to use the product resulting in dissatisfaction, but what I do know is that it is worth the price</li>
            <li> I have very, very long hair</li>
            <li> Multiple heats settings and takes less than a minute to heat up.</li>
            <li> I expect it to last a long time just as my previous Remington curling iron did!</li>
            <li> I can put it on a very low setting to use on my preschooler&#x27;s fine, thin hair and then turn it up for my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> The lever is also very loose</li>
            <li> just to look at the dial and see that the heat dial had slid and the heat was turned down causing you to stop what you are doing and wait a few minutes to heat back up.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!  </li>
            <li> No complaints at all, other than the location of the power switch.  </li>
            <li> This is a problem with other irons, not just this one though.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely disappointing, and a huge waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and it is very difficult to curl hair.</li>
            <li> and whenever I try to curl it, it is not really curling it but just making a little &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not return it is because it comes in that hard plastic packaging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white, with thin, wavy, long hair.</li>
            <li> My sister has ridiculously thick hair, and we figured the bigger iron would work well for her.  </li>
            <li> We even went to the extreme of holding the hair in the barrel for over a minute!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clap tight at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why</li>
            <li> I usually purchase CONAIR products because of the price.</li>
            <li> I usually like trying things out for myself.</li>
            <li> So for a relatively inexpensive curling iron, I thought this would do the trick, but sadly, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> the curling iron I received is not the one pictured, I wanted the black and purple one, not this one I received, I am not happy with the item I received, I want the one that is pictured</li>
            <li> It is a bit hard for my hair to get curled with this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it hardly curled my hair and keeped the curls</li>
            <li> so I knew it couldn&#x27;t be bad, but i was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> honestly do not buy this</li>
            <li> This thing sucks.  </li>
            <li> hair is thick and shoulder length</li>
            <li> We eventually tried it on my hair, which is thick, but not unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I have bought a ridiculous amount of curling irons.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible curling iron, did not hold my hair at all, slid right out.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, the power switch and heat control are located where my hand hits both of them - cutting it off, and moving the control button up and down.</li>
            <li> It is a very heavy object which can make your arms very tired while trying to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> waste!!!</li>
            <li> and I tend to leave them behind.)</li>
            <li> This is the absolute worst curling iron ever.</li>
            <li> Definitely not happy with this curling iron.</li>
            <li> AND if you have dark hair, like I do, it was impossible to see if my hair was at the end.</li>
            <li> It is useless to me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had extensions before you know that it is difficult to curls and to maintain them and</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> You will non be disappointed</li>
            <li> well, i was wrong!!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t understand the stupid imperial system...)</li>
            <li> The reason I give it 3 stars is because there is one aspect of this iron that is annoying.</li>
            <li> This one is worthless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gets hot very quickly.  Just what I expected!  Bought two (and got free shipping!).  Very happy! I expect it to last a long time just as my previous Remington curling iron did!</li>
            <li> Not a bad value for the money.</li>
            <li> I used to have the same product and I lost it, that&#x27;s why I buy it again and I love it</li>
            <li> This is a horrible curling iron, did not hold my hair at all, slid right out.  AND if you have dark hair, like I do, it was impossible to see if my hair was at the end.</li>
            <li> Love it, and will get great use from this product!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this new product for such a great price.  After searching high and low for what I thought would be a the best curling iron for me, I came across this one.  It looks nice. It&#x27;s ceramic (better for your hair).  It will create perfect loose waves though it is better suited for really long hair. My hair is about and inch or two below my shoulders and I wish I would have gotten a smaller barrel size.  It heats up really quickly and leaves your hair looking great.</li>
            <li> honestly do not buy this it is a complete waste of money first off i blew out my hair and tried to curl it i held it for 15seconds and the curls just fell it there was heat but honestly i want to just return it or give it away i used it on 4 occasions and still the same thing i have wavy soft hair and and sister has curly hair and we both tried it and it did not work if you want a curling iron that works and is affordable buy a Revlon one</li>
            <li> Received on time. Good value. Works well.</li>
            <li> My first curling iron was a DISASTER. Literally. I bought it one too big (coz I&#x27;m from Australia so I don&#x27;t understand the stupid imperial system...) so the curls disappeared in an hour or so (even with hair spray). And it broke also. But this one is amazing. The correct length (I have long-ish hair)/width and really, a gem. It makes my life so much easier. I also have a Remington hair straightener. For anyone who needed hair stying products, Remington is really the way to go. Their products don&#x27;t break easily. I&#x27;ve had my hair straightener for 2 years almost, still perfect :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just amazing! It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use. Fast delivery. You will love it! Just have one. You WON&#x27;T regret it.</li>
            <li> This curler doesn&#x27;t even curl my hair with product. It is useless to me. I am upset I even bought it.</li>
            <li> use it a lot for bending wood for my ship models</li>
            <li> I usually love Remington products, so it saddens me to give this 1 star, but its GARBAGE.  I&#x27;ve had a Remington straightener for 3 years &amp; it works as well as the day I bought it.  I have very easy to manage hair, but this thing didn&#x27;t even create a wave on the hottest setting, let alone a curl!  It claims to heat up to 350 degrees, but I was able to touch it to my finger and it didn&#x27;t burn so it definitely doesn&#x27;t get nearly that hot.</li>
            <li> I sure wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money on this curling iron, mainly because the tip end gets too hot! You&#x27;re supposed to be able to place your fingertips there, but this one doesn&#x27;t stay cool enough to do that.</li>
            <li> my curls stay with hot tool, but with this hot tool my curls fall in less than a hour</li>
            <li> I had to return this item because it did not get hot enough for me to curl my hair with it.</li>
            <li> even on the highest level is not that hot and hair falls flat fast because of that. I would go with one a little smaller and stainless steel or something that will heat up better and longer. good things is that is does have an auto shut off and it does heat up fast even though not that hot.</li>
            <li> It is a bit hard for my hair to get curled with this one.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and shoulder length and whenever I try to curl it, it is not really curling it but just making a little &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This would work better for thinner and maybe longer hair.</li>
            <li> nice curls ceramic hair,i was needed and thank you so much and items is a brand new , nice price,thank you</li>
            <li> Works really well curls last for days at a time. Wish barrel was a little bit longer but works really well</li>
            <li> Great curling iron. Heats up fast and has a nice curl. Very hot</li>
            <li> This curling iron was just ok, it doesnt really get hot enought for my hair, it might work better on thin hair</li>
            <li> This curling iron leaves a line where the level rests on your h air to keep it in place as you curl.  Because of this, ever curl has a divot in it that is very noticeable and would be embarrassing in public.  The lever is also very loose so you have to have the perfect amount of hair under it for it to hold. But when that much hair is being curled at the same time it doesn&#x27;t seem that the curling iron gets hot enough to curl it all.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this iron several tries to make sure my disappointments were not user error.  I&#x27;ve concluded that it&#x27;s the iron&#x27;s fault, not mine.  The only reason I did not return it is because it comes in that hard plastic packaging and I thought it would not be accepted back.  Now it just collects dust in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> For the price you cant beat it. It has different settings and glides over hair nicely providing a nice long lasting curl. The reason I give it 3 stars is because there is one aspect of this iron that is annoying. The dial on the side that controls the heat is very easily turned (even without touching the actual dial it seems to slide on its own just by moving it around while you are curling your hair) So its very annoying when you get it nice and hot and get halfway through your hair and realize it isnt curling anymore...just to look at the dial and see that the heat dial had slid and the heat was turned down causing you to stop what you are doing and wait a few minutes to heat back up. so overall its a great iron...I give it a B- because of the cheap dial that turns on its own as you move the iron around.</li>
            <li> I lovw this curler, its heats up quick doesn&#x27;t have that after burn smell when it heats up. The color are so cute for those who want to match your room color and stff.I choose this size because it gives your those big bouncy curls. I don&#x27;t recomand this size for sshort hair the waves are to big. This products leaves my hair silky and shiny I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I order this on a Sunday like at 2am night and I received it on Monday shippment was quick!&lt;br /&gt;***also it comes with this travel bag</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair and I had read great reviews about this product however did not see any recommendations on what type of hair this would be most appropriate for.  Using a curling iron with a large diameter will only create loose large curls, giving you a wavy hair look that will not last long, so if you&#x27;re looking for defined tight curls definitely go for a smaller size radius.  The product seems to be a good one, just be aware of the radius and what type of curls you are looking for though.</li>
            <li> Works well and makes great curls.  MY daughter enjoys using this and she hasnt hurt herself with it at all.  good quality, durable metals and plastic.</li>
            <li> I have had other curling irons before but this by far is my favorite. Multiple heats settings and takes less than a minute to heat up. I have relaxed hair and this doesn&#x27;t burn or damage it. Shipped quickly to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t curl my hair often and have never used a ceramic iron. This is fantastic. Heat is evenly distributed across the barrel and quickly curls my super thick, super long hair.</li>
            <li> A great curling iron for big bouncy curls! It gets hot quickly and the setting don&#x27;t change while you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> I expected way more from this but it hardly curled my hair and keeped the curls also i felt like the heat wasnt hot enough...</li>
            <li> Great Product. I like using it. Hold the hair very well and gives excellent heat.</li>
            <li> i used it once , I should of gotten a smaller barrel , but it still did the job</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this!! Does not heat up enough to do anything to your hair. Did nothing to my hair! I use a Remington flat iron and it&#x27;s the only flat iron that works on my hair so I figured a Remington was good. I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I debated whether I should take a chance on this little guy, and whether such an inexpensive iron could really do the job, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Amazon is so great about returns I knew I could just return/exchange with no problem if it didn&#x27;t.  For me, this has been JUST what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I wear my long fine hair straight but wanted a little bounce curve at the bottom.  This 1-1/2 inch barrel is just right.  And the iron does an awesome job for me -- and my hair has never looked &amp;#34;swingy-er&amp;#34; or healthier.  I&#x27;m not sure why but it does.  Also, the iron doesn&#x27;t get to the higher temps like 400+degrees, only to 350, so if you need the extra heat it might not work as well for you, but then again it might be worth a shot!  Great buy for the money and I&#x27;m happy as a clam :))</li>
            <li> used it two times and decided that my hair needs LESS heat - more love. Still a good size curling iron. Heats up fast!</li>
            <li> This product works great.  My hair was full of body after each use.  A great value for the price. You will non be disappointed</li>
            <li> I lovw this curler, its heats up quick doesn&#x27;t have that after burn smell when it heats up. The color are so cute for those who want to match your room color and stff.I choose this size because it gives your those big bouncy curls. I don&#x27;t recomand this size for sshort hair the waves are to big. This products leaves my hair silky and shiny I love it!   I order this on a Sunday like at 2am night and I received it on Monday shippment was quick!   ***also it comes with this travel bag</li>
            <li> wasnt to impressed... after a couple of use it started to melt itself and got rid of it... a hazard to my wifes hair...</li>
            <li> My daughter use it, but takes for ever to finally get curls on all her hair, I am a father trying to surprise a daughter, but well not a men product, not so familiar with this things ;(</li>
            <li> Purchased this on Monday, just received it, super fast shipping too.. i wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the correct size for my bob hair cut.. well, i was wrong!! perfect enough for that bounce that i LOVE and NEED.. 30 heat settings, 350 degrees salon heat, 30 second heat up and auto shut-off after 60 minutes.. can&#x27;t wait until i use it tonight!! i know im gonna get good results.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product for curling my hair, but to bend wood for my model ship building hobby, and it works great for that...</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough, if i can return it i would!! I had to buy another one. I do not recommend!!</li>
            <li> I love it! love it! love it! .... leaves a nice soft curl and it does not burn my hair</li>
            <li> No complaints at all, other than the location of the power switch.  This is a problem with other irons, not just this one though.  You get used to it and avoid that spot though.  It works great and gets super hot.  I love the 30 adjustable heat settings.  I can put it on a very low setting to use on my preschooler&#x27;s fine, thin hair and then turn it up for my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good quality for the price paid. I&#x27;ve had products by the same brand before so I knew it couldn&#x27;t be bad, but i was pleasantly surprised. The barrel heats up as promised, fast and all the way to 350 F. Hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck on the clamp as with some curling irons.  Overall great product.</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t heat up for longer than a month it wouldn&#x27;t curl right or stay hot not worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not work properly, and I can&#x27;t return it,because took in another country</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that has a mind of its own. This curling iron gets the job done. I have curls for days and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> No, seriously, this curling iron does NOTHING.  My hair is about 2&#x27; long.  I have long hair.  I had been using a 1\\&quot; high end curling iron this whole time and I finally decided the curls didn&#x27;t really work.  So, I went out to my local store and I picked this one up.  It was the last 1.5\\&quot; curling iron they had left.  I figured all curling irons are created equal.  Nope.  This thing sucks.  It does nothing.  I turn the heat up all the way and I leave the iron in my hair for about 30 seconds to see if it does anything.  It does nothing.  My high end 1\\&quot; iron heats up under 10 seconds and curls my hair in under 3 seconds.  After 30 seconds with this iron it STILL DOES NOTHING.  This curling iron is now a heated defense weapon or something.  I don&#x27;t know what to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPLURGE ON A HIGH END CURLING IRON.  SPEND THE $100.  THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li> Love this!! This curling iron is very smooth and the barrel gives big nice curls.. and for the cost you can&#x27;t ask for more. Gets hot quickly and has auto turn off - good for forgetful people like me.</li>
            <li> i love love love this curling iron&lt;br /&gt;I was originally going to get a wand but im glad i purchased this instead&lt;br /&gt;the shipping time was fast and the product works great on natural and weave hair</li>
            <li> its great, it heats up fast</li>
            <li> Heats up fine but doesn&#x27;t clamp tight enough to hold my hair. I have bought a ridiculous amount of curling irons. (I travel a lot and I tend to leave them behind.) I usually purchase CONAIR products because of the price. I bought this one thinking to try something different. This one is worthless. Will be ordering a CONAIR again.</li>
            <li> I have very, very long hair and I wanted an iron to give me looser curls than my 11/4 incher. This thing straightens hair and adds body but WILL NOT GIVE RINGLETS.  I&#x27;m white, with thin, wavy, long hair. If it can&#x27;t curl my hair, it can&#x27;t curl any hair.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I like using it when I want straight hair with more body than my flat iron gives me, and it&#x27;s really pretty!</li>
            <li> great product, it heats very QUICKLY!!!! great curls for long hair, big barrel as i hope for the loose curls i wanted!!! great price and great product!!!</li>
            <li> not even hot.  waste!!! I would return it I had the packing material.  This is the absolute worst curling iron ever.</li>
            <li> I love this curler. Gets hot super fast and shipment was on time like stated. Only thing about curler is the temperature nob can turn when you&#x27;re using it and sometimes turn very low without realizing it. But other then that there&#x27;s no serious downside.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT hold a curl!!! I have pretty thick hair and I thought that the thick barrel would help, but the curl stays for at most 1 hour. Definitely not happy with this curling iron.</li>
            <li> This really does what I had amazing curls in seconds. I strongly recommend this item for anyone with long straight hair that&#x27;s looking for fabulous curls.</li>
            <li> When I read the other reviews, I definitely had mixed feelings and did not know what to believe. I usually like trying things out for myself. The minute i received it which was the next day, thanks to PRIME, I tried it on my neighbor who has extensions. If you&#x27;ve had extensions before you know that it is difficult to curls and to maintain them and this curling iron did its job. I do not know if those who rated it poorly know how to use the product resulting in dissatisfaction, but what I do know is that it is worth the price and it did it&#x27;s job. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my own hair this week. Best investment yet!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, they recommend good quality product, will be a very good investment, enjoy it and they last much greetings</li>
            <li> Plugged it in and it sparked.  End of curling iron.  Never got to use it.  Dont buy this whatever you do.</li>
            <li> The Curling Iron is great, a little too big for what I wanted but still works!&lt;br /&gt;leaves your hair very shiny</li>
            <li> I have hard to curl hair - it&#x27;s very straight and fine. At the hottest setting, this doesn&#x27;t do much more than what a flat iron does - it puts a small curve onto the end of my hair and no more. Aside from that, the power switch and heat control are located where my hand hits both of them - cutting it off, and moving the control button up and down. Considering that, I did make sure to give it a chance on the highest setting without involuntary adjustments, and it just doesn&#x27;t curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Two days ago, my mother purchased this curling iron in hopes of producing big, beautiful curls in my sister&#x27;s hair.  My sister has ridiculously thick hair, and we figured the bigger iron would work well for her.  She tried it this morning, and it did NOTHING.  So, we thought that once again, her hair was too much for the tool.  We eventually tried it on my hair, which is thick, but not unmanageable.  Again, it did absolutely nothing, not a curl, not a wave, NADA! So, once more we decided to show the tool some mercy, and try it out on my other two sisters&#x27; medium and ultra fine hair.........SAME RESULTS. It was extremely disappointing, and a huge waste of money.  I would say that maybe the one we purchased did not heat properly, but we put it on the highest setting and it was extremely hot.  We even went to the extreme of holding the hair in the barrel for over a minute! I couldn&#x27;t believe that the reviews on this were so positive (which is the reason we purchased it in the first place).  So, I thought some of you may benefit from hearing that this was NOT all it was praised to be!</li>
            <li> Heats up rather quick, unique looking and curls well. I have thick medium length hair and this works perfectly! I just wish these would have a beep or something to notify you it&#x27;s up to temp.</li>
            <li> did not get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> el producto aduirido fue  identico al ofrecido muy completo para lo cual fue escogido  sin queja alguna hasta ahora volveria a comprarlo</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and it is very difficult to curl hair. It is a very heavy object which can make your arms very tired while trying to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> THIS  CURLING IRON IS GREAT FOR SHORT OR MEDIUM LENGTH HAIR . GIVES YOU JUST ENOUGH CURL THAT LOOKS NATURAL AN IS VERY EASY TO USE AN HANDLED.</li>
            <li> So for a relatively inexpensive curling iron, I thought this would do the trick, but sadly, it didn&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t stay on the hottest setting, the dial moves around--and it did not curl my hair at all. Granted, my hair is very thick and coarse, but I was expecting a LOT more.</li>
            <li> I got this product a few days early and was so excited to use it but it got to hot, burnt my hair and then started smoking, since then it wont heat up at all. is there a way i can exchange it or return it for a new one? I really wanted this curling Iron. I hope I can exchange it for one that works.</li>
            <li> the curling iron I received is not the one pictured, I wanted the black and purple one, not this one I received, I am not happy with the item I received, I want the one that is pictured</li>
            <li> Hair  wouldn&#x27;t stay in the barrel.  It didn&#x27;t clap tight at all. Seems to be made only for thicker hair, which not all of us women have the luxury of having. Disappointing.</li>
