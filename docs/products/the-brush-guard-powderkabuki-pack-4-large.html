            <li>I really like these for my brushes!!</li>

            <li>Similarly, I will buy more.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Kabuki pack and use them on my Sigma F20 Large Powder Brush, Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki Brush, Sigma F40 Large Angled Contour Brush, and my ELF Flat Top Powder brush.  </li>
            <li>I thought they would vary enough to put my eye shadow brush but they all fit my powder and blush brush.</li>
            <li>If you have makeup brushes, you absolutely need these Brush Guards.</li>
            <li>Brush holds its shape very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well in getting your brushes back to it&#x27;s original shape.  </li>
            <li>My brushes have returned to their original shape as if they have been recently purchased.</li>
            <li>I just wish the Guards shrunk back to their original form.</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep brush guards on the up-swing of the brush - i.e. - don&#x27;t push them down..  </li>
            <li>I use these all the time and my brushes look like new again!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really helpful when transporting the brushes and they dry faster and keep their original shapes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clever idea and an inexpensive way to preserve ,and store cosmetic brushes without taking up space.  </li>
            <li>So many brushes with so little time.</li>
            <li>A little circle of dust will collect but that&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>normally store my brushes upright, but when drying, put these on to maintain their shape.  </li>
            <li>Really great product for keeping my expensive brushes like new.  </li>
            <li>brushes looked like new _</li>
            <li>The packages marked with the company Coastal Scents are the exact same products as the Brush Guard name brand.</li>
            <li>Your brush will be ready to use the next day and will have also been shaped like new by this brush guard.  </li>
            <li>but overall I really like them</li>
            <li>I bought these Brush Guards because the protective case for my kabuki brush was slowly disintegrating, which made it harder to keep it in good condition and still take it with me on the go.</li>
            <li>I have makeup brushes from the Real Technique collection which have very large round brush handle bottoms and</li>
            <li>These are a must if you are serious about makeup and keeping your brushes in top shape.  </li>

            <li> Works very well in getting your brushes back to it&#x27;s original shape.  If you have expensive brushes, this is a must have!</li>
            <li> I bought these Brush Guards because the protective case for my kabuki brush was slowly disintegrating, which made it harder to keep it in good condition and still take it with me on the go. I was not disappointed-- the brush guard is easy to use and fits well over a M.A.C. #180 buffer brush. Definitely give it a try if you are regularly taking your makeup brushes with you or need a way to keep the brush&#x27;s shape intact while drying after cleaning them.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product five stars is because it comes with four nets but they are all the same size. I thought they would vary enough to put my eye shadow brush but they all fit my powder and blush brush. I love the way they keep my blush and powder brush clean and separate.</li>
            <li> Really great product for keeping my expensive brushes like new.  Instead of purchasing the combo pack, I bought a pack of each of the 4 sizes.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time and they are great for face brushes. I might invest in the brush tree you can get on amazon for about $20 that is easier to use though but these are great</li>
            <li> i do use it whenever i wash my brushes but its not very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;my brushes looked like new _ some hair fall out though</li>
            <li> How come I didn&#x27;t think of this??  It&#x27;s a clever idea and an inexpensive way to preserve ,and store cosmetic brushes without taking up space.  Great idea!</li>
            <li> So many brushes with so little time. This saves time and money by helping to dry brushes after cleaning. Less acne and skin irritation when using these brush guards.  I can store brushes in both my stand up tray and my roll up bag.  Make sure to keep brush guards on the up-swing of the brush - i.e. - don&#x27;t push them down..  Pull the brush down through the guard at all times.  Store wet brushes upside down in stand up trays so that they dry well and don&#x27;t collect dust.  Love this product.  Had to get used to it at first because it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, but cannot imagine life without these brush wonders!</li>
            <li> I really like these for my brushes!! They are really great for travel and storage to prevent dirt collecting on the brushes. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> Was very impressed with the service. My brushes have returned to their original shape as if they have been recently purchased. The best creation in makeup industry because of it  protect brushes from becoming scratchy and shapeless that can last for years and years.</li>
            <li> I love these for traveling and every day storage.  It keeps my brushes in nice shape.  I keep my makeup brushes behind a lot of stuff so the cat won&#x27;t scratch her face on them and pushing the guards down fraying out the bristles.  It collects dust on the guard so my brushes don&#x27;t have a bunch of lint in them.  A little circle of dust will collect but that&#x27;s okay, I just dust it off and use it.  It&#x27;s better than the whole brush having fuzz.</li>
            <li> These brush guards are awesome.  They protect the hairs of my brushes from flaring out.  They help my brushes maintain their original shape.  I purchased the Kabuki pack and use them on my Sigma F20 Large Powder Brush, Sigma F80 Flat Top Kabuki Brush, Sigma F40 Large Angled Contour Brush, and my ELF Flat Top Powder brush.  The guards fit all of these beautifully.  I have placed the guard on my F80 brush immediately after washing and left it to dry overnight.  The next morning when I need to use it, it&#x27;s still a tiny bit damp but I don&#x27;t mind because I apply my liquid foundation with my brush slightly damp.  I do this because I don&#x27;t want my brush to absorb a lot of product.</li>
            <li> If you have makeup brushes, you absolutely need these Brush Guards. They are expanding plastic mesh tubes that fit over your makeup brush handles, and then you slide them up to cover your brush head. This way, your brush will maintain its shape and not fall prey to the dreaded splay that always occurs in all brushes. Your cleaning regime should include these guards as well. After you have washed your brush, and blotted the excess water, you slide these guards on your brush and then place the brush upside down in a cup on your vanity or sink to dry. Your brush will be ready to use the next day and will have also been shaped like new by this brush guard.  There are several sizes from the largest to fit Kabuki brushes down to the smallest eye shadow brushes. The packages marked with the company Coastal Scents are the exact same products as the Brush Guard name brand. Be careful and don&#x27;t be fooled into purchasing copy cats. Coasta Scents and The Brush Guard brand are both genuine.  I have makeup brushes from the Real Technique collection which have very large round brush handle bottoms and the Brush Guards all fit nicely.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time and my brushes look like new again! I usually put the guards on after I wash the brushes and leave them to dry. Love this!</li>
            <li> My girl friends and I love it so much, very good product and same as the picture showed, will order again, thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought Brush Guard--Powder/Kabuki Pack. excellent case for brushes. Brush holds its shape very well. The hair does not stick out. Similarly, I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, will purchase again. Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best invention ever! I use them for travel, in my purse&#x27;s makeup bag, and storage in the bathroom. Don&#x27;t be deterred by their size, they stretch around even the thickest handles.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I had it for 2 years now and use it for all my make up brushes.</li>
            <li> Love these! I purchased both the Blush size and Kabuki size, but discovered the blush size is just too snug for fuller blush brushes such as 129 &amp; 168 Contour.  So A&amp;M ordering another pack of Kabuki sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally store my brushes upright, but when drying, put these on to maintain their shape.  They&#x27;re also perfect for traveling.  I keep two short handled brushes in my handbag and keep these guards on them for protection.  Great product and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really helpful when transporting the brushes and they dry faster and keep their original shapes. I just wish the Guards shrunk back to their original form. I think they would last longer.</li>
            <li> I actually liked the brush guards I had ordered the powder brush guards but instead I got the foundation guards I was upset because I wanted to use them on my powder brushes but it&#x27;s okay because now I&#x27;m using them for my smaller brushes but overall I really like them it helps keep the shape on my brushes.</li>
            <li> These are a must if you are serious about makeup and keeping your brushes in top shape.  I wash them often, and in between they stay contained and together in these shields.</li>
