            <li>the tension rods aren&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>It fits the shape of the nail perfectly and cuts cuticles (not nails) quite well.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman just makes an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Excellent sharpness.  </li>
            <li>But for me, I agree that the tension rods aren&#x27;t the greatest.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a brilliant, quality addition to the bathroom cupboard.  </li>
            <li>My very favorite cuticle nipper!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a great cuticle cutter and thought with a name like Tweezerman, I had found it.  </li>
            <li>Honestly the best nail clippers and cuticle clipper</li>
            <li>So despite the great reputation, this isn&#x27;t the cuticle nipper for me.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT, FEATURES FINER CLIPPING THAN THE ONES YOU BUY FROM THE DRUGSTORE</li>

            <li>This is by far the best set of NIPPERS ive ever had..  AMAZING.</li>
            <li>As advertised - good strong clippers.</li>
            <li>There are huge differences in steel and these seem like a good value.  </li>
            <li>It may work better if someone else was using it on your cuticles, rather than if you used it yourself on your own</li>
            <li>I love all tweezerman products.</li>
            <li>When you use these take care that you don&#x27;t nip more cuticle skin than intended.</li>
            <li>As with all the Tweezerman products I own, this cuticle nipper is of heavy build and excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Accurate and very precise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always bought Tweezerman at Sally Beauty Supply, but I got a better deal on Amazon Prime and got to enjoy the prospect of free delivery as well.</li>
            <li>They even cut through nails easily.</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman nipper is an excellent tool: durable, precise, an extremely sharp.</li>
            <li>Fine quality cuticle nippers.  </li>

            <li>Fits comfortably in hand.  </li>
            <li>Good tension and excellent cutting quality.</li>
            <li>These work just fine though and probably deserve one more star, but I was spoiled by the earlier version.</li>
            <li>I had an earlier iteration of these nippers which were of better fit and quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these for several months now, and they still are sharp and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>First time I ever bought a pair</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re not careful, you could easily cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are so large, it takes quite a bit to get into place to cut cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Very well crafted.  </li>
            <li>am very disapponted at Teezerman.</li>
            <li>of information is the main reason I don&#x27;t shop Amazon as much as I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d dropped my older Tweezerman&#x27;s on a concrete floor and it bent the tip, but was still able to use for years and only just replaced it because I lost the old ones.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman Professional Stainless Steel Award Winning Slant, Pink.</li>
            <li>Hope spring lasts better than other brands!!</li>
            <li>As a tool guy I like things that are well made, which is harder to find these days with all the cheap junk being sold.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase my first cuticle trimmer after thinking &amp;#34;I can do that&amp;#34; during a recent manicure.</li>
            <li>The pricing is reasonable when you consider it&#x27;s the last of this product you&#x27;ll need to buy, unless of course, you lose yours, as I did!</li>
            <li>The Trim’s were only a few bucks but work so much better.  </li>
            <li>so far addresses Amazon&#x27;s listing and not the actual product.</li>

            <li> The jaw opens 3/16&amp;#34; at the tip, which would do the the job, but my bifocal lens are not going to settle for less than 5/16&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sorry it took me so long to discover the Tweezerman brand.  I have disposed of all of my manicure tools made by other manufacturers and replaced them with Tweezerman products.  Everything that is supposed to cut - nippers, clippers, etc., - is sharp and cuts without pulling.  My highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Overrated, over-priced.  I was looking for a great cuticle cutter and thought with a name like Tweezerman, I had found it.  I bought these and used for over a month.  I have gone  back to my little Trim cutters.  The Trim’s were only a few bucks but work so much better.  These are so large, it takes quite a bit to get into place to cut cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and just buy a basic cutter.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best set of NIPPERS ive ever had..  AMAZING. Sharp, Lightweight and Made in USA</li>
            <li> I love all tweezerman products. They have great customer service and will always sharpen your tools free of charge. Love them!</li>
            <li> I would recommend anything made and sold by Tweezerman. I have had these before and they&#x27;ve been lost in a move. Tweezerman lifetime guarantees its products. I have nail clippers and tweezers by them and have to say they hold their value and have never gotten out of alignment or dull. The pricing is reasonable when you consider it&#x27;s the last of this product you&#x27;ll need to buy, unless of course, you lose yours, as I did! I&#x27;ve always bought Tweezerman at Sally Beauty Supply, but I got a better deal on Amazon Prime and got to enjoy the prospect of free delivery as well.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to using nippers, but I keep losing them. Lost two OPI ones, Revlon, and some no names from Rite aid I don&#x27;t recall. Tweezerman ones are my 5th pair. I think they are alright for the price.. the tension rods aren&#x27;t the greatest. Had better quality nippers and had worse ones. I personally will try different nippers the next time. Maybe stick with Revlon since OPI is usually more expensive.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job it&#x27;s supposed to. Cutting edges do not close precisely and the spring gets bent out of shape. Do not buy</li>
            <li> Excellent! Very well crafted.  Accurate and very precise. Seems to be very solid.  You get what you pay for with stuff like this.</li>
            <li> As a tool guy I like things that are well made, which is harder to find these days with all the cheap junk being sold.  There are huge differences in steel and these seem like a good value.  First time I ever bought a pair but I like it..</li>
            <li> This is my third pair.  They&#x27;re a brilliant, quality addition to the bathroom cupboard.  They even cut through nails easily.</li>
            <li> I thought I would vouch for this cuticle nipper as the only other review so far addresses Amazon&#x27;s listing and not the actual product. As with all the Tweezerman products I own, this cuticle nipper is of heavy build and excellent quality. It fits the shape of the nail perfectly and cuts cuticles (not nails) quite well.</li>
            <li> These go in my purse with me everywhere!  So sharp so there&#x27;s never any tugging on my cuticles.  No more hangnails!</li>
            <li> Fine quality cuticle nippers.  Fits comfortably in hand.  Good tension and excellent cutting quality. Would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman just makes an awesome product. I&#x27;d dropped my older Tweezerman&#x27;s on a concrete floor and it bent the tip, but was still able to use for years and only just replaced it because I lost the old ones.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT, FEATURES FINER CLIPPING THAN THE ONES YOU BUY FROM THE DRUGSTORE</li>
            <li> As advertised - good strong clippers. Hope spring lasts better than other brands!!</li>
            <li> I had an earlier iteration of these nippers which were of better fit and quality. These work just fine though and probably deserve one more star, but I was spoiled by the earlier version.</li>
            <li> Professional quality, very sharp nipper.  But if you&#x27;re not careful, you could easily cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The specific angle of the cutter takes some time to get used to.  It may work better if someone else was using it on your cuticles, rather than if you used it yourself on your own cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a small plastic cap that fits over the end to keep it closed when it&#x27;s not being used.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman cuticle nippers come in different jaw sizes: 1/2 or 1/4 inch.&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice if whoever input the information on this one did a more complete job.&lt;br /&gt;Lack of information is the main reason I don&#x27;t shop Amazon as much as I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Tweezerman-LTD-Cuticle-Nipper/dp/B007NJVNOI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1370788357&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;tweezerman+cuticle+nipper</li>
            <li> Honestly the best nail clippers and cuticle clipper I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be worse! It didn&#x27;t cut at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disapponted at Teezerman. I bought other items of them and were disappointed to all of them except&lt;br /&gt;the Tweezerman Professional Stainless Steel Award Winning Slant, Pink.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase my first cuticle trimmer after thinking &amp;#34;I can do that&amp;#34; during a recent manicure. The Tweezerman nipper is an excellent tool: durable, precise, an extremely sharp. Note: SHARP! When you use these take care that you don&#x27;t nip more cuticle skin than intended.</li>
            <li> PUSH YOUR CUTICLES BACK USING AN ORANGE STICK.  THIS IS RECOMMENDED BY DERMATOLOGISTS.  I LEARNED THE HARD WAY BY GETTING AN INFECTION IN FINGERNAIL BY A NAIL TECHNICIAN.  WHEN YOU CUT THE CUTICLE YOU OPEN UP THE NAIL BED TO INFECTION.  SO, JUST SAY NO TO CUTTING YOUR CUTICLES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try to sterilize the nipper by autoclaving it (boiling water for 15 min) - they rusted upon drying.</li>
            <li> My bag of manicure &amp; pedicure tools that have served me long &amp; well was left on an Amtrak train, so I am sadly replacing each item bit by bit.  I tried this Tweezerman Cuticle Nipper based on Amazon reviews &amp; reading up on all brands.  The packaging says neither 1/2 jaw nor 1/4 jaw; it is what it is.  Excellent sharpness.  But for me, I agree that the tension rods aren&#x27;t the greatest.  They are weaker &amp; don&#x27;t open as wide as other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  The jaw opens 3/16&amp;#34; at the tip, which would do the the job, but my bifocal lens are not going to settle for less than 5/16&amp;#34;.  So despite the great reputation, this isn&#x27;t the cuticle nipper for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for several months now, and they still are sharp and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> My very favorite cuticle nipper!</li>
