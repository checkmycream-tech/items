            <li>The conditioner is pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like a mini scalp massage every morning.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves a nice, cooling sensation on your scalp.</li>
            <li>The aroma is awesome and the product really does a nice job of reconditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>Packaging was done nicely- wrapped in plastic and no way for the bottles to spill out.</li>
            <li>It actually tingles once applied and feels real good and smells great.  </li>
            <li>The product works well as an effective hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is really nice......</li>
            <li>Get a nice tingle when you use it</li>
            <li>The brand is very good, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner, it is worth the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; amount that you have to pay for a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>I liked this conditioner when I was introduced to it at a salon, and I have grown to like it even more using it at home.</li>
            <li>Best product for my balding head by far.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner, I feel fresh and energized after using it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the price which is by far the cheapest I ever seen.</li>
            <li>and it seems to keep my hair nice and healthy</li>
            <li>My first review here of anything because Amazon orders have been great over the years.</li>
            <li>I bought this exact conditioner before via Amazon and thought it was great.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves your hair silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>I am all for a refreshing zing, but I imagine at any moment my hair will be falling out of my head as I wash the conditioner out.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to keep it off your eyes.</li>
            <li>I love pampering the 9 hairs I have left on my head with the best shampoo and conditioner around.</li>
            <li>I think that it works better than T-Gel.</li>
            <li>Packaging was ok.</li>
            <li>Love the product--large size more convenient.  </li>
            <li>I bought this more for the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>As a man, this is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li>My favorite exercise is swimming.</li>
            <li>I have nothing more to say than that.</li>
            <li>I loved the fresh scent that this conditioner had.</li>
            <li>itÂ´s better if you use a pump.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a bald spot on the top</li>
            <li>This is a lot cheaper and it keeps me from growing more bald.</li>
            <li>I like to get the big bottles, as they&#x27;re the best value.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the most organic thing on the market though, cancer maybe in a couple of years of using it ?</li>
            <li>While more work, I find it even better.</li>
            <li>Looking at prices in stores, I thought surely there would be a cheaper</li>
            <li>Also, I have to use a lot more of this product at a time than the products I am used to.</li>
            <li>American crew conditioner is some of the best on the market, I love the smell and the way my hair looks after using it.</li>
            <li>THIS CONDITIONER IS TOP NOTCH AND WILL GET YOU</li>
            <li>SO MANY GIRLS</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>I have been using these products for years and will gladly continue to do so.</li>
            <li>i love it, i feel refreshed and clean every time i use it!</li>
            <li>My hair feels so light and smooth after every wash and people notice for sure!</li>
            <li>so it feels nice and cool and tingly throughout application all the way until you are out of the shower for about five minutes.</li>
            <li>I love being able to order from Amazon and know that I will receive it in a timely and secure fashion.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the menthol feel, it&#x27;s just relaxing and refreshing while you shower.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong minty smell and tingling sensation, but that is something I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and clean, it smells good, and, most importantly, it tingles.</li>
            <li>your hair been shiny, softly, strong and fresh!</li>
            <li>And the presentation is huge...</li>
            <li>I use hair gel each day for work and this conditioner makes my hair really smooth after I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I also just finished up some American Crew Tea Tree Calming Conditioner, and was happy with that too.</li>
            <li>Shipper needs to secure cap as product leaked during shipment.  </li>
            <li>Helped me reach $35 for free shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best for firm hold.</li>
            <li>my hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Great basic conditioner.</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>It feels good in your head and your hair comes out soft.</li>
            <li>The refreshing feeling and eucalyptus scent start my day right.</li>
            <li>The conditioner itself seems a bit more liquid than what I was thinking for a conditioner; the minty smell was very soothing and strong and I could feel it working my scalp/hair.</li>
            <li>Its my first review in Amazon because I have always been satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>What a refreshing feeling first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>Although there is no shampoo product that will regrow hair, I find that the Crew Stimulating line has significantly reduced the rate of my hair loss.</li>
            <li>Was incredibly watered down.</li>
            <li>The reason why is because the shampoo cleans the pores in my scalp, leaving me with a tingling clean feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>Hair comes out nice, soft, and feels light and airy.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll feel clean after using it, even though its just a conditioner.</li>
            <li>The quality is comparable to the shampoos and conditioners provided in most of the large hotel chains.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will not be buying it again, I will stick with the cheaper brands this does nothing special</li>
            <li>Glad I can get a decent price with free Prime delivery.</li>
            <li>I tend to have frizzy hair (even when it&#x27;s short), but this conditioner allows me to look good without having to wear hair gel/fiber.</li>
            <li>This product cost more than twice as much in stores.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s doing anything great for your hair!  </li>
            <li>Convenient ordering and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is the perfect complement for American Crew Daily Shampoo...</li>
            <li>effect(with less of a great smell though) for cheaper.</li>
            <li>But, it can be pretty strong when you first use it.</li>
            <li>Tingles on your scalp, has that fresh peppermint smell.</li>
            <li>My head feels tingly and I feel so fresh and awake afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li>it smells awesomely fresh without smelling too feminine.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure that after I wash the conditioner out of my hair that I wash my hands no less than six times.  </li>
            <li>really like it because my hair feels clean after using it, like there is no product build up like you get with some hair</li>
            <li>However, I also enjoyed the pleasant mint/citrus smell it leaves behind.  </li>
            <li>I must admit that the reason I bought it was because I liked Graham Webb&#x27;s Ice Conditioner, and could not find it for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product gives a great fresh and clean sensation every single time it is used, totally recommended specailly during the hot summer months in GA</li>
            <li>Too bad they got rid of the good old Citrus Mint, which was more balanced and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Again, I am happy with the product overall and the price simply cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>Purchasing the 33.8 oz is much more cost effective than the in store pricing at least in this area.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both items for clean and manageable hair.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair soft and adds a bit of volume (my hair is fine).</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I believe I am just going to stick with standard conditioner that treats my hair much better than this over priced nonsense.</li>
            <li>Love american crew.  </li>
            <li>That feeling went away after the first use.</li>
            <li>i LOVE american crew products and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>These are my top three thoughts about American Crew&#x27;s Stimulating Conditioner:    1)</li>
            <li>My all time favorite conditioner, especially the minty eucalyptus smell.</li>
            <li>Love American Crew and boy did I get a bargain on this 33 Ounce Bottle.  </li>
            <li>I cannot remember how I first ran across this item but have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>This product smells pretty neutral/good manly smell.</li>
            <li>and sure enough this is it.</li>
            <li>guy at work was talking about it and told me I should try it, that it was more affordable than Graham Webb, but similar.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the American Crew products for years and love them.</li>
            <li>So far, its helped with dry scalp when combined with a good dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>I buy several units at a time for convenience and free shipping while keeping a year&#x27;s worth in stock.</li>
            <li>The conditioner not only moisturizes but it also lightly tingles when its on the scalp and has a fresh, minty scent.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is a huge improvement over major brands.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s pretty much everything I want in a conditioner.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not sure what to call it--spicy?), leaving my hair feeling good for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Makes you feel real stimulated kind of tingles when it applied, should leave on your hair for a few minutes to feel the effect and makes your hair manageable.</li>
            <li>and it was ready to go.</li>
            <li>Our hair shop sells the real thing.  </li>
            <li>When I do wash my hair though I must absolutely must use American Crew to give it that soft touch I love.</li>
            <li>My hair thanks me for it.</li>
            <li>It smells really minty and leaves my head tingling (but not burning).</li>
            <li>Although it is available locally, it is in 16.9 oz.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I was given a bottle of American Crew conditioner and pomade as a nice gesture last year by a co-worker.  </li>
            <li>nice conditioner for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Paired with their shampoo the two work well to keep your hair soft, but I suspect you can have a similar or better</li>
            <li>Other than that I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>Oh and a technique I learned the hard way, make sure that when you wash this product out of your hair, taken extra sets to make sure</li>
            <li>I also had to use more than the average amount of conditioner to cover all my hair.  </li>
            <li>I used to think that the \\&quot;proper\\&quot; amount of conditioner needed for hair wasn&#x27;t enough for my full head, so conditioners weren&#x27;t used for their fullest</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and manageable and, along with its companion shampoo, is fine for daily use.</li>
            <li>No point buying this when you can buy a mass-market conditioner for way less and for better results.    </li>
            <li>American Crew deals with chlorine in my hair better than products made specifically for such.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s really really particular.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it the cooling effect was so strong it burned a little and continued to burn after I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li>I am pretty particular when it comes to my hair products, and I rarely wash or condition it (rinsing under water is usually enough as I like to have some of my hairs natural oils.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone who uses Crew.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend CREW products</li>
            <li>Good product that I bought for the stimulating effect and less for the conditioning effect during dry winter months.  </li>
            <li>Feels watery and washes out too easily compared to other conditioners.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is not thick like it normally is but is watery and comes out of the bottle too</li>
            <li>I needed a new conditioner and i decided to try this one out because its supposed to be a &amp;#34;stimulating conditioner.&amp;#34;  That it is.  </li>
            <li>potential.&lt;br /&gt;The American Crew shampoo has been seeing lots of action in my shower in the past year or so, and their conditioner seemed like a worthwhile purchase after my previous one ran out (which I thought was good enough).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s conditioner, and I can&#x27;t get too excited one way or the other about it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that the top of my head is drier than usual, so that&#x27;s a plus?</li>
            <li>I normally get to putting this in as soon as possible and leaving it in until I&#x27;m ready to get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I have used the art of shaving conditioner in the past but for the money this is a far better deal</li>
            <li>However, I took it down to 4-starts because after ordering it twice online, in both cases the product leaked out and was a huge mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li>I buy the large 33.8 OZ size and then \\&quot;download\\&quot; part of it to a smaller bottle to keep in my shower.</li>
            <li>I have been reading that too much shampoing is bad for your hair, thus a conditioner is seen in so much of a better light by me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say about this conditioner only because it works so well.  </li>
            <li>The mint in this MUCH stronger than the standard &amp;#34;cool mint&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Unless one wants a mint, zing Christmas nightmare all over their face for the next twenty minutes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not whiskey in an old west saloon.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, this conditioner also leaves my hair soft as well.</li>
            <li>But when I got it, there was conditioner everywhere, the product was not properly sealed nor packaged very well.</li>
            <li>If you have soft hair, then this might work for you...</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft with a hint of mint.</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift by a coworker and definitely wont be using much longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s because of the stimulating action of Crew&#x27;s conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 47 years old, with thinning hair.</li>
            <li>This fixed it.</li>
            <li>i also feel like my hair regains some of it&#x27;s natural shine and moisture</li>
            <li>The real test is how it works on the majority of people who have normal to dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Firstly I have hair that can not stand to go without a conditioner, as it will feel dry and straw like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the crazy thing is this product is very popular with men.  </li>
            <li>This particular bottle really seems like they have watered down the formula of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>The new product I purchased is of similar consistency as the Amazon product.</li>
            <li>That said, I really like the American Crew Daily Stimulating Conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and my scalp is not dry.</li>
            <li>I knocked off one star because of the shape of the bottle, I wish it was a pump dispenser, the awkward size of the bottle is a pain in the shower but the conditioner product is really good.</li>
            <li>As far as actual conditioner quality, I am no hair expert (single straight male)</li>
            <li>and I can say it&#x27;s certainly no worse than any other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Not that it causes much of a difference in expected effect but it should be known prior to buying.</li>
            <li>Watered down - Pours out like milk - the real stuff has to practically be squeezed to come out of the bottle - save your money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty normal guy without any hair super-powers, so I generally find it difficult to tell the difference between the various high quality conditioners.</li>
            <li>The product is good, but a little expensive.</li>

            <li> My favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like a mini scalp massage every morning.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves a nice, cooling sensation on your scalp.</li>
            <li> The aroma is awesome and the product really does a nice job of reconditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> Packaging was done nicely- wrapped in plastic and no way for the bottles to spill out.</li>
            <li> It actually tingles once applied and feels real good and smells great.  </li>
            <li> The product works well as an effective hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is really nice......</li>
            <li> Get a nice tingle when you use it</li>
            <li> The brand is very good, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner, it is worth the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; amount that you have to pay for a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> I liked this conditioner when I was introduced to it at a salon, and I have grown to like it even more using it at home.</li>
            <li> Best product for my balding head by far.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, I feel fresh and energized after using it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price which is by far the cheapest I ever seen.</li>
            <li> and it seems to keep my hair nice and healthy</li>
            <li> My first review here of anything because Amazon orders have been great over the years.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact conditioner before via Amazon and thought it was great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaves your hair silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> I am all for a refreshing zing, but I imagine at any moment my hair will be falling out of my head as I wash the conditioner out.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to keep it off your eyes.</li>
            <li> I love pampering the 9 hairs I have left on my head with the best shampoo and conditioner around.</li>
            <li> I think that it works better than T-Gel.</li>
            <li> Packaging was ok.</li>
            <li> Love the product--large size more convenient.  </li>
            <li> I bought this more for the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> As a man, this is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li> My favorite exercise is swimming.</li>
            <li> I have nothing more to say than that.</li>
            <li> I loved the fresh scent that this conditioner had.</li>
            <li> itÂ´s better if you use a pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a bald spot on the top</li>
            <li> This is a lot cheaper and it keeps me from growing more bald.</li>
            <li> I like to get the big bottles, as they&#x27;re the best value.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the most organic thing on the market though, cancer maybe in a couple of years of using it ?</li>
            <li> While more work, I find it even better.</li>
            <li> Looking at prices in stores, I thought surely there would be a cheaper</li>
            <li> Also, I have to use a lot more of this product at a time than the products I am used to.</li>
            <li> American crew conditioner is some of the best on the market, I love the smell and the way my hair looks after using it.</li>
            <li> THIS CONDITIONER IS TOP NOTCH AND WILL GET YOU</li>
            <li> SO MANY GIRLS</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for years and will gladly continue to do so.</li>
            <li> i love it, i feel refreshed and clean every time i use it!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so light and smooth after every wash and people notice for sure!</li>
            <li> so it feels nice and cool and tingly throughout application all the way until you are out of the shower for about five minutes.</li>
            <li> I love being able to order from Amazon and know that I will receive it in a timely and secure fashion.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the menthol feel, it&#x27;s just relaxing and refreshing while you shower.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong minty smell and tingling sensation, but that is something I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and clean, it smells good, and, most importantly, it tingles.</li>
            <li> your hair been shiny, softly, strong and fresh!</li>
            <li> And the presentation is huge...</li>
            <li> I use hair gel each day for work and this conditioner makes my hair really smooth after I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I also just finished up some American Crew Tea Tree Calming Conditioner, and was happy with that too.</li>
            <li> Shipper needs to secure cap as product leaked during shipment.  </li>
            <li> Helped me reach $35 for free shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best for firm hold.</li>
            <li> my hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Great basic conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> It feels good in your head and your hair comes out soft.</li>
            <li> The refreshing feeling and eucalyptus scent start my day right.</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself seems a bit more liquid than what I was thinking for a conditioner; the minty smell was very soothing and strong and I could feel it working my scalp/hair.</li>
            <li> Its my first review in Amazon because I have always been satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> What a refreshing feeling first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Although there is no shampoo product that will regrow hair, I find that the Crew Stimulating line has significantly reduced the rate of my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Was incredibly watered down.</li>
            <li> The reason why is because the shampoo cleans the pores in my scalp, leaving me with a tingling clean feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> Hair comes out nice, soft, and feels light and airy.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel clean after using it, even though its just a conditioner.</li>
            <li> The quality is comparable to the shampoos and conditioners provided in most of the large hotel chains.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not be buying it again, I will stick with the cheaper brands this does nothing special</li>
            <li> Glad I can get a decent price with free Prime delivery.</li>
            <li> I tend to have frizzy hair (even when it&#x27;s short), but this conditioner allows me to look good without having to wear hair gel/fiber.</li>
            <li> This product cost more than twice as much in stores.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s doing anything great for your hair!  </li>
            <li> Convenient ordering and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is the perfect complement for American Crew Daily Shampoo...</li>
            <li> effect(with less of a great smell though) for cheaper.</li>
            <li> But, it can be pretty strong when you first use it.</li>
            <li> Tingles on your scalp, has that fresh peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> My head feels tingly and I feel so fresh and awake afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li> it smells awesomely fresh without smelling too feminine.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure that after I wash the conditioner out of my hair that I wash my hands no less than six times.  </li>
            <li> really like it because my hair feels clean after using it, like there is no product build up like you get with some hair</li>
            <li> However, I also enjoyed the pleasant mint/citrus smell it leaves behind.  </li>
            <li> I must admit that the reason I bought it was because I liked Graham Webb&#x27;s Ice Conditioner, and could not find it for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product gives a great fresh and clean sensation every single time it is used, totally recommended specailly during the hot summer months in GA</li>
            <li> Too bad they got rid of the good old Citrus Mint, which was more balanced and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Again, I am happy with the product overall and the price simply cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> Purchasing the 33.8 oz is much more cost effective than the in store pricing at least in this area.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both items for clean and manageable hair.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair soft and adds a bit of volume (my hair is fine).</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I believe I am just going to stick with standard conditioner that treats my hair much better than this over priced nonsense.</li>
            <li> Love american crew.  </li>
            <li> That feeling went away after the first use.</li>
            <li> i LOVE american crew products and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> These are my top three thoughts about American Crew&#x27;s Stimulating Conditioner:    1)</li>
            <li> My all time favorite conditioner, especially the minty eucalyptus smell.</li>
            <li> Love American Crew and boy did I get a bargain on this 33 Ounce Bottle.  </li>
            <li> I cannot remember how I first ran across this item but have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> This product smells pretty neutral/good manly smell.</li>
            <li> and sure enough this is it.</li>
            <li> guy at work was talking about it and told me I should try it, that it was more affordable than Graham Webb, but similar.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the American Crew products for years and love them.</li>
            <li> So far, its helped with dry scalp when combined with a good dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I buy several units at a time for convenience and free shipping while keeping a year&#x27;s worth in stock.</li>
            <li> The conditioner not only moisturizes but it also lightly tingles when its on the scalp and has a fresh, minty scent.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a huge improvement over major brands.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s pretty much everything I want in a conditioner.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure what to call it--spicy?), leaving my hair feeling good for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel real stimulated kind of tingles when it applied, should leave on your hair for a few minutes to feel the effect and makes your hair manageable.</li>
            <li> and it was ready to go.</li>
            <li> Our hair shop sells the real thing.  </li>
            <li> When I do wash my hair though I must absolutely must use American Crew to give it that soft touch I love.</li>
            <li> My hair thanks me for it.</li>
            <li> It smells really minty and leaves my head tingling (but not burning).</li>
            <li> Although it is available locally, it is in 16.9 oz.</li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of American Crew conditioner and pomade as a nice gesture last year by a co-worker.  </li>
            <li> nice conditioner for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Paired with their shampoo the two work well to keep your hair soft, but I suspect you can have a similar or better</li>
            <li> Other than that I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Oh and a technique I learned the hard way, make sure that when you wash this product out of your hair, taken extra sets to make sure</li>
            <li> I also had to use more than the average amount of conditioner to cover all my hair.  </li>
            <li> I used to think that the \\&quot;proper\\&quot; amount of conditioner needed for hair wasn&#x27;t enough for my full head, so conditioners weren&#x27;t used for their fullest</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and manageable and, along with its companion shampoo, is fine for daily use.</li>
            <li> No point buying this when you can buy a mass-market conditioner for way less and for better results.    </li>
            <li> American Crew deals with chlorine in my hair better than products made specifically for such.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s really really particular.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it the cooling effect was so strong it burned a little and continued to burn after I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> I am pretty particular when it comes to my hair products, and I rarely wash or condition it (rinsing under water is usually enough as I like to have some of my hairs natural oils.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone who uses Crew.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend CREW products</li>
            <li> Good product that I bought for the stimulating effect and less for the conditioning effect during dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> Feels watery and washes out too easily compared to other conditioners.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is not thick like it normally is but is watery and comes out of the bottle too</li>
            <li> I needed a new conditioner and i decided to try this one out because its supposed to be a &amp;#34;stimulating conditioner.&amp;#34;  That it is.  </li>
            <li> potential.&lt;br /&gt;The American Crew shampoo has been seeing lots of action in my shower in the past year or so, and their conditioner seemed like a worthwhile purchase after my previous one ran out (which I thought was good enough).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s conditioner, and I can&#x27;t get too excited one way or the other about it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that the top of my head is drier than usual, so that&#x27;s a plus?</li>
            <li> I normally get to putting this in as soon as possible and leaving it in until I&#x27;m ready to get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have used the art of shaving conditioner in the past but for the money this is a far better deal</li>
            <li> However, I took it down to 4-starts because after ordering it twice online, in both cases the product leaked out and was a huge mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li> I buy the large 33.8 OZ size and then \\&quot;download\\&quot; part of it to a smaller bottle to keep in my shower.</li>
            <li> I have been reading that too much shampoing is bad for your hair, thus a conditioner is seen in so much of a better light by me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about this conditioner only because it works so well.  </li>
            <li> The mint in this MUCH stronger than the standard &amp;#34;cool mint&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Unless one wants a mint, zing Christmas nightmare all over their face for the next twenty minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not whiskey in an old west saloon.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, this conditioner also leaves my hair soft as well.</li>
            <li> But when I got it, there was conditioner everywhere, the product was not properly sealed nor packaged very well.</li>
            <li> If you have soft hair, then this might work for you...</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft with a hint of mint.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift by a coworker and definitely wont be using much longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s because of the stimulating action of Crew&#x27;s conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 years old, with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This fixed it.</li>
            <li> i also feel like my hair regains some of it&#x27;s natural shine and moisture</li>
            <li> The real test is how it works on the majority of people who have normal to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Firstly I have hair that can not stand to go without a conditioner, as it will feel dry and straw like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the crazy thing is this product is very popular with men.  </li>
            <li> This particular bottle really seems like they have watered down the formula of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The new product I purchased is of similar consistency as the Amazon product.</li>
            <li> That said, I really like the American Crew Daily Stimulating Conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and my scalp is not dry.</li>
            <li> I knocked off one star because of the shape of the bottle, I wish it was a pump dispenser, the awkward size of the bottle is a pain in the shower but the conditioner product is really good.</li>
            <li> As far as actual conditioner quality, I am no hair expert (single straight male)</li>
            <li> and I can say it&#x27;s certainly no worse than any other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not that it causes much of a difference in expected effect but it should be known prior to buying.</li>
            <li> Watered down - Pours out like milk - the real stuff has to practically be squeezed to come out of the bottle - save your money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty normal guy without any hair super-powers, so I generally find it difficult to tell the difference between the various high quality conditioners.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I had dry scalp using other conditioners/shampoos and is the main reason I decided to buy a more expensive product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the large size was not much more than the mass market brands</li>
            <li> But the way it was wrapped wouldn&#x27;t have allowed for the cap to loosen and when new these caps are on decently tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with dandruff and scalp itching for a long time.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few years and my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> 33.8 oz bottles of this will go a long way compared to getting shampoo/conditioner every couple months.</li>
            <li> I use it daily or every other day.</li>
            <li> I purchased from Hayward Beauty - other people seem to have had the same issue.</li>
            <li> but I have no other way to explain what I received other than Watered Down.</li>
            <li> Unless the manufacturer changed the formula recently it appears this product has been watered down.</li>
            <li> American Crew Stimulating Conditioner for Hair and Scalp has been my conditioner of choice since my hair-care person gave me a small bottle as a customer Christmas gift about ten years ago.</li>
            <li> This bottle typically lasts me about 5-6 months as I only use a nickel-sized blob each time I shower.</li>
            <li> Had it not been wrapped up it would have been a big mess.</li>
            <li> Instead of having a thick consistency like in the past, it pours rights out of the bottle and often runs right through my fingers.</li>
            <li> For a common comparison: it conditions several grades below the level of conditioning provided by a mass-market conditioner such as Pantene.  </li>
            <li> However, conditioner is thinner than expected.</li>
            <li> After that, I really never looked for or used another conditioner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no greasy feel and no noticeable residue and comes with a &amp;#34;scalp tingle&amp;#34; as an added plus.</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived with cap partially opened so conditioner had leaked.</li>
            <li> I start by picking up a small bottle our my local hair dresser</li>
            <li> However, due to the price, I may not buy another one.</li>
            <li> but so will any other conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crew products for the past 10-12 years on the advice of my female hair dresser.</li>
            <li> On days when my hair is especially dirty (cleaning the attic, working in the yard), I still use this product (along with the AC Shampoo which is also fantastic), but on a daily basis I allow the natural oils in my hair to do their work.</li>
            <li> Seems to me that the cap was not screwed on tight for both orders; the caps were loose both times.</li>
            <li> Came open and wasted a little but not a lot.</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves it dry and fluffy.</li>
            <li> back part of my head that was getting worse starting about age 35.  </li>
            <li> And in that regard, it performs below average levels.    </li>
            <li> This seems to watered down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if it was slightly watered down.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to do so because I thought it might make a mess in the box because of the shipping process.</li>
            <li> In fact, I didn&#x27;t even know what conditioner did before my aunt explained the details just a few years ago</li>
            <li> I used to use an anti-dandruff shampoo everyday, but I have found that I have drastically reduced the amount of times</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad batch, or if this is the new standard.</li>
            <li> I also feel like the fragrance is not nearly as strong or &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; as it has been in the past.</li>
            <li> and I mean none of it runs down your face.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> Excessively minty and tingly.</li>
            <li> Plus this is my product of choice for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> Therefore, in my hair at least, this product didn&#x27;t distribute well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will think twice about buying this product again, at least from the seller, Hayward Beauty (fulfilled by Amazon.com).</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for years and have never had a complaint.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years now and it has always been thick while this one is liquid with water bubbles.</li>
            <li> I have thick and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Having wavy thick hair, I often tend to forego using conditioner.</li>
            <li> It also helps with dry scalp in the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> While I very much like the pomade, the conditioner is really awful.  </li>
            <li> Not the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;, but a substitute.....watered down, smells awful, not like the American Crew our hair stylist sells.  </li>
            <li> mine arrived with broken cap and leaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> A creamy WHITE smelling terrible!!</li>
            <li> It is fake........</li>
            <li> I was totally appalled that this product was so expensive.  </li>
            <li> It smells awful and is tough to wash out of the hair.</li>
            <li> Also, the Crew Pomade from this vendor is bad as well.  </li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s how bad it is.      </li>
            <li> stars for bad shipping.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair and scalp feeling refreshed, and the menthol scent isn&#x27;t bad either unless that would bother you.</li>
            <li> I really hate writing this review</li>
            <li> Bought 6-bottles of this from this vendor about a year ago and must say it&#x27;s crap!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time now and don&#x27;t plan to switch anytime soon.  I love being able to order from Amazon and know that I will receive it in a timely and secure fashion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about this conditioner only because it works so well.  It gives your head that &amp;#34;tingly&amp;#34; feeling as you work it in.  I use hair gel each day for work and this conditioner makes my hair really smooth after I get out of the shower.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased shampoo or condition online before. I was hesitant to do so because I thought it might make a mess in the box because of the shipping process. This product came wrapped up so all I had to do was rinse off the bottle and it was ready to go. Had it not been wrapped up it would have been a big mess. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Tingles on your scalp, has that fresh peppermint smell. The mint in this MUCH stronger than the standard &amp;#34;cool mint&amp;#34; Crew Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of American Crew conditioner and pomade as a nice gesture last year by a co-worker.  While I very much like the pomade, the conditioner is really awful.  To start with, the conditioner smells minty, like a peppermint without the sweetness.  It actually smells medicinal.  I have to make sure that after I wash the conditioner out of my hair that I wash my hands no less than six times.  Why one might ask, because the menthol seeps into my fingers and I don&#x27;t want to touch my face with \\&quot;stinging\\&quot; fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leads me to the \\&quot;stinging\\&quot; conditioner itself.  I feel as if I just rubbed icy-hot or Vick&#x27;s all over my scalp when using this product. I am all for a refreshing zing, but I imagine at any moment my hair will be falling out of my head as I wash the conditioner out.  Oh and a technique I learned the hard way, make sure that when you wash this product out of your hair, taken extra sets to make sure none and I mean none of it runs down your face.  Unless one wants a mint, zing Christmas nightmare all over their face for the next twenty minutes.  I also had to use more than the average amount of conditioner to cover all my hair.  Therefore, in my hair at least, this product didn&#x27;t distribute well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curiosity got the best of me after I experienced this product, so I wanted to see the cost of it.  I was totally appalled that this product was so expensive.  I could have the pleasure of having minty, menthol, icy-hot, zing on my face, zing on my lingering fingers, scalp burn, Christmas smelling nightmare for only (about) twenty bucks a bottle!!!  And the crazy thing is this product is very popular with men.  I think eighteen of those dollars goes towards the label \\&quot;American Crew\\&quot;.  I believe I am just going to stick with standard conditioner that treats my hair much better than this over priced nonsense.</li>
            <li> Great product - great smelling, great feeling, and good quality. However, conditioner is thinner than expected. Not that it causes much of a difference in expected effect but it should be known prior to buying. It&#x27;s as if it was slightly watered down. Again, I am happy with the product overall and the price simply cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I have been using for years.  Finding it at Amazon.com has now saved me about $5.00 per bottle.</li>
            <li> I really hate writing this review but I have no other way to explain what I received other than Watered Down. I have been using this conditioner for years now and it has always been thick while this one is liquid with water bubbles. When received the product was spilling out like the cap had been loosened. But the way it was wrapped wouldn&#x27;t have allowed for the cap to loosen and when new these caps are on decently tight. Bums me out that someone would try to get away with this. It&#x27;s not whiskey in an old west saloon.</li>
            <li> Simply a great product that awakens the senses and my hair, per se. Will continue to purchase AC products for their long-standing reliability and efficacy!</li>
            <li> Never knew my hair could look and feel so good. I was always the guy that would just buy the 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner bottles, but after getting my hair cut and styled, I wanted something that would compliment my cut. This stuff is awesome. My hair feels so light and smooth after every wash and people notice for sure! I enjoy the menthol feel, it&#x27;s just relaxing and refreshing while you shower.</li>
            <li> great product! everything as described, just someone doesnt know how to ship this and mine arrived with broken cap and leaking. besides that, great!</li>
            <li> Husband loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> This seems to watered down. Comes running off the bottle just by tilting it. Its my first review in Amazon because I have always been satisfied with the product. I have thick and wavy hair. The conditioner leaves it dry and fluffy.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty normal guy without any hair super-powers, so I generally find it difficult to tell the difference between the various high quality conditioners. That said, I really like the American Crew Daily Stimulating Conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling soft and clean, it smells good, and, most importantly, it tingles. It&#x27;s kind of like a mini scalp massage every morning.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I will use. Gives a great tingling sensation when used.</li>
            <li> Same as I can buy in the stores.  Works Great!  The only one that I will ever use.</li>
            <li> American Crew Stimulating Conditioner for Hair and Scalp has been my conditioner of choice since my hair-care person gave me a small bottle as a customer Christmas gift about ten years ago. After that, I really never looked for or used another conditioner. I buy the large 33.8 OZ size and then \\&quot;download\\&quot; part of it to a smaller bottle to keep in my shower. I use it daily or every other day. My hair and body profit by the great quality of conditioning and freshness the conditioner imparts. I recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> It works well on my greasy scalp but the mint is overpowering. Make sure to keep it off your eyes. Im not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves a nice, cooling sensation on your scalp. I normally get to putting this in as soon as possible and leaving it in until I&#x27;m ready to get out of the shower. But, it can be pretty strong when you first use it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good conditioner. I have been reading that too much shampoing is bad for your hair, thus a conditioner is seen in so much of a better light by me. Have been using American Crew for years. Good product.</li>
            <li> I liked this conditioner when I was introduced to it at a salon, and I have grown to like it even more using it at home. This product leaves my hair soft and adds a bit of volume (my hair is fine). It also helps with dry scalp in the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. Smells good and leaves my hair soft. And that&#x27;s pretty much everything I want in a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Watered down - Pours out like milk - the real stuff has to practically be squeezed to come out of the bottle - save your money.  My first review here of anything because Amazon orders have been great over the years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase. I bought this exact conditioner before via Amazon and thought it was great. I also just finished up some American Crew Tea Tree Calming Conditioner, and was happy with that too. This particular bottle really seems like they have watered down the formula of the conditioner. Instead of having a thick consistency like in the past, it pours rights out of the bottle and often runs right through my fingers. I also feel like the fragrance is not nearly as strong or &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; as it has been in the past. I shook it up several times just in case to no avail. Not sure if I got a bad batch, or if this is the new standard. I will think twice about buying this product again, at least from the seller, Hayward Beauty (fulfilled by Amazon.com).</li>
            <li> Bought 6-bottles of this from this vendor about a year ago and must say it&#x27;s crap!  Not the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;, but a substitute.....watered down, smells awful, not like the American Crew our hair stylist sells.  Our hair shop sells the real thing.  Also, the Crew Pomade from this vendor is bad as well.  A creamy WHITE smelling terrible!!</li>
            <li> nice conditioner for everyday use.</li>
            <li> this product gives a great fresh and clean sensation every single time it is used, totally recommended specailly during the hot summer months in GA</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and manageable and, along with its companion shampoo, is fine for daily use. Absolutely no greasy feel and no noticeable residue and comes with a &amp;#34;scalp tingle&amp;#34; as an added plus. I wouldn&#x27;t consider another choice as Crew does it for me!</li>
            <li> Great product ... good price.</li>
            <li> Love american crew.  Best product for my balding head by far. I love pampering the 9 hairs I have left on my head with the best shampoo and conditioner around. It is also great for the scalp!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with dandruff and scalp itching for a long time. I&#x27;ve used T-Gel and Denorex and they did help with itching but the dandruff issues remained. This conditioner doesn&#x27;t advertise that it helps with itching, but when I use it I don&#x27;t have scalp itch issues. I think that it works better than T-Gel. And it is effective at greatly reducing dandruff. The first time I used it the cooling effect was so strong it burned a little and continued to burn after I rinsed it out. That feeling went away after the first use.</li>
            <li> Packaging was ok. Came open and wasted a little but not a lot.</li>
            <li> Love the product--large size more convenient.  Shipper needs to secure cap as product leaked during shipment.  Would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> i LOVE american crew products and this does not disappoint. Great price,and leaves a good cooling feeling. I knocked off one star because of the shape of the bottle, I wish it was a pump dispenser, the awkward size of the bottle is a pain in the shower but the conditioner product is really good. My girlfriend loves using it too.</li>
            <li> Makes you feel real stimulated kind of tingles when it applied, should leave on your hair for a few minutes to feel the effect and makes your hair manageable.</li>
            <li> I am pretty particular when it comes to my hair products, and I rarely wash or condition it (rinsing under water is usually enough as I like to have some of my hairs natural oils.  When I do wash my hair though I must absolutely must use American Crew to give it that soft touch I love.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff for the tingle.  It&#x27;s conditioner, and I can&#x27;t get too excited one way or the other about it.  Glad I can get a decent price with free Prime delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought this more for the size of the bottle.  However, I also enjoyed the pleasant mint/citrus smell it leaves behind.  My hair thanks me for it.</li>
            <li> Invigorating. Soothing.</li>
            <li> What else can I say. I like the product a lot.</li>
            <li> As a man, this is my favorite conditioner. The reason why is because the shampoo cleans the pores in my scalp, leaving me with a tingling clean feeling afterwards. If I&#x27;m going to go bald, I want to go bald for hereditary reasons, not because the pores in my scalp are clogged with dirt and whatever else. Oh yeah, this conditioner also leaves my hair soft as well.</li>
            <li> great smell, tingly on the scalp.  excellent conditioner.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner. It smells really minty and leaves my head tingling (but not burning). I tend to have frizzy hair (even when it&#x27;s short), but this conditioner allows me to look good without having to wear hair gel/fiber.</li>
            <li> Been using this Crew Conditioner for over three years now. I start by picking up a small bottle our my local hair dresser and then at our local grocery store. The size here at Amazon is perfect. It does have a strong minty smell and tingling sensation, but that is something I don&#x27;t mind. If that does bother you, you can pick up a different combination of the conditioner, which works equally well.Works well and keeps the hair looking great.</li>
            <li> I would have rated this 5-star because our entire family likes to use this one product.  It&#x27;s huge bottle is the perfect size for us and it feels invigorating.  However, I took it down to 4-starts because after ordering it twice online, in both cases the product leaked out and was a huge mess to clean up.  Seems to me that the cap was not screwed on tight for both orders; the caps were loose both times.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few years and my hair is soft and manageable. A great product at a good price. Convenient ordering and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Conditioner came out of the cap during shipment. The conditioner seems runny. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. My favorite exercise is swimming. American Crew deals with chlorine in my hair better than products made specifically for such. Although it is available locally, it is in 16.9 oz. bottles for about $20.00. The 33.8 oz .online  containers are $26.00 - a savings of $14.00 each. I buy several units at a time for convenience and free shipping while keeping a year&#x27;s worth in stock.</li>
            <li> My son was very happy when he received the conditioner; it is one of his favorite to keep healthy look.</li>
            <li> Unless the manufacturer changed the formula recently it appears this product has been watered down. The conditioner is not thick like it normally is but is watery and comes out of the bottle too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: well I just ordered the same product from Loxa Beauty was is supposed to be the only American Crew authorized internet seller. The new product I purchased is of similar consistency as the Amazon product. My take is the manufacturer changed the formula.</li>
            <li> Smells good and does what it is suppose to. But when I got it, there was conditioner everywhere, the product was not properly sealed nor packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Feels watery and washes out too easily compared to other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Love this product - grows you hair, feels great and works well. I have nothing more to say than that.</li>
            <li> Was incredibly watered down. I purchased from Hayward Beauty - other people seem to have had the same issue.</li>
            <li> I loved the fresh scent that this conditioner had. This is expensive, but my hair did feel more nourished and hydrated after a bottle. However, due to the price, I may not buy another one. The product is good, but a little expensive.</li>
            <li> The only one I have used for a decade.  My hair is soft and my scalp is not dry. Hooray.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, I feel fresh and energized after using it.</li>
            <li> We sell salon products, so I have knowledge about hair care products.  These are my top three thoughts about American Crew&#x27;s Stimulating Conditioner:    1) It does a below-average job of conditioning your hair.  The quality is comparable to the shampoos and conditioners provided in most of the large hotel chains.  For a common comparison: it conditions several grades below the level of conditioning provided by a mass-market conditioner such as Pantene.  Yes, that&#x27;s how bad it is.      If you have soft hair, then this might work for you... but so will any other conditioner.  The real test is how it works on the majority of people who have normal to dry hair.  And in that regard, it performs below average levels.    2) It&#x27;s over-priced.  No point buying this when you can buy a mass-market conditioner for way less and for better results.    3) Yes, it \\&quot;stimulates\\&quot; your scalp, leaving it with a tingling sensation.  That&#x27;s because it has menthol.  Adding menthol to anything will do that.  However, that you feel a menthol-induced tingling on your scalp doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s doing anything great for your hair!  It&#x27;s just a gimmick.    So, I give it 2 stars (1 star would be something that actually damaged your hair, which this doesn&#x27;t do), and I urge you NOT to buy it.</li>
            <li> Very good price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Good price for amount of product.  Helped me reach $35 for free shipping.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite conditioner, especially the minty eucalyptus smell. Softens up my hair so I use it every day.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li> Works great and love the quality</li>
            <li> I needed a new conditioner and i decided to try this one out because its supposed to be a &amp;#34;stimulating conditioner.&amp;#34;  That it is.  The sensation I feel on my head after a shower with this conditioner is similar to how your mouth feels after popping in some mints.  My head feels tingly and I feel so fresh and awake afterwards.  I realize that not everyone may like this but you should give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Having wavy thick hair, I often tend to forego using conditioner. In fact, I didn&#x27;t even know what conditioner did before my aunt explained the details just a few years ago (I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties). I used to think that the \\&quot;proper\\&quot; amount of conditioner needed for hair wasn&#x27;t enough for my full head, so conditioners weren&#x27;t used for their fullest potential.&lt;br /&gt;The American Crew shampoo has been seeing lots of action in my shower in the past year or so, and their conditioner seemed like a worthwhile purchase after my previous one ran out (which I thought was good enough). The minute this conditioner went on my hair screamed. But it was a good scream.&lt;br /&gt;It had that awakening effect (I&#x27;m not sure what to call it--spicy?), leaving my hair feeling good for the rest of the day. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the top of my head is drier than usual, so that&#x27;s a plus?</li>
            <li> Bought this conditioner and it showed up leaking everywhere. See picture with shampoo for reference. Other than that I love the stuff. Leaves your hair soft with a hint of mint. -3 stars for bad shipping.</li>
            <li> What a refreshing feeling first thing in the morning.The aroma is awesome and the product really does a nice job of reconditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> Love American Crew and boy did I get a bargain on this 33 Ounce Bottle.  It will last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li> It feels awesome when I wash my hair with this conditioner. It send my head on a vacation. Wow, I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner, it is worth the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; amount that you have to pay for a nice conditioner. This bottle typically lasts me about 5-6 months as I only use a nickel-sized blob each time I shower. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while. This is probably my tenth or eleventh bottle.  It&#x27;s the best for firm hold.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for years and have never had a complaint. use several of thier products</li>
            <li> The conditioner is the perfect complement for American Crew Daily Shampoo... your hair been shiny, softly, strong and fresh! And the presentation is huge... itÂ´s better if you use a pump.</li>
            <li> Nothing &#x27;stimulating&#x27; at all about this conditioner. It smells awful and is tough to wash out of the hair. Also, made my hair coarse and brittle after one use.  Got this as a gift by a coworker and definitely wont be using much longer.  Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> came on time and was in perfect condition, works great and would highly recommend. I have used the art of shaving conditioner in the past but for the money this is a far better deal</li>
            <li> Good product that I bought for the stimulating effect and less for the conditioning effect during dry winter months.  So far, its helped with dry scalp when combined with a good dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby; he loves it.  It is the only conditioner that he likes to use.</li>
            <li> I bought the American Crew body body wash, shampoo, conditioner.  The conditioner is pretty awesome.  Hair comes out nice, soft, and feels light and airy.  My wife likes it too and she&#x27;s really really particular.</li>
            <li> It is fake........I&#x27;ve used crew for years this stuff is runny</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a minty scent and gives your head a buzzed feeling. It feels good in your head and your hair comes out soft.</li>
            <li> Excessively minty and tingly. Too bad they got rid of the good old Citrus Mint, which was more balanced and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived with cap partially opened so conditioner had leaked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crew products for the past 10-12 years on the advice of my female hair dresser. I&#x27;ve got a bald spot on the top back part of my head that was getting worse starting about age 35.  I started using Crew&#x27;s conditioner at about age 40. Now I&#x27;m 50 and the spot has stayed about the same since I started. I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s because of the stimulating action of Crew&#x27;s conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried Rogaine to help bring the hair back, but no luck. This is a lot cheaper and it keeps me from growing more bald.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and it is nothing like the product I buy at the Salon I get my hair cut at.</li>
            <li> I cannot remember how I first ran across this item but have been using it ever since. It is the feeling of the Menthol on the scalp that seems to draw me to this product. Purchasing the 33.8 oz is much more cost effective than the in store pricing at least in this area. Leaves hair and scalp feeling refreshed, and the menthol scent isn&#x27;t bad either unless that would bother you.</li>
            <li> What can I say? my hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Great basic conditioner. Has a mint smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for about a year now, in conjunction with the Crew Stimulating Shampoo. I&#x27;m 47 years old, with thinning hair. Although there is no shampoo product that will regrow hair, I find that the Crew Stimulating line has significantly reduced the rate of my hair loss. I used to use an anti-dandruff shampoo everyday, but I have found that I have drastically reduced the amount of times I it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tingling sensational is also a pleasant way to help wake up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order and use this product. I like to get the big bottles, as they&#x27;re the best value.</li>
            <li> I needed a conditioner for my overly greasy hair - which I do think is a good thing, but it does not look good at all.&lt;br /&gt;This helps strengthen my hair and keep it non-greasy. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the most organic thing on the market though, cancer maybe in a couple of years of using it ?</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a huge improvement over major brands. I immediately felt a difference. However, shortly after I started using this product I switched to a water-only wash regimen (Google it). While more work, I find it even better. On days when my hair is especially dirty (cleaning the attic, working in the yard), I still use this product (along with the AC Shampoo which is also fantastic), but on a daily basis I allow the natural oils in my hair to do their work.</li>
            <li> This product cost more than twice as much in stores. Great price for an amazing product. Highly recommend this to anyone who uses Crew.</li>
            <li> This product smells pretty neutral/good manly smell. It&#x27;s got menthol in it so it feels nice and cool and tingly throughout application all the way until you are out of the shower for about five minutes. As far as actual conditioner quality, I am no hair expert (single straight male) and I can say it&#x27;s certainly no worse than any other ones I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve got oily hair so it actually leaves my hair hydrated feeling without necessitating my scalp to produce too much oils after I shower with the regular harsh shampoo&#x27;s like Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Looking at prices in stores, I thought surely there would be a cheaper buy- and sure enough this is it. Packaging was done nicely- wrapped in plastic and no way for the bottles to spill out. The conditioner itself seems a bit more liquid than what I was thinking for a conditioner; the minty smell was very soothing and strong and I could feel it working my scalp/hair. I had dry scalp using other conditioners/shampoos and is the main reason I decided to buy a more expensive product. This fixed it.</li>
            <li> Great, great quality, and the product arrived on time, before that deadline. The brand is very good, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent salon type Stimulating Conditioner and at a value price in the 1L size.  It actually tingles once applied and feels real good and smells great.  I also bought the Daily Moisturizing Shampoo online from Amazon.  I highly recommend both items for clean and manageable hair.</li>
            <li> good product. Will buy again</li>
            <li> The menthol  in the product causes the tingle or stimulation. The product works well as an effective hair conditioner. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> great product.great price at amazon. fast delivery.The refreshing feeling and eucalyptus scent start my day right. I highly recommend CREW products</li>
            <li> I bought this because the large size was not much more than the mass market brands and I always see this brand when I get my hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying it again, I will stick with the cheaper brands this does nothing special and I feel there is no reason to spend the extra money.  Also, I have to use a lot more of this product at a time than the products I am used to.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I ever used. Perfect for the price which is by far the cheapest I ever seen.</li>
            <li> I only see this in local stores stocked in the smaller sizes. 33.8 oz bottles of this will go a long way compared to getting shampoo/conditioner every couple months. Plus this is my product of choice for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> American crew conditioner is some of the best on the market, I love the smell and the way my hair looks after using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the shampoo. Firstly I have hair that can not stand to go without a conditioner, as it will feel dry and straw like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would you want to buy this? it smells awesomely fresh without smelling too feminine. You&#x27;ll feel clean after using it, even though its just a conditioner. Paired with their shampoo the two work well to keep your hair soft, but I suspect you can have a similar or better effect(with less of a great smell though) for cheaper.</li>
            <li> i love it, i feel refreshed and clean every time i use it! i also feel like my hair regains some of it&#x27;s natural shine and moisture and it seems to keep my hair nice and healthy</li>
            <li> Good deal, and good quality conditioner.</li>
            <li> THIS CONDITIONER IS TOP NOTCH AND WILL GET YOU SO MANY GIRLS IT SMELLS GREAT</li>
            <li> I must admit that the reason I bought it was because I liked Graham Webb&#x27;s Ice Conditioner, and could not find it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;A guy at work was talking about it and told me I should try it, that it was more affordable than Graham Webb, but similar.  Makes your scalp tingle from the menthol......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it because my hair feels clean after using it, like there is no product build up like you get with some hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccommend this to men and women. Women- don&#x27;t be daunted by the fact that this is a man&#x27;s hair product.  It is really nice......</li>
            <li> Great deal. Love this product. Lasts me about a year and is the best price I have seen anywhere. Get a nice tingle when you use it so u know its working!</li>
            <li> Very good product. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> Great product and the price and shipping were fantastic!</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve bought this product. I like it and it always arrives on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the American Crew products for years and love them. The conditioner not only moisturizes but it also lightly tingles when its on the scalp and has a fresh, minty scent. I have been using these products for years and will gladly continue to do so.</li>
