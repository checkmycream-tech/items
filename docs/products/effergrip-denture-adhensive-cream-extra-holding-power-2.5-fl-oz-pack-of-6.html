            <li>None of the zinc free products worked properly.</li>
            <li>The product zinc-free, holds well, and has no horrible after-taste like some other products.</li>
            <li>the tubes are either old or suffered shipping heat..</li>
            <li>i have had dentures since i was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>go back to the old size tip ( please, thankyou).</li>
            <li>I like Effergrip, been using it for many years but the last 6 pack I purchased every tube is to thin and watery.</li>

            <li> These may seem like small things, but for a denture wearer these advantages can make a daily chore quicker and less time consuming.</li>
            <li> I also found that I have to use less product.</li>

            <li> i can&#x27;t afford the gas for 100 mile round trip to buy it.  </li>
            <li> any other product I was forced to try, ( when I couldn&#x27;t find Effergrip in the stores).&lt;br /&gt;I received my order on the date</li>
            <li> A small amount of adhesive lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I looked in several stores for this product and was unable to find it on any shelve, the folks in the stores could not/ would not tell me why the product was no longer stocked.</li>
            <li> it has servered me well over the past 25 years.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores anymore</li>
            <li> you will see what I mean my friend.</li>
            <li> Hate using goop which seeps out on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> She has had a difficult time finding this product and is not computer savy.  </li>
            <li> Sadly this did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> Keeps denture in all day no oozing or bad taste</li>
            <li> I am disappointed stores don&#x27;t carry the product.  </li>

            <li> I like Effergrip, been using it for many years but the last 6 pack I purchased every tube is to thin and watery. I hope my next order is a better paste &amp;#34;or thicker cream&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t want to change my adhensive cream so will be hoping for better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom.  She has had a difficult time finding this product and is not computer savy.  She was very pleased with the purchase and delivery.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be back again when her supply is depleted.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> When Effergrip went on sale, I decided to try it even though I had been using Poligrip for years.  I was both surprised and pleased with Effergrip and I found that it has a couple of advantages over Poligrip:  (1) It is easier to get out of the tube; (2) It holds just as well as Poligrip; and, (3) It is much easier to remove from your mouth when you take your dentures out in the evening.  These may seem like small things, but for a denture wearer these advantages can make a daily chore quicker and less time consuming.</li>
            <li> Best out there ......no aftertastee...eewww.....yet. ot inn stores just freekin crazed:D Try this you will see what I mean my friend.</li>
            <li> Great product works well.  6 pack at 1 time provides good value and not needing to reorder as often.  A small amount of adhesive lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This was for my mom...she used to get it in a local drug store that no longer carries it.  None of the big drug stores ever have it so it&#x27;s great to find and get a few at a time!</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago, but can only find it now online. It&#x27;s better than Poligrip. I even had corn on the cob last night and they stayed in place. I recommend it for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to keep having to add denture adhesive a few times a day</li>
            <li> This is only protist I have used since I was 23 I am now 56 I tell everyone to try effect grip but I would never change thank you for keeping it on the market</li>
            <li> This adhensive Cream works really great.</li>
            <li> on time delivery of a quality product</li>
            <li> product has no expiration date on it.  the tubes are either old or suffered shipping heat..it has separated ..... still usable, but not as pliable.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product every 2 or 3 months and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the shipping and the product. I will definitely be ordering from here again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Sadly this did not work for me.  Problem dentures that no one can seem to make fit.  Hate using goop which seeps out on a daily basis.  I am stuck!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it is the only one of it&#x27;s kind that really works all day.</li>
            <li> The tip is to big.......  go back to the old size tip ( please, thankyou).</li>
            <li> I was having a lot of problems with polygrip and similar brands when I found effergrip. Using the \\&quot;old brands\\&quot; caused quite a mess on removal of lowers. None of the zinc free products worked properly. Effergrip zinc free works longer and stronger, is less messy all around. I also found that I have to use less product. Try this one and you wont be disapointed.</li>
            <li> have been using it for years, Great</li>
            <li> When our local big-box store stopped carrying this brand of denture adhesive cream, I went on a search for it  This is the third year I&#x27;ve purchased this from Amazon and from this supplier for my husband.  It is the only brand he uses (and has for many, many years) because it seems to be the only brand that holds without gaps. He won&#x27;t use anything else if given a choice.</li>
            <li> I looked in several stores for this product and was unable to find it on any shelve, the folks in the stores could not/ would not tell me why the product was no longer stocked. sooooo! I did an internet search for Effergrip and found what I consider a very good value for my money. Effergrip holds my dentures far better then any other product I was forced to try, ( when I couldn&#x27;t find Effergrip in the stores).&lt;br /&gt;I received my order on the date Amazon said it would be delivered and was packaged in a very secure box. I am quite happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The product zinc-free, holds well, and has no horrible after-taste like some other products. The vendor always processes and ships the order quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product when the pulled it off the shelves I didn&#x27;t think I would ever be able to get it again but I found that I can order it every month through Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product and the availability.</li>
            <li> Keeps denture in all day no oozing or bad taste</li>
            <li> i have had dentures since i was 15 years old.  i started out using Poli-grip which i used for close on to 25 years.  then one day i was short of change and i bought Effergrip.  i was hooled.  it has servered me well over the past 25 years.  It is hard to find in stores anymore so i have to order it off the Web.  I find the product more efficient than poli-grip or any others i have tried.  I am disappointed stores don&#x27;t carry the product.  Wal-Mart is where i use to buy it then about two years ago for some reason they quit.  now the closest store to me is Wegman&#x27;s and that is about 50 miles away.  i can&#x27;t afford the gas for 100 mile round trip to buy it.  now i buy 6 tubes at a time and it gets delivered right to my doorstep.</li>
