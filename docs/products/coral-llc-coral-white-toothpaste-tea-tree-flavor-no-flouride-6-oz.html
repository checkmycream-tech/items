            <li>The ingredients are super healthy, so it&#x27;s especially great for kids.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this one.</li>
            <li>Sensodyne was somewhat effective, but nothing compared to this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice taste that isn&#x27;t overpowering (I like the mint flavor</li>
            <li>I had a choice, I could make my own toothpaste, or I could buy coral white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to find a good toothpaste that has calcium in it, and no fluoride.  </li>
            <li>Good, but good teeth really begins with a good diet.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great toothpaste, good taste and great ingredients without glycerin</li>
            <li>It does a fine job cleaning my teeth, and I feel good knowing there are no ingredients that can harm me, plus no glycerin to inhibit calcium absorption.</li>
            <li>I love when a product is all natural and very effective and this toothpaste is both!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying this regularly as it is just the best toothpaste on the market for what it is.</li>
            <li>It probably more than pays for itself in saved dental work.  </li>
            <li>My son loves the mint, and I love the tea tree.  </li>
            <li>I try to eat a healthy diet of fruits, veggies, lean meats and nuts, so this might help, but I drink soda sometimes and eat processed sugar foods, too, on occasion.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>However, the latest tube I purchased contained glycerin.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Fluoride-free, and I love the tea tree.</li>
            <li>This product will help some people more than others.</li>
            <li>, 20 minutes after buying it; it feels okay on the mouth</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff, and it works great for me</li>
            <li>do floss every day, which you should also be doing if you care about keeping your mouth healthy.  </li>
            <li>Many people think glycerin coats your teeth: There is no scientific evidence that backs up the idea that glycerin sticks to enamel.</li>
            <li>Tea tree is not all that delightful but Coral White even made it palatable.</li>
            <li>and I do think I am taking the best care of myself possible with products like this.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the 2 years and wasn&#x27;t sure how it was working but noticed my tooth sensitivity went away when I used it morn and night.  </li>
            <li>I really am so glad that I discovered &amp;#34;Coral White&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree flavor is not my favorite, I like mint better, but Tea Tree is ok.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Not foamy at all but leaves a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>so this toothpaste is really very clean and does what we all need.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel very clean.  </li>
            <li>awesome toothpaste  no crap in it, gets rid of my tooth pain and doesnt leave the after taste of regular toothpaste</li>
            <li>I tried the tea tree flavor as I felt I needed more fighting power and found the taste not too overwhelming considering how powerful tea tree itself can be.  </li>
            <li>the tea tree is not as strong as I feared it would be.</li>
            <li>Tastes good, works pretty well and has no bad (i.e.; toxic) chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find a great natural toothpaste without glycerin to help heal my teeth</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and they feel so smooth, almost like they were polished.  </li>
            <li>Rub your tongue around your teeth, feel the none smooth parts?</li>
            <li>My teeth feel fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The glycerin Free toothpaste will be in circulation by December 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This cleans my teeth and makes them feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>And my teeth stay strong and clean with this.  </li>
            <li>Great taste, low foam, no fluoride.</li>
            <li>WHyy!&lt;br /&gt;THey went so far and did so good and had to ruin it by adding those two ingredients known to be carcinogenic and have severe side effects.</li>
            <li>Has really helped with my tooth sensitivity,  a lot!!!  </li>
            <li>if you get the tea tree flavor be warned it is super strong.</li>
            <li>I am truly thrilled with it and recommend it highly to anyone.</li>
            <li>LEAVES MY MOUTH FRESH AND CLEAN, AND I FEEL SAFER WITHOUT FLOURIDE!</li>
            <li>I will note that glycerin is found in most toothpastes nowadays so this toothpaste is really spectacular in helping us all to stay cavity free and to help our teeth to heal finally.  </li>
            <li>Did some non-believer take over the company and throw out the one thing that made it unique?</li>
            <li>a better product might be jason fluoride free toothpaste, for ppl like me whos mouths dont really like peroxide.</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth and teeth feel clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many natural brands of toothpaste because I don&#x27;t want to ingest more fluoride every day, and I&#x27;ve found this to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clean-  </li>
            <li>the interest of full disclosure, I&#x27;ve also started taking Dr. Williams&#x27; Oral Probiotics, and I also use TheraNeem Tooth and Gum Powder (contains neem, probiotics, vitamin D and calcium, xylitol, etc.).  </li>
            <li>Is it true this contains Glycerin now?</li>
            <li>The problem is that I already get plenty of calcium so the affect of this isn&#x27;t as great for me as other people I think.  </li>
            <li>Is it extraordinary?</li>
            <li>I found if you use this stuff like the toothpaste that your used to, your teeth will start whitening on their own, and your teeth themselves will actually feel clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will use the Coral White as it is an even better alternative to Flouride Free Tom&#x27;s, IMO, until I run out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>but  I feel need more cleaning action  </li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually right reviews</li>
            <li>it really makes the mouth feel CLEAN</li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant and all natural ingredients is a big plus.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>you are looking at this toothpaste, you are probably already aware of the harmful effects of ingredients found in almost every toothpaste out there.  </li>
            <li>My teeth FEEL stronger, just more solidly rooted into my gums.  </li>
            <li>I landed on this toothpaste because the ingredients are generally healthy (xylitol, calcium, hydrogen peroxide, various herbs, no fluoride, no glycerine), and because I needed to re-mineralize my teeth.  </li>
            <li>then again, I only use top level toothpaste, and this product is in that class.</li>
            <li>you will never be able to get it back on ...</li>
            <li>I have this toothpaste and have pretty much used almost all of my first tube.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years, it has everything I want, and perhaps more importantly, it has none of the things I don&#x27;t want.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had one tooth that was starting to feel funny, but it&#x27;s fine now.  </li>
            <li>I know the price might seem high, but you don&#x27;t need to use much, and the results are SO worth it.  </li>
            <li>and so does my osteopath who is very particular about the products she recommends.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil is a nice addition (I&#x27;ve previously used the mint) because of its anti-bacterial benefits.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m re-growing enamel, but I certainly notice the lack of aches and pains, and my teeth are whiter and smoother than they&#x27;ve been in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is the absolute best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I just really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth ended up not in much contact with the toothpaste to fully get the benefit from it.</li>
            <li>chose this toothpaste because I don&#x27;t like the idea putting industrial cleaning products directly into my body daily (your mouth absorbs, and it turned out to have many tangible benefits.  </li>
            <li>Tastes great and leaves teeth very clean without the bad stuff.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums have never felt better and I&#x27;m not concerned about dyes and other chemicals that go in to my mouth with most other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>mainly because I think I drink too much distilled water, and lack some salts found in sea salt (which has helped me some).  </li>
            <li>will most likely buy a few tubes to vault away before coral calcium products are no longer available or trustworthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I will probably be looking for a new brand!</li>
            <li>There was high praise whenever I went to the dentist.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I feel that this toothpaste actually gives me a better clean than the other stuff most commonly advertised on TV.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a crown that was sore whenever I would chew with that side of my mouth, now completely normal.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several, several natural toothpastes and do have some I like a lot better than others.  </li>
            <li>i have no complaint i was having tooth pain after giving birth to my son and</li>
            <li>I want to try the mint toothpaste next; I&#x27;m using the tea tree version right now.</li>
            <li>Looks like it&#x27;s time to find a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but I just got back from my first dental appointment since...  </li>
            <li>In case you aren&#x27;t, be aware that almost every toothpaste contains SLS (a harsh detergent/surfactant/abrasive), fluoride (interferes with your mouth&#x27;s natural remineralization process by borking the PH, we get enough through tap water anyway), and glycerin (creates that smooth coating on your teeth, again interfering with your body&#x27;s natural processes to strengthen your teeth with calcium in saliva).  </li>
            <li>feel so clean and that last a long time and sparkling as well.</li>
            <li>In short, at least for me, I&#x27;m not getting the amazing results...</li>
            <li>My teeth seem to be healing and any discolorations from herbal teas that I drink are taken away so that my teeth are much easier to keep white.  </li>
            <li>I bought a tube of this toothpaste at Lassen&#x27;s Natural Foods about two weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Also, this works on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I used to really like this toothpaste and the lack of glycerin was making a big difference in the &amp;#34;watch&amp;#34; areas of my gums.</li>
            <li>So I was looking for a toothpaste that was ALL natural.</li>
            <li>A natural, pH balancing toothpaste with no FLouride, Synthetic colors;flavors or preservatives, no SLS and no Glycerin!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Even with a really old toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have a environmental health clinic and this is what we recommend for chemically intolerant or sensitive patients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it over a month, and I&#x27;ve realized that my teeth aren&#x27;t sensitive anymore.  </li>
            <li>I completely understand your concerns about glycerin.</li>
            <li>You know how you get that squeaky clean teeth feeling when you buy a brand new tooth brush, but it only last for as long as the toothbrush is newish?</li>
            <li>A tube of it lasts me around 6 months, so its negligibly more expensive in the long run than the cheap toothpaste at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>It iss a large tube size and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Now brush your teeth with this stuff, and you will find that those non smooth parts are gone if not mostly.</li>
            <li>And diet plays a major role in teeth.  </li>
            <li>Coral LLC apparently changed the formula.</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;ve flossed daily for years and really noticed the positive effects I mentioned above once I had been using this toothpaste for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I asked her what happened to the other cavities we discussed last time she told me they didn&#x27;t see them on the new xrays!  </li>
            <li>There are really too many variables to list that can contribute to bad teeth and bones.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> the interest of full disclosure, I&#x27;ve also started taking Dr. Williams&#x27; Oral Probiotics, and I also use TheraNeem Tooth and Gum Powder (contains neem, probiotics, vitamin D and calcium, xylitol, etc.).  </li>
            <li> Is it true this contains Glycerin now?</li>
            <li> The problem is that I already get plenty of calcium so the affect of this isn&#x27;t as great for me as other people I think.  </li>
            <li> Is it extraordinary?</li>
            <li> I found if you use this stuff like the toothpaste that your used to, your teeth will start whitening on their own, and your teeth themselves will actually feel clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will use the Coral White as it is an even better alternative to Flouride Free Tom&#x27;s, IMO, until I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> but  I feel need more cleaning action  </li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually right reviews</li>
            <li> it really makes the mouth feel CLEAN</li>
            <li> The taste is pleasant and all natural ingredients is a big plus.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> you are looking at this toothpaste, you are probably already aware of the harmful effects of ingredients found in almost every toothpaste out there.  </li>
            <li> My teeth FEEL stronger, just more solidly rooted into my gums.  </li>
            <li> I landed on this toothpaste because the ingredients are generally healthy (xylitol, calcium, hydrogen peroxide, various herbs, no fluoride, no glycerine), and because I needed to re-mineralize my teeth.  </li>
            <li> then again, I only use top level toothpaste, and this product is in that class.</li>
            <li> you will never be able to get it back on ...</li>
            <li> I have this toothpaste and have pretty much used almost all of my first tube.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years, it has everything I want, and perhaps more importantly, it has none of the things I don&#x27;t want.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had one tooth that was starting to feel funny, but it&#x27;s fine now.  </li>
            <li> I know the price might seem high, but you don&#x27;t need to use much, and the results are SO worth it.  </li>
            <li> and so does my osteopath who is very particular about the products she recommends.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil is a nice addition (I&#x27;ve previously used the mint) because of its anti-bacterial benefits.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m re-growing enamel, but I certainly notice the lack of aches and pains, and my teeth are whiter and smoother than they&#x27;ve been in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the absolute best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I just really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth ended up not in much contact with the toothpaste to fully get the benefit from it.</li>
            <li> chose this toothpaste because I don&#x27;t like the idea putting industrial cleaning products directly into my body daily (your mouth absorbs, and it turned out to have many tangible benefits.  </li>
            <li> Tastes great and leaves teeth very clean without the bad stuff.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums have never felt better and I&#x27;m not concerned about dyes and other chemicals that go in to my mouth with most other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> mainly because I think I drink too much distilled water, and lack some salts found in sea salt (which has helped me some).  </li>
            <li> will most likely buy a few tubes to vault away before coral calcium products are no longer available or trustworthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I will probably be looking for a new brand!</li>
            <li> There was high praise whenever I went to the dentist.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I feel that this toothpaste actually gives me a better clean than the other stuff most commonly advertised on TV.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a crown that was sore whenever I would chew with that side of my mouth, now completely normal.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several, several natural toothpastes and do have some I like a lot better than others.  </li>
            <li> i have no complaint i was having tooth pain after giving birth to my son and</li>
            <li> I want to try the mint toothpaste next; I&#x27;m using the tea tree version right now.</li>
            <li> Looks like it&#x27;s time to find a new toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but I just got back from my first dental appointment since...  </li>
            <li> In case you aren&#x27;t, be aware that almost every toothpaste contains SLS (a harsh detergent/surfactant/abrasive), fluoride (interferes with your mouth&#x27;s natural remineralization process by borking the PH, we get enough through tap water anyway), and glycerin (creates that smooth coating on your teeth, again interfering with your body&#x27;s natural processes to strengthen your teeth with calcium in saliva).  </li>
            <li> feel so clean and that last a long time and sparkling as well.</li>
            <li> In short, at least for me, I&#x27;m not getting the amazing results...</li>
            <li> My teeth seem to be healing and any discolorations from herbal teas that I drink are taken away so that my teeth are much easier to keep white.  </li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this toothpaste at Lassen&#x27;s Natural Foods about two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Also, this works on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I used to really like this toothpaste and the lack of glycerin was making a big difference in the &amp;#34;watch&amp;#34; areas of my gums.</li>
            <li> So I was looking for a toothpaste that was ALL natural.</li>
            <li> A natural, pH balancing toothpaste with no FLouride, Synthetic colors;flavors or preservatives, no SLS and no Glycerin!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Even with a really old toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have a environmental health clinic and this is what we recommend for chemically intolerant or sensitive patients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it over a month, and I&#x27;ve realized that my teeth aren&#x27;t sensitive anymore.  </li>
            <li> I completely understand your concerns about glycerin.</li>
            <li> You know how you get that squeaky clean teeth feeling when you buy a brand new tooth brush, but it only last for as long as the toothbrush is newish?</li>
            <li> A tube of it lasts me around 6 months, so its negligibly more expensive in the long run than the cheap toothpaste at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> It iss a large tube size and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Now brush your teeth with this stuff, and you will find that those non smooth parts are gone if not mostly.</li>
            <li> And diet plays a major role in teeth.  </li>
            <li> Coral LLC apparently changed the formula.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve flossed daily for years and really noticed the positive effects I mentioned above once I had been using this toothpaste for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I asked her what happened to the other cavities we discussed last time she told me they didn&#x27;t see them on the new xrays!  </li>
            <li> There are really too many variables to list that can contribute to bad teeth and bones.  </li>
            <li> The texture is a little different than normal toothpaste, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Glycerin is added only to the botanical blend, which ships from one manufacturer to another, in order to preserve the blend long enough to be added to the toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> may update this post in six months as toothpaste last a long time.</li>
            <li> Regardless, it&#x27;s hard to fault the results, and Coral White is certainly part of my dental regimen</li>
            <li> Glycerin in Coral toothpaste is used as minimal as possible (0.02% of Coral Toothpaste is glycerin).</li>
            <li> Did they find new cavities, did the old decay get worse?  </li>
            <li> No more sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need all of that other stuff that the commercial SAY you need in your toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It is healthy and what I understand glycerin (which it doesn&#x27;t have) is bad news (for gums especially)</li>
            <li> I had previously used Sensodyne ProNamel and other such concoctions, but after some bad dentist visits I undertook to learn more about fluoride, oral probiotics, etc.  </li>
            <li> I started using it after ready some scary stuff about regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the plain Coral White for years.</li>
            <li> other brand satisfies my desires for a toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I was sick of getting drilled &amp; filled</li>
            <li> A little bit.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my teeth are a little whiter and cleaner looking for longer after cleanings also</li>
            <li> It is impossible to assess the effect of glycerin on teeth since it is mixed with multiple ingredients, as each ingredient reacts between one another, and glycerin reacts with others by binding each other with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With Fukishima making the enviornment worse daily, I decided to focus on my bone density before all coral sources of calcium are polluted.  </li>
            <li> Of course drug store toothpaste is far less expensive!</li>
            <li> They used to be sensitive to ice and cold drinks, for which I used Sensodyne for a couple years.  </li>
            <li> With all the info on the web today it’s so hard to know what to believe.</li>
            <li> Sorbitol, for me at least, makes me gaseous and Xylitol is sugar alchohol(refined sugars)</li>
            <li> My teeth are rock solid, I can chew ice and drink ice cold drinks without ANY sensitivity at all.  </li>
            <li> No enviornmental or manmade pollutants such as flouride and artificial colors and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not to mention the artificial colors, flavors, and other chemicals you are scrubbing into your delicate mucous membranes</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s actually very hard to expose them to your teeth to the largest extend.</li>
            <li> Only toothpaste I&#x27;ve found with no chemical crap.  </li>
            <li> I was fearing the worst, my dad told me they&#x27;d only get worse if I didn&#x27;t go in and get them taken care of.  </li>
            <li> The guy who called me acted like I was stupid because I believe glycerin is not good for your teeth.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> and they always throw in some crap that I don&#x27;t want.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I have ever tried.  I tried the tea tree flavor as I felt I needed more fighting power and found the taste not too overwhelming considering how powerful tea tree itself can be.  My teeth seem to be healing and any discolorations from herbal teas that I drink are taken away so that my teeth are much easier to keep white.  I love this stuff.  It is healthy and what I understand glycerin (which it doesn&#x27;t have) is bad news (for gums especially) so this toothpaste is really very clean and does what we all need. I will note that glycerin is found in most toothpastes nowadays so this toothpaste is really spectacular in helping us all to stay cavity free and to help our teeth to heal finally.  I am truly thrilled with it and recommend it highly to anyone. Brushing is a pleasure with this toothpaste.  It also comes in mint flavor. Amazon sells both flavors.  I will be buying this regularly as it is just the best toothpaste on the market for what it is.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this toothpaste. I selected this because of the chemicals it does not contain. It works well and tastes good. Of course drug store toothpaste is far less expensive!</li>
            <li> the best product of all toothpastes. the tea tree is not as strong as I feared it would be. A keeper. Will order again</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product, saying that it actually healed her teeth.  My son and I have been using it for about 3 weeks, and already notice a difference. Our teeth are whiter, breath fresher, gums healthier.  I had one tooth that was starting to feel funny, but it&#x27;s fine now.  I know the price might seem high, but you don&#x27;t need to use much, and the results are SO worth it.  It probably more than pays for itself in saved dental work.  The ingredients are super healthy, so it&#x27;s especially great for kids.  My son loves the mint, and I love the tea tree.  Give it a try and you&#x27;ll be hooked, too.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this toothpaste at Lassen&#x27;s Natural Foods about two weeks ago. I have to say that I absolutely LOVE it!! My teeth are whiter...and they actually squeak when I brush them sometimes, too. I try to eat a healthy diet of fruits, veggies, lean meats and nuts, so this might help, but I drink soda sometimes and eat processed sugar foods, too, on occasion. I told my fiance that I sometimes have the urge to eat the toothpaste *LOL* ;) I want to try the mint toothpaste next; I&#x27;m using the tea tree version right now.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Has really helped with my tooth sensitivity,  a lot!!!  I have recession of the gums from over brushing.  Go figure.  I also noticed my teeth are very white (without abrasives) and they feel so smooth, almost like they were polished.  I can&#x27;t find this type of toothpaste in local stores so I must buy it here.</li>
            <li> I do like this product. But found out today that it does have Glycerin in it a product that I like to stay away from. Their corporate office said it was used to make it flow from the tube. The guy who called me acted like I was stupid because I believe glycerin is not good for your teeth. He told me that was a myth. So I will probably be looking for a new brand!</li>
            <li> I love when a product is all natural and very effective and this toothpaste is both! My teeth and gums have never felt better and I&#x27;m not concerned about dyes and other chemicals that go in to my mouth with most other toothpastes. Also, this works on my sensitive teeth. No more sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> I used to really like this toothpaste and the lack of glycerin was making a big difference in the &amp;#34;watch&amp;#34; areas of my gums. There was high praise whenever I went to the dentist. However, the latest tube I purchased contained glycerin. Coral LLC apparently changed the formula. Looks like it&#x27;s time to find a new toothpaste. Too bad. I really liked this one.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years now and since starting, have stopped getting cavities.  Fluoride-free, and I love the tea tree.</li>
            <li> Good, but good teeth really begins with a good diet.  I have this toothpaste and have pretty much used almost all of my first tube.  Does it help?  A little bit.  The problem is that I already get plenty of calcium so the affect of this isn&#x27;t as great for me as other people I think.  And diet plays a major role in teeth.  Avoiding sugar, getting magnesium, calcium, vitamin D, sea salt, exercise, alkaline blood, avoiding flouride, putting minerals in distilled water.. etc...  There are really too many variables to list that can contribute to bad teeth and bones.  In short, at least for me, I&#x27;m not getting the amazing results... mainly because I think I drink too much distilled water, and lack some salts found in sea salt (which has helped me some).  Each person&#x27;s situation is different I think.  This product will help some people more than others.</li>
            <li> Not foamy at all but leaves a nice clean feeling. I have reordered and will make this my regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> So I was looking for a toothpaste that was ALL natural. I was trying to do away with synthetic sugars and chemicals. From what I could read on the reviews and in the description, Coral White seemed to be just that; A natural, pH balancing toothpaste with no FLouride, Synthetic colors;flavors or preservatives, no SLS and no Glycerin!&lt;br /&gt;Well, it DOES contain XYLITOL and SORBITOL! WHyy!&lt;br /&gt;THey went so far and did so good and had to ruin it by adding those two ingredients known to be carcinogenic and have severe side effects. Sorbitol, for me at least, makes me gaseous and Xylitol is sugar alchohol(refined sugars) that is poisonous to humans!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, 20 minutes after buying it; it feels okay on the mouth but I have to keep looking because of the ingredients that aren&#x27;t for-mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use the Coral White as it is an even better alternative to Flouride Free Tom&#x27;s, IMO, until I run out. Then I&#x27;m going to OralWellness.</li>
            <li> LEAVES MY MOUTH FRESH AND CLEAN, AND I FEEL SAFER WITHOUT FLOURIDE!</li>
            <li> best toothpaste.  i love it</li>
            <li> Does not contain glycerin.  Makes my teeth feel very clean.  The only toothpaste I have used for years.  Update:   They ruined it!   It now has glycerin.   Too bad.  I just bought three tubes, but I won&#x27;t buy anymore.</li>
            <li> This is such a great toothpaste, good taste and great ingredients without glycerin and I highly recommend and so does my osteopath who is very particular about the products she recommends.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this toothpaste for everyone. You don&#x27;t need all of that other stuff that the commercial SAY you need in your toothpaste. I started buying this toothpaste and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;  You know how you get that squeaky clean teeth feeling when you buy a brand new tooth brush, but it only last for as long as the toothbrush is newish? Well this toothpaste, gives you that feeling all of the time. I feel that this toothpaste actually gives me a better clean than the other stuff most commonly advertised on TV.&lt;br /&gt;  I found if you use this stuff like the toothpaste that your used to, your teeth will start whitening on their own, and your teeth themselves will actually feel clean. Rub your tongue around your teeth, feel the none smooth parts? Now brush your teeth with this stuff, and you will find that those non smooth parts are gone if not mostly. Even with a really old toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;  I really like this stuff, and it works great for me, we even got some for my mother in law, and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the absolute best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking at this toothpaste, you are probably already aware of the harmful effects of ingredients found in almost every toothpaste out there.  In case you aren&#x27;t, be aware that almost every toothpaste contains SLS (a harsh detergent/surfactant/abrasive), fluoride (interferes with your mouth&#x27;s natural remineralization process by borking the PH, we get enough through tap water anyway), and glycerin (creates that smooth coating on your teeth, again interfering with your body&#x27;s natural processes to strengthen your teeth with calcium in saliva).  Not to mention the artificial colors, flavors, and other chemicals you are scrubbing into your delicate mucous membranes every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about a year.  A tube of it lasts me around 6 months, so its negligibly more expensive in the long run than the cheap toothpaste at the grocery store.  My teeth feel fantastic.  They used to be sensitive to ice and cold drinks, for which I used Sensodyne for a couple years.  Sensodyne was somewhat effective, but nothing compared to this.  My teeth are rock solid, I can chew ice and drink ice cold drinks without ANY sensitivity at all.  I had a crown that was sore whenever I would chew with that side of my mouth, now completely normal.  Literally no soreness at all.  My teeth FEEL stronger, just more solidly rooted into my gums.  All in all, my mouth feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do floss every day, which you should also be doing if you care about keeping your mouth healthy.  However I&#x27;ve flossed daily for years and really noticed the positive effects I mentioned above once I had been using this toothpaste for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this toothpaste because I don&#x27;t like the idea putting industrial cleaning products directly into my body daily (your mouth absorbs, and it turned out to have many tangible benefits.  I will never go back, and I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> meh. i bought this because of the good reviews and i wanted a product without fluoride, but my teeth were getting duller when i used it. i also dont think my teeth like peroxide, bc when i use peroxide to rinse my mouth it has that same effect. i know the whitening agent in this is peroxide, so thats why im mentioning this. a better product might be jason fluoride free toothpaste, for ppl like me whos mouths dont really like peroxide. it really makes the mouth feel CLEAN</li>
            <li> Tastes good, works pretty well and has no bad (i.e.; toxic) chemicals in it. We have a environmental health clinic and this is what we recommend for chemically intolerant or sensitive patients.</li>
            <li> I have tried several, several natural toothpastes and do have some I like a lot better than others.  This is just another one I am very satisfied with so will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> I have to say it appears that this stuff works.  I started using it because I had some sensitivity in my teeth.  I had previously used Sensodyne ProNamel and other such concoctions, but after some bad dentist visits I undertook to learn more about fluoride, oral probiotics, etc.  I landed on this toothpaste because the ingredients are generally healthy (xylitol, calcium, hydrogen peroxide, various herbs, no fluoride, no glycerine), and because I needed to re-mineralize my teeth.  I&#x27;ve been using it over a month, and I&#x27;ve realized that my teeth aren&#x27;t sensitive anymore.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m re-growing enamel, but I certainly notice the lack of aches and pains, and my teeth are whiter and smoother than they&#x27;ve been in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interest of full disclosure, I&#x27;ve also started taking Dr. Williams&#x27; Oral Probiotics, and I also use TheraNeem Tooth and Gum Powder (contains neem, probiotics, vitamin D and calcium, xylitol, etc.).  As a group, I believe they&#x27;re helping as well.  Regardless, it&#x27;s hard to fault the results, and Coral White is certainly part of my dental regimen right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $9.00/tube, this is a bit more expensive than traditional toothpaste, but do the research.  I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste! It does a fine job cleaning my teeth, and I feel good knowing there are no ingredients that can harm me, plus no glycerin to inhibit calcium absorption. The tea tree oil is a nice addition (I&#x27;ve previously used the mint) because of its anti-bacterial benefits.</li>
            <li> I like the toothpaste and I use it with Theraneem powder it works my teeth feel so clean and that last a long time and sparkling as well.</li>
            <li> I like this brand of toothpaste and it defiantly helps to sooth the aches in the mouth. I was quite sadden that the manufacture started adding glycerin to their toothpaste. In response I wrote them an email with my concerns. I decided it would share the email with you guys:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good morning Zachary,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your email. I completely understand your concerns about glycerin. With all the info on the web today it’s so hard to know what to believe. But let me ease your mind a bit.  The information provided below is based on what I know, what our manufacturer provided, and what I have researched:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•  Glycerin in Coral toothpaste is used as minimal as possible (0.02% of Coral Toothpaste is glycerin). Glycerin is added only to the botanical blend, which ships from one manufacturer to another, in order to preserve the blend long enough to be added to the toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•  It is an unsweetened vegetable glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•  Many people think glycerin coats your teeth: There is no scientific evidence that backs up the idea that glycerin sticks to enamel. It is impossible to assess the effect of glycerin on teeth since it is mixed with multiple ingredients, as each ingredient reacts between one another, and glycerin reacts with others by binding each other with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•  Glycerin is a humectant/hygroscopic: attracts moisture to the skin and gives toothpaste its texture, prevents it from drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•  Coral LLC toothpaste contains coral minerals and xylitol that, studies have shown, helps re-mineralize enamel, with no fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, Coral LLC will be removing glycerin from the toothpaste formula all together in order to satisfy our customers concerns. The glycerin Free toothpaste will be in circulation by December 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps. Please let me know if you need anything or have any further questions. Have a great Weekend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s to your Health,</li>
            <li> Tea tree is not all that delightful but Coral White even made it palatable. I&#x27;ve used the plain Coral White for years. Makes my mouth and teeth feel clean and I do think I am taking the best care of myself possible with products like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural brands of toothpaste because I don&#x27;t want to ingest more fluoride every day, and I&#x27;ve found this to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice taste that isn&#x27;t overpowering (I like the mint flavor the best).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It froths nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about 6 months now and I&#x27;m a fan. Try it out--I think you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. Tastes great and leaves teeth very clean without the bad stuff.</li>
            <li> this is the only toothpaste i will use for the rest of my life... it&#x27;s the safest thing out there.</li>
            <li> awesome toothpaste  no crap in it, gets rid of my tooth pain and doesnt leave the after taste of regular toothpaste</li>
            <li> This cleans my teeth and makes them feel smooth.  The taste is pleasant and all natural ingredients is a big plus. It iss a large tube size and lasts a long time. Teeth seem to be whiter since using this product.</li>
            <li> did not like the taste as well as the Coral White Mint</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. if you get the tea tree flavor be warned it is super strong. After a while I don&#x27;t taste it at all. I started using it after ready some scary stuff about regular toothpaste. I looked online and the ETSY sellers are charging a ton for the same ingredients this stuff has. I have noticed my teeth are a little whiter and cleaner looking for longer after cleanings also</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually right reviews but I&#x27;m so amazed with this product!  Two years ago I went to the dentist and they told me I had a bunch of cavities.  I was sick of getting drilled &amp; filled so I took a risk for 2 years and boycotted the dentist and never got the fillings.  I also researched products that could restore teeth and found coral white.  I have been using it for the 2 years and wasn&#x27;t sure how it was working but noticed my tooth sensitivity went away when I used it morn and night.  When I experimented briefly with another toothpaste my sensitivity came back, so I went back to coral white &amp; it disappeared again.  Well, it was stressful waiting it out but I just got back from my first dental appointment since...  I was fearing the worst, my dad told me they&#x27;d only get worse if I didn&#x27;t go in and get them taken care of.  Nervously sat there while they discussed my xrays, mumbling....  Did they find new cavities, did the old decay get worse?  She then told me I only had a couple to fill.  When I asked her what happened to the other cavities we discussed last time she told me they didn&#x27;t see them on the new xrays!  Victory!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years, it has everything I want, and perhaps more importantly, it has none of the things I don&#x27;t want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other brand satisfies my desires for a toothpaste. I&#x27;ve looked online and in stores and they always throw in some crap that I don&#x27;t want. I had a choice, I could make my own toothpaste, or I could buy coral white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying it online since the local store is always sold out.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste is so good i have no complaint i was having tooth pain after giving birth to my son and when i started using the toothpaste i feel such a difference</li>
            <li> I like it - but  I feel need more cleaning action  after this paste- it does not feel  perfect clean-  will not buy again</li>
            <li> My go-to toothpaste.  Only toothpaste I&#x27;ve found with no chemical crap.  And my teeth stay strong and clean with this.  Only problem is the cap!  Last 2 tubes I&#x27;ve bought - cap will not snap back on after use.  May have to cut it off and store tube in ziploc bag.  But the toothpaste is so good, that I&#x27;ll do it if need be.  I&#x27;ve left an email to co., but no reply.</li>
            <li> I really am so glad that I discovered &amp;#34;Coral White&amp;#34; toothpaste. The Tea Tree flavor is not my favorite, I like mint better, but Tea Tree is ok.  I&#x27;m glad to find a good toothpaste that has calcium in it, and no fluoride.  The texture is a little different than normal toothpaste, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I just really like this toothpaste.  Is it extraordinary? No&lt;br /&gt;But then again, I only use top level toothpaste, and this product is in that class. No enviornmental or manmade pollutants such as flouride and artificial colors and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Ilike is the fact that I am getting calcium where it is needed.  With Fukishima making the enviornment worse daily, I decided to focus on my bone density before all coral sources of calcium are polluted.  Okinawa had the best and this is sourced from the Caribean ,which is safe for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made this purchase after using the calcium capsules which really impressed me with thier bioavailability. I felt my bones changing after one week of use, so I figured the toothpaste must be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely buy a few tubes to vault away before coral calcium products are no longer available or trustworthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may update this post in six months as toothpaste last a long time.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothpaste for toddlers children and adults...Makes plaque disappear and strengthens teeth and gums</li>
            <li> Is it true this contains Glycerin now? I was so excited to find a great natural toothpaste without glycerin to help heal my teeth and this seemed like the answer to my prayers. It&#x27;s formulated to remineralize- what happened? Did some non-believer take over the company and throw out the one thing that made it unique? Or rather... put it back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the glycerin OUT and I&#x27;d probably buy this the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste. Great taste, low foam, no fluoride.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste wont generate foams as regular toothpaste so it&#x27;s actually very hard to expose them to your teeth to the largest extend. Your teeth ended up not in much contact with the toothpaste to fully get the benefit from it.</li>
            <li> once you open the cap ... you will never be able to get it back on ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gunk surrounds the opening rapidly ... aesthetically displeasing ...</li>
