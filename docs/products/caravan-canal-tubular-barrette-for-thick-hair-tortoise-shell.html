            <li>All my hair fits nicely without getting hooked or tangled in the closure &amp; it doesn&#x27;t slip out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>

            <li>I would recommend it because it is a nice product and was delivered on time.  </li>

            <li>Perfect for long hair.  </li>
            <li>Spent more for France Luxe and very happy with their \\&quot;Volume\\&quot; barrettes.</li>
            <li>Very good product, matches exactly golden brown hair or medium brown hair, for a modern classical look, the closure is very good, and the gap can fit for many hair types</li>
            <li>All of the Caravan barrettes in this size work very well and hold a good amount of hair</li>
            <li>it is nicely made and pretty.</li>
            <li>( I have fine hair but a lot of it).</li>
            <li>I have A LOT of fine hair.</li>
            <li>The color is fine and it seems that it will hold up.</li>
            <li>The clasp itself isn&#x27;t cheap metal either.</li>
            <li>Great product just too big for my hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have one handy in various places.</li>
            <li>It will hold all of it in a beautiful ponytail for you all day long.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have been able to fit all my hair in a barrette.</li>
            <li>Lovely large barrette.</li>
            <li>This barrette holds my hair up in a twist, which is cool and they&#x27;re indestructable as well.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>clip itself is good looking, just not capacious enough for me.  </li>
            <li>This clip is perfect for ladies with thick hair.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s super.</li>
            <li>I just got this yesterday, but I have worn it since I ripped the box open and love it!  </li>
            <li>Barrette is totally worth the price.  </li>
            <li>This works great--it&#x27;s just the right size.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice barrette, there&#x27;s just not very much room for hair.</li>
            <li>Simple, elegant and well-made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to twist my hair up into a french roll and use the barrette to keep it in place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to order two more.</li>
            <li>It broke the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>They barrettes don&#x27;t slip out and the clasp is a much better quality than your cheap, typical drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>Very nice for thick hair</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick hair and this barrette  is perfect for putting it up in back.</li>
            <li>I think it would be best for someone with really thick hair, perhaps even of a coarse texture in order to benefit fully from this style.</li>
            <li>but it is uncommon to fit my thick hair pulled back</li>
            <li>/&gt;Surprisingly strong and durable - will likely purchase again.</li>
            <li>this works pretty good for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is not that thick but is long and this clip holds it in place perfectly.</li>
            <li>I bought three more of these because I tend to loose them</li>
            <li>I gave it to a friend with super thick hair, and she was thrilled.</li>
            <li>SOOOOOO much easier that trying to keep the roll up with sticks.</li>
            <li>and I really like it and would order it again.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>No way could it fit my entire ponytail -</li>
            <li>too much hair -</li>
            <li>Holds my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>Cheap looking sending it back.</li>
            <li>price, fast delivery</li>
            <li>I wanted a barrette that I could pull all my hair into for a low ponytail -- using the barrette to secure my hair instead of an elastic band.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Good quality pin that really does holds up thick hair.</li>
            <li>This barrette is marked &amp;#34;Made in France&amp;#34; and the first thing I tried to do when I got it is break the metal off the barrette -</li>
            <li>I have long,  fine hair, not real thick, but not thin.  </li>
            <li>With this clip I am able to pin back about a third of my hair, which is a miracle.  </li>
            <li>When the one I&#x27;m currently using eventually dies (which all barrettes will eventually do given enough use), I want to make sure I have a couple back-ups.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but it could probably hold a little more.  </li>
            <li>Never been able to find a barrette to fit my extra thick hair.</li>
            <li>This barrette works great for my long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Most clips either won&#x27;t hold all of it or slip out of place within a few hours.</li>
            <li>It was great because I have really thick and long hair</li>
            <li>, i have thick hair and it looks nice with my hair color.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t as thick as it used to be (though it still looks very full), and this fell right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It looks very nice for church or casual.  </li>
            <li>Amazing for super thick long hair!!</li>
            <li>Great buy in comparison to other barrettes on Amazon , they were all 20 bucks with least being 14 bucks.</li>
            <li>Good quality, pretty and especially holds my thick hair with no worry of the clasp popping loose or breaking.</li>
            <li>This is the first barrette that I&#x27;ve found that will hold my super thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I just bought a second one because I was afraid of not being able to find something suitable when the time came to replace my current one.  </li>
            <li>I think this is overpriced for what you&#x27;re getting - a piece of plastic which is pretty rough on both edges.  </li>
            <li>This product is fine, but nothing special and too expensive for what you actually get.</li>
            <li>expensive, but good quality, and actually fits my ton of hair pulled back.</li>
            <li>Very well made but not exactly right for my hair.</li>
            <li>You can jam a whole mess of hair into it without it bending or breaking.</li>

            <li> You can jam a whole mess of hair into it without it bending or breaking.</li>
            <li> the barrette was smaller than i expected.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and it has held up for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this clip for anyone who has thick hair woes.</li>
            <li> strong clips for long thick hair are hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li> Not large enough; not even close.</li>
            <li> The only time I would say that this barrette is a bit small is when I&#x27;m wearing a french knot in the back.</li>
            <li> It fits a lot of hair and seems to be sturdy, whereas other barrettes I have had pop open or the metal pieces break.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely long, thick hair and cannot use a normal size battery.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the limited description and the reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair is normal to thick.  </li>
            <li> and it hold without popping a loose  on my head.</li>
            <li> (how you&#x27;d typically use a smaller barrette).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed, as I had intended to be able to sweep my hair up and back in this clip.  </li>
            <li> I only use it to hold about half of my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, straight, and very long.  </li>
            <li> and it is hard to find barrettes deep enough to hold it all.</li>
            <li> Works great on my thick hair!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Barrettes are generally too small to hold it up.</li>
            <li> stayed closed with think hair.</li>
            <li> I have always had incredibly thick hair and most barrettes are completely useless for holding a substantial amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s big enough to hold really thick hair (like mine used to be).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent less money on barrettes, but they have fallen apart on me.</li>
            <li> This barrette is definitely for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something with a bigger clip that would hold alot of thick.</li>
            <li> Actually fits my thick hair in one ponytail.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my bum.</li>

            <li> All of the Caravan barrettes in this size work very well and hold a good amount of hair ( I have fine hair but a lot of it). They barrettes don&#x27;t slip out and the clasp is a much better quality than your cheap, typical drugstore brand. The only time I would say that this barrette is a bit small is when I&#x27;m wearing a french knot in the back. I can still get all my hair in but it&#x27;s a tight squeeze.  I have owned two of these barrettes before - lost both of them and was sooo happy to see them on Amazon.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Simple, elegant and well-made.</li>
            <li> Very nice for thick hair</li>
            <li> Finally a  clip that will keep all my hair tucked in neatly</li>
            <li> Love this! Never been able to find a barrette to fit my extra thick hair. This one does!</li>
            <li> I have always had incredibly thick hair and most barrettes are completely useless for holding a substantial amount of hair.  With this clip I am able to pin back about a third of my hair, which is a miracle.  I absolutely recommend this clip for anyone who has thick hair woes.</li>
            <li> I have a thick mess of wavy hair on my head. Barrettes are generally too small to hold it up. This thing is amazing! I&#x27;m able to twist my hair up into a french roll and use the barrette to keep it in place. SOOOOOO much easier that trying to keep the roll up with sticks. The clasp itself isn&#x27;t cheap metal either. You can jam a whole mess of hair into it without it bending or breaking. I&#x27;m back to order two more. When the one I&#x27;m currently using eventually dies (which all barrettes will eventually do given enough use), I want to make sure I have a couple back-ups.</li>
            <li> Does not work with long thick hair.  However, it looks great.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my bum. It is thick. This hair barrette let&#x27;s me twist my hair up and double it up at the same time and clip it to the back of my head. It does the job great. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work, but it does. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months and I really like it and would order it again.&lt;br /&gt;Good strong clips for long thick hair are hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived quickly and in great shape.</li>
            <li> These are great. Holds a lot of hair in place and also looks great. Closure is tight also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice barrette, there&#x27;s just not very much room for hair.</li>
            <li> Love this barrette.  It fits a lot of hair and seems to be sturdy, whereas other barrettes I have had pop open or the metal pieces break.  I bought three more of these because I tend to loose them and it&#x27;s nice to have one handy in various places.</li>
            <li> This barrette works great for my long, thick hair.  It&#x27;s also attractive and well-made.</li>
            <li> This works great--it&#x27;s just the right size.  I have pretty thick hair and this barrette  is perfect for putting it up in back.</li>
            <li> Good quality, pretty and especially holds my thick hair with no worry of the clasp popping loose or breaking.</li>
            <li> Works great on my thick hair!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. Impossible to find anything that large in the stores.</li>
            <li> This barrette holds my hair up in a twist, which is cool and they&#x27;re indestructable as well. It&#x27;s only barette I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> stayed closed with think hair.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this barrett.</li>
            <li> it is nicely made and pretty. it holds my hair fairly well, i have thick hair and it looks nice with my hair color.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for myself. I have very thick hair and it is hard to find barrettes deep enough to hold it all. This one works great, looks good.</li>
            <li> This barrette says for Thick Hair.  My hair is normal to thick.  It broke the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> I tried putting my hair in it &amp; it snapped in half, don&#x27;t waste your money. Not for thick hair.</li>
            <li> This barrette is definitely for thick hair.  In the past I have purchased barrettes marketed for thick hair and been disappointed.  I didn&#x27;t have to struggle to get this one snapped.  I want more in every color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent less money on barrettes, but they have fallen apart on me. This barrette is marked &amp;#34;Made in France&amp;#34; and the first thing I tried to do when I got it is break the metal off the barrette - but it held!  Also, when it&#x27;s in my hair it&#x27;s IN - it doesn&#x27;t slide, doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s pretty. I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly strong and durable - will likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good quality pin that really does holds up thick hair.</li>
            <li> expensive, but good quality, and actually fits my ton of hair pulled back. No way could it fit my entire ponytail - too much hair - but it is uncommon to fit my thick hair pulled back so that&#x27;s super.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Holds up thick hair.</li>
            <li> this works pretty good for my thick hair. I need to order another</li>
            <li> Great product just too big for my hair</li>
            <li> As promised!  Perfect for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is the best!! It holds ALL of my hair, all day! I can even use it to put my hair up into a twist, this clip holds it securely in place! I have A LOT of fine hair. Most clips either won&#x27;t hold all of it or slip out of place within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I just got this yesterday, but I have worn it since I ripped the box open and love it!  It is super sturdy and holds all of my hair perfectly.  I have long,  fine hair, not real thick, but not thin.  I can pile it all up on my head and this clip holds it.  I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> It was great because I have really thick and long hair and I could put all of it up</li>
            <li> This a really great for curly hair, works as advertise and it seems to be of good quality. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I doubted that this was as big as they said, and bought it.  My hair isn&#x27;t as thick as it used to be (though it still looks very full), and this fell right out of my hair.  I&#x27;m giving it a 5 because it seems really well made, and it&#x27;s just awesome that it&#x27;s big enough to hold really thick hair (like mine used to be).  I gave it to a friend with super thick hair, and she was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Perfect for long hair.  My hair is not that thick but is long and this clip holds it in place perfectly.</li>
            <li> Barrett is made in France.  Holds my hair very well.  It is for thick hair and it works.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have been able to fit all my hair in a barrette. I,m thrilled!  The color is fine and it seems that it will hold up.</li>
            <li> the barrette was smaller than i expected.  I was looking for something with a bigger clip that would hold alot of thick. Went online because the stores no longer carry any barrettes that hold alot of hair without breaking.</li>
            <li> Not large enough; not even close. Hair got caught in the hinge too. Spent more for France Luxe and very happy with their \\&quot;Volume\\&quot; barrettes.</li>
            <li> Lovely large barrette. I put up half of my hair, have not tried all of it. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I think this is overpriced for what you&#x27;re getting - a piece of plastic which is pretty rough on both edges.  While it claims it&#x27;s for thick hair, there&#x27;s no way my daughter can get all of her thick hair in it with a french twist like another reviewer said.  She&#x27;ll be using this for the top 1/3 of her hair (how you&#x27;d typically use a smaller barrette).  This product is fine, but nothing special and too expensive for what you actually get.</li>
            <li> This clip is almost, but not quite, big enough to hold my hair in an up-do.  I&#x27;m a bit disappointed, as I had intended to be able to sweep my hair up and back in this clip.  Not going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip itself is good looking, just not capacious enough for me.  YMMV.</li>
            <li> Cheap looking sending it back.</li>
            <li> Amazing for super thick long hair!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely long, thick hair and cannot use a normal size battery.  This one is great!  All my hair fits nicely without getting hooked or tangled in the closure &amp; it doesn&#x27;t slip out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, fast delivery - I&#x27;m going to be looking to get some in a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair... A LOT. While this did hold my ponytail, but wasn&#x27;t big enough to hold a reverse french braid.  Received promptly and seems sturdy and of good workmanship.  If you just want it to contain your tresses, this will suit the purpose nicely.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it because it is a nice product and was delivered on time.  However, based on the way it grasp I think it would be best for someone with really thick hair, perhaps even of a coarse texture in order to benefit fully from this style.</li>
            <li> i wear this ALL the time! it holds all my thick hair even if i twist it and then clip. big fan here!</li>
            <li> Nice barrette; this is made in France; the quality shows.</li>
            <li> Very good product, matches exactly golden brown hair or medium brown hair, for a modern classical look, the closure is very good, and the gap can fit for many hair types</li>
            <li> This clip is perfect for ladies with thick hair. It will hold all of it in a beautiful ponytail for you all day long.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the limited description and the reviews. I wanted a barrette that I could pull all my hair into for a low ponytail -- using the barrette to secure my hair instead of an elastic band. When I&#x27;ve tried to do that, the barrette doesn&#x27;t even come close to closing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This barrette only fits about 25% of my hair. It might work if I just want to pull a portion of my hair into a barrette only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken a photo of the barrette in my hand to provide some perspective as it appears much bigger in the Amazon photo.</li>
            <li> Great buy in comparison to other barrettes on Amazon , they were all 20 bucks with least being 14 bucks. It&#x27;s thick like I like them and it hold without popping a loose  on my head.</li>
            <li> Love it Love it. Actually fits my thick hair in one ponytail. Very comfortable, I can even sleep in it</li>
            <li> Barrette is totally worth the price.  This is the first barrette that I&#x27;ve found that will hold my super thick hair.  I only use it to hold about half of my hair but it could probably hold a little more.  I use it every day and it has held up for a long time.  I just bought a second one because I was afraid of not being able to find something suitable when the time came to replace my current one.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, straight, and very long.  Ths barrette holds it all in a pony tail.  It is one of three that I purchased on Amazon that worked for my hair.  I have been looking for two years for a barrette to hold my hair and have found none locally.  I am very happy to have found them.  It looks very nice for church or casual.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very well made but not exactly right for my hair.</li>
