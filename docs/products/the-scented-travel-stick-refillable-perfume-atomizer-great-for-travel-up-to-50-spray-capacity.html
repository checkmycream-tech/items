            <li>Easy to fill.</li>
            <li>The sweet fragrance of Amarige de Givenchy is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>Makes taking your favorite perfume everywhere with you super easy.</li>
            <li>Perfect amount for a week, or maybe more, small that wont take so much soace, but sufficient for the purpose, super easy to use and nice soray.</li>
            <li>I like to travel light weight and have been dependent on sample vials of my perfume to this point.  </li>
            <li>and it can fit in my wallet with no issues.</li>
            <li>I filled it up with my perfume and out it in my purse.</li>
            <li>and he could have it available at my request.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nice and compact making it very convenient to always have some perfume in my purse.</li>
            <li>The great part also is it simple and you can take it with you in your purse where you want it, it can come with you.</li>
            <li>I like very nice and handy when needed although leaks a little.</li>
            <li>Very useful one.</li>
            <li>needs better instructions on how to fill.a great way to carry a small amount of ur favorite product&#x27;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it again, but will keep it from getting to hot and not put more in it than I will need for the trip.</li>
            <li>When it first came, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to use it.</li>
            <li>I am really glad to have this and happy with my results in a little spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m guessing there is no way to rinse or clean it out</li>
            <li>but I wish it came with istructions on how you were supposed to clean it out to switch scents...</li>
            <li>I got this at promotional pricing and agreed to give the honest feedback that you see here, but I would gladly repurchase at full price and actually plan to so that my husband has one to pack in his gym bag.</li>
            <li>Much better than traveling with a large bottle of perfume that can break en route.</li>
            <li>I thought it had leaked at first, but it is fine now...</li>
            <li>Used it on a trip and the first day it was fine.</li>
            <li>This is a great little way of carrying perfume on the go.</li>
            <li>many other perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;The Perfume bottle is beautiful but it is not a bottle that I would travel with because it is big, made out of glass and it might shatter and then my perfume would be lost.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how to fill it, but the directions were clear and worked.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth not buying a miniature version thats</li>
            <li>Definatly worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised at how many times I&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li>cool adorable little refillable atomizer will store your favorite scent and can be carried anywhere for your traveling convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits right in my makeup bag</li>
            <li>I have used this in my purse for day-to-day touch ups and recently it came in very handy for an overnight trip, where I didn&#x27;t need to pack the entire bottle and risk the breaking or spilling on my clothing.</li>
            <li>A steady spray doesn&#x27;t full it but spraying in bursts dies.</li>
            <li>A steady spray doesn&#x27;t full it but spraying in bursts does.</li>
            <li>Small, light weight and easy to fill with any of his full size cologne!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted one of these after first seeing them on QVC, but I always balked at the price.  </li>
            <li>Fast service!</li>
            <li>After my second try and re-reading the directions, I was able to fill it correctly and without losing any of my fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Everybody in the house wants one!</li>
            <li>but this just is simple and easy and I can have the best and what I actually want to take with me with just a few pumps</li>
            <li>It just makes it so much easier and more convenient to carry perfume or cologne, especially for those who travel often.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to fill and even easier to carry/store in my flat, crossbody bag.  </li>
            <li>It makes it really convenient because it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for your fast shipping, also.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I just fill it with mint essential oils for a free smell.</li>
            <li>very compact in size and ease of use</li>
            <li>I really like this travel stick-a lot.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>and I am loaded with the scent I want and ready to go where ever.</li>
            <li>Finally, I can carry my favorite perfume with me on short trips without having to pack the whole bottle!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to use up the perfume that I usually forget to spray because I&#x27;m always in a rush.  </li>
            <li>I initially had trouble getting it filled and my favorite perfume ended up all over my hands.</li>
            <li>Should be bigger but good for few days</li>
            <li>Just as described, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love this little guy.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about packing a heavy glass bottle of my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>The vial is small and the perfume is able to be refilled from the bottom of the black vial rather than the top.</li>
            <li>So far he loves it!</li>
            <li>This is a really handy item that I was skeptical about at first.  </li>
            <li>It was in my luggage the second day in a hot car and completely evaporated.</li>
            <li>I like being able to pack a small amount of my favorite scent to bring with me without having to carry that big heavy bottle everywhere</li>
            <li>and they all seem to have developed a leak while in my travel bag after flying.</li>
            <li>The size, which is a little smaller than I expected, makes is very easy to take on the go.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little device for taking along your favorite perfume without the big bottle or chancing a broken mess in your suitcase.</li>
            <li>I recommend your first attempt at filling occur when you will be wearing the fragrance you want to fill, that way if you have a little leaking you can utilize it and not waste it.</li>
            <li>We filled it again to confirm this was the issue, and we noticed that it was a slow drip out of the bottom.</li>
            <li>It is really small but so useful.</li>
            <li>I have been traveling a lit lately, and this little peoduct has been my must have love it</li>

            <li> Perfect amount for a week, or maybe more, small that wont take so much soace, but sufficient for the purpose, super easy to use and nice soray.</li>
            <li> I like to travel light weight and have been dependent on sample vials of my perfume to this point.  </li>
            <li> and it can fit in my wallet with no issues.</li>
            <li> I filled it up with my perfume and out it in my purse.</li>
            <li> and he could have it available at my request.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is nice and compact making it very convenient to always have some perfume in my purse.</li>
            <li> The great part also is it simple and you can take it with you in your purse where you want it, it can come with you.</li>
            <li> I like very nice and handy when needed although leaks a little.</li>
            <li> Very useful one.</li>
            <li> needs better instructions on how to fill.a great way to carry a small amount of ur favorite product&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it again, but will keep it from getting to hot and not put more in it than I will need for the trip.</li>
            <li> When it first came, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to use it.</li>
            <li> I am really glad to have this and happy with my results in a little spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m guessing there is no way to rinse or clean it out</li>
            <li> but I wish it came with istructions on how you were supposed to clean it out to switch scents...</li>
            <li> I got this at promotional pricing and agreed to give the honest feedback that you see here, but I would gladly repurchase at full price and actually plan to so that my husband has one to pack in his gym bag.</li>
            <li> Much better than traveling with a large bottle of perfume that can break en route.</li>
            <li> I thought it had leaked at first, but it is fine now...</li>
            <li> Used it on a trip and the first day it was fine.</li>
            <li> This is a great little way of carrying perfume on the go.</li>
            <li> many other perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;The Perfume bottle is beautiful but it is not a bottle that I would travel with because it is big, made out of glass and it might shatter and then my perfume would be lost.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to fill it, but the directions were clear and worked.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth not buying a miniature version thats</li>
            <li> Definatly worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually surprised at how many times I&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> cool adorable little refillable atomizer will store your favorite scent and can be carried anywhere for your traveling convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits right in my makeup bag</li>
            <li> I have used this in my purse for day-to-day touch ups and recently it came in very handy for an overnight trip, where I didn&#x27;t need to pack the entire bottle and risk the breaking or spilling on my clothing.</li>
            <li> A steady spray doesn&#x27;t full it but spraying in bursts dies.</li>
            <li> A steady spray doesn&#x27;t full it but spraying in bursts does.</li>
            <li> Small, light weight and easy to fill with any of his full size cologne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted one of these after first seeing them on QVC, but I always balked at the price.  </li>
            <li> Fast service!</li>
            <li> After my second try and re-reading the directions, I was able to fill it correctly and without losing any of my fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Everybody in the house wants one!</li>
            <li> but this just is simple and easy and I can have the best and what I actually want to take with me with just a few pumps</li>
            <li> It just makes it so much easier and more convenient to carry perfume or cologne, especially for those who travel often.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to fill and even easier to carry/store in my flat, crossbody bag.  </li>
            <li> It makes it really convenient because it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for your fast shipping, also.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just fill it with mint essential oils for a free smell.</li>
            <li> very compact in size and ease of use</li>
            <li> I really like this travel stick-a lot.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> and I am loaded with the scent I want and ready to go where ever.</li>
            <li> Finally, I can carry my favorite perfume with me on short trips without having to pack the whole bottle!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to use up the perfume that I usually forget to spray because I&#x27;m always in a rush.  </li>
            <li> I initially had trouble getting it filled and my favorite perfume ended up all over my hands.</li>
            <li> Should be bigger but good for few days</li>
            <li> Just as described, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about packing a heavy glass bottle of my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> The vial is small and the perfume is able to be refilled from the bottom of the black vial rather than the top.</li>
            <li> So far he loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a really handy item that I was skeptical about at first.  </li>
            <li> It was in my luggage the second day in a hot car and completely evaporated.</li>
            <li> I like being able to pack a small amount of my favorite scent to bring with me without having to carry that big heavy bottle everywhere</li>
            <li> and they all seem to have developed a leak while in my travel bag after flying.</li>
            <li> The size, which is a little smaller than I expected, makes is very easy to take on the go.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little device for taking along your favorite perfume without the big bottle or chancing a broken mess in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> I recommend your first attempt at filling occur when you will be wearing the fragrance you want to fill, that way if you have a little leaking you can utilize it and not waste it.</li>
            <li> We filled it again to confirm this was the issue, and we noticed that it was a slow drip out of the bottom.</li>
            <li> It is really small but so useful.</li>
            <li> I have been traveling a lit lately, and this little peoduct has been my must have love it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really come with directions, just a small picture.  </li>
            <li> This is a must for people who travels a lot (even for everyday outside stroll) who would put a big bottle of spray in the bag?</li>
            <li> off the spritzer of the perfume bottle, leaving you only with the little stick.&lt;br /&gt;Then pop off the cover of the Scented Travel Stick and leave the plastic one on.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> The last thing I need rolling around under all those My Little Ponies, EOS lip balm eggs and mace, is a perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> After 2 days, the travel stick was empty.</li>
            <li> Its small enough where it takes up no space.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing additional ones to  put other fragrances in.</li>
            <li> It comes out misty and not like a stream like some other spray bottles.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of traveling and usually just leave my perfume at home, especially when I am going out of the country - but not anymore!!</li>
            <li> up and down repeatedly until the Scented Stick is filled.&lt;br</li>

            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste it and then rinse well and change fragrances when I want.</li>
            <li> I like how small it is</li>
            <li> The photo is my spray in comparison to how small and compact the atomizer is.</li>
            <li> Directions were a little vague (just a small picture)</li>
            <li> This small perfume atomizer is so neat!</li>

            <li> This is a really handy item that I was skeptical about at first.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how to fill it, but the directions were clear and worked.  I thought it had leaked at first, but it is fine now...just be sure to wipe off the filling end and let the seal reset.  I like to travel light weight and have been dependent on sample vials of my perfume to this point.  Finally, I have something more handy for my purse!!</li>
            <li> This is a great little way of carrying perfume on the go. It makes it really convenient because it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space. I would have given 5 stars but it took a minute for me to figure out how to fill it. I&#x27;m also a bit worried that it may be leaking. I wish there was a way to cap off the end that I used to fill it with.</li>
            <li> The sweet fragrance of Amarige de Givenchy is my all time favorite. I have owned this bottle for a decade and it&#x27;s still almost brand-new only because I had finished one years ago and I own many other perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;The Perfume bottle is beautiful but it is not a bottle that I would travel with because it is big, made out of glass and it might shatter and then my perfume would be lost.&lt;br /&gt;I know they have the miniature version of Amarige but mine wasted and I never bought another one, so I can never travel with it until I purchased a Scented Travel Stick.&lt;br /&gt;This cool adorable little refillable atomizer will store your favorite scent and can be carried anywhere for your traveling convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the steps in the picture very easy to follow and do.&lt;br /&gt;Take off the spritzer of the perfume bottle, leaving you only with the little stick.&lt;br /&gt;Then pop off the cover of the Scented Travel Stick and leave the plastic one on.&lt;br /&gt;Then take the bottom of the Scented Travel Stick and place it on the little stick of the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Pump up and down repeatedly until the Scented Stick is filled.&lt;br /&gt;There you have it! It so easy to do and it&#x27;s worth not buying a miniature version thats costs more and you can always refill when the Scented Travel Stick runs out.</li>
            <li> This product was a great addition to my perfume addiction. I love perfume and body sprays and when this came along to review it made travelling with perfume easy. It fits in the palm of your hand and is easy to use. All i did was grab my perfume of choice and place the bottom of this on the top of the bottle. Then you push down and all done. I recommend this item to all my perfume friends for it is a great size for traveling and fits in my purse.</li>
            <li> Great way to take my perfume with me!</li>
            <li> Love this product it comes in handy while traveling. I can take it with me everywhere. Definatly worth the price.  Great for all perfumes. I would definatly recommend this</li>
            <li> super convenient, awesome for travel!</li>
            <li> This is great. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about packing a heavy glass bottle of my favorite scent. It also fits in my purse.</li>
            <li> Great way to bring perfume or cologne along when traveling.</li>
            <li> This great thing for traveling out town with the family and need to smell good..</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly in my compact purse</li>
            <li> Love product. Can take my favorite perfume with me anywhere I go.</li>
            <li> It did not work. It was impossible to fill. The mechanism is faulty and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had others just like this and have had no problem, but this one was bunk. All it did was spill my very expensive perfume all over the place, and waste my money.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kinda pissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could get a better one from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Should be bigger but good for few days</li>
            <li> So easy to use and super handy for keeping in my purse or using while traveling.</li>
            <li> Good for on the go use.</li>
            <li> Great for taking your favorite perfume on a trip.</li>
            <li> I carry a million things in my purse.  The last thing I need rolling around under all those My Little Ponies, EOS lip balm eggs and mace, is a perfume bottle. Now a tiny travel sized perfume stick, that&#x27;s a different story! This is so easy to fill and even easier to carry/store in my flat, crossbody bag.  The cap closes nice and securely.  I&#x27;m actually surprised at how many times I&#x27;ve used this and it&#x27;s nice to use up the perfume that I usually forget to spray because I&#x27;m always in a rush.  I&#x27;ve always wanted one of these after first seeing them on QVC, but I always balked at the price.  Little did I realize, i was just throwing money away by letting my perfumes sit unused on my vanity.  I got this at promotional pricing and agreed to give the honest feedback that you see here, but I would gladly repurchase at full price and actually plan to so that my husband has one to pack in his gym bag.</li>
            <li> I Just got it today and put it to use already. I like how small it is and it can fit in my wallet with no issues. My only issue is once it runs out I may want to use another perfume/spray in this and I&#x27;m guessing there is no way to rinse or clean it out so that when I refill it, it will still smell like the last perfume.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend to keep on his bag when he bikes to work. So far he loves it! Small, light weight and easy to fill with any of his full size cologne! Now I might buy one for myself!</li>
            <li> This is so neat. I filled it up with my perfume and out it in my purse. Its small enough where it takes up no space. The design is really cute. It looks like lipstick. It also holds the perfect amount. Also it sprays out the most perfect mist.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill and use. Much better than traveling with a large bottle of perfume that can break en route.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel. Used this last weekend when we went to the theatre. My favorite scent is in a huge bottle, so I was able to transfer to this and have something to freshen up. My husband was pleased too. :)</li>
            <li> This is great for travel or just to throw in your purse.  Makes taking your favorite perfume everywhere with you super easy. Compact and easy to use. Fast service!</li>
            <li> Love this. Directions were a little vague (just a small picture) but I figured out to take the spray head off my cologne and insert it into bottom of atomizer. A steady spray doesn&#x27;t full it but spraying in bursts dies.</li>
            <li> I like very nice and handy when needed although leaks a little.Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a handy little device for taking along your favorite perfume without the big bottle or chancing a broken mess in your suitcase. I have used this in my purse for day-to-day touch ups and recently it came in very handy for an overnight trip, where I didn&#x27;t need to pack the entire bottle and risk the breaking or spilling on my clothing. I initially had trouble getting it filled and my favorite perfume ended up all over my hands. I recommend your first attempt at filling occur when you will be wearing the fragrance you want to fill, that way if you have a little leaking you can utilize it and not waste it. After my second try and re-reading the directions, I was able to fill it correctly and without losing any of my fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;This item was received at a reduction in price for the purpose of testing, for a honest and unbiased review. I would recommend purchasing this item to others wanting to have an easy way to touch up your fragrance and for travel purposes. Its a great item and I will be purchasing additional ones to  put other fragrances in.</li>
            <li> What a great idea for my husband. I have purchased him several colognes through out our marriage and I love when he smells good. I bought him this so he could put it in his pocket with whatever cologne choice he wanted and he could have it available at my request.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortuantly, you fill this from the bottom, and I don&#x27;t know if ours is defective, or if they all have a bad inner seal. After 2 days, the travel stick was empty. We filled it again to confirm this was the issue, and we noticed that it was a slow drip out of the bottom.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved..!!!!</li>
            <li> Used it on a trip and the first day it was fine. It was in my luggage the second day in a hot car and completely evaporated. I&#x27;ll use it again, but will keep it from getting to hot and not put more in it than I will need for the trip.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this. I actually put essential oils in it and spray them on when I need them. It is great to carry in my purse with me. Thank you so much for your fast shipping, also.</li>
            <li> Oh How I love this. It is awesome. Sometimes I just fill it with mint essential oils for a free smell. Or I fill with my favorite perfume. But the perfect size !!</li>
            <li> Very useful one.I liked it a lot .its very compact in size and ease of use</li>
            <li> Head over heels for this refillable perfume vial. I have been wanting one of these for months. I take this with me everywhere I take a lip gloss (and that is everywhere-literally). The vial is small and the perfume is able to be refilled from the bottom of the black vial rather than the top. I really like this travel stick-a lot.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to fill using your existing perfume bottle. Works great, never had a leak, no complaints. It is nice and compact making it very convenient to always have some perfume in my purse.</li>
            <li> Super easy to refill!! Fits in my purse!</li>
            <li> Another great item to add to my purse. It doesn&#x27;t take up as much room as a whole bottle. I travel a lot so this is great for my cosmetic bag too. Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I like being able to pack a small amount of my favorite scent to bring with me without having to carry that big heavy bottle everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> It is really small but so useful. It&#x27;s easy to refill and it came as advertised. This is a must for people who travels a lot (even for everyday outside stroll) who would put a big bottle of spray in the bag? No one. The photo is my spray in comparison to how small and compact the atomizer is. Love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Instead of hauling bulky expensive bottles on vacation.</li>
            <li> easy to fill and use, but I wish it came with istructions on how you were supposed to clean it out to switch scents...because from what I can tell you can&#x27;t....so you better love the one you pick when you first fill it!</li>
            <li> Nice item. Comes in handy.</li>
            <li> This fits perfectly in your purse. When you need to freshen up your favorite scent is so handy. Great product.</li>
            <li> This small perfume atomizer is so neat! When it first came, I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to use it. Once going over the directions, I realized that all you have to do is unscrew the top of the perfume you want to use and attach the atomizer. Then you just give it a few pumps and you have a perfect amount of perfume to carry around! The size, which is a little smaller than I expected, makes is very easy to take on the go. It fits right in my makeup bag so I can bring it anywhere. It also has a really nice look to it. It&#x27;s easy to spray and use. It comes out misty and not like a stream like some other spray bottles. Everybody in the house wants one! It just makes it so much easier and more convenient to carry perfume or cologne, especially for those who travel often. Great product. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions stated are that of my own and have in no way been swayed.</li>
            <li> so nice to able to take your fragrance with you</li>
            <li> had girls night out and a couple of the girls commented on the fragrance I was wearing.  I pulled out my travel stick and let them spray some.  They were impressed.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!  Finally, I can carry my favorite perfume with me on short trips without having to pack the whole bottle!</li>
            <li> Perfect amount for a week, or maybe more, small that wont take so much soace, but sufficient for the purpose, super easy to use and nice soray. I have been traveling a lit lately, and this little peoduct has been my must have love it</li>
            <li> Love the size. Easy to fill. Now I can take my favorite fragrance with me.</li>
            <li> needs better instructions on how to fill.a great way to carry a small amount of ur favorite product&#x27;</li>
            <li> I like this perfuse diffuser but not the easiest to put into the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Bought 3 of these and they all seem to have developed a leak while in my travel bag after flying.</li>
            <li> Very handy little tool and a great idea. I have been using it every day, and have saved me every time. Just as described, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Scented Travel Stick is just right and great, I love it it because it is just right to travel and take and you can take your favorite scent with you. I use to have to get a small bottle of other perfumes and scents to take with me while traveling but this just is simple and easy and I can have the best and what I actually want to take with me with just a few pumps and I am loaded with the scent I want and ready to go where ever. The great part also is it simple and you can take it with you in your purse where you want it, it can come with you. I am really glad to have this and happy with my results in a little spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased Amazon review and am posting this disclosure to comply with Amazon&#x27;s Terms and Conditions</li>
            <li> Nice light weight travel stick.</li>
            <li> Very nice and easy to fill.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy. Nothing better then being able to take your favorite perfume in a compact size on the go. I just out a little in each time so I don&#x27;t waste it and then rinse well and change fragrances when I want. Great invention! Koodos today you</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anyone who travels or just want to have a travel size of their favorite perfume to carry with them.  It is the same size as a tube of lipstick.  It didn&#x27;t really come with directions, just a small picture.  To fill it you have to take the spray head off your perfume bottle and insert it into bottom of the atomizer. A steady spray doesn&#x27;t full it but spraying in bursts does. I was a little worried about it leaking but so far it has done great!  I was offered this at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and am so glad I decided to take up the offer.  I do a lot of traveling and usually just leave my perfume at home, especially when I am going out of the country - but not anymore!!</li>
            <li> This is very handy, easy to fill too.</li>
