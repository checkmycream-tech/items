            <li>, I was not at all impressed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is perfect for perfume wearers.</li>
            <li>but you need to apply at night to get the best results.</li>
            <li>Just perfect!!!</li>
            <li>Use as directed (at night) and it will work perfectly.</li>
            <li>This product is great!  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re like me, one of those in-between having and issue and not people, this is the perfect product for you.</li>
            <li>Best Ever I&#x27;ve Ever Ever Tried!!</li>

            <li>This is a great one!  </li>
            <li>She said Degree Clinical Protection works best if you shower at night and then use the Degree Clinical Protection.</li>

            <li>Very good protection against both wetness and odor.</li>
            <li>Great value, great scent, great product!</li>
            <li>in the background and sipping my beautiful lattes.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant works great under any conditions.</li>
            <li>But it is a great product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great if you use it like the directions say and put it on the night before and sleep with it on.</li>
            <li>Degree Clinical Protection has been great for me.</li>
            <li>so I was happy that this version held up as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never thought the fragrances were that great</li>
            <li>This deodorant is great.  </li>
            <li>Still this deodorant does its job great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally happy, sitting on my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>She said Degree Clinical Protection works great and she would buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this deodorant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell that great.  </li>
            <li>I have found to be very effective at controlling odor and perspiration.  </li>
            <li>She said the shape of the Degree Clinical Protection is a very nice size and shape.</li>
            <li>That being said, I felt that it did a good job of keeping the sweat and odor under control the majority of the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting really good protection, and haven&#x27;t had any worries about wearing sleeveless tops and exposing others to my funk.</li>
            <li>a good product,</li>
            <li>So, I think this deodorant is fair, and I will use it unless it makes the underarms of garments discolored.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in need of superior dryness</li>
            <li>I work at home at a fairly stressful job.  </li>
            <li>Everything was good except I went off the picture.</li>
            <li>&quot; But all in all it was a good experience.</li>
            <li>otherwise, love this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly and lasts more than 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>Just love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>While it lasts it does have a nice fragrance that I didn&#x27;t find to be too overpowering.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nice Fragrance - not too strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>three products suggest that you apply the product before going to bed at night, assuring the user that it will remain effective even through  your morning shower.  </li>

            <li>I liked this antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
            <li>The more I sweat the more pleasant scent I can</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not that great on people, if that makes</li>
            <li>Shower Clean scent is very nice.</li>
            <li>I have a very strong preference for non-scented items.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for it and it is very strong.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the most pleasant or feminine, though it&#x27;s not disgusting; it has a more \\&quot;athletic\\&quot; smell to it.</li>
            <li>but this one by far seems to work the best.</li>
            <li>For me I apply right after I shower in the morning and get great results.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful, fresh and clean scent, it&#x27;s not overly fragrant or too potent, and it excels at odor and wetness</li>
            <li>The price is a bit more though, so I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a good deal unless it&#x27;s on a good sale, since Ban is a regular non-clinical strength and works just as good</li>

            <li>I have bought and tried so many, trying to find one that protects against both odor and wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It protects against both wetness and odor for most of the day.</li>
            <li>- I feel like if it costs more and is clinical, it should work better.</li>
            <li>- I feel like if it costs more and is clinical, it should work better.</li>
            <li>I love the Degree Clinical protection line.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of anything that I have tried that is more effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Specially love the applicator which 2 to 3 clicks is all what you need.  </li>
            <li>scent is good for both men and women, a sort of sporty-talc scent that never changed (we&#x27;ve all had deodorants that start out fresh</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait until I use it all up so that I can move on to something better.</li>
            <li>Smells better on him, but I still don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been incredibly pleased with this.</li>
            <li>&quot; smell that so many have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Degree for many, many years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent deodorant, especially for the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; ones.  </li>
            <li>Man do I love the protection I&#x27;ve had from this product.</li>
            <li>The cream pushes up through middlin-size holes on top of the dispenser.</li>
            <li>All of them recommend applying before bed time, but I have never been able to accept that.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands of clinical strength deodorant and antiperspirant and I feel that Degree Clinical Protection is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it immediately after I shaved my armpits.</li>
            <li>But somewhere on day 3 (I know, I&#x27;m not terribly observant)</li>
            <li>This one does work ok for about a day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed on my husband either when he&#x27;s used it.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and it protects very well from sweat and odor.</li>
            <li>scent is very clean but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Degree Clinical is actually pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and has a nice matte feel under the arms once it dries.</li>
            <li>the scent is kind of strong when you first put it on, but it wears off. :)</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has a very light clean scent.</li>
            <li>Clinical Protection Antiperspirant and Deodorant is the very light and clean scent.</li>
            <li>It also absorbs into the skin very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting any on your clothes.</li>
            <li>but Degree&#x27;s really has done an exceptional job blocking wetness.</li>
            <li>and i can easily recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is neutral smelling, glides on easily, and works.  </li>
            <li>B001KYNZMA Degree Women&#x27;s Clinical Protection Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant-Sheer Powder-1.7 oz]] scent which is way too strong.</li>
            <li>It is too strong and makes my eyes water.  </li>
            <li>I guess this product works in cooler climates but in my hot and warm one it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It seems like it would last a full 24 hours if you need it to, it&#x27;s got a nice pleasant scent and it goes on easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be fine if you were just going to work or out walking or something, but I don&#x27;t like it out in the garden when I&#x27;m using a hose or getting in the pool.</li>
            <li>It seems to be more economical and easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>You get just the precise amount everytime you click it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth paying more for those results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works fabulously.</li>
            <li>PLEASE consider a fragrance free version.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s $0.02 - The lack of readily available information about the chemical components and risks associated with the use of this product</li>
            <li>&#x27;s $0.02 - The lack of readily available information about the chemical components and risks associated with the use of this product</li>
            <li>bouncing around to the sound of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>, although I know that this is how many deodorant/antiperspirants are dispensing their product, I don&#x27;t really like the top with the holes.</li>
            <li>It is light and clean and floral.</li>
            <li>I feel fresh all day wearing it and no discomfort!</li>
            <li>I was so intrigued and excited</li>
            <li>Originally when I started using this type of anti-perspirant deodorant I was almost turned off from continuing to buy it because of the price, but it won me over by the way it works.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, when I sniffed under my arms, I&#x27;m still getting a clean scent</li>
            <li>Women&#x27;s Anti-Perspirant and Deodorant, Shower Clean for a month now.  </li>
            <li>With that said I&#x27;ve never gotten the greatest results with Dove, or Spirit, or Lady Speed Stick, or even regular old Degree for women.</li>
            <li>It feels completely clean.</li>
            <li>The scent is a &#x27;clean&#x27; sort of scent and nothing extravagant.</li>
            <li>The scent lingered for a full four days afterwards even though I showered and shaved my underarms every day.</li>
            <li>the Active Clean scent is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a nice and inexpensive product that offers good protection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>The Active clean Motion sense, I have to admit that it smells great</li>
            <li>I could smell it on myself periodically throughout the day, so strongly that several times I kind of looked around to see where the smell was coming from and then realized -</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is highly scented and reminds me more of a \\&quot;clean linen\\&quot; type air freshener or candle smell.</li>
            <li>The scent stays true and fresh throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Like most clinical deodorants it is really tricky to get out of clothes if it gets on them.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent at first, but I found that I always had to apply normal anti-perspirant during the day because the clinical one wasn&#x27;t doing the job.</li>
            <li>It smells great, lasts for 24 hours, and works reasonably well if you apply it before you go to sleep, and don&#x27;t apply it the next day.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been picky about deodorant, but I&#x27;ve never been someone with an underarm problem that needed anything described as \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; or prescription worthy.</li>
            <li>I live in a Tropical island where it&#x27;s always hot and warm so sweaty arm pits is basically a norm.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will continue to buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of keeping you protected for the majority of the day; though the scent is long gone by then.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good one, although I&#x27;m not clear how \\&quot;clinical\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to make my own adjustments though, and I&#x27;m quite willing to do it for a product that gives me the odor and wetness protection that I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my deodorant and it took me a long time to find one I am happy with.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty &#x27;fresh&#x27; and clean like some soaps and not too sweet or powdery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Secret Clinical Strength original scent over this one, as it is much more effective in keeping away the sweat and has a more floral scent to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, overall, it offers great protection and has a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>deodorant has a clean soapy smell when I first apply it.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Heaven knows vinegar is still one of the most powerful cleaning tools in my kitchen, despite the fact that there is an entire row of cleaning solutions available in the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B001FB5HK6 Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant for Women, Power Gel, Flower Fresh, 2.25 oz (63 g)</li>
            <li>I feel very confident now wearing this and don&#x27;t have to worry about how long I can be out in the heat.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, it does not stain the underarms of garments, but I will be watching closely to make sure that it does not.  </li>
            <li>Deodorant changes or attempts to cover up that odor, with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li>All-Day Fresh Scent 2.6 Oz]]</li>
            <li>I smell fresh and this product has the added benefit of being non-irritating.</li>
            <li>Degree is by far my favorite</li>
            <li>(That can be a significant point as some of the stronger \\&quot;regular\\&quot; antiperspirants have almost as much aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY as the lower concentration \\&quot;clinical</li>
            <li>(That can be a significant point as some of the stronger \\&quot;regular\\&quot; antiperspirants have almost as much aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY as the lower concentration \\&quot;clinical</li>
            <li>The scent kicked in at all the right times -- after I mowed, did a bunch of chores, etc.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found this particular formula available without a scent yet</li>
            <li>advantage that Degree does have is that it is so highly scented and that may be important to someone.</li>
            <li>advantage that Degree does have is that it is so highly scented and that may be important to someone.</li>
            <li>It went on clear, dried fast, smelled wonderful, and provided me with dryness all day.</li>
            <li>For your average day-to-day tasks, it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like a clean kitchen without all the strong scents that mean someone just cleaned it using every chemical known to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It usually happens more quickly though in my experience, so Degree still performed better even in that area.</li>
            <li>but I think it is well worth the extra money for those who just want a bit more assurance that things are under control.</li>
            <li>Deodorant works great for daily use in light or even heavy workouts.  </li>
            <li>and it never stained my clothes and provided protection the whole day!</li>
            <li>deodorant cost more than what I currently use but knowing it works, I am going to be switching over to this brand and scent.</li>
            <li>When Degree first came out and I tried it then</li>
            <li>This is actually one of the better deodorants out there.</li>
            <li>higher price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>higher price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>be aware that the product must sit on your skin awhile before it will work.  </li>
            <li>When it was first introduced, I thought the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; moniker was just another marketing gimmick</li>
            <li>But after I started practicing Bikram (Hot) Yoga, a friend of mine suggested I try this stuff</li>
            <li>As I ran through the house grabbing my coffee and looking for my keys, I hastily placed an order for more deodorant (with next day shipping).</li>
            <li>This clinical protection deodorant works pretty well...</li>
            <li>I would rate the 2 a draw except for the much higher cost of Degree.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will pay more for this than a regular deodorant, but it feels luxurious to use this, and I like</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the Degree  </li>
            <li>You have to turn it a lot the first time to get it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several other clinical strength antiperspirants that I liked a lot better than this one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been out in that kind of weather when I didn&#x27;t have issues, and it certainly amazes me that I was in the minority of those walking around the Farmer&#x27;s Market because I didn&#x27;t have wet armpit</li>
            <li>readily found MSDS for both the Dove and  the Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder with Motion Sense, but have not been able to locate a MSDS for [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>readily found MSDS for both the Dove and  the Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder with Motion Sense, but have not been able to locate a MSDS for [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Verdict -A product with a nice fragrance, but ultimately is not worth the additonal cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My armpits were still mildly sweaty and by the end of my working day some mild odor was present too.</li>
            <li>I am normally a heavy perspire-er and have to wear long sleeve shirts most of the time to work and this product sure works for me!</li>
            <li>This deodorant doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell so even when I&#x27;m working out and sweating extra, I don&#x27;t smell myself.</li>
            <li>This deodorant held up very well.</li>
            <li>This product stops the perspiration, but I don&#x27;t really like the scent.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the scent of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t matter how much I sweat.</li>
            <li>I really would have rather had the product though, but they do not replace this item.  </li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>strenght\\&quot; antiperspirants at a much lower</li>
            <li>strenght\\&quot; antiperspirants at a much lower</li>
            <li>Degree has really come around to making quality deodorants for women.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this deodorant for about a week now and really like it.</li>
            <li>Sweating is not something a woman wants to talk about, but it&#x27;s a part of life.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would not hesitate to purchase and use it again.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like the scents as much.</li>
            <li>And when you twist to push the deodorant through the head, it comes out unevenly, so it takes more than a click or two to get the right amount.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is probably the only other deodorant I would buy besides my beloved Ban.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is probably the only other deodorant I would buy besides my beloved Ban.</li>
            <li>the significant factors really are the amount of aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY present in the product, information that is required to be listed on the Material Safety Data Sheet for each</li>
            <li>It is only a little more effective than the regular kinds, but not quite effective enough sometimes (even though I do follow the directions and apply only at night before bed).</li>
            <li>I do like this one much better than any other clinical that I have ever tried, though.</li>
            <li>I do like this one much better than any other clinical that I have ever tried, though.</li>
            <li>They only prevent one or the other even though they are labeled as antiperspirant and deodorant.it on myself periodically throughout the day, so strongly that several times I kind of looked around to see where the smell was coming from and then realized -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, clean, slightly sweet/floral scent that blends into my natural</li>
            <li>The rest of the day was full of events outside in the heat</li>
            <li>Ban Antiperspirant Deodorant, Invisible Solid, Sweet Surrender, 2.6-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li>I decided I&#x27;d only give it a full week before I made up my mind.</li>
            <li>$1 lady speed stick deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave stain on black clothes works way better....</li>
            <li>Also, I was able to wear it with a black shirt and not find any stains or smudges (this has to be attributed to the product and not user</li>
            <li>I found it to work just as good for hours on end of even heavy physical activity and sweating.</li>
            <li>This type of deodorant is not solid but more like opaque white gel.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit warm and it was a hard work.</li>
            <li>I prefer this vastly over the Powder scent, which to me is a little cloying and more distinctly feminine than I</li>
            <li>However, the real test was on a day that was close to 90 degrees out taking my two year old daughter to the park.</li>
            <li>The Sheer Powder smells like baby powder and the Active Clean scent smells clean.  </li>
            <li>That being said this scent is light enough that it is barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It simply smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I prefer this texture to the normal stick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s probably worth trying a &#x27;clinical&#x27; deodorant once, to see if there is a big improvement for you.</li>
            <li>My underarms hardly sweat at all now, and when I get home I still smell pretty fresh, unlike other deodorants which seem to mix with my body scent and create some kind of vile funk fusion.</li>
            <li>Newer formulations rely on aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY (for glycine), which seems to be less problematic and better tolerated by those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Since using it, I realize I now need to purchase new shirts that don&#x27;t have sweat stains.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clean, not tacky, chalky, or wet.</li>
            <li>Not only did I still feel fresh at the end of the day (after spending two hours commuting in August), I felt reasonably dry and smell free after walking several miles at the gym that evening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the 90+ degree heat, I do sweat, with this product, but I am not sure I&#x27;d be able to find a product that would prevent that.  </li>
            <li>I bought the two pack on Amazon last summer (June 2011), and just finished my first stick this month (February 2012).</li>
            <li>But, it has a unique delivery system, so you only use a tiny bit, so</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s almost the end of March, and I just recently used up the first \\&quot;stick.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Active Clean scent is noticeable and I get whiffs of it all day.</li>
            <li>It leaves me and my clothing dry and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>It kept me fresh and dry all day</li>
            <li>Protection was not as strong as expected - there were days where it struggled to get me (actually my wife) through her</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really strong, but it smells like a good bar soap (I haven&#x27;t used bars in a long time, so I can&#x27;t state a specific scent for comparison).</li>
            <li>This version was no exception and kept me dry and clean smelling all day on hot, humid and active days.</li>
            <li>I do prefer the Sheer Powder scent a little more but</li>
            <li>it has a little dial at the bottom that you click click til it squirts out the white goo at the top.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear and I never sweat.</li>
            <li>Because of medication I take, I tend to get \\&quot;hot flashes\\&quot;, and normally my shirt would get wet.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as much as I would have had with my regular deodorant, but there was still some wetness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes white on the skin but that disappears fast.</li>
            <li>With my old deodorant, I had to wash my tees after every run.    </li>
            <li>That said, my skin runs on the sensitive side</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, I am stressed sweaty and stinky, and just in need of a long hot shower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those Go directly to the shower, do not stop at the dinner table, and do not stop to watch the news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Active Clean smells like the typical Shower Fresh scent a lot of deos come with.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried out Degree Clinical Protection and it seems to works as well as the other brands I normally use.</li>
            <li>Older formulas used aluminum chloride or aluminum chlorhydrate, products that many found irritating to the skin, sometimes leading to acne or causing razor burn.  </li>
            <li>After a couple weeks I gave it a second shot, and again had the exact same experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to be doing something in high heat with some extra exertion, there might be some wetness (the odor still seemed to be under control though).</li>
            <li>the Active Clean scent is a little sporty and yet powdery sweet and flowery at the same time.</li>
            <li>day I twist it just enough - 2 twists - to get a little bit to the surface and that is more than enough to spread fully and have coverage all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>so I ignored these products, assuming wet, sweaty pits were a fact of life during the hot summer months.</li>
            <li>: it takes a longer time than expected to push the cream up from the tube on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using several brands of \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; anti-perspirant deodorants for the last 3-4 years and all of them protect me better than the average solid.</li>
            <li>If it was priced more similar to my regular deodorant it would have been 5 stars, but since it performs just as well and no better, I see no reason to pay a</li>

            <li>For over a year now I&#x27;ve been using Degree Clinical Active Clean, I&#x27;ve remained dry and carefree and never had any moment when I&#x27;ve had to consider to switch to something else.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t like deodorants with scent, but the scent on this one did not bother me.</li>
            <li>and I generally prefer an unscented/hypoallergenic product for this reason.</li>
            <li>Dove Clinical Protection Clear Tone, Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder with Motion Sense and this  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear and does not leave white stains on clothes.</li>
            <li>I never smell and my underarms are never wet.</li>
            <li>and wow now I&#x27;m never looking back!  </li>
            <li>The Degree Clinical Protection goes on wet but dries very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Naturally I&#x27;d be looking for the female products</li>
            <li>Dove was to moisturizing for me and Secret was okay</li>
            <li>never really have an issue with deodorant irritating my skin, so I can&#x27;t really speak to it decreasing irritation more than any other brand, but it certainly didn&#x27;t cause any issues for me.  </li>
            <li>While there are some very minor differences in the Inactive Ingredients between the products (most markedly between the Dove &amp; either Degree) and the specific fragrance differs (only slightly - I found the Dove and the Degree Sheer Powder to have very similar fragrances)</li>
            <li>It went on well and the applicator was nice, which actually less mess than other brands.</li>
            <li>My old Degree was a stick version so you only had to turn the bottom when it got too low on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Summer in Washington DC is *never* a dry affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I was doing a lot of heavy yard work/landscaping during 90+degree weather.</li>
            <li>After the first few days I got used to the smell</li>
            <li>After the first few days I got used to the smell</li>
            <li>Over the last few months I&#x27;ve tried several brands of \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; protection antiperspirant, and thus far this is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>In general, I sweat much less than my previous deodorant, so I do not go through tops as quickly, which was what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The Sheer Powder scent is much milder and is less noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life my armpits were not sweaty and therefore no embarrassing sweat marks in my clothes (that forces me to keep my hands glued to my sides) and one morning I forgot to apply the deodorant and had to walk down town and my arms stayed dry with no odor.</li>

            <li> But it is a great product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great if you use it like the directions say and put it on the night before and sleep with it on.</li>

            <li> This deodorant is great.  </li>
            <li> Still this deodorant does its job great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally happy, sitting on my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> She said Degree Clinical Protection works great and she would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell that great.  </li>
            <li> I have found to be very effective at controlling odor and perspiration.  </li>
            <li> She said the shape of the Degree Clinical Protection is a very nice size and shape.</li>
            <li> That being said, I felt that it did a good job of keeping the sweat and odor under control the majority of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting really good protection, and haven&#x27;t had any worries about wearing sleeveless tops and exposing others to my funk.</li>
            <li> a good product,</li>
            <li> So, I think this deodorant is fair, and I will use it unless it makes the underarms of garments discolored.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in need of superior dryness</li>
            <li> I work at home at a fairly stressful job.  </li>
            <li> Everything was good except I went off the picture.</li>
            <li> &quot; But all in all it was a good experience.</li>
            <li> otherwise, love this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly and lasts more than 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> Just love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> While it lasts it does have a nice fragrance that I didn&#x27;t find to be too overpowering.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nice Fragrance - not too strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> three products suggest that you apply the product before going to bed at night, assuring the user that it will remain effective even through  your morning shower.  </li>

            <li> I liked this antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
            <li> The more I sweat the more pleasant scent I can</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not that great on people, if that makes</li>
            <li> Shower Clean scent is very nice.</li>
            <li> I have a very strong preference for non-scented items.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it and it is very strong.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t the most pleasant or feminine, though it&#x27;s not disgusting; it has a more \\&quot;athletic\\&quot; smell to it.</li>
            <li> but this one by far seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> For me I apply right after I shower in the morning and get great results.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful, fresh and clean scent, it&#x27;s not overly fragrant or too potent, and it excels at odor and wetness</li>
            <li> The price is a bit more though, so I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a good deal unless it&#x27;s on a good sale, since Ban is a regular non-clinical strength and works just as good</li>

            <li> I have bought and tried so many, trying to find one that protects against both odor and wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It protects against both wetness and odor for most of the day.</li>
            <li> - I feel like if it costs more and is clinical, it should work better.</li>
            <li> - I feel like if it costs more and is clinical, it should work better.</li>
            <li> I love the Degree Clinical protection line.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of anything that I have tried that is more effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Specially love the applicator which 2 to 3 clicks is all what you need.  </li>
            <li> scent is good for both men and women, a sort of sporty-talc scent that never changed (we&#x27;ve all had deodorants that start out fresh</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait until I use it all up so that I can move on to something better.</li>
            <li> Smells better on him, but I still don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been incredibly pleased with this.</li>
            <li> &quot; smell that so many have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Degree for many, many years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent deodorant, especially for the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; ones.  </li>
            <li> Man do I love the protection I&#x27;ve had from this product.</li>
            <li> The cream pushes up through middlin-size holes on top of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> All of them recommend applying before bed time, but I have never been able to accept that.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of clinical strength deodorant and antiperspirant and I feel that Degree Clinical Protection is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it immediately after I shaved my armpits.</li>
            <li> But somewhere on day 3 (I know, I&#x27;m not terribly observant)</li>
            <li> This one does work ok for about a day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed on my husband either when he&#x27;s used it.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very nice and it protects very well from sweat and odor.</li>
            <li> scent is very clean but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Degree Clinical is actually pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and has a nice matte feel under the arms once it dries.</li>
            <li> the scent is kind of strong when you first put it on, but it wears off. :)</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has a very light clean scent.</li>
            <li> Clinical Protection Antiperspirant and Deodorant is the very light and clean scent.</li>
            <li> It also absorbs into the skin very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting any on your clothes.</li>
            <li> but Degree&#x27;s really has done an exceptional job blocking wetness.</li>
            <li> and i can easily recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is neutral smelling, glides on easily, and works.  </li>
            <li> B001KYNZMA Degree Women&#x27;s Clinical Protection Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant-Sheer Powder-1.7 oz]] scent which is way too strong.</li>
            <li> It is too strong and makes my eyes water.  </li>
            <li> I guess this product works in cooler climates but in my hot and warm one it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It seems like it would last a full 24 hours if you need it to, it&#x27;s got a nice pleasant scent and it goes on easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be fine if you were just going to work or out walking or something, but I don&#x27;t like it out in the garden when I&#x27;m using a hose or getting in the pool.</li>
            <li> It seems to be more economical and easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> You get just the precise amount everytime you click it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth paying more for those results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Works fabulously.</li>
            <li> PLEASE consider a fragrance free version.</li>

            <li> bouncing around to the sound of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> , although I know that this is how many deodorant/antiperspirants are dispensing their product, I don&#x27;t really like the top with the holes.</li>
            <li> It is light and clean and floral.</li>
            <li> I feel fresh all day wearing it and no discomfort!</li>
            <li> I was so intrigued and excited</li>
            <li> Originally when I started using this type of anti-perspirant deodorant I was almost turned off from continuing to buy it because of the price, but it won me over by the way it works.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, when I sniffed under my arms, I&#x27;m still getting a clean scent</li>
            <li> Women&#x27;s Anti-Perspirant and Deodorant, Shower Clean for a month now.  </li>
            <li> With that said I&#x27;ve never gotten the greatest results with Dove, or Spirit, or Lady Speed Stick, or even regular old Degree for women.</li>
            <li> It feels completely clean.</li>
            <li> The scent is a &#x27;clean&#x27; sort of scent and nothing extravagant.</li>
            <li> The scent lingered for a full four days afterwards even though I showered and shaved my underarms every day.</li>
            <li> the Active Clean scent is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a nice and inexpensive product that offers good protection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> The Active clean Motion sense, I have to admit that it smells great</li>
            <li> I could smell it on myself periodically throughout the day, so strongly that several times I kind of looked around to see where the smell was coming from and then realized -</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is highly scented and reminds me more of a \\&quot;clean linen\\&quot; type air freshener or candle smell.</li>
            <li> The scent stays true and fresh throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Like most clinical deodorants it is really tricky to get out of clothes if it gets on them.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent at first, but I found that I always had to apply normal anti-perspirant during the day because the clinical one wasn&#x27;t doing the job.</li>
            <li> It smells great, lasts for 24 hours, and works reasonably well if you apply it before you go to sleep, and don&#x27;t apply it the next day.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been picky about deodorant, but I&#x27;ve never been someone with an underarm problem that needed anything described as \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; or prescription worthy.</li>
            <li> I live in a Tropical island where it&#x27;s always hot and warm so sweaty arm pits is basically a norm.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and will continue to buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of keeping you protected for the majority of the day; though the scent is long gone by then.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good one, although I&#x27;m not clear how \\&quot;clinical\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to make my own adjustments though, and I&#x27;m quite willing to do it for a product that gives me the odor and wetness protection that I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my deodorant and it took me a long time to find one I am happy with.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty &#x27;fresh&#x27; and clean like some soaps and not too sweet or powdery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Secret Clinical Strength original scent over this one, as it is much more effective in keeping away the sweat and has a more floral scent to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, overall, it offers great protection and has a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> deodorant has a clean soapy smell when I first apply it.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Heaven knows vinegar is still one of the most powerful cleaning tools in my kitchen, despite the fact that there is an entire row of cleaning solutions available in the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B001FB5HK6 Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant for Women, Power Gel, Flower Fresh, 2.25 oz (63 g)</li>
            <li> I feel very confident now wearing this and don&#x27;t have to worry about how long I can be out in the heat.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, it does not stain the underarms of garments, but I will be watching closely to make sure that it does not.  </li>
            <li> Deodorant changes or attempts to cover up that odor, with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li> All-Day Fresh Scent 2.6 Oz]]</li>
            <li> I smell fresh and this product has the added benefit of being non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Degree is by far my favorite</li>
            <li> (That can be a significant point as some of the stronger \\&quot;regular\\&quot; antiperspirants have almost as much aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY as the lower concentration \\&quot;clinical</li>
            <li> (That can be a significant point as some of the stronger \\&quot;regular\\&quot; antiperspirants have almost as much aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY as the lower concentration \\&quot;clinical</li>
            <li> The scent kicked in at all the right times -- after I mowed, did a bunch of chores, etc.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found this particular formula available without a scent yet</li>
            <li> advantage that Degree does have is that it is so highly scented and that may be important to someone.</li>
            <li> advantage that Degree does have is that it is so highly scented and that may be important to someone.</li>
            <li> It went on clear, dried fast, smelled wonderful, and provided me with dryness all day.</li>
            <li> For your average day-to-day tasks, it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like a clean kitchen without all the strong scents that mean someone just cleaned it using every chemical known to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It usually happens more quickly though in my experience, so Degree still performed better even in that area.</li>
            <li> but I think it is well worth the extra money for those who just want a bit more assurance that things are under control.</li>
            <li> Deodorant works great for daily use in light or even heavy workouts.  </li>
            <li> and it never stained my clothes and provided protection the whole day!</li>
            <li> deodorant cost more than what I currently use but knowing it works, I am going to be switching over to this brand and scent.</li>
            <li> When Degree first came out and I tried it then</li>
            <li> This is actually one of the better deodorants out there.</li>
            <li> higher price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> higher price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> be aware that the product must sit on your skin awhile before it will work.  </li>
            <li> When it was first introduced, I thought the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; moniker was just another marketing gimmick</li>
            <li> But after I started practicing Bikram (Hot) Yoga, a friend of mine suggested I try this stuff</li>
            <li> As I ran through the house grabbing my coffee and looking for my keys, I hastily placed an order for more deodorant (with next day shipping).</li>
            <li> This clinical protection deodorant works pretty well...</li>
            <li> I would rate the 2 a draw except for the much higher cost of Degree.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will pay more for this than a regular deodorant, but it feels luxurious to use this, and I like</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Degree  </li>
            <li> You have to turn it a lot the first time to get it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other clinical strength antiperspirants that I liked a lot better than this one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been out in that kind of weather when I didn&#x27;t have issues, and it certainly amazes me that I was in the minority of those walking around the Farmer&#x27;s Market because I didn&#x27;t have wet armpit</li>
            <li> readily found MSDS for both the Dove and  the Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder with Motion Sense, but have not been able to locate a MSDS for [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> readily found MSDS for both the Dove and  the Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder with Motion Sense, but have not been able to locate a MSDS for [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Verdict -A product with a nice fragrance, but ultimately is not worth the additonal cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My armpits were still mildly sweaty and by the end of my working day some mild odor was present too.</li>
            <li> I am normally a heavy perspire-er and have to wear long sleeve shirts most of the time to work and this product sure works for me!</li>
            <li> This deodorant doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell so even when I&#x27;m working out and sweating extra, I don&#x27;t smell myself.</li>
            <li> This deodorant held up very well.</li>
            <li> This product stops the perspiration, but I don&#x27;t really like the scent.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the scent of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t matter how much I sweat.</li>
            <li> I really would have rather had the product though, but they do not replace this item.  </li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> strenght\\&quot; antiperspirants at a much lower</li>
            <li> strenght\\&quot; antiperspirants at a much lower</li>
            <li> Degree has really come around to making quality deodorants for women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this deodorant for about a week now and really like it.</li>
            <li> Sweating is not something a woman wants to talk about, but it&#x27;s a part of life.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would not hesitate to purchase and use it again.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like the scents as much.</li>
            <li> And when you twist to push the deodorant through the head, it comes out unevenly, so it takes more than a click or two to get the right amount.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is probably the only other deodorant I would buy besides my beloved Ban.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is probably the only other deodorant I would buy besides my beloved Ban.</li>
            <li> the significant factors really are the amount of aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY present in the product, information that is required to be listed on the Material Safety Data Sheet for each</li>
            <li> It is only a little more effective than the regular kinds, but not quite effective enough sometimes (even though I do follow the directions and apply only at night before bed).</li>
            <li> I do like this one much better than any other clinical that I have ever tried, though.</li>
            <li> I do like this one much better than any other clinical that I have ever tried, though.</li>
            <li> They only prevent one or the other even though they are labeled as antiperspirant and deodorant.it on myself periodically throughout the day, so strongly that several times I kind of looked around to see where the smell was coming from and then realized -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light, clean, slightly sweet/floral scent that blends into my natural</li>
            <li> The rest of the day was full of events outside in the heat</li>
            <li> Ban Antiperspirant Deodorant, Invisible Solid, Sweet Surrender, 2.6-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li> I decided I&#x27;d only give it a full week before I made up my mind.</li>
            <li> $1 lady speed stick deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave stain on black clothes works way better....</li>
            <li> Also, I was able to wear it with a black shirt and not find any stains or smudges (this has to be attributed to the product and not user</li>
            <li> I found it to work just as good for hours on end of even heavy physical activity and sweating.</li>
            <li> This type of deodorant is not solid but more like opaque white gel.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit warm and it was a hard work.</li>
            <li> I prefer this vastly over the Powder scent, which to me is a little cloying and more distinctly feminine than I</li>
            <li> However, the real test was on a day that was close to 90 degrees out taking my two year old daughter to the park.</li>
            <li> The Sheer Powder smells like baby powder and the Active Clean scent smells clean.  </li>
            <li> That being said this scent is light enough that it is barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It simply smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I prefer this texture to the normal stick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s probably worth trying a &#x27;clinical&#x27; deodorant once, to see if there is a big improvement for you.</li>
            <li> My underarms hardly sweat at all now, and when I get home I still smell pretty fresh, unlike other deodorants which seem to mix with my body scent and create some kind of vile funk fusion.</li>
            <li> Newer formulations rely on aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY (for glycine), which seems to be less problematic and better tolerated by those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Since using it, I realize I now need to purchase new shirts that don&#x27;t have sweat stains.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clean, not tacky, chalky, or wet.</li>
            <li> Not only did I still feel fresh at the end of the day (after spending two hours commuting in August), I felt reasonably dry and smell free after walking several miles at the gym that evening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the 90+ degree heat, I do sweat, with this product, but I am not sure I&#x27;d be able to find a product that would prevent that.  </li>
            <li> I bought the two pack on Amazon last summer (June 2011), and just finished my first stick this month (February 2012).</li>
            <li> But, it has a unique delivery system, so you only use a tiny bit, so</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s almost the end of March, and I just recently used up the first \\&quot;stick.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Active Clean scent is noticeable and I get whiffs of it all day.</li>
            <li> It leaves me and my clothing dry and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> It kept me fresh and dry all day</li>
            <li> Protection was not as strong as expected - there were days where it struggled to get me (actually my wife) through her</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really strong, but it smells like a good bar soap (I haven&#x27;t used bars in a long time, so I can&#x27;t state a specific scent for comparison).</li>
            <li> This version was no exception and kept me dry and clean smelling all day on hot, humid and active days.</li>
            <li> I do prefer the Sheer Powder scent a little more but</li>
            <li> it has a little dial at the bottom that you click click til it squirts out the white goo at the top.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear and I never sweat.</li>
            <li> Because of medication I take, I tend to get \\&quot;hot flashes\\&quot;, and normally my shirt would get wet.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as much as I would have had with my regular deodorant, but there was still some wetness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes white on the skin but that disappears fast.</li>
            <li> With my old deodorant, I had to wash my tees after every run.    </li>
            <li> That said, my skin runs on the sensitive side</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, I am stressed sweaty and stinky, and just in need of a long hot shower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those Go directly to the shower, do not stop at the dinner table, and do not stop to watch the news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Active Clean smells like the typical Shower Fresh scent a lot of deos come with.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried out Degree Clinical Protection and it seems to works as well as the other brands I normally use.</li>
            <li> Older formulas used aluminum chloride or aluminum chlorhydrate, products that many found irritating to the skin, sometimes leading to acne or causing razor burn.  </li>
            <li> After a couple weeks I gave it a second shot, and again had the exact same experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to be doing something in high heat with some extra exertion, there might be some wetness (the odor still seemed to be under control though).</li>
            <li> the Active Clean scent is a little sporty and yet powdery sweet and flowery at the same time.</li>
            <li> day I twist it just enough - 2 twists - to get a little bit to the surface and that is more than enough to spread fully and have coverage all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> so I ignored these products, assuming wet, sweaty pits were a fact of life during the hot summer months.</li>
            <li> : it takes a longer time than expected to push the cream up from the tube on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using several brands of \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; anti-perspirant deodorants for the last 3-4 years and all of them protect me better than the average solid.</li>
            <li> If it was priced more similar to my regular deodorant it would have been 5 stars, but since it performs just as well and no better, I see no reason to pay a</li>

            <li> For over a year now I&#x27;ve been using Degree Clinical Active Clean, I&#x27;ve remained dry and carefree and never had any moment when I&#x27;ve had to consider to switch to something else.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t like deodorants with scent, but the scent on this one did not bother me.</li>
            <li> and I generally prefer an unscented/hypoallergenic product for this reason.</li>
            <li> Dove Clinical Protection Clear Tone, Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder with Motion Sense and this  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear and does not leave white stains on clothes.</li>
            <li> I never smell and my underarms are never wet.</li>
            <li> and wow now I&#x27;m never looking back!  </li>
            <li> The Degree Clinical Protection goes on wet but dries very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Naturally I&#x27;d be looking for the female products</li>
            <li> Dove was to moisturizing for me and Secret was okay</li>
            <li> never really have an issue with deodorant irritating my skin, so I can&#x27;t really speak to it decreasing irritation more than any other brand, but it certainly didn&#x27;t cause any issues for me.  </li>
            <li> While there are some very minor differences in the Inactive Ingredients between the products (most markedly between the Dove &amp; either Degree) and the specific fragrance differs (only slightly - I found the Dove and the Degree Sheer Powder to have very similar fragrances)</li>
            <li> It went on well and the applicator was nice, which actually less mess than other brands.</li>
            <li> My old Degree was a stick version so you only had to turn the bottom when it got too low on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Summer in Washington DC is *never* a dry affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, I was doing a lot of heavy yard work/landscaping during 90+degree weather.</li>
            <li> After the first few days I got used to the smell</li>
            <li> After the first few days I got used to the smell</li>
            <li> Over the last few months I&#x27;ve tried several brands of \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; protection antiperspirant, and thus far this is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> In general, I sweat much less than my previous deodorant, so I do not go through tops as quickly, which was what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The Sheer Powder scent is much milder and is less noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life my armpits were not sweaty and therefore no embarrassing sweat marks in my clothes (that forces me to keep my hands glued to my sides) and one morning I forgot to apply the deodorant and had to walk down town and my arms stayed dry with no odor.</li>
            <li> When I say sweating, I mean I was SWEATING for hours and really was surprised that this deodorant held up so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not a good test subject, but to me it didn&#x27;t seem to be any better</li>
            <li> Once dry it doesn&#x27;t leave big white marks on my clothes when I dress.</li>
            <li> I found putting on antiperspirant before going to bed just strange and found no obvious difference between applying at night and applying after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma</li>
            <li> I found putting on antiperspirant before going to bed just strange and found no obvious difference between applying at night and applying after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma</li>
            <li> After I run in the 85+ degree heat, I do not need to immediately launder my tee, it will last for at least two runs, maybe three before it starts to have too much scent in the underarms.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;m still a little bit surprised at how well this Degree Clinical Protection has been working for me.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it warrants the high price tag.  </li>
            <li> If you have issues with excessive sweating, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> assumed that they are both made by people in white lab coats and work basically the same for people who need a little extra help in the scent control department.</li>
            <li> The next afternoon, I spent some time cleaning out my garage.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I never really was a big Degree deodorant fan.  </li>
            <li> We have been experiencing  a lot of humidity recently due to some strange weather and this has left my underarms dry as well as my clothing.</li>
            <li> They only prevent one or the other even though they are labeled as antiperspirant and deodorant.</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant keeps my underarms dry, there&#x27;s no BO</li>
            <li> and my underarms were so dry and sore</li>
            <li> As the day goes on the scent fades away and the product keeps you dry.</li>
            <li> Less laundry &#x3D; clothes last longer.      </li>
            <li> Often times you find some that do protect against odor but not very well against wetness, and vice versa.</li>
            <li> I would probably prefer to stink than to have wet or even clammy armpits.</li>
            <li> I would probably prefer to stink than to have wet or even clammy armpits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands and nothing has wowed me.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of initial use, I find I don&#x27;t need to apply it every day or night.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> But, I found that the Degree deodorant lasted much longer than the Secret I had been using.</li>
            <li> but only if you&#x27;ve never had trouble with skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The few times I did put it on at night, I felt nervous the next morning about getting stinky.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t like what happens when I get really wet, like if you are out in the rain, or swimming.  </li>
            <li> If I get sweaty and my underarms get wet, they feel slimy to me.  </li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t last ALL day, especially not those warmer days when I&#x27;m walking at least 40 minutes to and from class/work, and sometimes by evening my pits are left unguarded if you know what I mean...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s rather sharp and not very feminine, but it&#x27;s not really a smell</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clash with other scents.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical being a Men&#x27;s product and all</li>
            <li> , I always thought it felt a bit on the powdery side, and they just didn&#x27;t jive with me as much as other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> B001ECQ516 Degree Clinical Protection, Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Active  </li>
            <li> formulations of antiperspirants rely on some form of aluminum as the active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> All three of the products I&#x27;ve been examining contain aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY as their active ingredient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The picture shows \\&quot;shower clean\\&quot; and the description is for \\&quot;Active</li>
            <li> If I had to say a negative, it would be that it does lean some white marks, but let&#x27;s face it, that&#x27;s probably going to happen with 95% of deodorants</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been testing three different anti-antiperspirants:  </li>
            <li> Just like the Degree Clinical Motion Sense antiperspirant, this also dispenses through the tiny holes which I am still not a fan of..... but slowly getting use to.</li>
            <li> After I put it on, it instantly absorbs, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I even have deoderant on, but, seriously, from a person who has been using Mitchum and other stong anti-persperants, this product works</li>
            <li> Seems to cut down on the stress sweat.</li>
            <li> That means less damage to clothing.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a deodorant that kept me dry and did not make me itch or break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t smell body other ether, so that is a double plus and controlling BOTH issues is typically where other brands fail.</li>

            <li> I have tried a few over the counter but prescription strength anti-perspirants</li>
            <li> I usually use Secret Powder Fresh, an innocuous scent that I can&#x27;t usually find in Secret Clinical</li>
            <li> Unsightly wet spots on your clothes are now a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> The stick didn&#x27;t leave a thick layer of product on the dispenser like other brands do.</li>
            <li> For one thing, I&#x27;m not good with changing a lifelong morning habit.</li>
            <li> After about half a day it seemed to be wearing a little thin and offered less protection.</li>
            <li> : I use it in the morning to keep things dryer and make my life less confusing.</li>
            <li> but there was very little wetness protection, so after about four days I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I was leary of the price, and 1.7 oz sounded really small.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for some of us, it&#x27;s a bigger part than we would like it to be.</li>

            <li> It at least matches its antiperspirant/deodorant peers and it&#x27;s well priced.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just so darned expensive, that it&#x27;s not very practical.</li>

            <li> I do like the scent of this one as it&#x27;s subtle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s making this product lose a couple of stars and be one I can&#x27;t use long term is that it&#x27;s actually painful to wear.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I realized that I had ordered Degree Clinical Protection instead of Secret Clinical Strength.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite often people are confused by  the difference in an \\&quot;antiperspirant\\&quot; and a \\&quot;deodorant.\\&quot;  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I followed the directions and applied the deodorant at night after I took my shower. The next afternoon, I spent some time cleaning out my garage. It was a bit warm and it was a hard work. I started noticing some perspiration under my arms. It wasn&#x27;t as much as I would have had with my regular deodorant, but there was still some wetness. That being said, I felt that it did a good job of keeping the sweat and odor under control the majority of the time. For your average day-to-day tasks, it seems to do a good job. If you&#x27;re going to be doing something in high heat with some extra exertion, there might be some wetness (the odor still seemed to be under control though).</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my deodorant and it took me a long time to find one I am happy with. I use [[ASIN:B001FB5HK6 Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant for Women, Power Gel, Flower Fresh, 2.25 oz (63 g) (Pack of 6)]]. It is the only one that seems to work. It goes on clear and I never sweat. It also smells great! However, there are a few shirts of mine it does stain and my underarms are a different shade than the rest of my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this around the house it and worked great! It went on clear, dried fast, smelled wonderful, and provided me with dryness all day. However, the real test was on a day that was close to 90 degrees out taking my two year old daughter to the park. At the park my daughter was running back and forth through the playground and I was getting very anxious. My back even started to sweat however, my underarms did not! I was utterly shocked at how well this deodorant worked. The rest of the day was full of events outside in the heat and it never stained my clothes and provided protection the whole day! I can&#x27;t say that Mitchum does that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant cost more than what I currently use but knowing it works, I am going to be switching over to this brand and scent. I feel very confident now wearing this and don&#x27;t have to worry about how long I can be out in the heat. Very impressed!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;m still a little bit surprised at how well this Degree Clinical Protection has been working for me. When Degree first came out and I tried it then, I was not at all impressed. In fact, it was a stinker (literally). I don&#x27;t know about the regular degree product, but this clinical strength product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant has a clean soapy smell when I first apply it. It&#x27;s not really strong, but it smells like a good bar soap (I haven&#x27;t used bars in a long time, so I can&#x27;t state a specific scent for comparison). I&#x27;ve been getting really good protection, and haven&#x27;t had any worries about wearing sleeveless tops and exposing others to my funk. At the end of the day, when I sniffed under my arms, I&#x27;m still getting a clean scent and I don&#x27;t feel a lot of deodorant residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the applicator. It&#x27;s wide, which makes it uncomfortable. And when you twist to push the deodorant through the head, it comes out unevenly, so it takes more than a click or two to get the right amount. It&#x27;s easy enough to make my own adjustments though, and I&#x27;m quite willing to do it for a product that gives me the odor and wetness protection that I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I work out daily, and use regular degree often.  I can&#x27;t say that this is any different so I&#x27;m not sure if it warrants the high price tag.  Maybe I&#x27;m not a good test subject, but to me it didn&#x27;t seem to be any better then the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; version - which works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy if you think you need and extra boost, but if you&#x27;re like me and the regular is getting the job done - save your $.</li>
            <li> This is actually one of the better deodorants out there. I have bought and tried so many, trying to find one that protects against both odor and wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried \\&quot;regular\\&quot; deodorants and clinical deodorants. Often times you find some that do protect against odor but not very well against wetness, and vice versa. I do ALWAYS buy \\&quot;antiperspirant and deodorant\\&quot; because I want protection from both, not just one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always come back to my regular product though which is [[ASIN:B000KOM3YM Ban Antiperspirant Deodorant, Invisible Solid, Sweet Surrender, 2.6-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)]]. I switch up the scents, but always go back to that brand because it works so well. I never smell and my underarms are never wet. It is disappointing when you use a clinical strength product and still have either odor or wetness... or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Degree Clinical is actually pretty darn good. It absorbs quickly and has a nice matte feel under the arms once it dries. It protects against both wetness and odor for most of the day. I found it to work just as good for hours on end of even heavy physical activity and sweating. The first day I used it, I was doing a lot of heavy yard work/landscaping during 90+degree weather. I was a sweaty disgusting mess. This deodorant held up very well. I worked for about 11 hours and it wasn&#x27;t until after that, that I started to notice an odor and wetness. It was sort of a musty BO mixed with deodorant smell.. not just BO. I assume it is just my chemisty mixing with the deodorant and I have found that this does happen for me with a couple different deodorants that I&#x27;ve tried. It usually happens more quickly though in my experience, so Degree still performed better even in that area. When I say sweating, I mean I was SWEATING for hours and really was surprised that this deodorant held up so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is highly scented and reminds me more of a \\&quot;clean linen\\&quot; type air freshener or candle smell. I could smell it on myself periodically throughout the day, so strongly that several times I kind of looked around to see where the smell was coming from and then realized - oh, it&#x27;s me. After the first few days I got used to the smell and it didn&#x27;t have me sniffing around asking who lit a candle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the only other deodorant I would buy besides my beloved Ban. The price is a bit more though, so I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a good deal unless it&#x27;s on a good sale, since Ban is a regular non-clinical strength and works just as good - I feel like if it costs more and is clinical, it should work better. And that is where I knocked off the 5th star. If it was priced more similar to my regular deodorant it would have been 5 stars, but since it performs just as well and no better, I see no reason to pay a higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advantage that Degree does have is that it is so highly scented and that may be important to someone. I do like this one much better than any other clinical that I have ever tried, though. Very good protection against both wetness and odor. I do not like the least bit of wetness. I would probably prefer to stink than to have wet or even clammy armpits. I did not endure that annoyance with this Degree and I didn&#x27;t smell body other ether, so that is a double plus and controlling BOTH issues is typically where other brands fail. They only prevent one or the other even though they are labeled as antiperspirant and deodorant.it on myself periodically throughout the day, so strongly that several times I kind of looked around to see where the smell was coming from and then realized - oh, it&#x27;s me.

            <li> I love the Degree Clinical protection line. This deodorant works great under any conditions. I have tried this on very difficult days and I have never had any dampness or odor. I can&#x27;t think of anything that I have tried that is more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is perfect for perfume wearers. It is light and clean and floral. It doesn&#x27;t clash with other scents. The scent stays true and fresh throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Like most clinical deodorants it is really tricky to get out of clothes if it gets on them. But it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have a very strong preference for non-scented items.  That being said this scent is light enough that it is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the \\&quot;clinical Protection\\&quot; items from Degree I have found to be very effective at controlling odor and perspiration.  I also find that it helps with skin irritation that I get from damp pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like scented products I recommend this product over [[ASIN:B001KYNZMA Degree Women&#x27;s Clinical Protection Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant-Sheer Powder-1.7 oz]] scent which is way too strong.</li>
            <li> Deodorant works great for daily use in light or even heavy workouts.  It has a plesant subtle smell.  Specially love the applicator which 2 to 3 clicks is all what you need.  When you first use it, you would need to rotate/click the base several times before it starts to ooze out.  This type of deodorant is not solid but more like opaque white gel.  It seems to be more economical and easier to apply.  You get just the precise amount everytime you click it.</li>
            <li> This product stops the perspiration, but I don&#x27;t really like the scent.  It is too strong and makes my eyes water.  I much prefer the scent of the [[ASIN:B00CHHKFL8 Degree Clinical Protection, Women Sheer Powder, Motion Sense, 1.7 Ounce]]to this one.  The Sheer Powder scent is much milder and is less noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be aware that the product must sit on your skin awhile before it will work.  The directions say to apply before you go to bed at night, but I don&#x27;t like doing that because it can get on the sheets and sometimes in my eyes.  I apply the product in the morning and wait about an hour before I do anything strenuous.  If I apply and then immediately start exercising, it doesn&#x27;t reduce the sweating one bit.  But if I apply and wait an hour or two then my perspiration is reduced by about 90%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a good product, but you need to apply at night to get the best results.</li>
            <li> It at least matches its antiperspirant/deodorant peers and it&#x27;s well priced. I generally don&#x27;t like deodorants with scent, but the scent on this one did not bother me.</li>
            <li> Over the last few months I&#x27;ve tried several brands of \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; protection antiperspirant, and thus far this is my least favorite. They all tend to linger on the skin for quite some time, not washing off even after being worn for a full day, but this was the worst. The scent kicked in at all the right times -- after I mowed, did a bunch of chores, etc. -- but there was very little wetness protection, so after about four days I stopped using it. The scent lingered for a full four days afterwards even though I showered and shaved my underarms every day. After a couple weeks I gave it a second shot, and again had the exact same experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is good for both men and women, a sort of sporty-talc scent that never changed (we&#x27;ve all had deodorants that start out fresh but after a few hours start to become all powder or perfume, but this doesn&#x27;t do that, thankfully). It went on well and the applicator was nice, which actually less mess than other brands. The stick didn&#x27;t leave a thick layer of product on the dispenser like other brands do.</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant keeps my underarms dry, there&#x27;s no BO doesn&#x27;t matter how much I sweat. The more I sweat the more pleasant scent I can smell.&lt;br /&gt;It goes white on the skin but that disappears fast. Once dry it doesn&#x27;t leave big white marks on my clothes when I dress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not convinced of the clinical anti-perspirants that you apply at night.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands and nothing has wowed me.  This one was the worst of the 3 I&#x27;ve tried.  It has a nice scent at first, but I found that I always had to apply normal anti-perspirant during the day because the clinical one wasn&#x27;t doing the job.</li>
            <li> Just perfect!!! I recommend this to everybody. It works 100%!! No complains after 4 months using it. Just love it!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews here, I decided to try this deoderant.  Since using it, I realize I now need to purchase new shirts that don&#x27;t have sweat stains.  This stuff is amazing and works as advertised.  I have been using it for over 6 months and it is still works like a charm.  If you have issues with excessive sweating, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Regular deodorant doesn&#x27;t quite do the job for me, so I was hoping that this clinical strength one would. It is only a little more effective than the regular kinds, but not quite effective enough sometimes (even though I do follow the directions and apply only at night before bed). It definitely doesn&#x27;t last ALL day, especially not those warmer days when I&#x27;m walking at least 40 minutes to and from class/work, and sometimes by evening my pits are left unguarded if you know what I mean... It also stains my clothes if I accidentally get some on, and it leaves residue. The smell isn&#x27;t the most pleasant or feminine, though it&#x27;s not disgusting; it has a more \\&quot;athletic\\&quot; smell to it. I would recommend the Secret Clinical Strength original scent over this one, as it is much more effective in keeping away the sweat and has a more floral scent to it. Unfortunately, I ordered the 2-pack and I can&#x27;t wait until I use it all up so that I can move on to something better.</li>
            <li> Hi.  I&#x27;ve had Degree Clinical Protection Women&#x27;s Anti-Perspirant and Deodorant, Shower Clean for a month now.  It smells great, lasts for 24 hours, and works reasonably well if you apply it before you go to sleep, and don&#x27;t apply it the next day.    In the 90+ degree heat, I do sweat, with this product, but I am not sure I&#x27;d be able to find a product that would prevent that.  As far as I know, it does not stain the underarms of garments, but I will be watching closely to make sure that it does not.  In general, I sweat much less than my previous deodorant, so I do not go through tops as quickly, which was what I was looking for.  Less laundry &#x3D; clothes last longer.      After I run in the 85+ degree heat, I do not need to immediately launder my tee, it will last for at least two runs, maybe three before it starts to have too much scent in the underarms.  With my old deodorant, I had to wash my tees after every run.    So, I think this deodorant is fair, and I will use it unless it makes the underarms of garments discolored.</li>
            <li> Use as directed (at night) and it will work perfectly. I don&#x27;t sweat at all, even in the Georgia heat. I bought the two pack on Amazon last summer (June 2011), and just finished my first stick this month (February 2012). Great value, great scent, great product!</li>
            <li> $1 lady speed stick deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave stain on black clothes works way better....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Sucks I bought 2, but my hubby uses it (sometimes). Smells better on him, but I still don&#x27;t like it and I regret purchasing it, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few over the counter but prescription strength anti-perspirants but this one by far seems to work the best. It seems to prevent the extra sweating that I experience.</li>
            <li> When it was first introduced, I thought the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; moniker was just another marketing gimmick so I ignored these products, assuming wet, sweaty pits were a fact of life during the hot summer months. But after I started practicing Bikram (Hot) Yoga, a friend of mine suggested I try this stuff and wow now I&#x27;m never looking back!  I use it as directed applying only before bed 90% of the time, however I sometimes like to apply it after a shower anyway--just one click instead of two just to feel safe--even though it&#x27;s not supposed to wash off in the shower, and  I&#x27;ve never had a problem it staining my clothes.  This product definitely works to stop underarm wetness for 24 hours plus! Unsightly wet spots on your clothes are now a thing of the past! Yay!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months.  I use after my shower in the morning instead of at night and it still works.  It leaves me and my clothing dry and smelling fresh.  It&#x27;s worth paying more for those results.  I am normally a heavy perspire-er and have to wear long sleeve shirts most of the time to work and this product sure works for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been picky about deodorant, but I&#x27;ve never been someone with an underarm problem that needed anything described as \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; or prescription worthy. With that said I&#x27;ve never gotten the greatest results with Dove, or Spirit, or Lady Speed Stick, or even regular old Degree for women. Every time I tried one, it would work for a while...then stop. So for years I&#x27;ve been buying different product after different product, until now though. For over a year now I&#x27;ve been using Degree Clinical Active Clean, I&#x27;ve remained dry and carefree and never had any moment when I&#x27;ve had to consider to switch to something else. I&#x27;ve been incredibly pleased with this. So if you&#x27;re like me, one of those in-between having and issue and not people, this is the perfect product for you. If I had to say a negative, it would be that it does lean some white marks, but let&#x27;s face it, that&#x27;s probably going to happen with 95% of deodorants right? Just grab a damp washcloth and wipe it off.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I started using it six months ago and this is the only anti-perspirant/deodorant I will ever use. After a few weeks of initial use, I find I don&#x27;t need to apply it every day or night. I would apply it about once/twice a week or when I go dancing.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product a couple weeks. I was leary of the price, and 1.7 oz sounded really small. But, it has a unique delivery system, so you only use a tiny bit, so I imagine this is going to last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shower Clean scent is very nice. It doesn&#x27;t have that overpowering \\&quot;I AM WEARING SCENTED DEODERANT\\&quot; smell that so many have. It&#x27;s a light, clean, slightly sweet/floral scent that blends into my natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works fabulously. Because of medication I take, I tend to get \\&quot;hot flashes\\&quot;, and normally my shirt would get wet. But not with this product. It feels completely clean. After I put it on, it instantly absorbs, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I even have deoderant on, but, seriously, from a person who has been using Mitchum and other stong anti-persperants, this product works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s almost the end of March, and I just recently used up the first \\&quot;stick.\\&quot; This stuff works! It absorbs into the skin -- no marks on clothes. I&#x27;m totally hooked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and maybe I grew out of my ultra-sweaty stage but since I&#x27;ve been using this my sweat has been under control. I don&#x27;t even use it as directed (I think it&#x27;s supposed to be applied at night). I use it in the morning. If I forget I realize later because I&#x27;m sweaty. Buy the bigger size (the 1.7oz is smaller) for extra value.</li>
            <li> My Monday morning started with enough deodorant for one arm. As I ran through the house grabbing my coffee and looking for my keys, I hastily placed an order for more deodorant (with next day shipping). When it arrived, I realized that I had ordered Degree Clinical Protection instead of Secret Clinical Strength. Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assumed that they are both made by people in white lab coats and work basically the same for people who need a little extra help in the scent control department. But, I found that the Degree deodorant lasted much longer than the Secret I had been using. Not only did I still feel fresh at the end of the day (after spending two hours commuting in August), I felt reasonably dry and smell free after walking several miles at the gym that evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very clean but not overpowering. It simply smells fresh. Also, I was able to wear it with a black shirt and not find any stains or smudges (this has to be attributed to the product and not user skill).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I noticed is that the product that I received is slightly different than the one pictured. This might be a simple change in packaging. The one I received also says \\&quot;24H MotionSense Motion Activated Freshness\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t see that in the product that is pictured.</li>
            <li> This is now my daily use deoderant. Seems to cut down on the stress sweat. My only gripe is that white chalky formulas always have the potential to leave residue on your shirts.</li>
            <li> Ordered twin pack -- one of the products did not &amp;#34;turn&amp;#34; aka release the deodorant.  Thankfully, Amazon refunded me without question.  I really would have rather had the product though, but they do not replace this item.  Hopefully, it was a one time defect.  otherwise, love this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly and lasts more than 24 hours.  In the off chance you don&#x27;t get to shower and re-apply -- never fear...you won&#x27;t smell.  also helps control sweating.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great if you use it like the directions say and put it on the night before and sleep with it on. even after a shower in the morning it still works! the scent is kind of strong when you first put it on, but it wears off. :)</li>
            <li> Best Ever I&#x27;ve Ever Ever Tried!! PLEASE consider a fragrance free version. I&#x27;m not accustomed to smelling like a soapy loofah.</li>
            <li> I work outside all day, and have been trying all kinds of antiperspirants to prevent me from being gross and sweaty.  This one ACTUALLY WORKS.  My underarms hardly sweat at all now, and when I get home I still smell pretty fresh, unlike other deodorants which seem to mix with my body scent and create some kind of vile funk fusion.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a deodorant that kept me dry and did not make me itch or break out in a rash. Degree Clinical Protection has been great for me. I feel fresh all day wearing it and no discomfort!</li>
            <li> The Degree Clinical Protection Antiperspirant doesn&#x27;t seem to be as \\&quot;Clinical\\&quot; as is described  the name. After about half a day it seemed to be wearing a little thin and offered less protection. While it lasts it does have a nice fragrance that I didn&#x27;t find to be too overpowering. The Degree Clinical Protection goes on wet but dries very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Protection was not as strong as expected - there were days where it struggled to get me (actually my wife) through her day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Nice Fragrance - not too strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Did not cause any type of rash or irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Have not noticed it staining any of my (wife&#x27;s) clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict -A product with a nice fragrance, but ultimately is not worth the additonal cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 1/2 Stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Degree for many, many years. It seems to be the best protection for me. This version was no exception and kept me dry and clean smelling all day on hot, humid and active days. This is what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Degree so I was happy that this version held up as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Active Clean scent is noticeable and I get whiffs of it all day. It smells pretty &#x27;fresh&#x27; and clean like some soaps and not too sweet or powdery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, although I know that this is how many deodorant/antiperspirants are dispensing their product, I don&#x27;t really like the top with the holes. You have to turn the bottom over and over to get enough product to use on each arm. My old Degree was a stick version so you only had to turn the bottom when it got too low on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does go on white and disappears very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, it offers great protection and has a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> This clinical protection deodorant works pretty well...I like the fact that it has a very light clean scent. It kept me fresh and dry all day and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about sweating or reapplying it. It also absorbs into the skin very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting any on your clothes. Just like the Degree Clinical Motion Sense antiperspirant, this also dispenses through the tiny holes which I am still not a fan of..... but slowly getting use to.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in the beginning of the summer because I wanted to have something stronger in my arsenal of deodorants.  Summer in Washington DC is *never* a dry affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked.  Holds all day (I put it on after my morning shower - recommendation is to use it at night) and well into the evening without any problem.  I don&#x27;t have any problem with residue on my clothes. Every once and a while I&#x27;ll touch it up a bit if I have a chance before going out for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s targeted toward people who \\&quot;need\\&quot; the stronger protection - but I think it is well worth the extra money for those who just want a bit more assurance that things are under control.</li>
            <li> The best for me. Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I learned of Degree&#x27;s clinical protection products by mistake. I was travelling by air and stayed overnight in a hotel and didn&#x27;t have any deodorant. I was given the Men&#x27;s clinical protection. At first I was skeptical being a Men&#x27;s product and all but I was blown away by the way this product worked. I live in a Tropical island where it&#x27;s always hot and warm so sweaty arm pits is basically a norm. For the first time in my life my armpits were not sweaty and therefore no embarrassing sweat marks in my clothes (that forces me to keep my hands glued to my sides) and one morning I forgot to apply the deodorant and had to walk down town and my arms stayed dry with no odor. All that I got from the Men&#x27;s Clinical Protection.  I was so intrigued and excited I went to research this product. Naturally I&#x27;d be looking for the female products so I decided to try this one. The Active clean Motion sense, I have to admit that it smells great but it didn&#x27;t give me the protection that I needed. My armpits were still mildly sweaty and by the end of my working day some mild odor was present too. I was really disappointed. I guess this product works in cooler climates but in my hot and warm one it doesn&#x27;t. I am now afraid to even order another Women&#x27;s Degree clinical protection.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been testing three different anti-antiperspirants:  Dove Clinical Protection Clear Tone, Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder with Motion Sense and this  [[ASIN:B001ECQ516 Degree Clinical Protection, Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Active  Clean]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite often people are confused by  the difference in an \\&quot;antiperspirant\\&quot; and a \\&quot;deodorant.\\&quot;  Whether you glow or sweat like a race horse, an antiperspirant reduces the amount that you sweat.  It does nothing to cover up the way that you smell.  Odor is caused by bacterial breakdown of some of the products released when you sweat.  Deodorant changes or attempts to cover up that odor, with varying degrees of success. Any given underarm product may be an antiperspirant or a deodorant or both.  All three of the products that I have been testing are both antiperspirants and deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most formulations of antiperspirants rely on some form of aluminum as the active ingredient.  Older formulas used aluminum chloride or aluminum chlorhydrate, products that many found irritating to the skin, sometimes leading to acne or causing razor burn.  Newer formulations rely on aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY (for glycine), which seems to be less problematic and better tolerated by those with sensitive skin.  All three of the products I&#x27;ve been examining contain aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY as their active ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three products arrived in different boxes, but once removed from the box the product containers are virtually identical in size and shape.  They are all made by Unilever.  While there are some very minor differences in the Inactive Ingredients between the products (most markedly between the Dove &amp; either Degree) and the specific fragrance differs (only slightly - I found the Dove and the Degree Sheer Powder to have very similar fragrances) the significant factors really are the amount of aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY present in the product, information that is required to be listed on the Material Safety Data Sheet for each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I readily found MSDS for both the Dove and  the Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder with Motion Sense, but have not been able to locate a MSDS for [[ASIN:B001ECQ516 Degree Clinical Protection, Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Active  Clean]] in either a government database or on either the Unilever or Degree websites, so I can provide no further information as to the concentration of aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY in this product.  (That can be a significant point as some of the stronger \\&quot;regular\\&quot; antiperspirants have almost as much aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY as the lower concentration \\&quot;clinical strenght\\&quot; antiperspirants at a much lower price.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three products suggest that you apply the product before going to bed at night, assuring the user that it will remain effective even through  your morning shower.  I found putting on antiperspirant before going to bed just strange and found no obvious difference between applying at night and applying after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - The lack of readily available information about the chemical components and risks associated with the use of this product make this something that I will neither use nor recommend.rmation that is required to be listed on the Material Safety Data Sheet for each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I readily found MSDS for both the Dove and  the Degree Clinical Protection Sheer Powder with Motion Sense, but have not been able to locate a MSDS for [[ASIN:B001ECQ516 Degree Clinical Protection, Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Active  Clean]] in either a government database or on either the Unilever or Degree websites, so I can provide no further information as to the concentration of aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY in this product.

            <li> Years ago, I never really was a big Degree deodorant fan.  I never thought the fragrances were that great, I always thought it felt a bit on the powdery side, and they just didn&#x27;t jive with me as much as other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, not anymore!  This deodorant is great.  It has a wonderful, fresh and clean scent, it&#x27;s not overly fragrant or too potent, and it excels at odor and wetness protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never really have an issue with deodorant irritating my skin, so I can&#x27;t really speak to it decreasing irritation more than any other brand, but it certainly didn&#x27;t cause any issues for me.  It didn&#x27;t feel too drying or powdery, either.  Sometimes I have a problem with deodorants that do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent deodorant, especially for the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; ones.  I always use those, because I seem to perspire quite a bit.  This is a great one!  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!  Degree has really come around to making quality deodorants for women.</li>
            <li> Man do I love the protection I&#x27;ve had from this product. I&#x27;ve tried Dove, Suave, and Secret&#x27;s clinical strength antiperspirants before and have had varying results but Degree&#x27;s really has done an exceptional job blocking wetness. I&#x27;ve literally had no moisture or odor at all in the week I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s making this product lose a couple of stars and be one I can&#x27;t use long term is that it&#x27;s actually painful to wear. Just 4 days in and my underarms were so dry and sore I decided I&#x27;d only give it a full week before I made up my mind. That said, my skin runs on the sensitive side and I generally prefer an unscented/hypoallergenic product for this reason. I haven&#x27;t found this particular formula available without a scent yet though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like powdery florals the Active Clean scent is a little sporty and yet powdery sweet and flowery at the same time. I didn&#x27;t care for it and it is very strong. If you&#x27;re in need of superior dryness I would definitely recommend this one but only if you&#x27;ve never had trouble with skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this deodorant for about a week now and really like it. The scent is a &#x27;clean&#x27; sort of scent and nothing extravagant. It does a good job of keeping you protected for the majority of the day; though the scent is long gone by then. Still this deodorant does its job great and i can easily recommend it.</li>
            <li> I work at home at a fairly stressful job.  I&#x27;m generally happy, sitting on my [[ASIN:B006JBWYDA Gaiam Balance Ball Chair]] bouncing around to the sound of the [[ASIN:B007MS6D1I Big Bach Set]] in the background and sipping my beautiful lattes.  Then I remember what I&#x27;m doing and the repercussions of every decision and I get stressed out.  By the end of the day, I am stressed sweaty and stinky, and just in need of a long hot shower.  It&#x27;s one of those Go directly to the shower, do not stop at the dinner table, and do not stop to watch the news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried[[ASIN:B003EMJHG4 Secret Clinical Strength Waterproof Advanced Solid Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant All-Day Fresh Scent 2.6 Oz]] but it&#x27;s just so darned expensive, that it&#x27;s not very practical. I have always preferred Secret because it is both a deodorant and an antiperspirant.  I usually use Secret Powder Fresh, an innocuous scent that I can&#x27;t usually find in Secret Clinical Strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Degree Clinical Protection works as well as the Secret Clinical and it is both a deodorant and an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scents to these Degree Clinical Protections are non-offensive to me.  The Sheer Powder smells like baby powder and the Active Clean scent smells clean.  I can&#x27;t put my finger on that one.  It&#x27;s kind of like a clean kitchen without all the strong scents that mean someone just cleaned it using every chemical known to man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that you put these on at night.  That means less damage to clothing. I&#x27;m a nighttime shower taker so it works for me.</li>
            <li> Everything was good except I went off the picture. The picture shows \\&quot;shower clean\\&quot; and the description is for \\&quot;Active Clean\\&quot; But all in all it was a good experience.</li>
            <li> My wife loves Degree Clinical Protection. She said Degree Clinical Protection works best if you shower at night and then use the Degree Clinical Protection. She said the shape of the Degree Clinical Protection is a very nice size and shape. She said Degree Clinical Protection works great and she would buy again.</li>
            <li> Degree has 20% aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex compared with Secret&#x27;s 19%. I could not tell a difference and I still had a little wetness. I would rate the 2 a draw except for the much higher cost of Degree. That is why I lower it to 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this deodorant. It&#x27;s a good one, although I&#x27;m not clear how \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried putting the deo on at night, as is recommended, and that didn&#x27;t work for me. For one thing, I&#x27;m not good with changing a lifelong morning habit. I would feel all day that I missed something. And then at night I would forget to put it on. The few times I did put it on at night, I felt nervous the next morning about getting stinky. Turns out I didn&#x27;t get stinky...but I did get a little damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I apply it in the morning, there are no subsequent problems with stink or dampness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Active Clean smells like the typical Shower Fresh scent a lot of deos come with. I prefer this vastly over the Powder scent, which to me is a little cloying and more distinctly feminine than I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: This is a cream, and not a solid stick. The cream pushes up through middlin-size holes on top of the dispenser. It goes on clean, not tacky, chalky, or wet. I prefer this texture to the normal stick. It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on me or my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it takes a longer time than expected to push the cream up from the tube on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION: I use it in the morning to keep things dryer and make my life less confusing. I don&#x27;t think I will pay more for this than a regular deodorant, but it feels luxurious to use this, and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably worth trying a &#x27;clinical&#x27; deodorant once, to see if there is a big improvement for you.</li>
            <li> Sweating is not something a woman wants to talk about, but it&#x27;s a part of life. Unfortunately for some of us, it&#x27;s a bigger part than we would like it to be. I&#x27;ve been using several brands of \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; anti-perspirant deodorants for the last 3-4 years and all of them protect me better than the average solid. This is the first time I have tried out Degree Clinical Protection and it seems to works as well as the other brands I normally use. I do like the scent of this one as it&#x27;s subtle and not overpowering. One thing I don&#x27;t follow are the instructions. All of them recommend applying before bed time, but I have never been able to accept that. For me I apply right after I shower in the morning and get great results. Originally when I started using this type of anti-perspirant deodorant I was almost turned off from continuing to buy it because of the price, but it won me over by the way it works. Now I can&#x27;t imagine not using it, so the price is no longer a factor.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of clinical strength deodorant and antiperspirant and I feel that Degree Clinical Protection is one of the better ones. It goes on clear and does not leave white stains on clothes. I do prefer the Sheer Powder scent a little more but the Active Clean scent is pleasant and not too strong. I have not had any problems with odor or wetness all day while using this product. I really like this product and would not hesitate to purchase and use it again.</li>
            <li> I liked this antiperspirant/deodorant. It is neutral smelling, glides on easily, and works.  We have been experiencing  a lot of humidity recently due to some strange weather and this has left my underarms dry as well as my clothing. I smell fresh and this product has the added benefit of being non-irritating. I was able to use it immediately after I shaved my armpits. Overall, this is a nice and inexpensive product that offers good protection.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it in store so I turned to the online world. The scent is very nice and it protects very well from sweat and odor. I am very happy with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with sweating a lot and getting pit stains. I&#x27;ve tried the clinical protection deodorants from Degree, Dove, and Secret. Degree is by far my favorite and I&#x27;ve used this product for over 7 years! Dove was to moisturizing for me and Secret was okay but I didn&#x27;t like the scents as much. This deodorant doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell so even when I&#x27;m working out and sweating extra, I don&#x27;t smell myself.</li>
            <li> I started using this product because of my panic attacks and the wetness that would appear under my arms.  It seems to&lt;br /&gt;be working.  I would recommend this to everyone who experiences such attacks.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Degree  Clinical Protection Antiperspirant and Deodorant is the very light and clean scent. As the day goes on the scent fades away and the product keeps you dry. It goes on smoothly and dries fast. Also no stains to my clothes. I am very pleased and will continue to buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I always hope that innovation happens in things like deodorant.  Heaven knows vinegar is still one of the most powerful cleaning tools in my kitchen, despite the fact that there is an entire row of cleaning solutions available in the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We just had three days of muggy 90 degree weather.  What I noticed was that I had to keep daubing my forehead and face because I was perspiring, and of course I was surrounded by shiny faces everywhere we went.  But somewhere on day 3 (I know, I&#x27;m not terribly observant) I realized that I was NOT having problems with armpit perspiration or \\&quot;out in the sun\\&quot; body odor.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been out in that kind of weather when I didn&#x27;t have issues, and it certainly amazes me that I was in the minority of those walking around the Farmer&#x27;s Market because I didn&#x27;t have wet armpit syndrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each day I twist it just enough - 2 twists - to get a little bit to the surface and that is more than enough to spread fully and have coverage all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other clinical strength antiperspirants that I liked a lot better than this one.  This one does work ok for about a day.  It comes out basically the same way as the others in this class - it has a little dial at the bottom that you click click til it squirts out the white goo at the top.  You have to turn it a lot the first time to get it started.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell that great.  It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s rather sharp and not very feminine, but it&#x27;s not really a smell I&#x27;ve enjoyed on my husband either when he&#x27;s used it.  It might as well be be a fragrance for a dishwash, not a person.  It&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not that great on people, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t like what happens when I get really wet, like if you are out in the rain, or swimming.  I don&#x27;t mean under my arms, but I mean, all over.  If I get sweaty and my underarms get wet, they feel slimy to me.  This has happened 2-3 times so it wasn&#x27;t just some freak thing.&lt;br /&gt;It would be fine if you were just going to work or out walking or something, but I don&#x27;t like it out in the garden when I&#x27;m using a hose or getting in the pool.</li>
            <li> Degree Clinical Protection works well with no big complaints. It seems like it would last a full 24 hours if you need it to, it&#x27;s got a nice pleasant scent and it goes on easy. No issues here, and I would recommend it.</li>
