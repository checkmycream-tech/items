            <li>I love this paired with the matching shampoo.</li>
            <li>Still experimenting, however!! :)</li>
            <li>just try it your self you will love it.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I bought all the tubes they had in the store.</li>
            <li>It makes her hair get matted very quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent either.</li>
            <li>this conditioner works so fine for my hair</li>
            <li>Did I mention it&#x27;s sulphate and paraben free?</li>
            <li>Great for daily use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Giovanni products but this one really takes the cake.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I am natural and it leaves my hair soft and it smells amazing!!</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair (3C)</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it there was a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>So i bought my own conditioner and it has my hair feeling a lot stronger and moisturized;promoting new hair growth with all natural chemical free product.</li>
            <li>I only have to leave this conditioner in for a couple minutes and my hair feels amazing: sleek, shiny, soft, and light!</li>
            <li>As with most products I tried (without the harmful chemicals), I still had tangles in my naturally wispy hair that is damaged from coloring.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and light, the way hair is supposed to feel.  </li>
            <li>Great for my parched, thick colored hair.</li>
            <li>Thought this would be great watered down as a leave in for my curly girl 2 year old</li>
            <li>I can comb out the tangles in the shower with the conditioner on, and the comb slips right through, making rinsing so much easier.</li>
            <li>There is so much slip to this conditioner that it makes detangling a breeze.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair about 3C</li>
            <li>I do section by section and put a little pure shea butter on top and a little of camille rose gel.</li>
            <li>you have dry, damaged, or easily tangled hair</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it leaves my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UNTIL NOW....This line, the 2chic Ultra Moist shampoo, conditioner, and my new favorite, their little pump of leave-in conditioner/styling elixer that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy but gets tangles out with the smallest amount, are all so awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my hair extremely well and leaves is so soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say too much about it because I have only used it once since I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li>After dying my hair for the first time, my hair was feeling pretty dry but using this product makes it silky soft.</li>
            <li>Has helped my super dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so very soft after applying.</li>
            <li>They have restored my dry grey hair to a better state than when I used chemical hair products.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, WOW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Caucasian with long naturally curly hair that is kind of dry and brittle from straightening it several times a week.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s too heavy for her fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It also rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down.</li>
            <li>I have finally found my main conditioner!</li>
            <li>I have natural African-American hair</li>
            <li>My hair is always soft after using.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I wouldn&#x27;t give it a five because my Herbal Essence conditioner leaves my hair much softer and its cheaper than this product.</li>
            <li>I had always thought that my hair should feel soft after using conditioner.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s only at whole foods.</li>
            <li>My detangling time was cut down tremendously.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and the fragrance wasn&#x27;t over-powering or off-putting.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I recommend the 2chic Ultra Moist Deep Deep Moisture Mask for very dry and summer damage.</li>
            <li> Made my hair extremely dry and brittle, bought mine from a different store.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry like African hair and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long been on a mission to find a NATURAL conditioner that will deeply moisturizer my dry damaged hair without making it sticky, greasy, heavy, etc.</li>
            <li> Down side is that it&#x27;s only big size is 24oz</li>
            <li> Then I let it air dry</li>
            <li> My thick coarse african american hair has a penchant for tangling, this product was a miracle.</li>
            <li> It took my daughters hair which is naturally silky and shiny to dry, and dull.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t moisturize or soften like I expected.  </li>
            <li> and then when its almost dry I blow dry a little.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, coarse, dry and color treated hair and this conditioner is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> but I am very careful about what ingredients I put on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have hard water, dry over-processed hair, and no hope-until I tried this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I am not fond of the smell, it smells chemically to me and it stays with me all day unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> Terrible, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My mom has always had this HORRIBLE habit of buying the &amp;#34; bottom of the barrel&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not like the texture. It didn&#x27;t moisturize or soften like I expected.  Kind of sticky as well.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. I am natural and it leaves my hair soft and it smells amazing!! I can&#x27;t really say too much about it because I have only used it once since I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> Thought this would be great watered down as a leave in for my curly girl 2 year old but it&#x27;s not. It makes her hair get matted very quickly and easily. Maybe it&#x27;s too heavy for her fine hair.  Smells great. Just didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> This is one of Giovanni&#x27;s best products. It moisturizes my hair extremely well and leaves is so soft and easy to comb. The price is an added bonus. Don&#x27;t sleep on this product line!</li>
            <li> Since I am using this Conditioner, my hair is not longer falling. I just recommend you to use it! Do it!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product, and as I am already of fan of Giovanni products, I gave it a go. My thick coarse african american hair has a penchant for tangling, this product was a miracle. My detangling time was cut down tremendously. It left my hair soft and the fragrance wasn&#x27;t over-powering or off-putting.  This is now one of my go to products.</li>
            <li> THIS MAKE MY HAIR TANGLE DO NOT BUY IT</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells AMAZING and has great slip and moisturizing properties. I have natural African-American hair and I use this product once a week as part of my deep conditioning treatment. It leaves my hair shiny and tangle-free. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a Wal*Mart...I was traveling and forgot to pack my regular Organix shampoo/conditioner and the Wal*Mart location I was shopping at was sold out!!!  So I decided to give this stuff a try on a whim.  This has got to be the BEST conditioner ever!  I have really thick, coarse, dry and color treated hair and this conditioner is a miracle.  It makes my hair feel soft and light, the way hair is supposed to feel.  I&#x27;m getting Giovanni from now on.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this conditioner since I&#x27;m always looking for the best non chemical products.  I am not fond of the smell, it smells chemically to me and it stays with me all day unfortunately.  It feels sleek through my hair when I apply it and does a good job moisturizing my wavy/curly hair.  It works for now, but hope to find something better that smells better.</li>
            <li> I had been using Giovanni products for a while when they came out with this 2chic line. As with most products I tried (without the harmful chemicals), I still had tangles in my naturally wispy hair that is damaged from coloring. Nothing could beat Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Detangler but I am very careful about what ingredients I put on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL NOW....This line, the 2chic Ultra Moist shampoo, conditioner, and my new favorite, their little pump of leave-in conditioner/styling elixer that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy but gets tangles out with the smallest amount, are all so awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry, damaged, or easily tangled hair this could be your answer. Try it. I have the tangliest hair on the planet and this stuff- even the shampoo- feels so moisturizing and silky, it reduces tangles and breakage to a point a thought was not possible. I can comb out the tangles in the shower with the conditioner on, and the comb slips right through, making rinsing so much easier. It&#x27;s making it possible to grow my hair long. It also rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent either. Did I mention it&#x27;s sulphate and paraben free?</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner! I have super curly hair (3C) and I have found that this is one of the few conditioners that really works in my hair. My hair is always soft after using.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it leaves my hair so soft and manageable. The only reason why I wouldn&#x27;t give it a five because my Herbal Essence conditioner leaves my hair much softer and its cheaper than this product. I would definitely repurchase if the day comes and I cant find any herbal essence products.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Giovanni&#x27;s 2chic Ultra Moist line of hair products is the best I have ever used. Great for daily use and I recommend the 2chic Ultra Moist Deep Deep Moisture Mask for very dry and summer damage. Great products!</li>
            <li> My mom has always had this HORRIBLE habit of buying the &amp;#34; bottom of the barrel&amp;#34; shampoo/conditioner. when I was younger my hair resisted all the chemicals, but now im a little older and it doesnt like that $#!t... and my hairs integrity suffered. So i bought my own conditioner and it has my hair feeling a lot stronger and moisturized;promoting new hair growth with all natural chemical free product.</li>
            <li> Seriously, WOW! I cannot stop touching my hair! I&#x27;ve always liked Giovanni products but this one really takes the cake. I&#x27;ve long been on a mission to find a NATURAL conditioner that will deeply moisturizer my dry damaged hair without making it sticky, greasy, heavy, etc. I&#x27;m Caucasian with long naturally curly hair that is kind of dry and brittle from straightening it several times a week. I only have to leave this conditioner in for a couple minutes and my hair feels amazing: sleek, shiny, soft, and light! PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Made my hair extremely dry and brittle, bought mine from a different store. So I figured maybe its just not for my coarse hair, so I tried it on my daughters hair. It took my daughters hair which is naturally silky and shiny to dry, and dull.</li>
            <li> Terrible, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have hard water, dry over-processed hair, and no hope-until I tried this stuff.  From the first time I used it there was a huge difference.  I love it</li>
            <li> i have course hair,and curly hair.beautiful results.</li>
            <li> I love it the scent and the job it does</li>
            <li> I have finally found my main conditioner! I love this conditioner. I am so glad that I decided to try it. It makes my hair feel so very soft after applying. I had always thought that my hair should feel soft after using conditioner. I had just resigned myself to believe that my hair would never feel the way that I thought it should after using conditioner. That is until I used this 2Chic Ultra Moisturizing conditioner. After applying, my hair immediately feels like butter and what can I say about the slip. There is so much slip to this conditioner that it makes detangling a breeze. I have many uses for this conditioner. I use it as my rinse out, I add it to my deep conditioner for extra moisture and I also use it as my leave in conditioner. I loved it so much, I bought all the tubes they had in the store. I am done product searching for a conditioner, because there is no need for me to look any further, as this is THE ONE!</li>
            <li> MOST AMAZING EVER!!! Some have even thought thatI got a treatment.  Including my own sister lol. It smells fantastic! !!!!! I have very curly hair about 3C it gets very big. I put a lot in as a leave in and so not rinse. I do section by section and put a little pure shea butter on top and a little of camille rose gel. Then I let it air dry and then when its almost dry I blow dry a little. I WILL USE Forever.  Down side is that it&#x27;s only big size is 24oz and it&#x27;s only at whole foods.</li>
            <li> Great for my parched, thick colored hair. After dying my hair for the first time, my hair was feeling pretty dry but using this product makes it silky soft. The nice scent is an added bonus. Paraben, sulfate free!</li>
