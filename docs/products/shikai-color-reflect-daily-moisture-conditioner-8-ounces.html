            <li>This is one of the best conditioners I have found.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally I went to work with my hair looking like Thandie Newton in Beloved.  </li>
            <li>The product is good for all colored treated hair types</li>
            <li>I must say I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I just love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>This conditioner combined with Head and Shoulder shampoo makes a fabulous combination for my hair and head!     </li>

            <li>Pay the price and get something better.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and I use it every day.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo, but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t soften and condition as well as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft, has a nice pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>but it also doesn&#x27;t make it super nice.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for several years because it&#x27;s a good product from a good company.</li>
            <li>I have tried literally every natural conditioner at whole foods and this is the best.</li>
            <li>This conditioner seems OK  but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky and smooth and light.</li>
            <li>long time user still great, conditions without flatening</li>
            <li>I love trying new things, so I keep trying others just to experiment.</li>
            <li>Very light but makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is worth trying</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair soft and doesnt require much, it is very rich.</li>
            <li>Originally found this at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>I always come back to this product because it does the best job of detangling without weighing my hair down too much.</li>
            <li>When I first used it I sat under the showerhead to rinse it out for what seemed like a week.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it as a subscribe and save subscription, but canceled my subscription after the first batch.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but not strong.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product after browsing the whole foods isle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this at whole foods but it is cheaper to get a 3 pack thru amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>Love this, but it&#x27;s becoming difficult to find, and the price has gone up tremendously.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I use this and it completely changes the texture of my hair!!  </li>
            <li>My hair is really shiny, soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I usually like to give products one more try for money&#x27;s sake, but I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
            <li>It feels soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>but wow this is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The day could NOT end fast enough.  </li>
            <li>but I decided to switch to natural products.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals, no animal products/testing.</li>
            <li>but I live in very humid climate, with a dry oily scalp.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of thin hair, so it tangles easily and gets weighed down easily.</li>
            <li>This is the first conditioner I have ever found that calms it down and makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner flattened and dulled my very thick, curly, healthy hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have to be uber picky when it comes to what I wash my hair with because I have very very long hair of medium thickness</li>

            <li> but in the end dried my hair out in the long term causing me to keep using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> A MESS.</li>
            <li> If you decide to try it but have frizzy or very thick curly hair use a little less than necessary, then try Oscar Blandi&#x27;s Jasmine Hair oil to get your hair to lay a little smoother.</li>
            <li> I also use a little of it as leave in conditioner too for the ends.</li>
            <li> Just not worth it--for me at least.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive product than my usual Redken and it turned out to be a big, fat mistake.  </li>
            <li> I usually can tolerate a bit of weigh or product buildup</li>
            <li> This was not good for me whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy really expensive salon/designer conditioner</li>
            <li> but this was the worst.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair terrible</li>

            <li> This was not good for me whatsoever.  I usually can tolerate a bit of weigh or product buildup but this was the worst.  I have 3b/c hair curly hair.  When I first used it I sat under the showerhead to rinse it out for what seemed like a week.  At the point that I&#x27;d given up seeing that my hair was not going to lose it&#x27;s heaviness unless I rewashed my hair and I had no time, I tried to get out of the shower at that point and almost slipped and bust my *ss as my tub felt like I poured Crisco in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what ingredient or combination of ingredients caused the disaster but wow this is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally I went to work with my hair looking like Thandie Newton in Beloved.  The day could NOT end fast enough.  I usually like to give products one more try for money&#x27;s sake, but I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
            <li> long time user still great, conditions without flatening</li>

            <li> I have thick, coarse hair. This is the first conditioner I have ever found that calms it down and makes it feel soft. I just love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I used to buy really expensive salon/designer conditioner but I decided to switch to natural products. I found that reg products, such as Redken, seemed to work well but in the end dried my hair out in the long term causing me to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this at whole foods but it is cheaper to get a 3 pack thru amazon. This keeps my hair soft and doesnt require much, it is very rich. I also use a little of it as leave in conditioner too for the ends. Smells good but not strong. I have tried literally every natural conditioner at whole foods and this is the best.</li>

            <li> I was looking for a less expensive product than my usual Redken and it turned out to be a big, fat mistake.  This conditioner flattened and dulled my very thick, curly, healthy hair.  Never again. Pay the price and get something better.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I use it every day.  My hair is really shiny, soft and manageable.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Been using this for several years because it&#x27;s a good product from a good company. No harsh chemicals, no animal products/testing. It leaves hair soft, has a nice pleasant scent. As we age the texture of our hair changes. The product is good for all colored treated hair types but I guess the results depends on individual&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other kinds, but I come back to this one time and time again. It makes my hair silky and smooth and light. I love it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner seems OK  but nothing special.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair terrible but it also doesn&#x27;t make it super nice.  When using after the shampoo it did seem to make my hair somewhat smoother and softer...but perhaps the shampoo was just drying.    For the price, it is worth trying I guess.  I ordered it as a subscribe and save subscription, but canceled my subscription after the first batch.  Just not worth it--for me at least.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioners I have found. Very light but makes my hair soft and shiny. Combined with the shampoo- a winner!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS, THINKING THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT, SINCE I HAD USED THE OTHER CONDITIONER, AND THIS WAS HORRIBLE. IT DID NOT DETANGLE MY HAIR OR ANYTHING. MADE MY HAIR A MESS.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo, but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t soften and condition as well as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> if you color your hair this brand is a must!</li>
            <li> After I shampoo, my hair always seems to feel dry and coarse.  I use this and it completely changes the texture of my hair!!  It feels soft and shiny!  I like it!</li>
            <li> Love this, but it&#x27;s becoming difficult to find, and the price has gone up tremendously.</li>
            <li> Originally found this at Whole Foods.  Love it.  Makes my hair shiny and silky.  Very hydrating.  Highly recommend.  Shampoo too.</li>
