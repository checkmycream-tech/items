            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>So, this product MAY be safer to use health wise but stink-wise</li>
            <li>Good deodorant does not cause rashes&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>its not as good as the stick deodorant</li>
            <li>I am delighted to find it on Az.</li>
            <li>Needs to cover every spot of the armpit in order to work effectively.  </li>
            <li>While it worked at keeping me smelling nice, something within it caused me to break out.</li>
            <li>This product,however, keeps me smelling nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a really nice product.</li>
            <li>It effectively stops odor.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant on the market.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a bit more synthetic, but it&#x27;s just as effective.</li>
            <li>smells very fresh and clean perfect for sensitives skin and for hot days</li>
            <li>He feels more confident now.</li>
            <li>Smells too fruity for a man to use confidently.  </li>
            <li>Is better at covering odor than at preventing it.  </li>
            <li>Advisable to re-apply more often during the summer months.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants (Tom&#x27;s,</li>
            <li>He came upon Nature&#x27;s Gate and was so happy that he found an aluminum free deoderant since he is very health concious.</li>
            <li>Not as nice as the spring fresh stick deodorant, which natures gate doesnt seem to make anymore.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>It smells really, really good (light, sweet, fresh) and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it at Wegman&#x27;s but they stopped carrying it</li>
            <li>so I was excited to find it here.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat a ton, but I can&#x27;t make it through a day now without smelling my own B.O. (To be completely forthright).</li>
            <li>Keeps me smelling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t super noticeable anyway.</li>
            <li>Just the right scent and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Being an avid Howard Stern fan, I tend to listen to him when it comes to products that he likes.</li>
            <li>The first one I tried was Tom&#x27;s, the woodspice scent.</li>
            <li>I like the scent because its pretty neutral, to me</li>
            <li>It is gentle to the skin, even healing right after shaving.</li>
            <li>He was searching for a deoderant that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum because there are studies that link aluminum to certain cancers.</li>
            <li>I really think it has to do with the parabens or glycol.</li>
            <li>back to nature&#x27;s Gate, even if I have to purchase it online for a bit more total.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes as I had used the product once.</li>
            <li>I think for everyday use this more than suffices.</li>
            <li>Due to the fruity/flowery smell and its coverage issues, seems better suited for women, especially with their shaven armpits.</li>
            <li>bought this product after trying another natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a relief for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Sometimes after a particularly long or hot shift there is odor, but usually at that point I&#x27;m ready for a shower anyway.</li>
            <li>It does go on rather wet as most roll-on&#x27;s do and takes a few minutes to dry</li>
            <li>It does get a little frothy when you apply it, especially if you have underarm hair, but it goes away quickly and actually dries unlike some natural deodorants which just seem to never dry and stay gross and wet in your pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Bought this for my husband.  He was always pitting out in his shirts.  This product has basically stopped that unsightly ring in the armpit look.  He feels more confident now.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant without aluminum that actually works for me.</li>
            <li> Being an avid Howard Stern fan, I tend to listen to him when it comes to products that he likes. He was searching for a deoderant that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum because there are studies that link aluminum to certain cancers. He came upon Nature&#x27;s Gate and was so happy that he found an aluminum free deoderant since he is very health concious. I decided to also try this product. Shortly after purchasing and using it I realized that it had no staying power for body odor. My job doesn&#x27;t entail any physical labor but by the time I would get home from work I noticed that unwanted aroma wafting from my arm pits. I immediately stopped using it because I want to smell like a female, not a physical laborer. Shortly after I stopped using it, Howard starting mentioning on air that he was smelling &#x27;a whiff&#x27; with this product and he has since stopped using it. So, this product MAY be safer to use health wise but stink-wise it doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard.</li>
            <li> Smells too fruity for a man to use confidently.  Needs to cover every spot of the armpit in order to work effectively.  Is better at covering odor than at preventing it.  Due to the fruity/flowery smell and its coverage issues, seems better suited for women, especially with their shaven armpits.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant product I&#x27;ve found that has no harsh irritating chemicals.  It&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> Good deodorant does not cause rashes&lt;br /&gt;Also smells very fresh and clean perfect for sensitives skin and for hot days</li>
            <li> Just the right scent and long-lasting. Advisable to re-apply more often during the summer months. This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant.  It smells really, really good (light, sweet, fresh) and works very well.  I do not like to use a lot of  chemicals, especially under my arms and I have tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants (Tom&#x27;s, Kiss My Face, Desert something or other) that did not do the job half as well as this one.  It does go on rather wet as most roll-on&#x27;s do and takes a few minutes to dry but this is not an issue for me. No residue on clothes or staining or anything.  I originally bought it at Wegman&#x27;s but they stopped carrying it so I was excited to find it here.</li>
            <li> bought this product after trying another natural deodorant. This is a great product.  The last brand I tried would leave me with a terrible odor later in the day. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have, over the past few months, been trying to transition into using only natural deodorant instead of ones containing aluminum. The first one I tried was Tom&#x27;s, the woodspice scent. While it worked at keeping me smelling nice, something within it caused me to break out. My armpits turned dark and the skin was scaly looking. Gross. So I tried another, Jason&#x27;s Aloe Vera. It burned every time I used it and exacerbated the irritation I was experiencing. Also, at the end of the day, my armpits smelled like skunky weed. How attractive! I really think it has to do with the parabens or glycol. This product,however, keeps me smelling nice (I use the summer spice scent) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms. It&#x27;s a relief for people with sensitive skin. I&#x27;m a chef, and even though I&#x27;m a girl, I still sweat a lot in the heat of work. Sometimes after a particularly long or hot shift there is odor, but usually at that point I&#x27;m ready for a shower anyway. I think for everyday use this more than suffices. Even during a workout, it isn&#x27;t smelly. It does get a little frothy when you apply it, especially if you have underarm hair, but it goes away quickly and actually dries unlike some natural deodorants which just seem to never dry and stay gross and wet in your pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a really nice product. I like the scent because its pretty neutral, to me it smells like incense or something along those lines. The scent isn&#x27;t super noticeable anyway.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant on the market.  Keeps me smelling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Wish this was not discontinued. It was the best deodorant I ever used!</li>
            <li> Not as nice as the spring fresh stick deodorant, which natures gate doesnt seem to make anymore. The smell is a bit more synthetic, but it&#x27;s just as effective. Takes a while to dry though. I wish they&#x27;d start making the stick version again!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> its not as good as the stick deodorant</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes as I had used the product once. As a result, I ordered two bottles. I don&#x27;t sweat a ton, but I can&#x27;t make it through a day now without smelling my own B.O. (To be completely forthright). I would suggest ordering one and trying it out, it could work, just was a big fail for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for years, but my retailer stopped selling it a few years ago. The only options were to drive to another store 30 minutes away or order it online and pay shipping. I am delighted to find it on Az. It is gentle to the skin, even healing right after shaving. It effectively stops odor. But note, it is not an antiperspirant: it won&#x27;t stop you from sweating!</li>
            <li> for some reason, my local stores have not been stocking this, so i am buying online. just wanted to add to other comment about Tom&#x27;s of Maine - since the local stores didn&#x27;t have Nature&#x27;s Gate, i tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine. after a few days, the skin started to peel under my arms. It looked like a sunburn. Very scary!  back to nature&#x27;s Gate, even if I have to purchase it online for a bit more total.</li>
